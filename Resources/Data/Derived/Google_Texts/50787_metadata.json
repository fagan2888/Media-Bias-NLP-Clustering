It seems gym-goers are always drinking nutrient shakes.\n\nThere are health claims all over these products -- including enhanced recovery, increased muscle mass, fat burning, better muscle definition and improved \"well-being.\" As a sports scientist, I am often asked which ones are best for training.\n\nMy general opinion is that supplements are unnecessary. You should be able to satisfy all your nutritional requirements with an appropriate diet.\n\nBut since this answer never seems to satisfy, here is a look at some of the most common supplements and the data on their importance to exercise. It is aimed at people who work out a few times a week.\n\nProtein: The main reason for consuming protein is to increase muscle mass; it stimulates the body to produce muscle protein. This is well established, but what is often debated is how much protein is sufficient, what type to ingest and the best time to do so.\n\nThe best type appears to be whey protein. It is absorbed into the gut more than 70 percent faster than other options, such as casein and soy protein supplements. This increases the rate at which the body builds muscle protein by more than 20 percent compared to the other options.\n\nMany gym-goers swear by something called the \"anabolic window,\" a claim that the protein needs to be consumed within minutes of stopping exercise. This is pretty much hype. The window is likely 24 to 48 hours, rather than a few minutes.\n\nAs for how much protein to consume, a recent study found that in young men between 176 and 187 pounds who weight-train regularly, it took 20 grams of whey protein to achieve the best possible result -- what we call \"maximal stimulation.\" Any more than 20 grams appears unnecessary. It just leads to a lot of extra protein in the urine.\n\nCreatine: Creatine occurs naturally in red meat, eggs and fish. Quite a large body of evidence supports its use to gain muscle mass and enhance recovery.\n\nWhen creatine is taken up into the muscle, it helps to generate energy. This can help enhance gains in muscle mass and strength from weight training.\n\nBut creatine's effects on sport performance are less convincing. It increases body water storage, which increases body mass. This counteracts the muscle benefits and means there are unlikely to be benefits overall.\n\nVitamins: Vitamins are good for health, but when taken in excess the opposite can be true for both health and exercise.\n\nIn particular vitamin C and E, which act as antioxidants, have actually been shown to hamper the body's adaptation to exercise training. This suggests that these supplements may do more harm than good.\n\nCaffeine: People don't consume caffeine to help adapt their bodies to training but rather for improved performance during a single bout of exercise, such as a competition.\n\nCaffeine supplements will indeed prolong your endurance during exercise. You can get the same benefits from drinking coffee.\n\nEnergy drinks: Carbohydrate-based drinks have long been seen as worthwhile because they increase the delivery of energy to the body and provide hydration. But the evidence supporting their ability to improve performance has been called into question.\n\nThere has also been concern about children consuming these drinks without exercising much and unwittingly increasing their sugar and calorie consumption. These drinks also often contain caffeine, not recommended for children.\n\nOthers: Several other supplements claim to benefit exercisers: beta-alanine, fish oil, conjugated linoleic acid, L-carnitine, L-arginine, nitrate and vitamin D. Current evidence suggests no apparent benefit.\n\nIn short, nutrition products can benefit people who work out, but there's so much misinformation that you may well be wasting money or undermining your body's performance.\n\nExercise, have a balanced diet and enjoy it!\n\nStuart Gray is a senior lecturer at the Institute of Medical Sciences at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.
