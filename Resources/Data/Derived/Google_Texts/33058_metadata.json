The brief includes numerous descriptions from women about how access to contraception has enabled them to prevent unintended pregnancies, focus on their educational and professional goals, and treat serious medical conditions.\n\n\u201cIn the future, I would like to have a family,\u201d explains one of the amici in the brief. \u201cBut right now, I am working towards a degree and I am not in a financial position to raise a child. I owe money for my undergraduate, graduate, and law-school degrees. Every cent I save counts. Contraception enables me to focus on my degree and puts me in control of my own reproductive health.\"\n\nThese and many other stories highlight the serious harms that women would suffer if religious objectors were permitted to block their access to contraceptive coverage.\n\n\u201cReligious colleges, nursing homes and other entities have been given a generous accommodation,\u201d said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to pay for birth control. All they have to do is tolerate the fact that some of their students and staff might want to use it.\u201d\n\nThe federal government announced in February 2012 that religious institutions would be able to opt out of paying directly for contraceptive coverage as part of an accommodation to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage regulations. Under the compromise, these groups are not required to pay for the birth control or coverage for birth control; they must simply inform the government of their objection so that the government can arrange for a third-party insurer to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\nBut dozens of religiously affiliated institutions are not satisfied with that exemption, claiming that RFRA, a 1993 federal law intended to protect religious minorities from government overreach, gives them the right to stop their students, staff and employees from accessing contraceptives even though the religious organizations do not have to pay for or provide coverage for those products.\n\nIn its brief for Zubik v. Burwell, which is one of seven consolidated cases before the high court, Americans United says religiously affiliated institutions do not have the right to stop anyone from accessing medical care regardless of how a group feels morally about specific types of medicine.\n\nAmericans United is the only national group representing a directly affected woman in this dispute, having successfully intervened on behalf of a University of Notre Dame student in January 2014. These actions are part of Americans United\u2019s Protect Thy Neighbor project, which seeks to stop religion-based discrimination against LGBT persons and others.\n\n\u201cThe voices of affected women have been conspicuously absent from most of the lawsuits seeking to block contraceptive coverage,\u201d said Americans United Senior Litigation Counsel Gregory M. Lipper. \u201cAs our brief makes clear, women will suffer concrete and profound harms if religious objectors succeed in blocking their access to vital healthcare.\u201d\n\nThe brief was written by Lipper, Americans United Legal Director Richard B. Katskee, and Madison Fellow Natacha Y. Lam on behalf of students and staff at institutions including University of Notre Dame, Georgetown University, Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Fordham University, DePaul University and Loyola Marymount University.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"admins": "756885656, 10150361922348092"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe voices of affected women have been conspicuously absent from most of the lawsuits seeking to block contraceptive coverage,\u201d said Americans United Senior Litigation Counsel Gregory M.
