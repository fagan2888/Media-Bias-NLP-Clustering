CLEVELAND, Ohio -- With the start of the federal income tax filing season Friday, taxpayers had better hope they don't need to call the IRS for help.

The Internal Revenue Service has endured $600 million in budget cuts, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in a news conference Thursday. That means a smaller workforce that isn't allowed to work as much overtime during the January to April busy season, Koskinen said.

Tax filers who call the IRS's toll-free number should expect "extensive waits" of a half-hour or more, he said. Filers should try, as much as possible, to get their basic questions answered from the IRS' website, irs.gov. This includes filers who want to check on the status of their refund.

People who file paper returns can expect the IRS to take at least one extra week to process their refund.

"We clearly are resource-strained," Koskinen said.

The filing season kicks off Friday when the IRS' Free File program will open for the year. Anyone who earns $60,000 or less can file online at no cost. Although 70 percent of all taxpayers qualify for Free File, only 3.2 million returns -- roughly 2 percent -- were filed through Free File last year.

Free File is an agreement between the IRS and a group of major tax software companies. In exchange for the IRS agreeing not to put out its own software, the companies agree to provide their product at no charge for low- and middle-income tax filers.

Taxpayers can begin filing their returns by mail or electronically through any program beginning Tuesday, Jan. 20.
