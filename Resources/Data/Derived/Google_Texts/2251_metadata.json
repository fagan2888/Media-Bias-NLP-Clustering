Harry Reid\u2019s staff and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe background\n\nA CNN story this month said, \u201cDemocratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, one of Obamacare\u2019s architects and staunchest supporters, is also the only top congressional leader to exempt some of his staff from having to buy insurance through the law\u2019s new exchanges.\n\n\u201cReid is the exception among the other top congressional leaders. GOP House Speaker John Boehner, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell have all directed their staffs to join the exchange, their aides said.\u201d\n\nThe CNN story quoted Reid saying in September, \u201cLet\u2019s stop these really juvenile political games \u2014 the one dealing with health care for senators and House members and our staff. We are going to be part of exchanges, that\u2019s what the law says and we\u2019ll be part of that.\u201d\n\nCNN added, \u201cThat\u2019s true. Reid and his personal staff will buy insurance through the exchange. But it\u2019s also true that the law lets lawmakers decide if their committee and leadership staffers hold on to their federal employee insurance plans, an option Reid has exercised.\u201d\n\nReid responded to a question about the story during an interview with the RGJ\u2019s Ray Hagar: \u201cWhat does top congressional leaders mean? Like me and McConnell? No, that is simply not true. Some of the people on my leadership team have done the same thing, following my lead. CNN is wrong.\u201d\n\nReid also told Hagar, \u201cAll I did was follow the law. The law says that if you have committee staff, leadership staff, they stay where they are. If you have other staff, which is most everyone, they go to the exchanges.\u201d\n\nInterpretation of the law isn\u2019t as definitive as Reid claims.\n\nHere\u2019s what the ACA says: \u201c(T)he only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act).\u201d\n\nThe law further defines congressional staff as \u201call full-time and part-time employees employed by the official office of a Member of Congress, whether in Washington, DC or outside of Washington, DC.\u201d\n\nIt seems simple: the only health plans for congressional staff shall be ACA plans.\n\nBut this is Washington, where simple is elusive.\n\nNow we\u2019ve got to define what \u201cofficial office\u201d means in order to understand who counts as an employee of it.\n\nIn April 2010, the independent Congressional Research Service issued a memorandum that found \u201cit appears possible to argue that the definition of \u2018congressional staff\u2019 used by (the law) excludes any staff not directly affiliated with a Member\u2019s personal office.\u201d\n\nIt goes on to say that this means committee staff and leadership staff can keep their federal health insurance plans.\n\nThis is what Reid is referring to when he says he\u2019s following the law. However, he could\u2019ve done the opposite, too.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service memo adds: \u201cAlternatively, it may be argued that (the law) can be interpreted as encompassing more than a Member\u2019s personal staff.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where a short trip into the weeds is necessary.\n\nThe memo says there are two ways you can look at who is in charge of staff. If you consider who pays the staff to be their authority, then committee and leadership staff are not paid for by the members\u2019 offices so they can be excluded from the exchanges.\n\nBut if you consider who hires and fires the staff to be their authority, then committee and leadership staff are indeed under the control of the individual member. With this interpretation, the memo says, \u201cit appears possible that committee staff and leadership staff could be included among the staff covered by the provision.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the memo says the law can be interpreted either way: some staffers can stick with their old plan, or they should use the ACA exchanges.\n\nIn August, the Office of Personnel Management \u2014 the federal government\u2019s human resources department \u2014 clarified the matter by saying it was up to members of Congress to decide which way their offices would interpret the requirement.\n\nThey were given a tight window near the end of October to decide.\n\nBoehner and the top four Republican leaders in the Senate put their entire staffs into the ACA exchanges.\n\nMany Democrats also put all of their staffs into the exchanges, including Pelosi and Washington Sen. Patty Murray.\n\nSome members of Congress went the opposite way and exempted some \u2014 or even all \u2014 of their staff, including Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Sen. Tim Johnson, D.-S.D.\n\nOf the six congressional members from Nevada, all required their entire staffs to participate in the ACA exchanges, except Reid, who exempted part of his staff, and Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who allowed his entire staff to stay with their old plan and who signed up for a private plan outside the exchanges for himself.\n\nSo what does Reid say now? His spokeswoman, Kristen Orthman told Fact Checker that Reid\u2019s definition of \u201ccongressional leader(s)\u201d is more expansive than CNN\u2019s.\n\nCNN\u2019s story considered the top four congressional leaders to be \u201ctop\u201d whereas Orthman said Reid would go deeper. Among prominent senators who exempted some staff as Reid did are Republicans Charles Grassley of Iowa and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, as well as Democrats Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\nThe verdict\n\nTo be clear, Reid followed the law, a number of Republicans did the same thing Reid did and Reid did not exempt his entire staff, as some commenters have claimed.\n\nFact Checker is harder on prepared statements or repeated claims than on impromptu comments in a live setting. Reid said CNN was wrong in response to the first question out of the gate in his RGJ interview, which challenged him on a highly charged topic.\n\nSuch defensiveness is an understandable reaction so some slack should be cut. That said, Reid was wrong.\n\nThere is not a statement in CNN\u2019s story that was incorrect, and it was a worthy news angle to look at how the top leader of each party in the House and Senate treated their staffs in relation to health care coverage \u2014 and to call out Reid as the exception.\n\nTruth Meter: 3 (out of 10)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reno Nevada News - rgj.com is the home page of Reno Nevada with in depth and updated Reno local news.
