He says just under $40 billion, about a third of the General Fund budget, will go to programs that support low income Californians.\n\nBrown\u2019s budget proposal also includes additional spending for K-12 students. USC Public Policy Professor Gary Painter says that kind of spending is key if the state really wants to reduce its poverty rate.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been of greatest concern here in California in recent years is that we\u2019ve taken our investments out of things like education, which have been proven to enhance the life chances of people and allow people who start off poor to move up the ladder.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins welcomes the increased social services spending, which had been devastated in recent years by budget cuts. Atkins often says the economic recovery has not reached all Californians. But while she appreciates Brown\u2019s proposed spending, she\u2019s not satisfied.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot for poverty in California and it\u2019s not enough. It is not enough. There is where we might differ in terms of I get to have the luxury as a legislator to push to get more of those programs done,\" says Atkins.\n\nMike Herald, with the Western Center on Law and Poverty is not so diplomatic. He says the governor is not proposing anything that would actually lower the poverty rate. Herald says CalWorks, the state\u2019s welfare program, must be updated and grants to the blind, aged and disabled should be increased.\n\n\u201cAll of these kinds of proposal were completely ignored and not one penny of the billions in new revenue that we\u2019re getting in the current budget, in the proposed budget are going to alleviate those concerns.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are taking a cautious approach to Brown\u2019s proposed spending increases. Assembly member Melissa Melendez says she agrees the state should help people in need, but...\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of needs in California. And everybody has their hand out saying we need this much money for this program, for this activity,\" says Melendez. \"We have to balance it all. We can\u2019t just give it all away to one group. So it is a careful balance and it has to be a thoughtful balance.\u201d\n\nBrown argues California has done more than many states to address poverty. USC\u2019s Painter says other states have solid track records of helping low income families. But he says Brown\u2019s claim may be true if the only consideration is the amount of money spent. And, like Brown, Painter says California can\u2019t solve the problem alone.\n\n\u201cIt has to be a partnership with the federal government, it has to be a partnership with the philanthropists in the state. I don\u2019t think that any state government, any local government can be expected to successfully address some of the challenges that surround long-term poverty.\u201d\n\nPainter says California is a largely immigrant state and many people arrive here without resources to survive. But he says if the state spends wisely it can help those people advance and improve the economy while lowering the poverty rate.", "article_metadata": {"category": "State Government", "description": "Governor Jerry Brown says a large portion of his annual budget proposal will go toward reducing the poverty rate - and he's getting push back from all sides.", "author": "Katie Orr", "og": {"url": "http://www.capradio.org/40028", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.capradio.org/media/3127304/JB%20poverty%20011215%20KO%20P.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "Governor Jerry Brown says a large portion of his annual budget proposal will go toward reducing the poverty rate - and he's getting push back from all sides.", "title": "Governor Brown Gets Push Back On Poverty"}, "has_audio": 1, "robots": "index, follow", "nid": 40028, "keywords": "Capital Public Radio, CPR, Governor Brown Gets Push Back On Poverty", "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad5c\"", "article_summary": "In releasing his annual budget proposal, California Governor Jerry Brown defended his administration\u2019s efforts to address California\u2019s high poverty rate.\nHe says the governor is not proposing anything that would actually lower the poverty rate.\n\"That\u2019s why we expanded the affordable care act, that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing money in the workforce investment act,\" Governor Jerry Brown said during his budget proposal on Friday morning.\nBut he says if the state spends wisely it can help those people advance and improve the economy while lowering the poverty rate.\nUSC Public Policy Professor Gary Painter says that kind of spending is key if the state really wants to reduce its poverty rate."}
