The Campbell Soup Co. has apologized for a tweet by its SpaghettiOs account that marked the 72nd anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor with a picture of a smiling noodle holding an American flag.

“Take a moment to remember #PearlHarbor with us,” SpaghettiOs tweeted Friday night. A picture attached shows its cartoon mascot licking his lips and holding the flag, The Associated Press reported.

Many Twitter users blasted the lighthearted photo as disrespectful to the 2,402 Americans who lost their lives on December 7, 1941, when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

A representative for Campbell’s said Saturday that the message had been deleted, AP reported.

“We apologize for our recent tweet in remembrance of Pearl Harbor Day. We meant to pay respect, not to offend,” SpaghettiOs tweeted to its 12,000 followers.
