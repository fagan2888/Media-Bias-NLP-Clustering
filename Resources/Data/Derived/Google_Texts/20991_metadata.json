San Francisco Supervisor Scott Wiener, one of the authors of the measure, pointed to a major analysis from the Institute of Medicine last year that showed people who start smoking as teens are more likely to become hooked.\n\n\u201cBy increasing the legal age to buy tobacco products from the age of 18 to the age of 21, we will save lives,\u201d he said just before the vote. The measure applies to many tobacco products, including smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes.\n\nBut there\u2019s a potential glitch. Tom Briant, executive director of the National Association of Tobacco Outlets says California law pre-empts cities from raising the age.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be some resolution on these questions, and the best person to do that is the California attorney general,\u201d Briant said in an interview.\n\nBriant stopped short of saying his organization would challenge San Francisco in court, but did say the board of his organization would meet in April and discuss both Santa Clara County and San Francisco\u2019s moves.\n\nCalifornia law states that 18 is the legal age to buy or possess tobacco products. In this passage, the Legislature seems to claim for itself the right to regulate tobacco:\n\nIt is the Legislature\u2019s intent to regulate the subject matter of this section. As a result, no city, county, or city and county shall adopt any ordinance or regulation inconsistent with this section.\n\nSupervisor Wiener was unfazed. He said the San Francisco law did not interfere with state law and was unconcerned about challenges from the tobacco industry.\n\n\u201cOur city has a history of taking on major industries in the name of public health, in the name of consumers, and winning. And we will do so here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe wine country city of Healdsburg was first in California to raise the tobacco age last fall, but declined to implement the higher age, apparently under pressure from the tobacco industry. Wiener said that with San Francisco\u2019s greater resources, the city would prevail in any court case.\n\nLarry Cohen, executive director of the Oakland-based advocacy group Prevention Institute, said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more pleased\u201d with the supervisors\u2019 vote. The move to raise the tobacco age to 21 is \u201cgathering momentum nationally,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNinety-five percent of daily smokers pick up the habit before age 21,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the 21 age is really a critical number\u201d to reduce the numbers of smokers.\n\nCertainly San Franciscans who are 18, 19 and 20 would be able to travel to a nearby city to legally purchase tobacco, but the higher age \u201cwould still have its impact,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nMost would not be thinking, \u201cCan I get on a BART train and go to South San Francisco\u201d to buy cigarettes, he said.\n\nThe measure goes to the mayor later this month. A spokeswoman said he supports the move and will sign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "But the tobacco industry says the move is pre-empted by state law.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"San Francisco Supervisors Raise Tobacco Age to 21\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/03\\/01\\/san-francisco-supervisors-raise-tobacco-age-to-21\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-01 20:31:30\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-03-03 14:23:34\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":155517,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"News\",\"Tobacco\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/03\\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-02-at-9.51.45-AM.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "But the tobacco industry says the move is pre-empted by state law.", "title": "San Francisco Supervisors Raise Tobacco Age to 21", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/03/01/san-francisco-supervisors-raise-tobacco-age-to-21/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-02-at-9.51.45-AM.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "news,tobacco", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBy increasing the legal age to buy tobacco products from the age of 18 to the age of 21, we will save lives,\u201d he said just before the vote.\nHe said the San Francisco law did not interfere with state law and was unconcerned about challenges from the tobacco industry.\nAs a result, no city, county, or city and county shall adopt any ordinance or regulation inconsistent with this section.\nThe move to raise the tobacco age to 21 is \u201cgathering momentum nationally,\u201d he said.\nThe measure applies to many tobacco products, including smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes."}
