He says a man with a gun threatened him over his decorations and because it's not the first time, the incident was caught on camera.\n\nBecause of all the lights and inflatable decorations, Michael Green's house is hard to ignore during the holidays but not all of the attention is welcome.\n\n\"Almost every year for 13 years there's been some kind of vandalism done to my Christmas decorations,\u201d Michael Green said.\n\nThat's why about 10 years ago, he installed security cameras. Sure enough this week, they caught a vandal on camera but green says it's what happened after next that still has him spooked.\n\n\"This year was totally different. This year blew my mind,\u201d Green said.\n\nIn the security video, you see an older man walking down the sidewalk suddenly start ripping down garland from Green's fence.\n\n\"I heard the pulling of staples breaking of wires, breaking of glass just on the other side of the fence,\u201d Green said.\n\nGreen runs out his yard and follows the man across the street.\n\n\"I thought I was going to yell at the guy and maybe catch him and make him pay for some lights or something,\u201d Green said.\n\nInstead, he says the man turned around and threatened to kill him.\n\n\"'Don't follow me, I'll shoot you. I'll shoot you right now,' and that's when he pulled out the gun,\u201d Green said.\n\nIn the future, Green says some things will be different. He'll call police first instead of confronting vandals but he says one thing won't ever change. His display of Christmas cheer is here to stay.\n\n\"This is for the community, it's for more than just me and yeah, the lights are up to stay,\u201d Green said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A Wichita man says a man with a gun threatened him over his decorations and because it's not the first time, the incident was caught on camera.", "language": "english", "author": "Parrish Alleman", "og": {"description": "A Wichita man says a man with a gun threatened him over his decorations and because it's not the first time, the incident was caught on camera.", "title": "Christmas vandal threatens homeowner with gun", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Christmas-vandal-threatens-homeowner-with-gun-235899871.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/B83/235/B832357E3B56406DABEAAE80BC1C284B", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/E59/F61/E59F61C719AF4D89BC14F0E606971E66.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A Wichita man says a man with a gun threatened him over his decorations and because it's not the first time, the incident was caught on camera.", "title": "Christmas vandal threatens homeowner with gun", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Christmas-vandal-threatens-homeowner-with-gun-235899871.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Christmas_vandals.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Christmas vandal threatens homeowner with gun", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Christmas vandal threatens homeowner with"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4777\"", "article_summary": "\"Almost every year for 13 years there's been some kind of vandalism done to my Christmas decorations,\u201d Michael Green said.\nBecause of all the lights and inflatable decorations, Michael Green's house is hard to ignore during the holidays but not all of the attention is welcome.\nHe says a man with a gun threatened him over his decorations and because it's not the first time, the incident was caught on camera.\nSure enough this week, they caught a vandal on camera but green says it's what happened after next that still has him spooked.\n\"This is for the community, it's for more than just me and yeah, the lights are up to stay,\u201d Green said."}
