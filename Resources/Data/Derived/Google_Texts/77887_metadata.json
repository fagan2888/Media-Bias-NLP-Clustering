However, that legislation didn\u2019t pool the risk of the approximately 10 municipalities that joined with the state plan or each other.\n\n\u201cThe partnership system rates towns individually based upon claims and experience,\u201d Sal Luciano, executive director of AFSCME Council 4, said Thursday. \u201cWhile it provides the communities that have joined it with greater price stability, it unnecessarily inflates costs by keeping these groups in separate pools.\u201d\n\nLuciano said allowing for true pooling of risk would save local taxpayers money.\n\nNew London Mayor Daryl Finizio, whose city participates in the plan, said the larger the risk pool \u201cthe lower it will drive costs for all of us.\u201d\n\nMark Waxenberg, executive director of the Connecticut Education Association, said if the CEA were allowed to pool its members in various towns it could save $4,000 per policy when some of those policies cost as much as $35,000 a year for a family.\n\nLori Pelletier, executive secretary treasurer of the AFL-CIO, said the group hears all the time about state mandates, but this proposal is the \u201cunmandate\u201d because it allows municipalities buy into a bigger pool and save local taxpayers money.\n\nShe said it\u2019s similar to the Costco model, in which people belong to Costco because they can buy 500 rolls of toilet paper cheaper there than they can buy one roll of toilet paper elsewhere.\n\nKeith Stover, a lobbyist for the Connecticut Association of Health Plans, said he feels like he\u2019s \u201chaving an acid flashback.\u201d\n\nHe said it was a \u201cbad idea then and it\u2019s a bad idea now.\u201d\n\nStover believes there are enough group options in the marketplace for groups and the bill is \u201ca solution in search of a problem.\u201d\n\nBut Rep. Peter Tercyak, co-chairman of the Labor and Public Employees Committee, said information about this bill needs to get out because municipalities aren\u2019t even asking about it.\n\nTercyak said municipalities should at least be looking at the plan as an option and asking their brokers if they can beat it. He said that\u2019s how the \u201cmetropolis of Sprague\u201d was able to save money on that small town\u2019s health insurance plan.\n\n\u201cThe idea that somebody would stay with the same broker and vendor forever, because we have a relationship and pay millions and millions more for their city, strikes few taxpayers as a good idea,\u201d Tercyak said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop that.\u201d\n\nThe bill at the moment doesn\u2019t include language regarding healthcare pooling, but they plan to use it as the vehicle for such in the future.", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "CT News Junkie", "og": {"url": "http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/unions_pitch_healthcare_pooling/", "type": "article", "site_name": "CT News Junkie", "description": "Union officials and municipal leaders asked state lawmakers again Thursday for the ability to pool their health insurance risk with other municipalities and the state employees\u2019 plan.", "title": "Unions Pitch Healthcare Pooling | CT News Junkie"}, "robots": "index,follow,archive", "fb": {"admins": 100000516708778, "app_id": 625264840857145}, "google-site-verification": "xSWCEDPXS2srINlbzkJoWA5QowbCkai3awnZqgts9xc", "viewport": "width=1474"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf957\"", "article_summary": "He said that\u2019s how the \u201cmetropolis of Sprague\u201d was able to save money on that small town\u2019s health insurance plan.\nHowever, that legislation didn\u2019t pool the risk of the approximately 10 municipalities that joined with the state plan or each other.\nIn 2011, legislation established a Connecticut Partnership Plan, which allowed municipalities to take advantage of the state\u2019s health benefits plan.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop that.\u201dThe bill at the moment doesn\u2019t include language regarding healthcare pooling, but they plan to use it as the vehicle for such in the future.\n\u201cThe partnership system rates towns individually based upon claims and experience,\u201d Sal Luciano, executive director of AFSCME Council 4, said Thursday."}
