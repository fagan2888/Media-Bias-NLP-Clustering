He just wasn\u2019t the Washington outsider Republicans wanted.\n\nFrom the outset, Cruz staked his claim as the \u201ctrue conservative\u201d in the race, a brand built on standing up to the corruption of the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nHe talked about building a coalition of young people, evangelicals, libertarians, minorities and Reagan Democrats.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are uniting and coming together behind our campaign,\u201d he said as part of his regular stump speech, at press conferences, at quick stops in small towns across the country.\n\nThe plan was simple: do well in Iowa, build on that momentum in South Carolina, then go on to win the so-called \u201cSEC primary\u201d in the South, and build a dominant delegate lead.\n\nToo many things got in the way, but mostly it was Donald Trump. Cruz cozied up to Trump last year with an eye toward capturing the billionaire\u2019s supporters when he inevitably stumbled \u2014 and got burned when Trump started questioning his eligibility to be president and named him \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted.\u201d Cruz\u2019s outsider credentials \u2014 a tea party-aligned senator, leader of a government shutdown fight against President Barack Obama over Obamacare \u2014 suddenly weren\u2019t enough. And the evangelical candidate who first announced his campaign at Liberty University couldn\u2019t nail down the evangelical vote.\n\nI spent 2016 traveling the country with Sen. Cruz and his staff \u2014 30 states, from Maine to California. I chased him to diners and late-night shows and even a cheese palace. I heard his stump speech so often that I sometimes quote it in social situations.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went down:\n\nHustling on the ground in Iowa\n\nWithout question, the Cruz campaign was a professional crew built for the long-haul. It ran a meticulous data operation. The data drove the schedule \u2014 they didn\u2019t travel anywhere without up-to-the-minute polling to back it up. The campaign eschewed Secret Service for private security to maintain the flexibility to make last-minute decisions.\n\nHe built an Iowa organization slow and steady, and by December, he was beginning to surge in the polls.\n\nHe outworked each of his rivals, traveling to each of the Hawkeye State\u2019s 99 counties, known as the \u201cfull Grassley,\u201d on his campaign bus, and holding up to seven campaign events in a single day en route to his victory in the first-in-the-nation caucuses.\n\nCruz campaigned relentlessly. He didn\u2019t fill arenas like Trump, but he tirelessly stumped and shook hands and posed for pictures.\n\nAt the end of one particularly grueling day of his 28-stop Iowa bus tour, Cruz hopped behind the counter at Penny\u2019s Diner in rural Missouri Valley, pouring coffee for folks gathered.\n\n\u201cWhy am I so optimistic? Cause it\u2019s 10:30 at night in a diner and it\u2019s standing room only,\u201d Cruz told the crowd.\n\nHe courted and successfully nabbed key Iowa endorsements and engaged conservative activists and pastors.\n\nI pushed through the thickets of Akron, Iowa, as he joined Iowa Congressman Steve King\u2019s Iowa pheasant hunt, winning his formal approval two weeks later. Decked out in hunting gear and a fluorescent orange hat, Cruz took three shots and killed two birds.\n\n\u201cNo reporters were shot, so it was a good day,\u201d he joked.\n\nThe campaign housed hundreds of out-of-town volunteers in Des Moines dormitories dubbed \u201cCamp Cruz,\u201d building a veritable grassroots army of phone bankers and doorknockers, a tactic they would use again in South Carolina, Wisconsin, and Indiana.\n\nBut Iowa\u2019s win didn\u2019t come without cost. On caucus night, the Cruz campaign sent a message to supporters suggesting \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 Ben Carson was dropping out, and Trump doled out one of his legendary monikers to Cruz. \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d stuck, and would be with him until the final day.\n\nAnother round of bus tour barnstorming and Cruz exceeded expectations in New Hampshire, placing third behind Trump and John Kasich.\n\nBut then came South Carolina, where Trump pulled out a second win. In the weeks that followed, it became clear what Cruz referred to as his \u201cfirewall\u201d was no longer locked up. Cruz won Oklahoma, Alaska, and his home state of Texas, but Trump swept seven wins in states that on paper were Cruz Country.\n\nWisconsin was the campaign\u2019s last hurrah. Cruz resumed his bus tour and packed his schedule with rallies and retail stops.\n\nThe campaign was confident here, and we saw Cruz\u2019s sense of humor and quick wit on full display one afternoon following a trip to a \u201cCheese Castle.\u201d\n\nA reporter asked Cruz, whose favorite food is cheese, whether he would \u201carm the cheese curds.\u201d\n\nCruz turned around on the way to his bus and walked back toward the cameras.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s funny. Alright, you convinced me, yes, we need to arm the cheese curds. And you know, if we send the cheese curds into ISIS, it\u2019ll fatten \u2019em up and they\u2019ll go down immediately,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThey\u2019ll just decide, this whole jihad thing, they don\u2019t need it, and they should just happily eat cheese curds and live in peace with their fellow man.\u201d\n\nCruz always wove a few jokes into his stump speech, and distinguished himself from the field with his frequent pop culture references. He regaled a group of teenage girls in Indiana on Sunday with an extended impression of Billy Crystal in \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d\n\nHe spoke dotingly of his daughters, Caroline, 8, and Catherine, 5, who frequently joined him on the trail and stole the show in an April CNN town hall.\n\nTrump defines the narrative\n\nThe campaign tried to counter the marketing acumen of Donald Trump with a tightly-controlled, aggressive branding and marketing plan. The theme was \u201cTrusTed,\u201d and it was on signs, wrapped on the campaign bus, and behind Cruz for nearly every media availability and rally. Cruz\u2019s staffers wore blue vests emblazoned with the Cruz flame logo, \u201c#CruzCrew\u201d embroidered on the back.\n\nThe plan was to foster authenticity: Every time voters watched Cruz on television in front of a pop-up banner, they would be reminded of his trustworthiness. But the strict banner placement ahead of every media gaggle and rally undermined its intended goal. Instead of showing Cruz in real places, the diners, the factories, it appeared that Cruz could have been anywhere.\n\nAnd Trump didn\u2019t need signs or stickers or vests to create a branding phenomenon.\n\nHe questioned Cruz\u2019s eligibility to be president, calling him an \u201canchor baby,\u201d pointing to the fact Cruz was born in Alberta, Canada. He highlighted Cruz\u2019s Cuban roots, reminding supporters that his full name was Rafael. Trump raised questions about the TrusTed brand, and voters were reminded every time they saw Cruz in front of his banner.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d nickname started to wear on the campaign and was only amplified as Trump blamed Cruz for \u201crigging\u201d the system as his campaign worked activists to pick up delegates at conventions in Wyoming, Colorado, and North Dakota.\n\nIn the final week of Cruz\u2019s candidacy, his campaign made some big decisions. It announced an alliance of sorts with Kasich \u2014 Cruz would focus his resources on Indiana and pull out of New Mexico and Oregon, while Kasich would do the opposite. Cruz announced that Carly Fiorina would be his running mate, a move seen as desperate and for which he was also criticized locally for not sending her to places in Indiana where she could help.\n\nAt a time when the voters were blatantly rejecting Washington deal-making, these decisions only played into Trump\u2019s argument.\n\nAnd Trump never let up. Even when it was clear he would win, he began Indiana primary day quoting a National Enquirer story linking Cruz\u2019s father to Lee Harvey Oswald, a charge Cruz disputed as \u201cludicrous.\u201d\n\nEvolving relationship with Trump\n\nMuch was said of the \u201cbromance\u201d between Cruz and Donald Trump. In one of the more ironic moments of the race, the two appeared on stage together at a rally opposing the Iran deal in September on Capitol Hill.\n\nFor a long time, Cruz would not wade into the fight his fellow rivals were waging with Trump. He played the long game, watching Trump obliterate Rick Perry, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, and Marco Rubio, and reaping benefits as the crowded Republican field narrowed.\n\nIn a late November Iowa swing, a voter asked Cruz why he would not attack Trump. Cruz said he\u2019d rather \u201cheap praises\u201d on the businessman. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good advice for us to be in the business of blasting each other.\u201d\n\nIn January, Cruz said over and over again, \u201cI like Donald Trump. I respect Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThose quotes and others would only hurt Cruz as he worked to fight off the attacks from the billionaire.\n\nAfter a super PAC ran an ad with a photo of Trump\u2019s wife Melania from a G.Q. magazine spread, Trump tweeted, \u201cBe careful, Lyin\u2019 Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!\u201d\n\nIt takes a lot to tick Cruz off, he said at a press conference at Dane Manufacturing, but messing with his wife, \u201cThat\u2019ll do it every time.\u201d\n\nHe raised his voice and looked straight into our cameras: \u201cDonald, you\u2019re a sniveling coward, and leave Heidi the hell alone.\u201d\n\nThe next day, he held a press conference in a cone factory. In response to a report in the National Enquirer regarding infidelity, he accused Trump and his henchmen of constructing the \u201ctabloid smear.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not here in Wisconsin campaigning, so he sits in Trump Tower and sends tweets,\u201d he said amid the smell of plastic, his pop-up Cruz backdrop flanked by pallets of traffic cones.\n\nAt the end, Cruz, as he said, \u201cleft it all on the field.\u201d On Monday, I ran across the street with him as he sparred with a Trump supporter. And then on Tuesday, an emboldened Cruz left nothing unsaid, unloading on Trump in a last-ditch effort hours after voting had already begun in Indiana.\n\n\u201cFor those of y\u2019all who have traveled with me all across the country, I\u2019m going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump,\u201d he finally, finally said. \u201cThe man is a pathological liar.\u201dBy that point, it was too late. Cruz had already spent the night before discussing whether to move his campaign forward, talking with advisers well into the morning.\n\nThe 45 year-old\u2019s political career is far from over, and Cruz made that clear in his concession speech Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cWith a heavy heart, but with boundless enthusiasm for the future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign. But hear me now, I am not suspending our fight for liberty,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI will continue this fight with all of my strength and all of my ability.\u201d\n\nSee you in 2020, senator.", "article_metadata": {"framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "description": "Ted Cruz was always the Washington outsider.
