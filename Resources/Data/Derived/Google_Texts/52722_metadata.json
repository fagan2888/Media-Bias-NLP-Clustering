Most of their Senate wins were predicted by the electoral map. The victories of many Republican governors, however, were impressive for extending the map, holding hard-earned territory or crossing demographic barriers.\n\nThere were Republican wins in Massachusetts, Maryland and, in what amounted to dancing in President Obama\u2019s end zone, Illinois. Greg Abbott got back to George W. Bush levels of support with Hispanic voters in Texas. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker won his third election in four years.\n\nBut Ohio Gov. John Kasich deserves the award for best performance in a battleground state. It helps, of course, to have a flawed Democratic opponent. (How does one function in life for 10 years without a valid driver\u2019s license?) Yet Kasich won a majority of union voters, three-fifths of female voters, a majority of voters younger than 30, two-thirds of independents and a quarter of African American voters.\n\nPoliticians are supposed to pretend that a favorable verdict was perfectly natural and inevitable. When I raised the African American vote with Kasich, he responded, \u201cI\u2019m flabbergasted by it.\u201d Disarming candor is Kasich\u2019s stock in trade. And a decisive electoral victory has liberated someone who already had few inhibitions.\n\nDescribing his policy-oriented, aspirational campaign, Kasich told me, \u201cWhen I first started, my staff completely freaked out. \u2018How are you going to get any excitement without talking about Obama?\u2019 We are too caught up in ideology and partisanship in this country. When I said [during the campaign] that we need to respect the president of the United States, the reporter [for the Associated Press] nearly passed out.\n\n\u201cWe need to show more respect, not anger. This is not a wrestling match. There have been too many hardened hearts in this country: \u2018You are my enemy, just because you don\u2019t think the way I think.\u2019 I don\u2019t even know how we got here. At the end of the day, it means that my side is not always totally right and the other side totally wrong.\u201d\n\nIf Kasich mounts a run for president, the biggest challenge for reporters will be stenography. He speaks in a rush of fragments and detours. But it is possible to detect some themes in the fugue.\n\nKasich is an exuberantly orthodox free marketeer who has balanced budgets, reduced business regulations, privatized government services and placed a relentless emphasis on job creation. \u201cLet me be clear,\u201d he told me. \u201cUnless you build a strong economy, nothing else works.\u201d\n\nThis, however, is not a destination but a foundation. \u201cThen,\u201d he said, \u201cyou reach out to help people. On mental illness. On drug addiction. On autism. Now you are tapping into the real problems of real people, regardless of their philosophy. All are made in the image of God and deserve a chance to be what we are meant to be. Our purpose is not to dwell on infirmity but to recognize infirmity and address it as best we can.\u201d Kasich increased state spending on various social issues, as well as accepting the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Kasich is most interesting when he is attempting to reframe the values debate, by avoiding culture war controversies and emphasizing broadly shared moral commitments. \u201cI believe it all comes down to fundamental values: responsibility, resilience, caring about your neighbor.\u201d He cited an \u201cerosion\u201d of those commitments in sports, business and politics. \u201cWhy do politicians keep using the division card? Self-interest.\u201d\n\nOhio\u2019s governor is pleasingly difficult to locate on an ideological map. His twin passions for economic growth and social inclusion are Jack Kemp-like. His references to religion as a source of compassion are reminiscent of George W. Bush. And he adds an authentic blue-collar appeal: \u201cWhen I went to Youngstown, I could say, \u2018I get your values. I grew up next door to you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt is difficult at this point to imagine how this oddly shaped piece fits the puzzle of the Republican primaries. But Kasich speaks with a fatalism that is really faith. \u201cYou do your job,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re out, you\u2019re out. I think the Lord wants me to be an effective leader and let everyone rise. What is the worst thing that could have happened to me in this election? I could have lost.\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t, emphatically.\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Michael Gerson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "John Kasich, Ohio\u2019s governor, is pleasingly difficult to locate on an ideological map.", "title": "From Ohio, a different sort of Republicanism", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-john-kasichs-different-sort-of-republicanism/2014/11/10/1eb52a8c-690d-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/11/10/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Election_Ohio-04f14.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mjgerson"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-john-kasichs-different-sort-of-republicanism/2014/11/10/1eb52a8c-690d-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Michael Gerson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "1eb52a8c-690d-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "John Kasich, Ohio\u2019s governor, is pleasingly difficult to locate on an ideological map."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2ef\"", "article_summary": "Describing his policy-oriented, aspirational campaign, Kasich told me, \u201cWhen I first started, my staff completely freaked out.\nYet Kasich won a majority of union voters, three-fifths of female voters, a majority of voters younger than 30, two-thirds of independents and a quarter of African American voters.\nThe victories of many Republican governors, however, were impressive for extending the map, holding hard-earned territory or crossing demographic barriers.\nThere were Republican wins in Massachusetts, Maryland and, in what amounted to dancing in President Obama\u2019s end zone, Illinois.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re out, you\u2019re out."}
