One who maybe even might be able to resist the temptation to actively antagonize Latinos, the nation\u2019s fastest-growing electoral bloc. For a moment, it looked like the fever that had burned since the election of President Barack Obama in 2008 had broken.\n\nBut then came the Mexican rapists, and Benghazi, and the plot to \u201cIslamize\u201d America, and Planned Parenthood acting as an agent of holocaust. We heard endless dark warnings about Obama the Nazi, Obama the ISIS apologist. We learned that the Affordable Care Act is tantamount to slavery and the Holocaust could have been averted if the Jews had just had guns, and that the Iran deal will trigger the second Holocaust (so many holocausts!).\n\nOnce the Paris attacks happened, the panic tightened its grip, with two leading Republican presidential candidates suddenly possessed by dueling hallucinations of celebratory Muslims in Jersey on 9/11. Then came San Bernardino. Donald Trump, who had previously contented himself with talk of an authoritarian state in which Muslims were made to register and neighbor spied upon neighbor, doubled down, calling for a ban of all Muslims trying to come to the United States. The rest of the field, while not quite scaling such rhetorical heights, hardly distinguished itself with steely Churchillian reserve, opting instead for a flurry of Muppet arms. When Obama gave a speech emphasizing calm and fortitude, Marco Rubio responded by saying that, on the contrary, Americans are \u201creally scared,\u201d John Kasich said \u201cour way of life is at stake,\u201d Chris Christie proclaimed that World War III had begun, and Jeb Bush said ISIS is \u201corganizing to destroy Western Civilization.\u201d\n\nMcConnell may have tried\u2014however lamely\u2014to get the scary horse back into the barn, but time passes and news breaks and the beast does not abide. What is driving all this panic? It\u2019s easy to blame it on individual demagogues and pin it all on the symptoms of Obama Derangement Syndrome. This was the view on display in a November column by the New York Times\u2019 Paul Krugman, who attributed the abundance of panic in the GOP to the fact that \u201cmany bullies are also cowards\u201d and \u201cthe apocalyptic mind-set that has developed among Republicans during the Obama years.\u201d There is something to that, but it\u2019s hardly the whole story.\n\nThe fact is, the variety of political panic we are presently enjoying is woven into the fabric of our society, an unfortunate side effect of living in a continually morphing nation of immigrants. This panic has historically afflicted the right more than the left (though the left is not immune to panics of its own), and though it usually simmers just beneath the surface of our politics, it has, at this particular moment in time, not just reemerged but, seemingly, gone mainstream.\n\nFor the most part, the current field of Republicans is riding the wave, ginning up panic whenever possible, in a campaign season that often seems less like an application to the White House and more like one for the ding farm. But will it work? Can this trembling, red-eyed, dark-minded impulse at the core of our national experience be marshaled to win a national election? And, perhaps more importantly, can it be stopped?\n\n***\n\nFor all our talk of steady hands and rugged individualism, there\u2019s a long and hallowed tradition of sheer barking panic in American politics. \u201cThere\u2019s no country in the world that can get more hysterical!\u201d Sinclair Lewis wrote in It Can\u2019t Happen Here, his 1935 novel about a folksy American politician who leads a panicky nation into fascism. And indeed, we\u2019ve done our part to prove him right. Over the decades, Americans, minds afire with doomsday visions of wild plots and schemes, have lost it over the illuminati, the Masons, the pope of Rome and his marauding Jesuits, the League of Nations, the U.N., communist infiltrators, welfare queens, Willie Horton, Jeremiah Wright, birtherism, gay plots, \u201cdeath panels,\u201d Jade Helm, no-go zones, the aforementioned Mexican rapists/ethnic cleansers/Ebola-infected ISIS supporters, and so on.\n\nAnd throughout, most of those eruptions have come from a certain spot on the American political spectrum. Writing in 1954, historian Richard Hofstadter, borrowing a term from the social theorist Theodore Adorno, dubbed these people \u201cpseudo-conservatives.\u201d In his essay \u201cThe Pseudo-Conservative Revolt,\u201d which Hofstadter wrote in response to the rise of far-right demagogues like Joe McCarthy and groups like the John Birch Society, he defined the type:\n\n\n\nIn 1955, the above flier, issued by the Keep America Committee, urged readers to \"fight communistic world government\" by opposing public health programs like water fluoridation. | Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough they believe themselves to be conservatives and usually employ the rhetoric of conservatives, [pseudo-conservatives] show signs of a serious and restless dissatisfaction with American life, its institutions and traditions.\u201d They may call themselves conservatives, Hofstadter noted, but they do so mainly for the veneer of political legitimacy the term confers. In reality, they are more a mix of ultraconservative, isolationist and, occasionally, radical. \u201cThey have little in common with the temperate and compromising spirit of true conservatism in the classical sense of the word.\u201d\n\nThe pseudo-conservative, Hofstadter continued, \u201cis likely to be antagonistic to most of the operations of our federal government except congressional investigations.\u201d He is preoccupied with his loyalty and the perceived disloyalty of others and prone to constant patriotic \u201cself-advertisement.\u201d He \u201csees his own country as being so weak that it is constantly about to fall victim to subversion; and yet he feels it is so all-powerful that any failure it may experience in getting its way in the world ... cannot possibly be due to its own limitations but must be attributed to its having been betrayed.\u201d He believes that \u201cthose who place greater stress on negotiation and accommodation are engaged in treasonable conspiracy or are guilty of well-nigh criminal failings in moral and intellectual fiber.\u201d\n\nAll these years later, Hofstadter\u2019s essay reads like the whiteboard from a breakout session at CPAC. While the author blamed the confluence of uncertain times and the advent of mass media\u2014which keeps people \u201cin an almost constant state of political mobilization\u201d\u2014he also argued that the animating spirit of pseudo-conservatism was tied to the \u201crootlessness and heterogeneity\u201d at the center of the American experiment:\n\n\u201cBecause we no longer have the relative ethnic homogeneity we had up to about eighty years ago,\u201d he wrote, \u201cour sense of belonging has long had about it a high degree of uncertainty. We boast of \u2018the melting pot,\u2019 but we are not quite sure what it is that will remain when we are melted down.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Crime is down, jobs are growing, America is pre-eminent.
