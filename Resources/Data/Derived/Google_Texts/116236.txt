On the Offensive Against Epidemics

Progress was made against several epidemics this year, and an old public health lesson was reinforced: The world doesn’t necessarily have to wait for a new miracle drug or vaccine to beat back an outbreak. Officials just have to find the political will — and the money.

The explosive Ebola epidemic in West Africa that claimed more than 11,000 lives in 2014 was slowly ground out by treatment in tent hospitals and by relentless tracing of the contacts of each confirmed case. Ebola vaccines, tested in Africa appeared promising, but by the time they became available, there were so few remaining cases that scientists could not do the large, definitive trial they had hoped for.

Polio has probably been wiped out in Africa, where smallpox and rinderpest, the only two diseases eliminated from the planet, made their last stand. The last polio case on the continent was a Somali child paralyzed on Aug. 11, 2014. The only two countries that have not wiped out the virus are Pakistan and Afghanistan.

And, although the crucial discoveries were made earlier, it was only in the last year that a new approach to fighting the AIDS epidemic in the United States began to take hold. More city and county health departments began making serious efforts to find and test everyone likely to have the virus and get them on antiretroviral drugs immediately rather than waiting for their immune systems to weaken. Patients taking the drugs are about 96 percent less likely to infect any of their partners, even when condoms are not used.

More people at risk of H.I.V. infection — gay men and drug injectors, in particular — are beginning to take Truvada, a pill that can protect them. In gay men, evidence is mounting that it is nearly 100 percent effective at preventing H.I.V. infection if taken daily.

Although a viable H.I.V. vaccine is still far off, using one of those methods is just as effective as any vaccine could be. – DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.
