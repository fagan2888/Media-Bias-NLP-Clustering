Davidson analyst Timothy Ramey, a longtime Herbalife bull, calls the stock his \u201csingle best idea\u201d for 2014, the second year in a row he is giving it that distinction.\n\nThe stock, which we deemed one of the five best stocks of 2013, soared last year despite despite claims by hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman that the company operates an illegal pyramid scheme. Mr. Ramey expects the rally to continue as investors turn their attention away from the short-seller\u2019s allegations and focus on the company\u2019s fundamentals.\n\n\u201cUnleashed from the bear raid, Herbalife should trade on growth prospects,\u201d Mr. Ramey wrote to clients. He, of course, was the analyst who last month took a victory lap by saying he\u2019d like to thank \u201cMom, Jesus and the short sellers\u201d for Herbalife\u2019s big surge.\n\nShares kicked off the new year up 1.9% to $80.22.\n\nMr. Ramey noted the company\u2019s latest audit from PwC showed a clean bill of health, which is a positive long-term catalyst for the stock. And despite the big rally, Herbalife\u2019s valuation still looks compelling. Shares trade at about 15 times next year\u2019s earnings, according to FactSet.\n\n\u201cIf \u201cmultilevel\u201d were to be fully vindicated as an operating strategy, why wouldn\u2019t Herbalife deserve to sell at 25x EPS?\u201d Mr. Ramey asks. \u201cIt has impressive margins, huge cash flow, which it has used to benefit shareholders with aggressive share repurchase and dividend increases, and its revenue growth beats anything else we cover.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the scrutiny Herbalife faces isn\u2019t likely to dissipate anytime soon. Last month Mr. Ackman, the billionaire investor, made fresh allegations of operational impropriety and promised to reveal more dirt on Herbalife in 2014. The company has repeatedly denied Mr. Ackman\u2019s allegations.\n\nFor now, Mr. Ramey outlines possible catalysts that could push the stock higher this year.\n\n\u201cWe continue to think that the situation is ripe for a catalyst \u2013 perhaps a leveraged share repurchase, perhaps a leveraged buyout,\u201d he says. \u201cSeveral noted investors including Carl Icahn and William Stiritz have \u2018activist\u2019 positions and are likely to pressure Herbalife to use its zero-debt-net-of-cash balance sheet to leverage returns to shareholders.\u201d\n\nHerbalife has reported quarterly results that have exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations in 19 straight quarters. Mr. Ramey notes the company has kept its dividend constant for the past eight quarters after it upped it by 50% in the first quarter of 2012.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "In the wake of Herbalife Ltd.'s 139% rally last year to record levels, one analyst says the stock has plenty of room to run higher.", "title": "Herbalife Is \u2018Single Best Idea\u2019 in 2014: Analyst", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/01/02/herbalife-is-single-best-idea-in-2014-analyst/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AU863_1217He_G_20131217121257.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Herbalife Is \u2018Single Best Idea\u2019 in 2014: Analyst", "description": "In the wake of Herbalife Ltd.'s 139% rally last year to record levels, one analyst says the stock has plenty of room to run higher.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Steven Russolillo", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "In the wake of Herbalife Ltd.'s 139% rally last year to record levels, one analyst says the stock has plenty of room to run higher.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-01-02T20:14:21-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/01/02/herbalife-is-single-best-idea-in-2014-analyst/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-14044", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "In the wake of Herbalife Ltd.'s 139% rally last year to record levels, one analyst says the stock has plenty of room to run higher.", "title": "Herbalife Is \u2018Single Best Idea\u2019 in 2014: Analyst", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/01/02/herbalife-is-single-best-idea-in-2014-analyst/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AU863_1217He_G_20131217121257.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-14044", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-01-02T20:37:45-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd062b\"", "article_summary": "Davidson analyst Timothy Ramey, a longtime Herbalife bull, calls the stock his \u201csingle best idea\u201d for 2014, the second year in a row he is giving it that distinction.\n\u201cUnleashed from the bear raid, Herbalife should trade on growth prospects,\u201d Mr. Ramey wrote to clients.\n\u201cIf \u201cmultilevel\u201d were to be fully vindicated as an operating strategy, why wouldn\u2019t Herbalife deserve to sell at 25x EPS?\u201d Mr. Ramey asks.\nBloomberg NewsIn the wake of Herbalife 139% rally last year to record levels, one analyst says the stock has plenty of room to run higher.\nMr. Ramey expects the rally to continue as investors turn their attention away from the short-seller\u2019s allegations and focus on the company\u2019s fundamentals."}
