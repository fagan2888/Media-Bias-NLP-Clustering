Now it\u2019s become a headache she just can\u2019t shake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating,\u201d Ramey said.\n\nRamey\u2019s not alone. More than 100,000 Hoosiers have seen their insurance plans cancelled, most because they buy individual plans that no longer qualify under Obamacare.\n\nOthers, like Ramey, are losing Medicaid plans like Healthy Indiana because of changes in income thresholds.\n\n\u201cWhat am I going to do for my medications? What are other people going to do?\u201d Ramey said.\n\nDespite the President\u2019s plan this week to allow insurers to extend those plans, Logan Harrison with the Indiana Department of Insurance refutes that.\n\n\u201cWe knew that there were going to be cancellations of policies,\u201d Harrison said.\n\nIn fact, Harrison and other state leaders say they already spent years working with insurers to rewrite their plans.\n\n\u201cFor the perception to be created that \u2026 it\u2019s just so easy that we could reorder a plan that is no longer in existence is absurd,\u201d Harrison said.\n\nThe problem is even worse because Ramey and others are unable to access new plans on Healthcare.gov. Until it\u2019s fixed, many are left waiting and hoping they\u2019ll find insurance by the first of the year.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to cover? How much is the premium? What\u2019s my out of pocket? I need to know those kind of questions to balance my budget and prepare for this,\u201d Ramey said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "INDIANAPOLIS - Hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers could find themselves without insurance if a fix to problems with Obamacare isn't completed soon.
