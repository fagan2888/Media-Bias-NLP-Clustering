Now I hear that this kind of fat is being banned. Why would they do that to her pie crust after all this time?\n\n\u2014 Annie B., New York\n\nA: You\u2019re right, Annie, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has announced that it wants to get trans fats out of the American diet \u2014 because they\u2019re dangerous.\n\nYou\u2019re also right that moms like yours (and prepared-food manufacturers) have been making pie crusts, cakes and cookies with partially hydrogenated oils, which is what trans fats are, ever since the vegetable shortening Crisco was introduced in 1911. Consumers today spend more than $10 billion a year on prepared cakes, cupcakes, cookies and brownies. Virtually all those treats contain trans fats.\n\nBut in the past 20 years, there\u2019s been a lot of research on the dangers of trans fats, and major health organizations, including the Institute of Medicine, say it\u2019s not smart to consume ANY. We agree. We\u2019ve both spent countless hours trying to combat the bodily damage that trans fats cause. Dr. Oz has seen what they do to his cardiac patients on a daily basis, and for years Dr. Mike at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Center has dealt with obesity-related problems that come in part from a prevalence of trans fats in food.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that banning trans fats could prevent 20,000 heart attacks annually. We say it also can reduce the incidence of diabetes and high blood pressure, dementia and sexual dysfunction.\n\nWe all should be glad the FDA has taken this step. But banning trans fats will take a while; we\u2019re in a 60-day review period, and if the FDA does act, it may take two to five years to phase trans fats out of our food.\n\nSo, until they\u2019re gone, watch out for partially hydrogenated oils on ingredient lists and trans fats on nutritional labels. Trans fats (one of the Five Food Felons) still are found in some frozen foods, baked goods, frostings, coffee creamers and microwavable popcorns, among other items. And avoid unpackaged baked goods and deep-fried restaurant foods; they\u2019re often made with trans fats.\n\nA: You\u2019re in control of what\u2019s on the menu in your house, so there\u2019s a lot you can do to make your kids aware of the great tastes in natural, healthy food. But we\u2019re not saying it\u2019s easy.\n\nMost of the $4.6 billion spent yearly on fast-food advertising targets your kids. The Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity\u2019s new report says children see three to five TV ads for fast food every day. So when ads come on, talk to your kids about the real content of various food products and what kinds of food are better for their health and happiness. (If you need a crash course to do that, see our 99-second edition of \u201cYOU: On a Diet\u201d.)\n\nAnother great way to get kids into good-for-them foods is to take them to local farms that are committed to healthy farming. We figure \u201cE-I-E-I-Ohhh\u201d is Old MacDonald\u2019s refrain because he heard 30 percent of kids in one survey thought cheese came from plants, and half didn\u2019t know bacon came from pigs.\n\nThe website www.localharvest.org /organic-farms/visiting offers info on local farms you can visit. And more than 2,000 schools nationally have developed farm-school initiatives (check out Know Your Farmer, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture).\n\nYour kids will get excited about picking apples, planting basil \u2026 and walnut harvesting is fun (see it online at Walnuts.org). Then it\u2019ll be easier to get them involved in grocery shopping and cooking.\n\nPlanning, cooking and having family meals together is a powerful way to reduce the risk of obesity, keep kids off drugs (really!) and improve their nutrition for a lifetime of better health.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Banning trans fats could prevent 20,000 heart attacks in the U.S. annually; and getting your kids to eat 'right'"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019ve both spent countless hours trying to combat the bodily damage that trans fats cause.\nBut banning trans fats will take a while; we\u2019re in a 60-day review period, and if the FDA does act, it may take two to five years to phase trans fats out of our food.\nAnd avoid unpackaged baked goods and deep-fried restaurant foods; they\u2019re often made with trans fats.\nIt\u2019s estimated that banning trans fats could prevent 20,000 heart attacks annually.\nSo, until they\u2019re gone, watch out for partially hydrogenated oils on ingredient lists and trans fats on nutritional labels."}
