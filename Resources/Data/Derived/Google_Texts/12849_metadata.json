Conducted by researchers at Ben-Gurion University in Israel, the study found that a fear of spiders, arachnophobia, can alter the person\u2019s perception of the arachnids so that they appear larger than they actually are.\n\nFor their study, the researchers recruited 25 women who were asked to estimate the size of spiders, butterflies, and birds in photos. Prior to estimating, the women were split into two groups \u2014 low or high fear of spiders \u2014 based on their answers to a questionnaire that gauged severity of arachnophobia. The questions were designed to differentiate between fear and general unpleasantness, which allowed the researchers to control for differences in size estimation related to disgust.\n\nAlthough both groups rated the arachnids equally as unpleasant, it was only the group with a high fear of spiders that overestimated their sizes. When it came to the birds and butterflies, however, there were no differences between the groups in terms of estimated sizes. In a statement, the researchers said these results suggest there\u2019s more going on than a simple difference of opinion. \u201cThis study revealed how perception of even a basic feature such as size is influenced by emotion, and demonstrates how each of us experiences the world in a unique and different way,\u201d said Dr. Tali Leibovich, a PhD researcher at BGU\u2019s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.\n\nThis is not the first time scientists have recognized the mind\u2019s ability to warp perception. The study noted past research that found people perceive negative stimuli, like a circle with a swastika in the center, as larger than positive or neutral stimuli, like a dollar sign.\n\nA study published this year also found a person's weight could interfere with their perception of distance; obese people saw destinations at least 10 percent further than those with an normal weight. \u201cIt is a conscious perception of the world, but it\u2019s not based on conscious perception of the body or feelings of laziness\u201d study author Dr. Jessica Witt told The Telegraph. \u201cIt cannot be controlled\u2026 you can\u2019t will yourself to see that target as closer or that hill as less steep.\u201d\n\nWhile the current study\u2019s results suggest it\u2019s a fear of spiders that alters perception, Leibovich said it\u2019s possible that arachnophobes already had an altered perception, and that their fear grew out of it. Only future studies will uncover the answers to this, and serve \u201cas a basis to developing treatment for different phobias.\u201d\n\nSource: Leibovich T, Cohen N, Henik A.
