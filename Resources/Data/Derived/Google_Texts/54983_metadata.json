They are taking advantage of the large piles of cash that investors have ready to commit to the asset class following a period of record distributions. In the first three months of the year alone, 11 of Europe\u2019s largest private equity firms returned around $15 billion to their investors, according to research by Private Equity News.\n\nBC Partners, which raised its last buyout fund in 2012, is expected to return to market early next year with a target of around \u20ac6 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nCinven, which last raised a fund in 2013, is expected to return to market early next year. Advent International is also expected to return to market in 2016, the people said.\n\n\u201cWe expect 2015 to be a very strong year for fundraising with a rash of funds hitting their hard caps and managers coming back to market earlier than anticipated and taking advantage of the market buoyancy to increase their targets,\u201d said Janet Brooks, a partner at placement agent Monument Group.\n\nAngela Willetts, a managing director at gatekeeper Capital Dynamics, said that she had seen a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d number of funds come back to market in the first half and that she had \u201ccertainly seen much faster fundraising.\u201d Ms. Willetts said that these large distributions were welcome, but were proving to be an issue for some investors who were finding it difficult to maintain their allocations to the asset class.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they are getting distributions back it\u2019s like trying to run up a down escalator, they can never quite get to allocation target as they are constantly getting money back,\u201d said Ms. Willetts.\n\n\u2013Hillary Canada contributed to this post.\n\nWrite to Alec Macfarlane at alec.macfarlane@wsj.com and Becky Pritchard at becky.pritchard@wsj.com\n\n(This item first appeared in Private Equity News, a U.K. trade publication owned by Dow Jones & Co.)", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "European buyout firms are enjoying a rapid fundraising environment with various top names on course to secure large pots of fresh capital in the coming months.", "title": "European Firms Jump Into Rapid Fundraising Market", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/21/european-firms-jump-into-rapid-fundraising-market/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "European Firms Jump Into Rapid Fundraising Market", "description": "European buyout firms are enjoying a rapid fundraising environment with various top names on course to secure large pots of fresh capital in the coming months.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Alec Macfarlane and Becky Pritchard", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "European buyout firms are enjoying a rapid fundraising environment with various top names on course to secure large pots of fresh capital in the coming months.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-04-21T17:29:34-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/21/european-firms-jump-into-rapid-fundraising-market/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-18347", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "European buyout firms are enjoying a rapid fundraising environment with various top names on course to secure large pots of fresh capital in the coming months.", "title": "European Firms Jump Into Rapid Fundraising Market", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/21/european-firms-jump-into-rapid-fundraising-market/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-18347", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-21T17:34:31-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Some managers are also pushing to come back to market earlier than anticipated in an effort to take advantage of the strong fundraising market.\nEuropean buyout firms are enjoying a rapid fundraising environment with various top names on course to secure large pots of fresh capital in the coming months.\nIn the first three months of the year alone, 11 of Europe\u2019s largest private equity firms returned around $15 billion to their investors, according to research by Private Equity News.\nWrite to Alec Macfarlane at alec.macfarlane@wsj.com and Becky Pritchard at becky.pritchard@wsj.com(This item first appeared in Private Equity News, a U.K. trade publication owned by Dow Jones & Co.)\nMontagu Private Equity, which recently returned to the market with a \u20ac2.5 billion fund, has already attracted roughly \u20ac2 billion of preliminary demand from its existing investors, one person said."}
