Another chance for scattered storms rolls through KAKEland today. Some of the storms could produce large hail, damaging winds, and there's a chance for a few tornadoes.

Isolated showers will still be possible this morning in Wichita, with much better chances in Eastern Kansas. Beneficial rain will be the main feature with the activity this morning.

The chance for strong and severe storms increases this afternoon across a large part of KAKEland. Hail, high wind and very isolated tornadoes are possible.

The best chance for storms comes through tonight and overnight. Central and south central Kansas, including Wichita, could get some locally heavy rain and isolated severe storms. Large hail looks to be the most likely threat at that time.
