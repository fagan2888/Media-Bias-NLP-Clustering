While the start of the 2015 fall semester Aug. 24 is still six weeks away, the window of opportunity is closing fast for having the best selection of classes.\n\nBesides having increased choices of open class sections, dates and times, registering now instead of later has other benefits for both continuing and new students. There are more advising times, campus tours are available, and the stress level of being part of the hectic, late enrollment rush is eliminated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaking an appointment with an advisor in the Fremont Campus' Go!Zone enrollment and advising center is encouraged, but walk-ins also are welcome. Besides taking care of the enrolling, advising and registering functions, students also can learn about upcoming events, services that are available to them, and the benefits that are offered through participation in student clubs and/or Associated Student Government.\n\nAdditional information about all enrolling, advising and registering procedures is available by calling Toni Roberts at 296-6100.\n\n\"We are very excited for this coming academic year and the start of the fall semester,\" said Lana Carter, the Fremont Campus' dean. \"PCC was recently spotlighted as one of the top four colleges in the country for 'adding value' to a student's college years, and the Fremont Campus is ready to help make that happen for our students.\n\nThe Go!Zone and bookstore hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays through Aug. 7, with the hours extended to 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday from Aug. 10 through Aug. 21 (until 5 p.m. on Fridays). In addition, there will be special Saturday hours of 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Aug. 15.\n\nStudents should be aware that all financial aid paperwork must be submitted by Aug. 10 to ensure that aid is available by the start of classes. Information about financial aid assistance and scholarships is available by calling Eric Ingmire, director of student services, at (719) 296-6106.\n\nWhen registering, new students should sign up for one of the two orientations that are scheduled in August. They will 5:30-7:30 p.m. Aug. 20 and 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Aug. 21.\n\nIn addition, a community Education Pathways Fair will be 4-6 p.m. Aug. 6, on the Fremont Campus. The fair will provide information about career fields and the academic programs that can enable students to enter those career tracks.\n\nSimas releases 10th novel\n\nFormer Ca\u00f1on City resident Ann Simas recently released her 10th book, Heaven Sent, a supernatural thriller with a love story.\n\nIn the novel, Sophie Doyle has a near-death experience after being hit by a car, but when she arrives in heaven, she's given an assignment: Save a child from the dark place.
