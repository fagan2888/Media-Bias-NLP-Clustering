Like life on tour, this volunteer is also looking to save on hotel and airfare. Peter Maurer has made following these players across the county a full-time job.

The US Senior Open officially starts Monday with practice rounds. Thousands of volunteers are already walking the grounds of Oak Tree National making sure the tournament is a success for players and fans.

Like life on tour, this volunteer is also looking to save on hotel and airfare. He's made following these players across the county a full-time job.

"I enjoy being around the golf course, around the golfer," said Peter Maurer.

You could call Maurer from Plano, Texas another journeyman.

"I've done all opens, the men's and women's and seniors'. I did the PGA, Kiawa and I've done a Ryder Cup."

Out here Maurer won't swing a club, but he will raise his arms.

"I just enjoy doing it."

He enjoys it so much so that the retired salesman follows the tour, volunteering for nine events a year, sometimes more. The US senior open will be his 49th event

Maurer is thrilled to be here. At the US open in Pinehurst a few weeks ago he had to stay 40 minutes from the course. This week he's nine minutes away.
