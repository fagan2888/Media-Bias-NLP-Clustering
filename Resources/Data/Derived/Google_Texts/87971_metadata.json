Too bad that\u2019s not as good as it sounds.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Maine\u2019s unemployment rate dropped below 4 percent in 2015, and the news was even more impressive in the state\u2019s three metropolitan regions, especially Portland, which was one of only 25 metro areas in the nation with unemployment under 3 percent.\n\nThat sounds great, and it\u2019s encouraging to think that we are finally emerging from the Great Recession.\n\nBut the rate doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Maine has a slow-growing population, and it is aging quickly. The low unemployment rate has as much to do with people leaving the workforce as it does with an expanding economy, and a tight labor market will discourage future growth and opportunity. Maine policymakers should not be satisfied with the low unemployment rate \u2013 they should take steps to get more people in the workforce, giving businesses the fuel they need to start up and grow.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember what the employment rate measures and what it does not.\n\nThe rate tells you how many people in the workforce are out of a job and looking for a new one. It does not count people who lost their full-time jobs and can find only part-time work, and it doesn\u2019t measure people who have given up looking for work.\n\nThe unemployment rate isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s shrinking.\n\nSo is the workforce.\n\nThere were 676,627 employed and unemployed Mainers in the workforce last December. One year earlier, there were 693,676 people. In December 2007, just at the start of the recession, there were 701,498 people in the workforce, nearly 25,000 more people than there were at the end of last year. Most members of the baby boom generation \u2013 roughly 411,000 Mainers \u2013 are expected to leave the workforce by 2032. If every Mainer under the age of 20 sticks around and joins the workforce, there will be a shortfall of 109,000 workers.\n\nEconomic development efforts in Maine have usually been focused on attracting employers, but they should also be centered on ways of attracting workers from other parts of the country, and from other countries. Immigration by younger people is the only way Maine can avoid the demographic winter that lies ahead.\n\nAnd we have to make better use of the people who already live here. Young people need job training and counseling to enter the workforce. Healthy, active seniors are a key source of labor in an aging state. Many seniors are already employed, and many more would appreciate the income and connection that come with a part-time job.\n\nMaine needs to do everything possible to bring more people into the workforce.\n\nFull employment will be something to celebrate when it\u2019s a measure of an expanding job market, not a shrinking labor supply.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If the size of the workforce keeps shrinking, Mainers will miss out on economic opportunity.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "If the size of the workforce keeps shrinking, Mainers will miss out on economic opportunity.", "title": "Our View: State's full employment statistics are nothing to celebrate - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 991, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/765126_767609_20140813_pepperell_31-e1456185272696.jpg", "height": 714}, "updated_time": "2016-02-23T09:12:56-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/02/23/our-view-states-full-employment-stats-are-nothing-to-celebrate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If the size of the workforce keeps shrinking, Mainers will miss out on economic opportunity.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/765126_767609_20140813_pepperell_31-e1456185272696.jpg", "title": "Our View: State's full employment statistics are nothing to celebrate - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Editorials", "tag": "unemployment", "published_time": "2016-02-23T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-23T09:12:56-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Full employment will be something to celebrate when it\u2019s a measure of an expanding job market, not a shrinking labor supply.\nIt\u2019s important to remember what the employment rate measures and what it does not.\nThe unemployment rate isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s shrinking.\nMaine reached full employment at the end of 2015.\nThe rate tells you how many people in the workforce are out of a job and looking for a new one."}
