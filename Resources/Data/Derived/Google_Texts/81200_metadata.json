Others have been forced to choose.\n\n\"I know moms that have decided to quit their jobs instead of quitting breastfeeding. I mean, I've had people come to me in tears because they were making that choice,\" Graham said.\n\nSenator Hillman Frazier filed a bill that would require employers to allow \"reasonable break time\" and a private location for moms to pump or breastfeed while at work.\n\n\"This is not a female issue alone. It's going to benefit the entire state. That's why we're working towards educating the public about the benefits of breastfeeding. It's going to help the mother and the baby and the state,\" Senator Frazier said.\n\nFrazier notes that there are potential health cost savings for the state. Graham agrees.\n\n\"When you know there is a correlation between breastfeeding and the reduction of chronic health conditions, it makes sense. It makes sense that you would want to support moms to give the best they can for their babies,\" Graham said.\n\nIt wasn't until 2006 that Mississippi laws were changed to make a distinction between indecent exposure and breastfeeding in public.\n\n\n\nA similar provision is included in the affordable care act.\n\nBut this would be an amendment to current state laws.", "article_metadata": {"description": "JACKSON, Miss (WTVA) --Mississippi is among the states with the lowest rates of breastfeeding.\n\nOne lawmaker blames a lack of education for the low", "og": {"site_name": "WTVA.com", "description": "JACKSON, Miss (WTVA) --Mississippi is among the states with the lowest rates of breastfeeding.\n\nOne lawmaker blames a lack of education for the low", "title": "WTVA.com | Breastfeeding bill", "url": "http://www.wtva.com/news/Breastfeeding_bill.html", "image": "http://media.heartland-interactive.com/images/1280x720_51121P00-HMWFE.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 1465228997135960}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://data.wtva.com/images//ms-icon-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "Article Section", "published_time": "Thu Jan 28 19:42:13 PST 2016", "modified_time": "Fri Mar 11 13:29:16 PST 2016"}, "google-site-verification": "ogcsOvNtf4KHmmeYTUO3vRD28FCTd5s10uoUa5fZ2N0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd9d\"", "article_summary": "One lawmaker blames a lack of education for the low rates of breastfeeding and has introduced a bill to change that.\n\"When you know there is a correlation between breastfeeding and the reduction of chronic health conditions, it makes sense.\nJACKSON, Miss (WTVA) --Mississippi is among the states with the lowest rates of breastfeeding.\nIt wasn't until 2006 that Mississippi laws were changed to make a distinction between indecent exposure and breastfeeding in public.\nMom Laura Graham doesn't think women should have to choose between work or breastfeeding."}
