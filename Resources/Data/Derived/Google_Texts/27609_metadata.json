I just keep hearing all the hubbub about it,\u201d said Carla Bible, a 27-year-old uninsured resident of Bedford who was waiting outside. \u201cUsually it\u2019s anti-[Obamacare] \u2014 a lot of anti.\u201d\n\nSome of the patients thought the law could be promising. But just weeks before the March 31 deadline for having coverage, they still hadn\u2019t signed up for plans on the federal Obamacare website, HealthCare.gov.\n\nOthers said they are among the 400,000 or so Virginians who could benefit if Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, succeeds in his plan to expand Medicaid benefits. He is battling Republicans in the legislature who cite concerns about the cost and doubt the program\u2019s efficacy.\n\nGet a number, get it early\n\nThe first cars arrived before midnight on a Friday. Some stayed overnight, parked in a paved lot across from the student activities center at Southern Virginia University. Others gravitated to a heated tent set up nearby.\n\nAt 3 a.m., patients warmed by camouflaged hunter jackets, Washington Redskins gear and blankets gathered near the clinic building to take a number from a deli-style dispenser. Tickets in hand, they waited for the doors to open at 6 a.m.\n\nThe school\u2019s gymnasium served as an eye clinic, where patients peered at letters 20 feet away and then picked out frames for new eyeglasses. Down the hall, drills whirred as rows of dentists repaired fillings and yanked out hundreds of teeth. In between, patients waited near a small stairway to see the medical doctor, some with mouths full of gauze after their visits at the dental station.\n\nThis is how it works at clinics hosted by Remote Area Medical, an organization founded by British-born Stan Brock in 1985 to deliver free health care to those who cannot afford it or access it where they live.\n\nMr. Brock was inspired to form the organization after he had a medical emergency in a remote part of the South American nation of Guyana. Since then, he has been a \u201c24/7\u201d volunteer at the helm of the nonprofit.\n\nThe organization relies on $5 and $10 donations and the generosity of medical professionals who volunteer their time and expertise at free clinics in underserved areas from Appalachia to the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThe university in Buena Vista hosts a Remote Area Medical clinic every two years. Events in 2010 and 2012 each doled out the equivalent of more than $200,000 in care, said Ryan Sloan, the head student coordinator.\n\nBut this year\u2019s event posed a new question: Obamacare launched months ago, so can it take hold in a place like this?\n\nA clear view gets murky\n\nBuena Vista means \u201cgood view\u201d in Spanish. Though the way locals say it, \u201cBuena\u201d rhymes with \u201ctuna\u201d and \u201ci\u201d in \u201cVista\u201d is a short sound. However it sounds, the name is fitting for a town nestled in majestic mountains.\n\nA house along the town\u2019s main drag flew a Confederate flag and the \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d banner of the tea party. Although President Obama won Virginia in 2012, voters in Rockbridge County supported Republican nominee Mitt Romney by an 18-percentage-point margin.\n\nEven so, many of the clinic\u2019s patients said they liked the spirit of Mr. Obama\u2019s law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, which attempts to cover millions more Americans by offering subsidized health care plans and expanding Medicaid in states. After all, they might benefit from the law.\n\nBut it was hard to find anyone at the clinic who had logged onto HealthCare.gov, browsed through plans and ended up a happy customer.\n\n\u201cNobody knows what it\u2019s about,\u201d Erica Fitzgerald, 26, said as she waited in the women\u2019s health care section. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve waited for so long [to apply for coverage]. I\u2019m a little nervous about not knowing what I\u2019m really getting into.\u201d\n\nDeborah Oswalt, director of the Virginia Health Care Foundation, said that besides the law\u2019s complexity and mixed messages from the political class, the word might not be getting out because state leaders left federal grant money on the table instead of spending it on state-run exchanges and marketing.\n\n\u201cI certainly think that one of the problems is that since Virginia opted for using the federal marketplace, there is very little money available to pay for navigators and other ways of educating folks,\u201d she said, referring to in-person assisters who guide people through the enrollment process.\n\nSome clinic patients brushed off Obamacare or bristled at the idea that government could siphon off a penalty from their tax refunds for flouting the individual mandate, a part of the law that requires almost all Americans to hold insurance.\n\nA 27-year-old man from Harrisonburg referred to the law by coupling the president\u2019s name with an expletive. He said he checked out plans on HealthCare.gov and couldn\u2019t find anything affordable.\n\nOthers said the nation\u2019s health care problems run too deep to see instant results.\n\n\u201cObama did what he could do,\u201d Mr. Bsullak said as he waited to see a medical doctor. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance all he did so far is help the insurance companies.\u201d\n\nThe dentist(s) will see you now\n\nDavid McCormick, 36, hoped to get 14 teeth pulled by one of the clinic\u2019s dentists. He was off by one.\n\nBy the time he was finished, Dr. Francis G. Serio, dean of the dental medicine school at Bluefield College in Virginia, had extracted 15 teeth from Mr. McCormick\u2019s mouth.\n\nAs he worked, Dr. Serio spoke at length about the dental problems in Appalachia, including \u201csmoking and Mountain Dew\u201d and high-deductible plans that are practically worthless.\n\n\u201cThey get a new plan, then they find out it doesn\u2019t pay anything,\u201d he said as he stood on a tarp put down to protect the gym floor from blood spatter. Each dentist\u2019s station had a waste basket \u2014 for the teeth.\n\nMr. Brock said that whenever representatives of Remote Area Medical ask who needs dental or vision care at the start of their clinics, almost all the hands go up. Few hands go up for general medical care, either because the patients have some form of health care benefits or use the emergency room when they fall ill.\n\nBoth of those are issues for Obamacare.\n\nThe law requires plans to cover dental care for children but not for adults. HealthCare.gov advises adults to buy standalone dental plans or find health care plans on the exchanges that include dental coverage.\n\nSome people can afford that, but \u201cfor a lot of people, they won\u2019t be able to,\u201d Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said in a phone interview.\n\nShe said an Obamacare subsidy might help consumers pay for dental plans, but the assistance is applied to underlying medical plans first. Health care plans at the bronze level may save money for dental coverage but likely carry high deductibles, she said.\n\nAs Dr. Serio put it, \u201cNone of this is simple.\u201d\n\nEmergency room use also is a major problem \u2014 one Obamacare was designed to fix. The administration argues that relying on emergency rooms is more expensive and less healthy in the long run. Because emergency rooms cannot deny care, those without insurance end up freeloading on everyone else.\n\n\u201cThose that can afford it, those who\u2019ve got the insurance, the system works,\u201d Mr. Brock said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to do something for the 40-odd million Americans for which the system does not work, and it sure as hell doesn\u2019t work in dentistry and vision.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many of the hundreds of people gathered on a recent Saturday for a free clinic are exactly the types of people Obamacare is trying to reach \u2014 generally poor in pocketbook and in health, who either lack insurance or whose bare-bones policies don't cover vision or dental care.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Many of the hundreds of people gathered on a recent Saturday for a free clinic are exactly the types of people Obamacare is trying to reach \u2014 generally poor in pocketbook and in health, who either lack insurance or whose bare-bones policies don\u2019t cover vision or dental care.", "title": "Where\u2019s Obamacare? \u2014 Rural Virginians choose free clinic over government red tape", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/12/wheres-obamacare-rural-virginians-choose-free-clin/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/12/3_122014_medical-20140301-04-28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/12/3_122014_medical-20140301-04-28201.jpg", "description": "Many of the hundreds of people gathered on a recent Saturday for a free clinic are exactly the types of people Obamacare is trying to reach \u2014 generally poor in pocketbook and in health, who either lac", "card": "summary", "title": "Where\u2019s Obamacare? \u2014 Rural Virginians choose free clinic over go"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Social Issues, Barack Obama, Rich Bsullak, Buena Vista"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d48\"", "article_summary": "HealthCare.gov advises adults to buy standalone dental plans or find health care plans on the exchanges that include dental coverage.\nShe said an Obamacare subsidy might help consumers pay for dental plans, but the assistance is applied to underlying medical plans first.\nHealth care plans at the bronze level may save money for dental coverage but likely carry high deductibles, she said.\nOthers said the nation\u2019s health care problems run too deep to see instant results.\nThe university in Buena Vista hosts a Remote Area Medical clinic every two years."}
