For every $1 billion expended on this sort of infrastructure, 13,000 jobs will be created over the coming decade, according to the government report.\n\nRelated: Why Winter Ravaged Roads and Bridges Need a Gas Tax Makeover\n\n\u201cIn addition to these hundreds of thousands of jobs that will be created, transportation employers across the main subsectors of trucking, transit, air, highway, rail, and maritime will need to hire up to 4.6 million workers \u2013 1.2 times the current transportation workforce \u2013 in the next decade, due to the industry\u2019s employment needs that will result from growth, retirements, and turnover,\u201d the report added. \u201cMany of these individuals will require training to meet the skill requirements of transportation employers.\u201d\n\nAs state governments compete with one another to attract more businesses and residents, investment in infrastructure is a vital tool in their arsenals. \u201cCareers in the transportation industry can lift Americans into the middle class or help them stay there, and this report concludes that there will be more job opportunities in the near future,\u201d said Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx.\n\nUnder current policies, there will be net transportation job growth in practically every state and region. The cities most likely to benefit from this job expansion include Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Chicago and New York, according to the report. Only two states -- Kentucky and Vermont \u2013 are likely to incur small declines because of spending or policy decisions.\n\nRelated: Obama Says China\u2019s Infrastructure Puts the U.S. to Shame\n\nJoseph Kane, a senior analyst with Brookings who specializes in metropolitan infrastructure, stressed the importance of these jobs because they pay more competitive wages in contrast to all jobs nationally and they provide as much as 30 percent more in salary to lower-income workers. He says that these transportation-related jobs fill \u201ca huge void\u201d in an important segment of the workforce.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Kane said that lawmakers, state officials, business groups and other advocates have understandably focused on the problems of a near bankrupt Federal Highway Trust Fund that has repeatedly threatened the cutoff of critical federal funds for highway and bridge projects.\n\nKane said that some may be overlooking or mistakenly downplaying the importance of funding infrastructure projects across the board that are vital to the country\u2019s long term economic well-being. President Obama has repeatedly warned that the U.S. lags far behind China and other global economic rivals in infrastructure construction, such as energy grids, port facilities, airports and other major projects that enhance a country\u2019s competitive edge in trade.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been this predominant focus\u201d on highway and bridge projects, he said, particularly in a post-recessionary era when the government engaged in considerable stimulus spending to try to jump-start the economy.\n\nRelated: The U.S. Still Won\u2019t Invest In 21st Century Infrastructure\n\n\u201cBut what this DOT report and what we at Brookings have emphasized in the past is that the highway trust fund is supporting a lot of those construction jobs, but it\u2019s also important to create and maintain those infrastructure facilities that ultimately are operated by millions of different workers across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not just construction workers you see along the highways, but it is also the truck drivers, the technicians, the engineers \u2013 workers across all skill levels\u2014that are involved in these projects,\u201d Kane said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The nation\u2019s highway and infrastructure projects limped along this summer, funded by y", "title": "Here\u2019s an Easy Way to Create Millions of Middle Class Jobs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/04/Here-s-Easy-Way-Create-Millions-Middle-Class-Jobs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02172011_highway_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/04/Here-s-Easy-Way-Create-Millions-Middle-Class-Jobs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02172011_highway_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The nation\u2019s highway and infrastructure projects limped along this summer, funded by y", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Department of Transportation funds and oversees more than $51 billion of surface transportation construction annually, including highways, bridges and other public transportation systems.\nKane said that some may be overlooking or mistakenly downplaying the importance of funding infrastructure projects across the board that are vital to the country\u2019s long term economic well-being.\nThe nation\u2019s highway and infrastructure projects limped along this summer, funded by yet another short-term, patchwork spending bill approved by Congress before the August recess.\nFor every $1 billion expended on this sort of infrastructure, 13,000 jobs will be created over the coming decade, according to the government report.\nHe says that these transportation-related jobs fill \u201ca huge void\u201d in an important segment of the workforce."}
