They chat about massages, and where they found their sports gear, about the awful practice that coach Bob Whitford put them through on Saturday, and the new paddling technique they\u2019re trying to incorporate into their stroke before October.\n\nThen they turn to the 40-foot dragon boat that needs to be launched into the water, grab their paddles and life jackets and prepare for practice.\n\nThey are of every age, from 71-year old Dana Bauer of Lakewood Ranch to 39-year-old Emily Williams of Sarasota, but there are quiet reminders of the bond they share:\n\nThe blue butterfly on Cris Campbell\u2019s forearm that grasps a breast cancer ribbon. Pink everywhere \u2014 on the boat, on the paddles, on T-shirts, on water shoes, on sports pants. Even the name of their team, \u201cSurvivors in Sync,\u201d which when abbreviated indicates a sisterhood.\n\n\u201cSIS baby, SIS,\u201d Whitford, also the park manager, says as a recent practice gets underway.\n\nThe Survivors in Sync dragon boat team comprises about 30 women who have been told they have\n\nbreast cancer. As their first year as a team comes to a close, the women are training for the International Breast Cancer Paddlers\u2019 Commission\u2019s Participatory Dragon Boat Festival in October.\n\nMore than 2,500 international participants are expected to travel to Sarasota for the three-day event, Oct. 24-26, with a competition, networking events, workshops and parties.\n\nIt\u2019s a celebration of the first boat of breast cancer survivors that turned to this sport, after Canadian sports medicine professor Dr. Don McKenzie began pushing patients toward dragon boat racing to boost energy, strength and spirits in 1996. The movement was also meant to challenge a widespread assumption that upper-body exertion put breast cancer survivors at a greater risk of lymphedema \u2014 fluid retention and tissue swelling that can be caused by cancer treatments.\n\nSarasota\u2019s boat weighs almost 600 pounds, and has 10 rows that seat two women each. A drummer sits on a narrow wooden bench perched in the bow, and a steersman stands in the stern.\n\n\u201cCome on, ladies; you are burning daylight!\u201d Whitford calls out as the team stretches in a circle at a recent practice.\n\nTeam members Elaine Parnell and Carla \u201cCookie\u201d Baldwin check their boat assignments on a tiny mock-up sheet. Team captain Angela Long moves them around to make sure people get experience on both sides of the boat.\n\nThey are part of a larger network in Florida \u2014 and across the country and the world \u2014 of breast cancer survivors who have put their mark on this 2,000-year-old Chinese sport, and show no signs of stopping.\n\nThere are other dragon boat racing teams in Florida: Miami\u2019s Save Our Sisters, Punta Gorda\u2019s Missin Mammaries, the newly formed Heart and Soul Dragonboat Paddlers in Melbourne.\n\nLong \u2014 who founded the online resource guide Breast Investigators after being diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 35 in 2004 \u2014 is connected to a diverse network of women who have survived breast cancer through her work. She remembers being invited to a planning meeting two summers ago for the dragon boat festival.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d really like Sarasota to have a team,\u201d she remembers someone saying \u2014 and it was as if all eyes were on her.\n\nShe pieced together a team using her contacts. They started with nothing, not even a boat, and hosted the first practices in classrooms.\n\n\u201cWe were practicing on chairs and yardsticks,\u201d Camila Garcia, 49, of Bradenton, says \u2014 \u201cpretending to be in the water paddling.\u201d\n\nThen the Pink Dragon Ladies of Tampa took the team under their wing, until Benderson Development donated a boat to the team this May named \u201cNate\u2019s Hope.\u201d\n\nBefore, those interested from the Sarasota-Bradenton area would caravan up to Tampa, and practice after the Pink Ladies, sometimes borrowing a few rowers.\n\n\u201cThey really are our big sisters,\u201d Long said. \u201cThey help us any way they can.\u201d\n\nThe Pink Dragon Ladies, as well as the Miami team Save Our Sisters, will co-host this year\u2019s festival at Nathan Benderson Park.\n\nAt a recent pre-festival event hosted by the Sarasota Area Sports Alliance, co-chair and Save Our Sisters member Kim Bonomo rallies the crowd about the magnitude of the event that will bring in 105 teams.\n\nSurvivors in Sync turn out in pink team shirts, and Bonomo points them out to the crowd.\n\n\u201cI know you are going to love this team,\u201d Bonomo says. \u201cYou are going to embrace this team. And I bet they will even beat us one day. Bring it on.\u201d\n\nIn the hotel lobby, a woman spots the pink-clad crowd.\n\n\u201cI love your T-shirts,\u201d she says. \u201cI want one.\u201d\n\nElyse Black looks at her.\n\n\u201cWe are wearing these T-shirts because we have to,\u201d Black says. \u201cSo hopefully one day you won\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nAnd the woman looks like she had never considered the idea at all.\n\nOnce the Sarasota team had a boat, membership grew from roughly 15 paddlers to 30.\n\nCampbell joined the team a few months before that. In 2009 her arm came to rest on her breast, and she felt a lump. A scramble of doctors\u2019 appointments followed.\n\n\u201cThey called me and told me it was breast cancer,\u201d Campbell said, \u201cAnd my tumor was larger than they thought.\u201d\n\nShe underwent chemotherapy from July to December 2012, then radiation from January to March, and has successfully finished treatments. She had never heard of dragon boat racing until she read an article in Florida Weekly. It was fun and an energy-booster \u2014 but it also helped her take in a changed relationship with her body.\n\nSometimes she still puts her arms in front of the mirror and looks for signs of swelling that might indicate that she has lymphedema. But it hasn\u2019t come.\n\nWhen life feels like a roulette, the team helps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the friendships here,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cWe all have something in common, but we don\u2019t just sit there and talk about it. This has really made me feel like I can go on with my life.\u201d\n\nSometimes the camaraderie inspires new membership.\n\nLike Bauer, whose longtime friend Barb Green encouraged her to come out this year, her seventh year cancer-free.\n\nOr Benita Zarr, 48, who had tried dragon boat racing with some coworkers just weeks before she was diagnosed with cancer. And after enduring surgery and while undergoing radiation, she joined the team.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so inspired here,\u201d said Zarr, who finished treatment in August. \u201cThey are so strong, these women.\u201d\n\nOr Lisa Merck Edwing, who shows up to help coordinate practice for her teammates even though she\u2019s fatigued, has treatment tomorrow, and feels too off to paddle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired, but I push through it,\u201d she says.\n\nPat Van Stedum and Black are in the stroke seats at a recent practice; the entire boat will follow their lead as they turn their bodies to each other, look each other in the eye and try to to keep their paddles in unison.\n\n\u201cThey say you should be boob to boob,\u201d Baldwin, 58, says.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t have any,\u201d Black exclaims and the women around her laugh.\n\nBut there is something about the set-up that says a lot about the sport, because Van Stedum and Black aren\u2019t looking at each other\u2019s paddles to stay on tempo. They look at each other.\n\n\u201cYou can really start to feel a cadence,\u201d Black says.\n\nWhitford, who volunteers his time to coach the ladies three times a week, calls out directions.\n\n\u201cThe outer shoulder has to rotate. The shoulder inside must come back. Slight bend of the elbow. Push forward in your feet. Push the boat. Push it. Weird concept, I know.\u201d\n\nAnd so they paddle, in pieces that get faster and faster.\n\n45 strokes a minute.\n\n49 strokes a minute.\n\n51 strokes a minute.\n\nTwo kids playing on the west bank of the park stare for a moment at the sight, before running off after another distraction. At the end, the women sprint. Coming from nothing, the boat jerks, almost as if it is resisting the push forward the women are giving it. Then suddenly it falls into a rhythm and rushes forward.\n\n\u201cThe crowd will be roaring for you,\u201d Whitford calls as they pass the sandy beaches that run the race course at Benderson Park. For now, there is just construction equipment, abandoned for the day.\n\n52 strokes a minute.\n\nThere is no drum tonight, just the sound of oars cutting through the water and an occasional war whoop from Black that seems to energize everyone. But the beat will come next week, when the team lets a stranger in the bow beat the drum.\n\nWhen it echoes, it sounds like one big resounding heartbeat.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/09/breast1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29fb\"", "article_summary": "Even the name of their team, \u201cSurvivors in Sync,\u201d which when abbreviated indicates a sisterhood.\nThe Survivors in Sync dragon boat team comprises about 30 women who have been told they havebreast cancer.\nThen they turn to the 40-foot dragon boat that needs to be launched into the water, grab their paddles and life jackets and prepare for practice.\nThe movement was also meant to challenge a widespread assumption that upper-body exertion put breast cancer survivors at a greater risk of lymphedema \u2014 fluid retention and tissue swelling that can be caused by cancer treatments.\nSurvivors in Sync turn out in pink team shirts, and Bonomo points them out to the crowd."}
