Michael Chappell of the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) held that ECM BioFilms, Inc. d/b/a Enviroplastics International (\u201cECM\u201d) made false and unsubstantiated claims that plastics made with its additive \u201cwould completely biodegrade, including in a landfill, in a time period ranging from 9 months to 5 years.\u201d Decision at 318. Accordingly, Chief Judge Chappell entered an order barring ECM from making claims \u201cthat any product or package will completely biodegrade within any time period, or that tests prove such representation, unless such representation is true, not misleading, and, at the time it is made, [substantiated].\u201d Id. at 321. Importantly, however, Chief Judge Chappell also held that the FTC failed to prove that the unqualified claim \u201cbiodegradable,\u201d when used with plastics, carries the implied message that such plastic will \u201ccompletely biodegrade into elements found in nature, including in a landfill, within one year\u201d\u2014a meaning the FTC ascribed to the term in its 2012 Guides For The Use Of Environmental Marketing Claims (\u201cGreen Guides\u201d). See id. at 316; 16 C.F.R. 260.8(c) (2014).\n\nECM is a manufacturer and seller of a plastic additive \u201cMasterBatch Pellets\u201d which is added to plastic during manufacture. Chief Judge Chappell found that ECM advertised the additive as follows: (1) the additive \u201ccauses plastics to be \u2018biodegradable,\u2019\u201d (2) \u201cthat plastics treated with [the additive] are \u2018biodegradable\u2019 in a \u2018landfill,\u2019\u201d and (3) that \u201cplastic products made with ECM additives [f]ully biodegrade in 9 months to 5 years.\u201d Decision at 173, 176.\n\nIn October, 2013, the FTC filed an Administrative Complaint against ECM. The FTC alleged that ECM made the following false or unsubstantiated claims:\n\nECM Plastics are \u201cbiodegradable, e., will completely break down and decompose into elements found in nature within a reasonably short period of time after customary disposal,\u201d which time period [the FTC] asserts is less than one year after disposal in a landfill; ECM Plastics are \u201cbiodegradable\u201d in a \u201clandfill; ECM Plastics are \u201cbiodegradable in a stated timeframe\u201d; which according to [the FTC] was \u201c9 months to 5 years\u201d; and Tests prove that ECM Plastics have the characteristics identified in 1, 2, or 3 above. . . .\n\nDecision at 167.\n\nUnder the revised 2012 version of the Green Guides, the FTC set forth its view that \u201c[i]t is deceptive to make an unqualified degradable claim [which includes \u201cbiodegradable\u201d] for items entering the solid waste stream if the items do not completely decompose within one year after customary disposal.\u201d 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 260.8(c) (2014) (emphasis added). During the enforcement proceeding, the FTC acknowledged that the one year time limit it argued \u201cbiodegradable\u201d implied was based upon the Green Guides. See Decision at 304.\n\nIn rejecting the \u201cone year\u201d time limitation as implied by the term \u201cbiodegradable,\u201d Chief Judge Chappell held that the FTC \u201cfailed to prove that, for purposes of evaluating whether [ECM\u2019s] claims are false or unsubstantiated, the term \u2018biodegradable\u2019 means that an item must completely break down and decompose into elements found in nature within one year after customary disposal.\u201d Decision at 317. Instead, ECM\u2019s survey evidence showed \u201cconsumers interpret the term \u2018biodegradable\u2019 to mean the process by which a product breaks down or decays, and do not infer from the term any particular time period, much less a rigid time period.\u201d Decision at 222. Chief Judge Chappell rejected a Google Consumer Survey the FTC offered to prove the implied one year time limit concluding the Google survey was \u201cnot of sufficient methodological quality to constitute probative evidence in litigation, under the Commission\u2019s standards or the standards applicable to federal courts in general.\u201d Decision at 317.\n\nThe FTC did, however, prevail on its theories that the advertised claim of biodegradability between 9 months and 5 years was false and unsubstantiated. Chief Judge Chappell held: \u201c[t]he expert testimony convincingly establishes that ECM Plastics are not fully biodegradable in a period of 9 months to 5 years in a landfill, and that tests do not prove such claims.\u201d Chief Judge Chappell further noted \u201cit has been found as a matter of fact, there is presently no single test that can substantiate the precise rate of biodegradation of plastics in a landfill.\u201d Decision at 312. Among other failures, the Google survey did not draw a sample from the appropriate population, did not ask questions in a way to minimize bias, and was not analyzed correctly by the FTC\u2019s expert. Decision at 190. For example, each respondent was asked only one question and the online pop-up questions presented \u201ca distraction at best, and a barrier to respondents whose objective [was] to access information\u201d creating \u201cdisinterest bias.\u201d Decision at 192-93. Additionally, the FTC\u2019s expert \u201cforce-fit\u201d responses into categories and excluded \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cit depends\u201d answers. Decision at 194-5.\n\nIn addition to calling into question the Green Guides\u2019 guidance on \u201cbiodegradable\u201d claims, this case illustrates the importance of methodologically sound consumer surveys in false advertising litigation. Without proper survey evidence, the FTC was unable to meet its burden to prove that the term \u201cbiodegradable\u201d carried the additional implied meaning that a product will degrade within one year\u2019s time to a sufficient number of reasonable consumers. Additionally, ECM\u2019s survey, which was designed and conducted in accordance with principles of survey research, led Chief Judge Chappell to the conclusion that the term \u201cbiodegradable\u201d did not imply a one year term for decomposition.\n\nECM filed a notice of appeal on February 6, 2015.
