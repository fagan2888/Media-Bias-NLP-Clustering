It was covered in red marks, telling me that I had failed to correctly utilize the quadratic formula, and that my calculator-less computational skills were not up to par. I was devastated \u2014 embarrassed that I had failed so miserably at something that was expected of me.\n\nThankfully I made a full recovery, and the best part is that after high school, I never had to look at another complicated math problem again. Contrary to what many teachers implied, algebra and calculus are not essential to everyone\u2019s daily life. Neither is reciting the history of the antebellum south, or memorizing a long list of amino acids. For some people, yes, but not all.\n\nAll of us do, however, have a very real need for an education in health and fitness. Whether one is a brain surgeon, musician, or financial analyst, they have a body to take care of. Without knowing how to eat right and exercise, we\u2019re putting ourselves at risk for a plethora of health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Why is it then that physical education is treated like a second class part of a child\u2019s education?\n\nWhat\u2019s The Big Deal?\n\nThe obesity epidemic in the U.S. is not news. As a country, we\u2019ve been struggling with our weight for years, and we\u2019ve reached the point where an entire third of our population is considered obese. The most harrowing part is that many of these people are children \u2014 childhood obesity has more than doubled in the last 30 years, and obesity in adolescents has quadrupled. Most of the time children are not going to fast food restaurants and buying themselves food, which means that their condition is a result of their environment, their parenting, and their education.\n\nChildren spend the majority of their day in school, and it has an undeniable effect on their health. In terms of physical education, the benefits have been demonstrated many times over. In perhaps the most obvious advantage, longer phys ed classes have been shown to reduce the likelihood that a young child will become obese. Not only do the classes give kids a workout during the day, but they expose them to activities and sports that may spark an interest in the child.\n\nThe benefits continue even into the long term.\n\n\u201cStudents need to be taught how to maintain health in order to strive as adults in the world,\u201d Dr. Tsippora Shainhouse, a board-certified pediatrician and dermatologist, and contributor to the Los Angeles Pediatric Society Newsletter, told Medical Daily in an email. \u201cSchools can provide a safe, supportive environment to learn and practice these healthy habits and lay the groundwork for maintaining a healthy lifestyle into adulthood.\u201d\n\nPhysical education, contrary to the beliefs of many, does not harm students by pulling them away from their academics. Often called a waste of time by more academically oriented students and parents, P.E. holds hidden benefits for the brain. Research shows that children who exercise actually get better grades in school, and one study found that kids getting cardiorespiratory exercise had bigger hippocampi, the brain structure associated with both short and long-term memory.\n\nEven other teachers should be grateful kids are getting to the gym during the day, according to Harold Kohl, a professor of epidemiology and kinesiology at the University of Texas.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for the educators is better academic performance,\u201d he told the Las Vegas Review. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the Holy Grail on this deal, and the evidence is getting pretty strong\u2026mental health benefits, physical health benefits, skeletal health benefits, metabolic benefits.\u201d\n\nThere really isn\u2019t much wiggle room for one to dispute the value of physical education, so why is it still a struggle to get kids the classes they need?\n\nAn Afterthought, Not A Priority\n\nAs I mentioned, many of the subjects taught in schools become irrelevant to kids later in life. They\u2019re all taken seriously though, accepted as an essential part of being an \u201ceducated\u201d person. A child\u2019s physical education is often downplayed, pushed aside, or delegitimized through various avenues, the most common of which are defunding and lack of grading.\n\nCurrently, there are no federal regulations addressing physical education in schools. The No Child Left Behind Act addressed standardized testing for academic disciplines, and the only thing it really ended up leaving behind was fitness education. Since it\u2019s left up to individual states to decide what its requirements are, many schools have cut funding for phys ed classes in favor of new technology or materials for other courses.\n\nAs a result, schools have inadequate programs, and some have none at all. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that nearly half of the high school students surveyed said they had no physical education classes in an average week. In states that allow schools to opt out of physical education, the class becomes optional in the eyes of kids, leading to health and fitness being seen as optional as well.\n\nSome states do require an adequate level of phys ed classes, but this doesn\u2019t mean the program is perfect. The grading systems for many schools are quite standard; think of a report card that lists a number or letter grade for every class. One class often gets left out \u2014 surprise, it\u2019s phys ed again.\n\n\u201cThere should be formal grading in physical education, just like there is in other core subjects,\u201d Jayne Greenberg, district director of physical education and health literacy for Miami-Dade County Public Schools, told Parents magazine.\n\nShe believes phys ed should be graded based on participation, skill level, and written tests, just like everything else.\n\n\u201cParents need an honest assessment of their child\u2019s abilities \u2014 just like they\u2019re getting in math and reading\u2014so they know what needs improvement,\u201d she said.\n\nThe grading isn\u2019t so important in the sense of a child knowing whether they\u2019re a racketball all-star or not. It\u2019s important because grades matter to kids. They learn subjects not always because they want to, but because they\u2019re scared of failing a test or class. If the same mentality were applied to phys ed, kids would be forced to actually learn about their health and fitness, rather than just go through the motions.\n\nThere has been an outcry from parents over the idea \u2014 what if my child simply isn\u2019t good at sports? Well, some kids aren\u2019t good at reading or math or science, but by exercising their brain through practice and homework, they can learn to get through it. Exercising the body isn't any different.\n\n\u201cQuality physical education programs promote better self-esteem for students,\u201d Virginia Chillari, a physical education teacher from Winslow Township School, N.J., told Medical Daily in an email. \u201cA student who may not excel in the classroom can have an alternative outlet to shine and be recognized in a positive way.\u201d\n\nOf course, students with physical disabilities would be provided alternative ways to make their grade, just as cognitive or learning disabilities are taken into consideration in academic classes.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that physical education teachers can teach all learners using many different styles,\u201d Chillari said. \u201cWe use visual concepts through demonstration, auditory concepts through music and language, and physical concepts through participation.\u201d\n\nChillari also noted that grading in classes helps support teachers as well as students, reinforcing that what they do is \u201clegitimate.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time for everyone to recognize just that, and accept that physical education is an important, if not the most important component of a child\u2019s education. Taking care of the body is not optional in life, so it shouldn\u2019t be optional during school. Besides, if we\u2019re too busy getting treatment for heart disease or struggling with obesity, how are we supposed to find time to use that quadratic formula?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "physical, education, schools, afterthought, just, important, math, or, science", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Health and fitness are vital parts of everyone's life, but schools are cutting funding, slacking on grading, and some aren't even requiring phys ed classes at all.", "title": "Why Aren't Schools Taking Health And Fitness Seriously?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/physical-education-schools-afterthought-just-important-math-or-science-353316", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/19/phys-ed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health and fitness are vital parts of everyone's life, but schools are cutting funding, slacking on grading, and some aren't even requiring phys ed classes at all.", "title": "Why Aren't Schools Taking Health And Fitness Seriously?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/physical-education-schools-afterthought-just-important-math-or-science-353316", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/19/phys-ed.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/19/phys-ed.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2015-09-20T09:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-13T12:20:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Health and fitness are vital parts of everyone's life, but schools are cutting funding, slacking on grading, and some aren't even requiring phys ed classes at all."}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt is important to note that physical education teachers can teach all learners using many different styles,\u201d Chillari said.\nSome states do require an adequate level of phys ed classes, but this doesn\u2019t mean the program is perfect.\nWhy is it then that physical education is treated like a second class part of a child\u2019s education?\nIn perhaps the most obvious advantage, longer phys ed classes have been shown to reduce the likelihood that a young child will become obese.\nShe believes phys ed should be graded based on participation, skill level, and written tests, just like everything else."}
