Schedule exercise "dates" with your friends. Friends help keep you accountable in your fitness routine. And, since it's often hard to schedule catching-up time on your busy calendar, you can skip the drinks or lunch and instead set up a tennis match or meet for a jog. You'll burn calories and get in needed friend time.

Find a routine you can love. When you find a class, group or individual program you love, exercise becomes less of an added chore and more of a pleasure you look forward to.

"Play" during family time. Hiking, biking, sledding, even just simply kicking a ball with your kids are all great ways to burn calories and have fun. The added bonus is that you're teaching your children the importance of an active lifestyle.

Go to bed earlier. If you find yourself wasting away your evening hours watching television or browsing the Internet, try going to sleep earlier. The added rest could give you enough extra energy to wake up early for a workout. Because of fewer scheduling conflicts early in the morning, you are much less likely to miss your workout. Plus, morning exercise sessions get your endorphins going for increased productivity throughout the day.

Keep exercise clothes and a "cleanup" kit at your desk. Sometimes a lunchtime workout is all you can fit in. Be prepared by having essentials at your desk to quickly clean up if a shower is not possible.
