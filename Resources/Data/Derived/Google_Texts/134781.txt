Biotech stocks to buy aren’t exactly the most popular investments on Wall Street right now.

The “risk on” environment of 2013 seems to have evaporated, with volatility heating up and many investors taking shelter in old stalwarts like consumer staples and even bond funds. Biotech stocks are often seen as risky and more speculative by investors, particularly those who prefer entrenched health care stocks like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) or Pfizer (PFE) in Big Pharma.

But if you’re looking for outperformance in 2015, then the modest risk but big-time potential of biotech stocks could be just what the doctor ordered.

There are many reasons to be bullish on healthcare stocks broadly — both because of the recession-proof nature of the sector, and the growth that is sure to come from greater access to insurance via Obamacare and demographic tailwinds thanks to aging Boomers who will need more care and medications.

Biotech stocks in particular are among the best stocks to buy because healthcare megacaps face questions of competition abroad, a strong dollar holding back international profits in 2015 and, of course, patent expirations on blockbuster drugs from years past

If you want to invest in tomorrow’s cutting edge treatments to day, the best biotech stocks to buy are the way to do just that.
