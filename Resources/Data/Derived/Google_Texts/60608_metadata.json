The clinics will be open to the general public and charge a set price for minor illnesses and treatments for common injuries.\n\nThe \u201cCareClinics,\u201d staffed with Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners (ARNPs), will charge $75 per visit for a list of common conditions, including colds and flu, sinus infections, allergies, burns, rashes and cuts, pinkeye, sore throat, head lice, warts, sprains and strains, bronchitis, ear infections and urinary-tract and intestinal infections. Care is available to patients age 2 and over.\n\nThe clinic will collect co-payments and bill most insurers for non-Group Health members, and create an electronic medical-record file through Epic, the most commonly used type of system, that can be forwarded to a patient\u2019s primary-care or specialty provider, said Dr. Wellesley Chapman, medical director for the clinics. The idea is to make it convenient and easy for the customer, he said, an concept more common in the retail world than in health care. \u201cI think we can agree that health care in general is not built around customer service,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first site is slated to open in mid-January at Bartell Drugs in University Village. In the next two months, the partnership plans to open clinics at Crossroads in Bellevue and at a new Bartell Drugs in Ballard.\n\nPatients have said they want more choices and more transparency, said Group Health President and CEO Scott Armstrong, who said the clinics are \u201ca sensible extension of the things we\u2019re doing well already.\u201d\n\nToo many patients go to emergency rooms for simple problems that could be easily treated at such a clinic, he said, and a many are admitted for problems that were preventable. \u201cIf your goal is to advance the overall health of a population of patients, then you should be doing exactly what Group Health is doing,\u201d he said.\n\nHelen Neville, Bartell Drug\u2019s senior vice president of marketing, said her company, like Group Health, has long valued customer service. And customers were saying they wanted more options for convenient access to health care. \u201cThis is the right idea and the right partnership.\u201d\n\nThe clinics likely will be open the same hours as the in-store pharmacies, and decisions about expanding the program will be made after a six-month evaluation, the two companies said.\n\nIn early January, the partnership will launch www.care-clinic.org for more information.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "Anticipating the coming wave of patients under the Affordable Care Act, Group Health and Bartell Drugs are building three in-store, walk-in retail clinics in Seattle, Bellevue and Ballard.
