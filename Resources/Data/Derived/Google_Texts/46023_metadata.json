That all-time high figure could get worse as myriad oncoming problems come to life.\n\nAt the end of July, White House officials told Congress to expect more \u201cbumps\u201d during the coming 2015 enrollment period. The warning comes after a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that the Healthcare.gov website and all of its problems cost taxpayers $840 million \u2014 far more than it cost Apple to develop the iPhone.\n\nHowever, other observers foresaw this problem months ago. Information surfaced that enrollment data could be wrong for as many as 2 million applicants, a result of the back end of Healthcare.gov being left in disarray as the government scrambled to fix the front end amid last fall\u2019s crash.\n\nThus, subsidies could be at risk for millions of people, which could lead to higher premiums. The reports have made it clear that the problems that began last fall and have continued into 2014 and now the 2015 enrollment period go much deeper than just a failed website, and they will affect the very workings of the law and the millions of people stuck paying for it through higher taxes and higher premiums.\n\nNot long after the GAO report, National Journal reported that Obamacare enrollees could be shocked with \u201cthousands of dollars more\u201d in premiums for merely keeping the same plan they selected last time.\n\nEighty-five percent of enrollees are receiving subsidies, which are tied to a \u201cbenchmark\u201d plan. However, as new options enter the market, plans could \u201close their benchmark status to cheaper competitors.\u201d A new benchmark plan means subsidies based on the old benchmark do not go as far, potentially subjecting enrollees to thousands of dollars in premium increases.\n\nThe White House has already set up an \u201cauto-renewal\u201d process, making it easier for people to stick with the plan they have, rather than again having to deal with the Byzantine labyrinth of Healthcare.gov.\n\nOne analyst told National Journal, \u201cI would expect that probably the majority of 2014 enrollees are going to be impacted pretty substantially.\u201d\n\nThe multitude of factors that could significantly increase premiums is a far cry from President Obama\u2019s oft-repeated promise that Obamacare would \u201clower premiums by up to $2,500.\u201d\n\nFinally, the incredibly unpopular mandates \u2014 the backbone of the law \u2014 could be on thin ice. Democratic Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, who is up for re-election this fall, has asked the administration to delay the employer mandate once again. Mr. Obama has already failed twice to enforce it on time. Earlier this year, former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs predicted that the employer mandate would never go into effect.\n\nThe employer mandate could lead to several million more plan cancellations, despite the fact that Mr. Obama repeatedly promised that people could keep their plan if they liked it, which turned into 2013\u2019s \u201clie of the year\u201d after millions of individual market plans were nixed.\n\nIn addition, The Wall Street Journal reported that \u201calmost 90 percent of the nation\u2019s 30 million uninsured won\u2019t pay\u201d the individual-mandate tax as punishment for not having insurance. Despite the fact that the president promised he would \u201csign a universal health care bill into law that will cover every American,\u201d the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Obamacare would leave 30 million people without insurance a decade after implementation. Now, most won\u2019t pay any sort of fine, which was a cornerstone of the law.\n\nUltimately, Obamacare remains an unmitigated disaster. With the midterm elections approaching, many of those who once loudly backed the president\u2019s health care law aren\u2019t so keen to talk about it now. That\u2019s not surprising, given how many Americans are coping with a seemingly unending barrage of Obamacare\u2019s problems \u2014 and an ever-growing list of broken promises.\n\nAkash Chougule is a policy analyst at Americans for Prosperity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just as President Obama's health care law hits record unpopularity, multiple reports have surfaced of new problems that could plague Obamacare and cost Americans thousands of dollars each.", "Author": "Akash Chougule", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Just as President Obama\u2019s health care law hits record unpopularity, multiple reports have surfaced of new problems that could plague Obamacare and cost Americans thousands of dollars each.", "title": "CHOUGULE: Obamacare\u2019s backdoor premium hikes", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/13/chougule-obamacares-backdoor-premium-hikes/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/13/8_132014_b3-chou-money-wreck8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/13/8_132014_b3-chou-money-wreck8201.jpg", "title": "CHOUGULE: Obamacare\u2019s backdoor premium hikes", "description": "Just as President Obama's health care law hits record unpopularity, multiple reports have surfaced of new problems that could plague Obamacare and cost Americans thousands of dollars each.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfa9\"", "article_summary": "Eighty-five percent of enrollees are receiving subsidies, which are tied to a \u201cbenchmark\u201d plan.\nThat\u2019s not surprising, given how many Americans are coping with a seemingly unending barrage of Obamacare\u2019s problems \u2014 and an ever-growing list of broken promises.\nAt the end of July, White House officials told Congress to expect more \u201cbumps\u201d during the coming 2015 enrollment period.\nEarlier this year, former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs predicted that the employer mandate would never go into effect.\nThat all-time high figure could get worse as myriad oncoming problems come to life."}
