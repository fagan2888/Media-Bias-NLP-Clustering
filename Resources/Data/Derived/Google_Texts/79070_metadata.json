Why? They were pretending otherwise because in that way, they could portray Bibi Netanyahu, who actually gave an accurate assessment, as an alarmist, trying to stir up war or whatever, and to justify the long, drawn out negotiations that were renewed twice, even though the president had said we\u2019re going to give it six months and then we\u2019re going to heap on them more sanctions. The reason they are telling us now the truth, which they have known, as the Secretary of [Energy] is admitting right now\u2026the reason they\u2019re acknowledging now that it\u2019s short is also to serve their political purposes. They\u2019re on the verge of a deal. They want the deal. they want to say, \u2018look what we\u2019ve accomplished. We\u2019ve stretched the breakout from two months to a year,\u2019 and also to generate alarm to say, \u2018but we have to do this because the Iranians are so close to acquiring a bomb.\u2019\n\nHe continued, \u201cbut this shouldn\u2019t surprise us. With Obamacare, Obama said to everybody, \u2014 \u2018if you like your plan, you\u2019ll keep your plan.\u2019 They knew that would not be true. They assured Americans, if you liked what you had, you\u2019d be okay and then millions of plans were canceled. This [is an] administration that is determined to get a deal, and will not let the facts stand in the way.\u201d\n\nFellow panelist NPR National Political Correspondent Mara Liasson said that the Obama administration is now \u201con the same page\u201d as the Israelis regarding the status of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and are now being \u201cas truthful\u201d as Netanyahu.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Charles Krauthammer accused the Obama administration of \"deliberately deceiving the American people, and the Congress\" on Iran", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Charles Krauthammer accused the Obama administration of \"deliberately deceiving the American people, and the Congress\" on Iran", "title": "Krauthammer: WH Was 'Deliberately Deceiving' Public and Congress on Iran - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Krauthammer-421-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/04/21/krauthammer-wh-was-deliberately-deceiving-public-and-congress-on-iran/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Charles Krauthammer accused the Obama administration of \"deliberately deceiving the American people, and the Congress\" on Iran", "title": "Krauthammer: WH Was 'Deliberately Deceiving' Public and Congress on Iran - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Krauthammer-421-Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Charles Krauthammer, Iran, mara liasson,Breitbart TV, Middle East, Obama,Krauthammer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "mara liasson", "published_time": "2015-04-21T16:34:42-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Obama,Middle East"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde476\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERColumnist Charles Krauthammer stated the \u201cthe best explanation\u201d for the Obama administration keeping Iran\u2019s nuclear breakout time a secret is \u201d they were deliberately deceiving the American people, and the Congress\u201d on Tuesday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERKrauthammer said, \u201cthe only explanation, the best explanation surely, is they were deliberately deceiving the American people, and the Congress, of course, because they knew that they were only a few months away and pretended otherwise.\nThey assured Americans, if you liked what you had, you\u2019d be okay and then millions of plans were canceled.\nWith Obamacare, Obama said to everybody, \u2014 \u2018if you like your plan, you\u2019ll keep your plan.\u2019 They knew that would not be true.\nThe reason they are telling us now the truth, which they have known, as the Secretary of [Energy] is admitting right now\u2026the reason they\u2019re acknowledging now that it\u2019s short is also to serve their political purposes."}
