The Vermont \u201cSpirit of the ADA\u201d Award is given to employers who reflect the spirit of the Americans with Disabilities Act in their employment practices. Successfully meeting any of the following criteria qualifies employers for eligibility to be nominated:\n\nRecruitment outreach and equal accessibility in the application, interviewing, and hiring procedures for people with disabilities.\n\nUse of on-the-job accommodations, modifications, progressive employment methods, and/or creative solutions for successful training and employment of people with disabilities.\n\nAccessible physical structures, buildings, work stations and equipment, and services.\n\nSupport for the employment of a person(s) with disability as an overall employment strategy.\n\nThe following employers have been recognized for the promotion of hiring and retaining of people with disabilities:\n\nBarbara Barber, Label Shopper \u2013 Bennington\n\nBetsy Bailey, Little Dippers Doodle Children\u2019s Center \u2013 St. Johnsbury\n\nSandra Kuc, Vermonsters Childcare and Learning Center \u2013 Rutland\n\nExecutive Chef Ray Wood, Capitol Food Court (The Abbey Group) \u2013 Montpelier\n\nSimon Labranche and JP Labranche, Labranche Lumber Company \u2013 Newport\n\nHolly Laber, Green Mountain Electric Supply \u2013 Colchester\n\nNeomi Campbell, Springfield Food Co-op \u2013 Springfield\n\nMike Rainville, Maple Landmark Woodcraft \u2013 Middlebury\n\nMichael Underwood, Walmart \u2013 St. Albans\n\nMatt Farnham, Hannaford Food & Drug \u2013 Morrisville\n\nCarolyn Stoughton, The Gathering Place \u2013 Brattleboro\n\nFedEx Ground \u2013 White River Junction, VT/West Lebanon, NH\n\nEvery day, people with disabilities can and do add value to America\u2019s workplaces. However, in both good economic times and bad, people with disabilities have far fewer job opportunities than the general population. The goal of the GCEPD is to promote the hiring, retention and advancement of people with disabilities and dispel negative stereotypes about disability and employment. The employers who are recognized for this award have been exemplary in their employment of people with disabilities, and the employees have been successful contributors to their respective organizations.\n\nThe GCEPD and VOCREHAB VERMONT will also be participating in radio shows to recognize the National Disability Employment Awareness Month, promoting noteworthy employment practices, resources and employers of distinction that have won the \u201cSpirit of the ADA\u201d Awards on our website \u2013 HYPERLINK \u201chttp://www.hireus.org\u201d www.hireus.org. We will also conduct broad outreach through the electronic distribution of our newsletter, \u201cAbilities\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the progress that has been made by Vermont employers in the hiring of people with disabilities. The Spirit of the ADA Awards will recognize some of these employers. We will also continue our education and outreach efforts to increase the employment outcomes for Vermonters of ALL abilities and to help employers gain awareness of this valuable resource pool for employment,\u201d said Christopher J. Loso, Chair of the Vermont GCEPD and Vice President of Loso\u2019s Professional Janitorial Services, Inc. \u201cMy company has been employing people with disabilities for the past four years as part of our overall recruitment efforts and they have made a tremendous impact with their quality of work. They should be seriously considered by employers across Vermont looking for skilled and motivated employees. It makes perfect business sense.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the GCEPD will be giving a special recognition award to Vermont State Representative Bill Botzow, Chair of the House Commerce and Economic Development Committee for his work over many years attempting to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities. GCEPD is further recognizing Representative Botzow for his work promoting such necessary complements to employment as accessible transportation; affordable, accessible and integrated housing; and suitable educational opportunities. The 2015 legislative session brought some of these goals to fruition with Representative Botzow\u2019s leadership. During the past session, Representative Botzow\u2019s committee spearheaded legislation which will enhance employment incentives within the Medicaid for Working Persons with Disabilities (MWPD) Program and which will create ABLE Act accounts, allowing people with disabilities to establish tax-free accounts to use for necessities related to disability. In both cases, independent living, self-sufficiency and socioeconomic productivity should increase and reliance upon entitlements decrease, improving short and long-term prospects for all Vermonters.\n\n\u201cThe GCEPD is pleased and honored to recognize Representative Botzow for his tireless efforts to improve opportunities for people with disabilities, particularly with regard to employment. He has always understood that we are talking about \u2018workforce development\u2019 and that our efforts are directed toward the benefit of all Vermonters. We are moving away from handouts and patronization and toward inclusion and productivity,\u201d stated Sam Liss, member of the GCEPD.\n\nAbout the Vermont GCEPD\n\nThe Governor\u2019s Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities (GCEPD) is a permanent statewide committee established in 1963 by the Vermont legislature to promote the employment of people with disabilities. Its 23 members represent a broad cross section of individuals from business, disability groups, government, and service providers. Through education and outreach activities it provides support and resources to employers and job seekers to facilitate the employment and accommodation of people of all abilities.\n\nAbout National Disability Employment Awareness Month\n\nHeld each October, National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) is a national campaign that raises awareness about disability employment issues and celebrates the many and varied contributions of America\u2019s workers with disabilities. The theme for 2015 is \u201cMy Disability Is One Part of Who I Am.\u201d\n\nNDEAM\u2019s roots go back to 1945, when Congress enacted a law declaring the first week in October each year \u201cNational Employ the Physically Handicapped Week.\u201d In 1988, Congress expanded the week to a month and changed the name to \u201cNational Disability Employment Awareness Month.\u201d Upon its establishment in 2001, ODEP assumed responsibility for NDEAM and has worked to expand its reach and scope ever since. For more information about NDEAM, including specific ideas for how different types of organizations can participate, visit www.dol.gov/odep/ and select \u201cNational Disability Employment Awareness Month\u201d from the drop-down menu.
