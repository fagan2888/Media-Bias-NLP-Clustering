California Resources Corporation (CRC) – formerly Vintage Petroleum – has agreed to pay $200,000 in penalties, costs and restitution, stemming from spills of oil and produced water into streams and dry waterways, from various facilities that the company operates in Ventura County. The company violated state law prohibiting the release of petroleum and related products into “waters of the state.”

Ventura County District Attorney (VCDA) Gregory Totten announced this week the payment was part of a settlement involving “seven distinct spill events” that occurred between March 2011 and August 2014. The spills occurred in Willard Canyon, Tripas Canyon Creek, Ice Box Canyon, Lyons Creek (in the Ojai Fee lease, near Sulphur Mountain), Amphitheatre Creek and Javon Creek. Another spill occurred in an unnamed dry tributary to the Ventura River. Javon and Amphitheatre creeks are dry tributaries to the Pacific Ocean. And according to the Office of Spill Prevention and Response (OSPR) the Ice Box Canyon spill in 2013 involved an estimated less than one gallon of crude oil reaching the Pacific Ocean, after 84 gallons of crude leaked from a corroded pipe. The oil overflowed a containment area to reach the Pacific.

“Anytime there is a spill of oil to water, they must inform the Office of Emergency Management (OEM), ” said Christopher Harmon, senior deputy with Totten's office. Harmon said when the spills are reported, wardens from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) will arrive on scene to investigate and oversee cleanup, or the special division, OSPR will supervise. The VCDA learned of the spills from DFW.
