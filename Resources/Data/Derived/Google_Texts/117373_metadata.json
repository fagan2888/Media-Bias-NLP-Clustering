Patients had visited their doctor as the result of a persistent cough that lasted from two to eight weeks. Pertussis infections were confirmed through laboratory testing of oral fluid and six of the patients had their cough frequency monitored for 24 hours via wearable automated devices.\n\nOut of the 279 children, 56 displayed evidence of a recent pertussis infection, including 39 who had not received their full whooping cough vaccination. Four out of the six children given wearable automated devices coughed over 400 times in 24 hours. Children who received their preschool pertussis booster vaccine over seven years prior to visiting their doctor with a persistent cough were three times more likely to be diagnosed with a pertussis infection.\n\nBefore the UK introduced the preschool pertussis booster vaccination in 2001, signs of a pertussis infection could be found in 40 percent of school-age children who visited a primary care physician to be treated for a persistent cough. Researchers hope the findings from their study will help inform future decisions regarding the need for adolescent booster vaccinations in the UK.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whooping cough is a serious illness that affects infants, children, and adults that can turn life-threatening, especially in infants. A total of 48,277 cases of pertussis were reported in the United States in 2012. An estimated 16 million pertussis cases are reported around the world each year, resulting in 195,000 deaths.\n\nSource: Fry N, Campbell H, Wang K, et al.
