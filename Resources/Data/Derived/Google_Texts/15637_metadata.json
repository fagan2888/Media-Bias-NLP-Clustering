Frye, the deputy assistant secretary for acquisition and logistics at the VA, said that since the department isn\u2019t following procurement rules, \u201cDoors are swung wide open for fraud, waste and abuse. \u201cI can state without reservation that VA has and continues to waste millions of dollars by paying excessive prices for goods and services due to breaches of Federal laws.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Latest Outrage from Veterans Affairs\n\nThe memo, which referred to a \u201cculture of lawlessness and chaos,\u201d was sent to VA Secretary Bob McDonald in March. It details specific ways the agency has violated federal procurement laws, including the excessive use of government charge cards to purchase billions of dollars worth of medical supplies\u2014instead of using contracts. Federal charge cards are meant to make it easier for the government to make smaller purchases\u2014on items under $3,000. But in one case, a VA employee charged up to $1.2 billion for prosthetics.\n\nBy not engaging in the competitive bidding process, the VA isn\u2019t getting the highest-quality of treatment or supplies for the best price available, the memo said.\n\n\u201cThese unlawful acts may potentially result in serious harm or death to America\u2019s veterans,\u201d Frye wrote. \u201cCollectively, I believe they serve to decay the entire VA health-care system.\n\nVA spokesperson Victoria Dillon told the Post that some care isn\u2019t covered under the federal acquisition laws because the department outsources it to deal with increasing demand.\n\nRelated: POGO Blows the Lid Off Veterans Affairs Scandal\n\nIn response to revelations last year of hidden wait times and cover-ups at VA facilities across the country, Congress approved a $16 billion VA reform package that included new funding for more facilities and doctors. It also allowed vets to get treatment paid for by the VA through outside hospitals.\n\nAccording to Dillon\u2019s statement, authorizations for outside medical care jumped 46 percent in the first four months of the year.\n\nStill, Frye\u2019s memo suggests that the procurement issues predate last year\u2019s scandal and subsequent reform bill.\n\nAnd while the VA is getting slammed for its procurement practices, the department\u2019s inspector general released a separate report raising issues over the VA\u2019s conference spending.\n\nThe auditors said that last year the VA understated how much it spent on two human resources conferences in Orlando, Fla. The agency reported that it spent $5 million, but the IG said the actual cost was about $6.1 million. The report also said that VA employees planning the conferences improperly accepted gifts including room upgrades, meals, limousine services, golf, spa services, helicopter rides and tickets for the Rockettes.\n\nThe memo and IG reports come as the VA is desperately trying to repair its tarnished image. And though the department\u2019s chief says it\u2019s on the road to reform, the latest findings reveal it still has a long way to go.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The embattled Department of Veterans Affairs is under new scrutiny after an internal d", "title": "VA Spent $6 Billion Improperly in \u2018Culture of Lawlessness and Chaos\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/14/VA-Spent-6-Billion-Improperly-Culture-Lawlessness-and-Chaos", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/05292014_VA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/14/VA-Spent-6-Billion-Improperly-Culture-Lawlessness-and-Chaos", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/05292014_VA.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The embattled Department of Veterans Affairs is under new scrutiny after an internal d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ad9\"", "article_summary": "By not engaging in the competitive bidding process, the VA isn\u2019t getting the highest-quality of treatment or supplies for the best price available, the memo said.\nThe auditors said that last year the VA understated how much it spent on two human resources conferences in Orlando, Fla.\nThe memo and IG reports come as the VA is desperately trying to repair its tarnished image.\nBut in one case, a VA employee charged up to $1.2 billion for prosthetics.\nIt details specific ways the agency has violated federal procurement laws, including the excessive use of government charge cards to purchase billions of dollars worth of medical supplies\u2014instead of using contracts."}
