No one can take it across state lines. And smoking of marijuana is not permitted in public, something that the Colorado ski industry is taking pains to point out.\n\nAs many as 30 medical marijuana dispensaries in eight Colorado towns that have approved the retail sale of marijuana are bracing for what they expect will be a booming business on what\u2019s being called \u201cGreen Wednesday\u201d in Colorado.\n\n\u201cSome interesting stuff out there,\u201d Ricardo Baca, the marijuana editor for the Denver Post told Here & Now\u2019s Robin Young. \u201cLines around the block, lines around the corner. We haven\u2019t run into much overnight camping. As one person just told me outside a shop called City Med\u2026 \u2018It\u2019s all smiles here.'\u201d\n\nBaca says that while people are eagerly buying, the law is very strict regarding where marijuana can be used.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s illegal to ingest the product anywhere in public,\u201d Baca said. \u201cThe ski resorts are an even more serious issue, because so many of the resorts occupy federal land.\u201d\n\nAndy Williams, co-owner of Medicine Man Denver, described business today as \u201cabsolutely phenomenal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real group sense of relief, you really feel it on people out there,\u201d Williams told Here & Now\u2019s Meghna Chakrabarti. \u201cThey\u2019re finally free of breaking the law to do something that they love to do. People don\u2019t like to break the law, and they don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nMedicine Mann Denver is one of the few outlets in Colorado that will be selling pot for recreational use to people over 21. The store had already been dispensing medical marijuana since 2010.\n\nTo meet demand, the dispensary is in the process of doubling its growing capacity to 40,000 square feet.\n\n\u201cI welcome this industry to keep growing,\u201d Williams said. \u201cA strong industry in Colorado that is well-managed and well-enforced is going to mean that other states are going to see the great things we are doing here.\u201d\n\nGuests", "article_metadata": {"description": "Colorado becomes the first state to allow recreational marijuana use.
