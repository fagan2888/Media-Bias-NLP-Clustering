The concept, promoted by consulting engineer Robert Pyke, would offer as much water as the tunnel scheme pushed by Gov. Jerry Brown, could be built sooner and at a fraction of the cost of the tunnels, the farmers say. The governor\u0092s tunnels are the heart of the so-called \u0093Bay Delta Conservation Plan.\u0094 If built, each would be 40 feet in diameter and be buried 150 feet deep for a 35-mile run to the state and federal irrigation projects\u0092 pumping plants near Tracy. They would siphon off fresh water from the Sacramento River before it could flow naturally into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. After Mr. Pyke detailed his idea recently at a meeting in Clarksburg, three prominent Delta businessmen enthusiastically endorsed his alternative and urged everyone to get on the Pyke Western Delta Intake Concept \u0093bus\u0094 instead of the Bay Delta Conservation Plan \u0093bus.\u0094 \u0093Right now we have a bus at the curb at the Capitol,\u0094 began Courtland\u0092s Steamboat Acres pear farmer Tim Neuharth. \u0093It\u0092s a big bus. It\u0092s the only bus. The door is wide open in the front. The door is wide open in the middle. On the marquee it says BDCP. It\u0092s the only vehicle at the curb that we have to work with. There needs to be another \u0091bus\u0092 at the curb so that there is an alternative. My opinion is Robert Pyke\u0092s plan is the alternative.\u0094 Another endorser who spoke was Sean Doherty Sr., a lobbyist in Sacramento, who with former California Assemblyman Bill Berryhill, has formed Citizens Coalition for Delta Protection. They recently added Mr. Pyke to their board of directors. Mr. Doherty told the Clarksburg audience that the polling is not good on the Bay Delta Conservation Plan. \u0093It\u0092s at 56 percent right now,\u0094 he said. \u0093Anyone who is involved in politics will tell you that in order for a tax initiative to pass, you need to go into the election with 65 percent. And if the BDCP is mentioned in the water bond, it fails at 70 percent.\u0094 Could the governor be about to make a big announcement? Mr. Doherty, who said he and Mr. Berryhill have been discussing Mr. Pyke\u0092s alternative plan with key legislators in Sacramento, said to look for the governor to make an announcement about the twin tunnels and a water bond in the next two weeks. \u0093We know it is coming,\u0094 said Mr. Doherty. \u0093We have an idea of what he\u0092s going to say and it will be fairly significant about the BDCP. \u0093If the BDCP falls, and we don\u0092t present an alternative, and we believe the alternative is the Western Delta Intake, the BDCP will come up with some other monster that will destroy the Delta. This plan makes perfect sense. And it needs all the support that you can get. If we can fund phase one [to do a scientific study of Mr. Pyke\u0092s WDIC], Bill Berryhill and I are convinced that we can get the additional funding through legislative action by the State Legislature,\u0094 Mr. Doherty said. He said the amount needed would be about $850,000. \u0093The study is needed to show this is a viable alternative and needs to be pursued.\u0094 The Pyke plan in bulletpoints The following are the proposed benefits of going with Mr. Pyke\u0092s WDIC plan: \u0095 The WDIC would be located on Sherman Island on the south end of Sacramento County. Sherman Island is now mostly owned by the state of California. \u0095 All waters (rivers, streams, island pump outs, run-off, etc.) must pass through the Delta to the WDIC site. \u0095 Due to all of the water passing through the Delta, money for Delta infrastructure will remain in the Delta \u0095 WDIC is half the distance to the state and federal pumping stations, meaning a huge reduction in construction costs and mitigation costs \u0095 WDIC\u0092s permeable embankments are far more efficient and effective than other fish screen proposals, which are ineffective or unproven \u0095 Due to all waters passing through the Delta and the inclusion of additional storage, which allows true \u0093Big Gulp-Little Gulp operation,\u0094 southern water users would receive more water over the long haul versus BDCP\u0092s proposal. \u0095 WDIC is self-regulating; meaning over-pumping of water at any time will result in too much brackish (salt) water. The pumps must be turned down or shut off as a result of too much brackish water. Other benefits, according to Mr. Pyke\u0092s presentation: \u0095 Costs 50 percent less than the BDCP \u0095 Provides flood control benefits \u0095 Helps retard saltwater intrusion \u0095 Reduces traffic delays on Highway 160 \u0095 Restores more natural flow patterns \u0095 Ensures reasonable, minimum outflows \u0095 Creates new habitat where it is most useful at and off the western end of Sherman Island, close to the mixing zone \u0095 Adds shaded riparian habitat along Sherman Island and other islands improved to the \u0093fat levee\u0094 standard in accordance with the ESP of the Delta Protection Commission. The WDIC plan proposes additional south-of-the-Delta storage, much of it likely as groundwater, but also perhaps including new Westside storage. During periods of very high flow, the new intakes and the existing South Bay intakes, with fish screens along the Old River, could be used simultaneously. The WDIC also recommends, to maintain South Delta water quality, there would be lined canals to recirculate water from the aqueducts to the San Joaquin River as necessary. \u0093What I\u0092m proposing,\u0094 said Mr. Neuharth, \u0093is that this (North Delta CARES) group and others like it step up to the plate and be on the offensive instead of the defensive. This is a war! This is a war for your homes, your farms, your properties, and your businesses. If we don\u0092t get on the offensive, the BDCP will roll over the top of you. And I\u0092m not an advocate saying \u0091You can\u0092t take any water out of the Delta.\u0092 There are wet years where there is water they can take out of the Delta \u0097 but not in this particular (Sacramento River) location. It needs to be after it has passed through the Delta.\u0094 Mr. Neuharth said it is a good time to push Mr. Pyke\u0092s plan forward because \u0093the BDCP is wavering.\u0094 \u0093They\u0092re getting knocked around pretty good. So when your enemy steps back, you advance. You don\u0092t step back and let them regroup. You hit them hard and go after them. BDCP and company has put a tremendous amount of effort into science and marketing. They have a lot of people in this state and back in Washington aware and thinking we have this huge problem that the levees are going to collapse and blah, blah, blah,\u0094 he said. \u0093So why not piggy back off that? Right now, why not get this study done and piggy back on all this publicity and use it to our advantage?\u0094 Mr. Neuharth said the next step is to find or create a 501C organization that could be a depository for the initial $250,000 needed to fund Mr. Pyke\u0092s study to get credibility. Mr. Doherty said his organization is working on that but presently it is a 501C4 for advocacy and lobbying, but allows for contributions that can be deducted as a business expense. The third Delta businessman who endorsed the plan at the Clarksburg meeting was Bill Wells, the executive director of the Delta Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau and a columnist for the Bay Delta Yachtsman magazine, who has held a seat on the BDCP as a Delta representative. \u0093Bob\u0092s an absolute genius,\u0094 said Mr. Wells, \u0093and one of the top 10 smartest people I\u0092ve ever met in my life. \u0093When you talk to Bob, you get straight answers. When you talk to guys like Jerry Meral [former head of the BDCP], he was a master of double-talk,\u0092 said Mr. Wells. \u0093I know Bob does a lot on his own dime just because he knows right from wrong.\u0094 You can watch the video of Robert Pyke\u0092s complete presentation with slide graphics, plus the comments of farmer Tim Neuharth, Sean Doherty and Bill Wells in the other videos here: Dr. Robert Pyke provides history of CA water supply and details on his Western Delta Intake Concept (WDIC) from Gene Beley on Vimeo.

But it does not do ONE BIG THING -- improve fish runs to the Bay Delta and improve the large ecology of the Delta. To do that would conceptually require some sort of interchange where fresh river water could flow to the sea and Delta water could still flow south (or west under Pyke's proposal) to convey water to Central Valley farms and southern cities. The only way to do that is to keep the fish flows on the ground surface and separate the water conveyances for farms and cities in a subsurface pipe. So we are right back to the tunnel concept. Anybody can come up with a better and cheaper plan than the Twin Tunnels when fish flows do not have to be considered. The original Peripheral Canal would still be much cheaper but it also doesn't do much for fish flows. There are many cheaper alternatives to the tunnels but the environmentalist will hold any alternative plan hostage to their dream of a fish only river. Dream on about a cheaper alternative.\n\n\n\nRobert Pyke 6/23/14 1:59 PM\n\nWayne Lusvardi is out-to-lunch on this one. Wayne, I know my talk and hence the video are quite long, but if you actually watch the video you will see that the WDIC does multiple positive things to improve the Bay-Delta ecosystem and the prospects for native aquatic species.\n\n\n\nChris Gulick 6/23/14 2:36 PM\n\nGene , you can add me to the list of WDIC proponents. I have known Dr. Pyke for some time now and have long been familiar with the concept he is proposing. I highly doubt it will ever be built given it's inability to be gamed, but, I certainly think it is a viable alternative. As opposed to what Mr. Lusvardi might have you believe the BDCP / tunnel plan does not improve or increase the net positive outflow from the Delta. Arguing that the WDIC doesn't either is a little odd at best. Perhaps Mr. Lusvardi could share his logic on this ? Could it be that the co equal goals are not so equal ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "California, Central Valley, business, San Joaquin Valley, Great Central Valley, news, urban sprawl, rural, real estate, housing, farming, dairy, agribusiness, cotton, oil, gasoline, ethanol, biodiesel, alternative fuels, prices, Kern, Tulare, Kings, Fresno, Madera, Merced, Mariposa, Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Stockton, Modesto, Merced, Visalia, Portervile, Bakersfield, Schwarzenegger", "distribution": "global", "description": "Central Valley Business Times.
