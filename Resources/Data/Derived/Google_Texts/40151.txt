Some political analysts say Donald Trump's inflammatory statements on any number of topics may eventually be his campaign's undoing.

But don't tell that to the many supporters who are attracted to the Republican front-runner specifically because he shoots from the lip.

For years, conservatives have decried political correctness as a scourge of orthodox beliefs and language, imposed by liberals - and they say it keeps people from voicing uncomfortable truths.

Now, some Trump supporters applaud him for not being afraid to make noise about the things that anger them but that they feel discouraged from saying out loud.
