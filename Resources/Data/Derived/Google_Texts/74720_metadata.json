Chris Christie\u2019s plan for getting past \u201cBridgegate\u201d was to simply get past it. As soon as the emails showing that his aides and allies purposefully created traffic congestion as part of some sort of retribution plot were reported in the press, Christie fired aide Bridget Kelly and Port Authority executive David Wildstein. After taking a day to compose himself (or get his story straight), he held an epic press conference at which he spoke until he could plausibly argue that he had answered every single question reporters had for him. Since then he\u2019s mainly appeared before (suspiciously) friendly town hall audiences. He seems to think he\u2019s done enough to get past the worst of it. Yesterday, Christie told a reporter, \u201cYou folks are the only people at the moment who are asking me about this.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Kelly and Wildstein are also still talking. They are communicating with us from the distant past (a few months ago) thanks to Wildstein\u2019s very helpful cooperation with New Jersey state legislators investigating the scandal. Wildstein \u2014 who has a reputation for being \u201ccapable of anything\u201d \u2014 looks to be working to undermine his former ally with a steady stream of documents. The most recent batch include a return of the headline-friendly \u201ctraffic problems\u201d line.\n\nKelly and Wildstein were texting last August about prominent New Jersey Rabbi Mendy Carlebach. Carlebach \u2014 not exactly a liberal, as he was a chaplain at the 2004 and 2008 Republican National Conventions \u2014 had somehow pissed Wildstein off, though it\u2019s unclear how. (Carlebach claims to have no idea what he could\u2019ve done.) And what do Christie\u2019s allies do to people who piss them off? Exactly. Here are the messages, from the Bergen Record (via TPM):\n\nIn the texts about the chaplain, Wildstein sent Kelly a picture of Rabbi Mendy Carlebach, later writing: \u201cAnd he has officially pissed me off.\u201d \u201cClearly,\u201d Kelly responded on Aug. 19. \u201cWe cannot cause traffic problems in front of his house, can we?\u201d Kelly wrote. \u201cFlights to Tel Aviv all mysteriously delayed,\u201d wrote Wildstein, an executive at the bi-state agency that controls the region\u2019s airports. \u201cPerfect,\u201d Kelly wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Christie tries to hang on, new documents show his allies threatening more \"traffic problems\"", "author": "Alex Pareene", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As Christie tries to hang on, new documents show his allies threatening more \"traffic problems\"", "title": "Chris Christie having trouble moving on from that bridge thing", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/27/chris_christie_having_trouble_moving_on_from_that_bridge_thing/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/chris_christie11.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Christie tries to hang on, new documents show his allies threatening more \"traffic problems\"", "creator": "@pareene", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/chris_christie11.jpg", "title": "Chris Christie having trouble moving on from that bridge thing", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Chris Christie having trouble moving on from that bridge thing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bridgegate, Chris Christie, David Wildstein, New Jersey", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf56d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFlights to Tel Aviv all mysteriously delayed,\u201d wrote Wildstein, an executive at the bi-state agency that controls the region\u2019s airports.\nTopics: Bridgegate, Chris Christie, David Wildstein, New Jersey, Politics NewsNew Jersey Gov.\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d Kelly wrote.\n\u201cWe cannot cause traffic problems in front of his house, can we?\u201d Kelly wrote.\nThe most recent batch include a return of the headline-friendly \u201ctraffic problems\u201d line."}
