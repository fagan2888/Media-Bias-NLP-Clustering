Dan Schmidt, D-Moscow, said Friday. \u201cAt least it\u2019s written down. People can look at the numbers, look at the proposals. They\u2019ll be public record. They can compare.\u201d\n\nMost Idaho legislation requires a committee vote even to be introduced, but individual lawmakers can propose personal bills without committee votes in the early weeks of each year\u2019s legislative session. Schmidt\u2019s two bills were filed on the final day of that period.\n\nGov. Butch Otter convened several task forces in recent years that all recommended expanding Medicaid \u2013 an option for states under the federal Affordable Care Act. Such expansion would serve the estimated 78,000 people in Idaho who fall into a coverage gap, earning too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to qualify for subsidized health insurance under the state exchange.\n\nBut state lawmakers who want no part of Obamacare have been unwilling to consider the move.\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s bill is going to be out there and it\u2019ll have numbers, and people can look at that,\u201d said Schmidt, referring to Otter\u2019s proposal for a state-funded $30 million \u201cPrimary Care Access Program,\u201d which would provide some limited primary and preventive care to the uninsured.\n\nInstead of costing the state $30 million, Medicaid expansion would save state taxpayers millions, because the federal government would cover nearly all its costs and the state would no longer need to spend millions on a catastrophic care program for people with unpaid medical bills.\n\nIn a guest opinion sent out to Idaho newspapers this week, Otter wrote that his Primary Care Access Program, or something like it, \u201cis all that we can reasonably hope to achieve right now in the context of Idaho\u2019s political environment.\u201d\n\nBut Schmidt said he disagrees.\n\n\u201cI think the majority party is trying to portray that there aren\u2019t some choices, and that\u2019s how the governor has framed this \u2013 that this is his only choice.\u201d\n\nSchmidt\u2019s two bills include one that would enact the \u201cHealthy Idaho Plan,\u201d a proposal from Otter\u2019s latest task force that would expand Medicaid for those who make up to 100 percent of the federal poverty level, then use federal Medicaid expansion funds to purchase private insurance through the state exchange for those who make up to 138 percent of the poverty level.\n\nLast year, 54,000 Idahoans applied for coverage through the exchange but were turned away because their incomes were too low to qualify.\n\nSchmidt\u2019s other bill would follow the recommendation of Otter\u2019s first task force, expanding Medicaid to the full extent allowed by law \u2013 to adults earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level.\n\n\u201cThat will save Idahoans the most money,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cIt\u2019ll have the most impact on the general fund.\u201d\n\nSchmidt said the latest estimates show the Healthy Idaho Plan would save Idaho $28.4 million next year. The full-expansion option would save $44.3 million.\n\nSchmidt said this is the first time in his six years in the Senate that he\u2019s filed a personal bill.\n\n\u201cWhen I first got elected, my goal was to work with the majority party, and talk about policy issues and try to foster a healthy discussion for moving Idaho forward,\u201d he said.\n\nSchmidt has made his mark on the Legislature\u2019s joint budget committee by working closely with some of the panel\u2019s most conservative GOP members on compromise funding proposals for the state\u2019s health and human services programs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving up,\u201d he said. \u201cI still believe people can, and do, even in this body, change their minds pretty quickly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two bills to expand Medicaid in Idaho were introduced in the Idaho Senate on Friday, both as personal bills filed by Sen.
