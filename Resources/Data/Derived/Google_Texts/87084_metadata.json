The judge sent them back to the jury room with instructions to keep trying to reach a unanimous verdict.\n\n\"Although it may seem like an eternity, it has only been three and a half days of deliberations,\" Robreno told them.\n\nThe jury ended their deliberations for the day less than two hours later without a verdict. They are due back for more discussion Wednesday morning.\n\nOfficers Thomas Liciardello, Brian Reynolds, Michael Spicer, Perry Betts, Linwood Norman and John Speiser each face charges of racketeering conspiracy, civil rights violations, robbery and filing false reports.\n\nProsecutors say the officers - all members of the Police Department's Narcotics Field Unit - routinely roughed up drug suspects, pocketed seized money and lied on official police reports to cover up their crimes.\n\nThe officers have denied the charges.\n\njroebuck@phillynews.com\n\n215-854-2608 @jeremyrroebuck", "article_metadata": {"contenttype": "Article", "publication": "Philadelphia Inquirer", "pubdate": 20160527, "title": "Jurors in narcotics officers' corruption trial say they are at an impasse", "og": {"site_name": "Philly.com", "description": "Federal jurors deliberating the fate of six members of an elite Philadelphia narcotics squad declared Tuesday that they were at \"an impasse on one or more counts.\"", "title": "Jurors in narcotics officers' corruption trial say they are at an impasse", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20150513_Jurors_in_narcotics_officers__corruption_trial_say_they_are_at_an_impasse.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/copsphoto600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentid": 303495121, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20150513_Jurors_in_narcotics_officers__corruption_trial_say_they_are_at_an_impasse.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/copsphoto600.jpg", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jurors in narcotics officers' corruption trial say they are at an impasse"}, "cg": "news", "fb": {"app_id": 938226082960499}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-12T15:24:49-04:00", "editdate": "20150512T15:24:49", "searchdate": "2015-05-12", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "db3T5L3C8_JvO-55gJ22lGGUnZLlNulgzTwX1NhCV3o", "verify-v1": "3x82DC93LZlv0I/hQEBoyVVjlGPtX7VxHFgv1upr+9I=", "y_key": "ccf0cd67e5f1e33c", "livedate": "20150512T15:24:49", "sourcepublication": "Inquirer", "description": "Federal jurors deliberating the fate of six members of an elite Philadelphia narcotics squad declared Tuesday that they were at \"an impasse on one or more counts.\""}, "article_summary": "Undated photos, from top left to right, show Philadelphia Police officers Thomas Liciardello, Perry Betts, Linwood Norman and from bottom left to right, Brian Reynolds, John Speiser and Michael Spicer.\nOfficers Thomas Liciardello, Brian Reynolds, Michael Spicer, Perry Betts, Linwood Norman and John Speiser each face charges of racketeering conspiracy, civil rights violations, robbery and filing false reports.\n(Philadelphia Police Department )Undated photos, from top left to right, show Philadelphia Police officers Thomas Liciardello, Perry Betts, Linwood Norman and from bottom left to right, Brian Reynolds, John Speiser and Michael Spicer.\n(Philadelphia Police Department )Federal jurors deliberating the fate of six members of an elite Philadelphia narcotics squad said Tuesday that they were at \"an impasse on one or more counts.\"\nProsecutors say the officers - all members of the Police Department's Narcotics Field Unit - routinely roughed up drug suspects, pocketed seized money and lied on official police reports to cover up their crimes."}
