Christopher Stevens, and wounded a number of others. It also caused a political firestorm when the White House blamed the attack on an anti-Islam video made in the United States, which was later proven not to be the case.\n\nRelated: Release of Benghazi Report Won\u2019t Slow New Investigation\n\nIn a midterm election year, there is money to be made (and controversy to stir up) from a new book written by those who were on the ground, tasked with defending the compound against America\u2019s enemies \u2013 and who want to get their side of things out.\n\n13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi is written by a journalism professor at Boston University, Mitchell Zuckoff, along with the Annex Security Team \u2013 the six CIA contract operators who responded to the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks. The operators\u2019 palpable frustration about what happened once the compound was under attack by terrorists just about pops off the pages of the book.\n\nThe operators claim vigorously in 13 Hours that they were told by the CIA chief in charge to \u201cwait,\u201d \u201cstand down\u201d and \u201chold up\u201d essentially while people figured out what to do and tried to coordinate with the local militia and others once the attack had occurred. This, of course, has all come out before and is not new to this telling.\n\nRelated: New Benghazi Emails Could Derail Hillary in 2016\n\nBut here is the new immediacy: Right after Ambassador Stevens wrote a line in his diary that night referencing the \"never ending security threats\" in the area, the consulate was suddenly \u201coverrun\u201d by several dozen men \u201cchanting in Arabic and firing AK-47s into the air,\u201d the book recounts.\n\nThey \u201cswarmed through the pedestrian entrance at the compound\u2019s main gate. Eventually their numbers swelled to more than sixty\u2026 A few hid their faces with scarves, but most didn\u2019t\u2026. One thing was certain: They displayed a common desire to terrorize Americans at the Special Mission Compound. Or worse.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic terrorists, likely members of an al-Qaeda branch, set fire to the compound and began to invade the ambassador\u2019s residential villa by blowing open the wooden front doors with what\u2019s presumed to be a rocket-propelled grenade.\n\nMoving further in, the marauders doused the interior with diesel fuel and set it on fire \u2013 trapping the three men who were hiding in the darkness of the interior\u2019s safe haven: agent in charge Scott Wickland, Ambassador Stevens and communications expert Sean Smith of the State Department.\n\nRelated: House Intel Committee Reveals Benghazi Findings\n\nLethal black smoke quickly enveloped the interior and though Wickland tried to lead Stevens and Smith to safety and fresh air, according to the book, he eventually lost the two men in the smoke and chaos. Despite numerous attempts to find them, he ultimately made his way out, barely conscious and suffering from smoke inhalation. He managed to radio fellow agents for help.\n\n\u201cAfter making the call, Wickland collapsed on the rooftop,\u201d the book says.\n\nWith the compound under attack, no coordinated effort to help or save the Americans seemed to be under way \u2013 or if it was, it was not communicated to those hired to protect it, the book suggests. So the members of the Annex\u2019s security team decided to take matters into their own hands. \u201cThe operators\u2019 only option was to act,\u201d the book says.\n\nThey zoomed off to the burning and compromised residence, finally locating the body of Sean Smith \u2013 and took heavy fire on their way out without having located Ambassador Stevens. The tale proceeds apace as the operators continued to battle against a second attack by the terrorists at Benghazi as the awful night turned into morning and the attackers finally receded.\n\nRelated: Benghazi Attack Could Have Been Prevented - Senate Report\n\nThe book succeeds in its blow-by-blow retelling; but this account requires readers to believe and trust fully in the narrators\u2019 point of view, since it\u2019s impossible to know what they\u2019re leaving out.\n\nThe writers say their book \u201cis not intended to support or satisfy one side or the other in resolving the controversies that remain. By telling their story, the Benghazi operators hope that the battle and their actions will be understood on their own terms, outside of partisan or political interests.\u201d\n\nMany uncertainties remain, of course, about what happened in Benghazi, chiefly whether the White House manipulated its messaging of the events for political reasons. What\u2019s clear from multiple accounts, including this one, is this: Security was lacking. Coordination seemed uncertain. Communication wasn\u2019t strong. Lives were lost.\n\nIf you believe this new account, there was also a fierce defense of American interests by those charged with that nearly impossible task two years ago.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Despite numerous congressional investigations into the attack on the American consulat", "title": "What Really Happened in Benghazi on 9/11/2012", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/07/What-Really-Happened-Benghazi-9112012", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/Benghazi%20U.S.%20Consulate%20in%20Flames.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/07/What-Really-Happened-Benghazi-9112012", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/Benghazi%20U.S.%20Consulate%20in%20Flames.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Despite numerous congressional investigations into the attack on the American consulat", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc98a3\"", "article_summary": "The operators\u2019 palpable frustration about what happened once the compound was under attack by terrorists just about pops off the pages of the book.\nBy telling their story, the Benghazi operators hope that the battle and their actions will be understood on their own terms, outside of partisan or political interests.\u201dMany uncertainties remain, of course, about what happened in Benghazi, chiefly whether the White House manipulated its messaging of the events for political reasons.\nDespite numerous congressional investigations into the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, we still don\u2019t know the whole story.\n13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi is written by a journalism professor at Boston University, Mitchell Zuckoff, along with the Annex Security Team \u2013 the six CIA contract operators who responded to the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks.\nThe attack took the lives of four Americans, including Ambassador J.
