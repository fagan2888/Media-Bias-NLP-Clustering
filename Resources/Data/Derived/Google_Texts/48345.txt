The Museo de las Americas has been having some good fun with its exhibit “El Brindis: Remixed,” featuring dozens of photos of people making and consuming (and sometimes over-consuming) alcohol.

Luckily, the exhibit is turning interative next month with a very serious mezcal tasting sponsored by the Consulate General of Mexico. Master Master Mescalier Sergio Iñurrigarro , who travels the globe talking about his liquor, will chat, and pour, at 6 p.m. Dec. 3.

Admission is $10, and, of course, you get to see the exhibit with that. Reserve a spot by emailing guestservice@museo.org. Space is limited, and if you don’t get in, you’ll end up drinking mezcal at home alone. Again.

Oh, read my review of the show here. Please.
