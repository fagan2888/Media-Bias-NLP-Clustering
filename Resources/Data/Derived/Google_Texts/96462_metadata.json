Getting rid of zits is more than just an urge to rid our faces of blemishes; it\u2019s part of our DNA. Still, for as long as man\u2019s been popping pimples, dermatologists have been warning against it. But if you truly can\u2019t help popping pimples, like so many of us, Dr. Mehmet Oz offers directions on the proper way to do so to avoid infection and scarring.\n\nWith the help of a seriously gross and way too realistic jumbo-sized zit, Dr. Oz finally revealed on The Oprah Winfrey Show the healthy way to get rid of acne. The trick is piercing the blemish rather than squeezing it. \u201cNever squeeze a pimple, because when you squeeze a pimple, you macerate it,\u201d Dr. Oz explains, referring to the process of the breaking down of skin caused by prolonged exposure to moisture.\n\nInstead, Dr. Oz recommends that you pierce the pimple parallel to the skin with a sterilized needle and then rip the skin upward. This will cause no pain, since you are piercing the already dead skin. \u201cIf you\u2019re going deeper than this, it\u2019s going to be uncomfortable, so only hit the white part of the pimple,\u201d Oz says. This is also not going to cause any further damage to the healthy skin surrounding the blemish.\n\nAlthough many associate pimples as being the product of poor hygiene, they are actually quite unrelated to an individual\u2019s grooming patterns. Instead, they are the product of overactive sebaceous glands at the base of the hair follicles. When dead skin cells are left behind and get stuck together in the sebum, the pore gets blocked and a pimple forms.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "how, pop, pimple, dr, oz, explains, right, way, pop, zit, extremely, realistic, prop", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Dr. Oz gives an extremely graphic demonstration of the best way to pop a pimple in order to prevent further skin damage.", "title": "Dr. Oz Explains The Right Way To Pop A Pimple [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-pop-pimple-dr-oz-explains-right-way-pop-zit-extremely-realistic-prop-308116", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/28/pimple.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Oz gives an extremely graphic demonstration of the best way to pop a pimple in order to prevent further skin damage.", "title": "Dr. Oz Explains The Right Way To Pop A Pimple [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-pop-pimple-dr-oz-explains-right-way-pop-zit-extremely-realistic-prop-308116", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/28/pimple.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/28/pimple.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-10-28T11:59:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-28T12:02:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Dr. Oz gives an extremely graphic demonstration of the best way to pop a pimple in order to prevent further skin damage."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd114c\"", "article_summary": "With the help of a seriously gross and way too realistic jumbo-sized zit, Dr. Oz finally revealed on The Oprah Winfrey Show the healthy way to get rid of acne.\nStill, for as long as man\u2019s been popping pimples, dermatologists have been warning against it.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going deeper than this, it\u2019s going to be uncomfortable, so only hit the white part of the pimple,\u201d Oz says.\nInstead, Dr. Oz recommends that you pierce the pimple parallel to the skin with a sterilized needle and then rip the skin upward.\nBut if you truly can\u2019t help popping pimples, like so many of us, Dr. Mehmet Oz offers directions on the proper way to do so to avoid infection and scarring."}
