Think about that for a moment.\n\nThat\u2019s the equivalent of seven library trips last year for every man, woman, and child in the county; how many did you make? And that figure doesn\u2019t include the 14.7 million visits in 2014 to the library\u2019s Web site, toledolibrary.org, or the thousands of library users who were served at home or at nursing homes, public housing sites, and community centers.\n\nI can\u2019t think of an institution in this community that helps more people \u2014 or a broader cross section of our population \u2014 than Ohio\u2019s oldest (176 years and counting) public library does. Our library puts Toledo in the big leagues in a way that few, if any, other amenities in northwest Ohio can claim. Its services also create tremendous economic value for the region.\n\nThe Blade\u2019s editorial board visited the main downtown library last week, so that director Clyde Scoles and his colleagues could show us some of the library\u2019s latest digital technology and update us on its expansion plans, even as it must cope with what Mr. Scoles calls an \u201cinformation Armageddon.\u201d He notes: \u201cThis is not your grandmother\u2019s library.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s for sure. The conference table around which we sat was decorated with items made on the library\u2019s new three-dimensional printer: a cell phone case, a snowflake, a dreidel, dollhouse furniture. The library soon will allow customers to use the 3-D printer for a nominal fee.\n\nIt\u2019s an example, Mr. Scoles says, of dramatic changes in technology that require the library to adapt. That means enabling users not only to absorb content \u2014 print, music, video \u2014 but also to create it. In the next few months, he says, the library will launch an initiative aimed at helping users to publish the essays they write.\n\n\u201cThe learning models and business models are changing very fast,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are tapping into centers all over the country and around the world.\u201d\n\nCheap \u2014 but high-value\n\nTo illustrate, the library hooked us up, via Skype and a gigantic video monitor, with Maryland author Jeff Yeager, who calls himself \u201cthe ultimate cheapskate.\u201d Mr. Yeager, a Toledo native, will be in town this week to speak at the main library and two branches as part of the library\u2019s \u201cOpen Book\u201d series.\n\nMr. Yeager advises Americans how to spend and consume less, especially in retirement, without sacrificing quality of life. He calls Toledo \u201cthe cradle of cheapskate civilization.\u201d To that end, he notes that the library is a fine way to get not only printed material but also online books and magazines, movies, music, audiobooks, and computer access \u2014 all for free.\n\n\n\nTHE BLADE Enlarge | Buy This Image The library soon will allow customers to use its new three-dimensional printer, which created this ornamental snowflake.\n\nThat includes Mr. Yeager\u2019s four books, which he says have attracted more than a million readers, \u201cand all the cheapskates read them at the library. Most books are written for public libraries; they\u2019re incredibly valuable in introducing writers like me to a broad range of readers. I tell people, go to the library \u2014 it\u2019s a cheap date.\u201d\n\nCheap, but high-value. Mr. Scoles shared attractive renderings of the library\u2019s newest branch, at King Road and Sylvania Avenue in Sylvania Township; construction is scheduled to start in May and take about a year. Sylvania city residents need not worry: The current branch on Monroe Street will undergo a program of upgrades and stay in business after the new branch opens.\n\nWe also got to see the floor plan for the expanded Oregon branch; that renovation is set for completion this summer, and it looks good. A new Mott branch library on Dorr Street is in the works.\n\nEven as the library embraces the digital future, it is expanding its traditional emphasis on promoting reading and literacy. It maintains 500 community partnerships \u2014 with Toledo Public Schools and suburban districts, the Metroparks, Imagination Station, the art museum, the zoo, the botanical garden, public media, the Boys & Girls Clubs, and many other local institutions.\n\n\u201cWe want to increase our impact on the community,\u201d says Jim Funk, the library\u2019s manager of institutional and community initiatives. Working closely with other organizations, he adds, breaks down walls that can hamper collaboration.\n\nService provider\n\nThe library also continues to broaden its array of nontraditional service for users. Starting in March, it will offer passport services. The children\u2019s library in the main branch is providing vision screenings for children and adults as part of its new \u201cWise About Eyes\u201d exhibit. In recent weeks, the library enabled users to sign up for the latest round of health insurance provided by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nTHE BLADE Enlarge | Buy This Image Clyde Scoles, director of the Toledo-Lucas County Public Library, says the library is embracing new technology and services.\n\nThe Sylvania branch now conducts classes to show iPad owners how to get library materials on their devices. Similar classes teach business owners to use the library\u2019s electronic databases to gain a competitive edge.\n\nThe Blade has reported in recent weeks on some of the problems the library faces in serving its diverse clientele: computer users who download pornography, children whose parents expect the library to care for them after school, people who display dubious hygiene or disruptive and even violent behavior. Of course, such problems are not unique to Toledo, but affect public libraries across the country.\n\nThe library could alleviate these difficulties by becoming more exclusive about the customers it allows through its doors. But that would violate Mr. Scoles\u2019 mission statement for the library: \u201cOpen to All.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe library mirrors the entire social fabric of the community,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes the issues are troublesome. We want people to come here to read, to research, to look for jobs, to get assistance. We do a pretty good job of meeting the challenges.\u201d\n\nDespite the alarms regularly sounded about how electronic devices are crowding out reading, Mr. Scoles insists that five centuries of book publishing are not going to end abruptly. Neither is the library\u2019s role as a repository of the printed word.\n\n\u201cBooks are not going away \u2014 that is our brand,\u201d Mr. Scoles says. \u201cBut the library always is in a changing mode.\u201d\n\nToledoans enjoy one of the best public libraries in the country. County residents have shown, both through our patronage and our approval of property tax requests to support its operations, that we appreciate how the library improves our lives every day.\n\nThe library\u2019s description of itself as \u201ca beacon of community engagement, experimentation, and expression\u201d is, if anything, understated. Let\u2019s never take it for granted.\n\nDavid Kushma is editor of The Blade.\n\nContact him at: dkushma@theblade.com or on Twitter @dkushma1", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://opinion.toledoblade.com/image/2015/01/24/75x_b1_a4-4_cC_z/Blade-Editor-28.jpg", "sailthru.author": "BY DAVID KUSHMA<br>BLADE EDITOR", "description": "The Toledo-Lucas County Public Library attracted more than 3 million visits \u2014 a record number \u2014 in 2014.
