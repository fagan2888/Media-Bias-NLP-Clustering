The Capital allows its readers to express divergent opinions. Like Mr. Wotring, I am a Christian and I love him despite our disparate viewpoints. Universal love is a central theme surrounding religion in general.\n\nHe states that many still wonder how President Barack Obama could achieve his office. He then proceeds to discount the achievements of our president with conjecture and speculation about his religion, as though that matters.\n\nAs a physician who believes in the inherent right of all people to health care, I feel that the Affordable Care Act alone would have rendered Obama's presidency a success. Now let's add the clean-energy revolution, job creation and Wall Street regulation, and it's game over. The Middle East unrest is the result of the illusion of our separateness.\n\nMr. Wotring, I doubt that \"many\" wonder how \"this man\" became president. He has accomplished an enormous amount during his administration and he did it against overwhelming odds that are decreasing steadily as you and I age out. Those born in an era of higher consciousness and acceptance of (perceived) differences will not be shackled by ghosts of the past and will march on until our common humanity is recognized.\n\nALYSON HALL\n\nAnnapolis\n\nVoter fraud\n\nA recent letter from Chris Body (The Capital, Sept. 13) claimed that rampant voter fraud makes Republican efforts to erode voting rights necessary. This is one more cherished myth of the misled, the misinformed and the selectively misanthropic.\n\nA Google search turned up over 40 pages of references to voter fraud in the United States. A quick scan of all of them showed that the overwhelming majority cite studies that have proved it happens very rarely. I looked up every one of those on the first page. All of them debunked Republicans' claim of widespread voter fraud.\n\nAs expected with statistics, the numbers vary, but the most frequently stated actual rate of voter fraud is 0.02.\n\nAnd the odds of being struck by lightning in a year? Nine point six.\n\nLUCIA ROBSON\n\nArnold\n\nSalt storage\n\nI would like to ask Del. Sid Saab, Council Chairman Jerry Walker and the residents of Crofton and Davidsonville, where they want the salt dome serving their area to be located if not in their neighborhood?\n\nDoes this mean that they don't want salt placed on their roads? Because if they want salt on their roads but don't want to have the facility in their neighborhood then I say the answer must be \"keep it where it is planned.\"\n\nThis is a constant drone from Davidsonville residents ... put it in north county, not in ours. Frankly, I'm tired of hearing it. We all have to share in the ugly part of civilization, we can't decide that we only want the pretty part. The northern part already has the prisons, the dump and tremendous retail development. South county can handle a salt dome.\n\nSUSAN GUYAUX\n\nCrownsville\n\nFarmers market\n\nI am writing regarding the article about the new regulations governing the vendors at the markets, particularly the Riva Road market that I have been attending very regularly since 2007 and at which I routinely spend $200 per month (The Capital, Sept. 6). I have made many friends among the vendors and have been very impressed with the quality and dedication among them and the pride they take in their wares.\n\nAll of a sudden some of my favorite ones have left \u2014 Ron Horath, the \"pierogi lady\" and several others \u2014 due to the regulations that the new market czar has now, after all these years, decided to implement to show his muscle. I dare say I have spent a lot more time there than he has, or ever will, and I have never heard of anyone getting sick or any substandard products being sold there.\n\nDuring the campaign, I tried to get Steve Schuh to go with me on a Saturday morning to meet, greet and show his interest in our agriculture community, but he never seemed to have the time. Too bad.\n\nHad he done this, he might not have approved of this person's heavy-handed tactics, which have driven exhibitors away and put some out of business.\n\nLest you wonder, I worked very hard to help get Steve elected and am quite satisfied with the job he is doing. My only hope is that he is so busy that this situation has gotten by him unnoticed \u2014 I hope that is the reason.\n\nI don't know what can be done now to mollify this situation, but to do this with basically no warning smacks of someone who has little if any people skills, and has no clue about how to have satisfied vendors and customers.\n\nCHUCK STEADMAN\n\nAnnapolis", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Letters: Obama an uplifter; Voter fraud; Salt dome; Farmers market controversy", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Capital Gazette", "author": "Capital Gazette", "og": {"site_name": "capitalgazette.com", "description": "Obama an uplifter", "title": "Letters: Obama an uplifter; Voter fraud; Salt dome; Farmers market controversy", "url": "http://www.capitalgazette.com/opinion/letters/ph-ac-ce-letters-1009-20151007-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617cddf/turbine/ph-ac-ce-letters-1009-20151007", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp06.10", "twitter": {"site": "@capgaznews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Alyson Hall, Myron Wotring, Lucia Robson, Susan Guyaux, Chuck Steadman", "fb": {"page_id": 324858467568005, "app_id": 290392664473911}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-10-09", "Description": "In his letter \"Obama a letdown\" (The Capital, Sept. 30), Myron Wotring is correct on several fronts.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Alyson Hall, Myron Wotring, Lucia Robson, Susan Guyaux, Chuck Steadman"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca819\"", "article_summary": "As expected with statistics, the numbers vary, but the most frequently stated actual rate of voter fraud is 0.02.\nA Google search turned up over 40 pages of references to voter fraud in the United States.\nObama an uplifterIn his letter \"Obama a letdown\" (The Capital, Sept. 30), Myron Wotring is correct on several fronts.\nALYSON HALLAnnapolisVoter fraudA recent letter from Chris Body (The Capital, Sept. 13) claimed that rampant voter fraud makes Republican efforts to erode voting rights necessary.\nAll of them debunked Republicans' claim of widespread voter fraud."}
