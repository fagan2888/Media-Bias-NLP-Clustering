The requirement applies to any business regulated by the Fair Labor Standards Act, regardless of size \u2013 so even employees at a local pizza parlor and/or food mart must receive the notice. After Oct. 1, any new hires must receive the letter within 14 days of their starting date, according to the DOL.\n\nThe DOL has letter templates for employers on its site for those who offer insurance benefits and those who do not. Wayne Hoffman, president of free market think tank Idaho Freedom Foundation, says he decided to write his own letter, instead. He has made his form letter available for download on the Internet.\n\nHoffman says the DOL letter template is too pro-ObamaCare, and he doesn\u2019t necessarily agree with its wording.\n\n\u201cIt extols the virtues of ObamaCare, and this is basically the vehicle to convince people to sign up and not worry about the other possible ramifications of being a government welfare state,\u201d Hoffman says.\n\nHoffman says the governments\u2019 notification lets workers know that they may be eligible for subsidies, but does not explain fully how these tax credits are being funded. The letters from the DOL states, \u201cyou may be eligible for a tax credit that lowers your monthly premium, or a reduction in certain cost-sharing if your employer does not offer coverage to you at all or does not offer coverage that meets certain standards.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWho pays for that?\u201d Hoffman says. \u201cIt\u2019s being drawn on a Treasury that has no money\u2026 someone pays for this, somewhere.\u201d\n\nHoffman himself does not fall into the territory of businesses that will be impacted by the employer mandate portion of the law, which was rolled back to Jan. 1, 2015. This mandates that every business with at least 50 or more full-time workers must offer their workers acceptable health-care coverage or face a fine of $2,000 per worker, per year. The debate around the mandate has centered on whether small companies will comply and offer this coverage, or opt to pay the penalty instead\u2014or reduce staff levels to stay below the compliance threshold.\n\nThe Letter Guidelines\n\nThe Department of Labor says employers do not have to send out the government\u2019s sample letter, but that the notice must meet certain criteria in explaining the new law and exchange marketplace.\n\n\u201cProviding model notices to employees will ensure that employers are meeting the requirement. Using the models is not, however, mandatory. Employers can create their own notices as long as the content set forth in the law and explained in Department of Labor guidance is included,\u201d a Labor Department spokesperson stated via e-mail.\n\nThe letter must include information on these three points, the DOL says:\n\nAbout the Health Insurance Marketplace;\n\nThat, depending on their income and what coverage may be offered by the employer, they may be able to get lower cost private insurance in the Marketplace; and\n\nThat if they buy insurance through the Marketplace, they may lose the employer contribution (if any) to their health benefits\n\nBusiness Owners\u2019 Responses to the Letter\n\nHoffman\u2019s notice takes a much different approach. Here are some of its passages:\n\n\u201cIt is important to understand that your use of the above subsidies may come at a heavy price to both you and the country. I understand that you must make your own decision concerning your utilization of the exchanges so it is your duty to fully research the act before you make the decision. I will be available to discuss this with you whenever you would like.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstand that our country is trillions of dollars in debt. If you accept tax credits to pay for your health insurance, that bill will have to be paid by this nation's children and grandchildren.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease know that this health care mandate has a direct impact on this company's resources. As such, we will be monitoring the impact of the health care law on our ability to hire, expand or reward our current employees for their hard work.\u201d\n\nEmployers who choose to create a notification letter via Hoffman\u2019s site can customize the details they send out to workers. He says he believes many will opt for the government notification because they don\u2019t realize they have other options, and he finds that unfortunate.\n\n\u201cThe [DOL] letter has a \u2018doe-eyed, don\u2019t worry about it, what can possibly happen?\u2019 tone to it,\u201d he says. \u201cMost folks will resort to the DOL form, but employers still have rights, and that is our point.\u201d\n\nNewtek president and CEO Barry Sloane says he will be sending out notices to his 320 employees across the country, but will have his human resources department craft their own version.\n\n\u201cI think its important to us to have that message to our employees, and to be frank, we are still formulating opinions about what we will do [under the ACA],\u201d Sloane says. \u201cWe feel we need to address our employees in our stakeholders\u2019 and shareholders\u2019 best interest, including the staff. The government\u2019s letter does what it does, but we have to address our employees with what we see as what\u2019s happening.\"\n\nThe company currently offers its workers\u2019 health coverage, and while Sloane says it reserves the right to change its mind, it is planning to continue offering these benefits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rapidly changing landscape, and we don\u2019t have quotes yet on existing coverage, but will get them shortly. We plan to stay the course and want our staff to know the world is changing and that our communication will primarily be about our guesses as to what will happen in the marketplace,\u201d he says.\n\nA restaurant owner in Iowa, who asked for anonymity, says he isn\u2019t sending out the letters because he simply doesn\u2019t have time. Some of his 75 workers are full-time, and are offered coverage, and some are not\u2014both need to be separately categorized.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time for an excessive amount of paper work, I am a restaurant owner,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to send out [an ACA notification letter] since they aren\u2019t penalizing you for not sending it.\u201d\n\nPeter Palumbo has taken an entirely different approach to the letter. The New York-based president of Camelot Limo has actually outsourced all health-care preparations to a third-party company called TASC.\n\nThe move will cost him several thousand dollars a year, but the company has an insurance policy in case Camelot misses a deadline, he says.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Labor hasn\u2019t sent us anything, but I did get emails from our health insurance broker, and I didn\u2019t know what to send out,\u201d Palumbo says. \u201cEvery time I do research, there\u2019s another thing I have to send out.\u201d\n\nHe has 60 total workers, 20 of which are full-time and offered health-care.\n\n\u201cOur expenses went up 14% for the exact same plan, and it continues to go up between 10% and 20% a year,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s to the point where a business can\u2019t even afford to offer their employees health care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-03-23 03:05:32 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "The Labor Dept. has required all small businesses with at least one worker and $500,000 in revenues to notify employees about the government\u2019s new health-care exchanges by Oct. 1.
