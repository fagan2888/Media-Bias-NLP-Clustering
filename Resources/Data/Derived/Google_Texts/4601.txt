The city of Albuquerque is taking another step in helping the homeless.

In the last couple of months, city officials have made an extra effort to help those on the streets. They created a homeless 311 hotline for people to call and implemented daily job opportunities.

Now, downtown nonprofit Healthcare for the Homeless is expanding. The organization serves about 7,000 people a year. Its board president, Jose Viramontes, said by adding on it will now be able to help hundreds more.

Healthcare for the Homeless offers medical and mental health services and other basic needs to people like a place to shower, access to computers and clothes.



Viramontes told Action 7 News there just simply aren't enough services for the people on Albuquerque's streets.



Jimmy Lujan, a former client and current center advocate, said if it weren't for Healthcare for the Homeless, he would likely have died already. He said this extra downtown space is desperately needed.



The expansion is costing $3.6 million. It is being paid for through a federal grant funded by the Affordable Care Act.
