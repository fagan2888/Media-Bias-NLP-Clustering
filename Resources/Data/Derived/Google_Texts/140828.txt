Last year’s Christmas Hipster was the pajama boy in the ads for Obamacare, which splattered all over the internet during the administration’s campaign to get young people to sign up. This year, however, London ad agency Grey London took inspiration from a less clean-cut variety of hipster to bring you Beard Baubles. Yes, that’s right—Christmas ornaments for your beard.

Seriously, these might be more impressive than the guy who made an actual bowl out of his beard and ramen ate out of it. Though Beard Baubles started as a goofy idea for a Christmas card it turned more meaningful when Grey got in touch with Australian group Beard Season, which seeks to spread skin cancer awareness after the death of a friend.

“Because Wes’ melanoma was on his neck, and not many blokes had beards back then,” Beard Season says, “we ditched our shavers to share Wes’ story with everyone who asked about our beards, and encourage them to have a skin check.”
