Thanks, Bernie Sanders.\n\n3 Clinton Needs Sanders Supporters to Win, But Sanders Needs Clinton Supporters to Change the System\n\n4 Anthony Weiner Wasn\u2019t the Only One Who Couldn\u2019t Stop Exposing Himself\n\n5 This Will Be a Historic (and Terrifying) Election for Gun Control\n\nOn this closely divided Court, outcomes are determined not by the most extreme but by the most centrist justice. Convention dictates that we call it the Roberts Court, but in truth this is the Kennedy Court. And Kennedy has voted with the liberals on issues of speech, sexuality, the death penalty, and the rights of enemy combatants, while siding with the conservatives on issues of racial discrimination, federal power, and access to courts. The Court\u2019s results are mixed not because of Roberts\u2019s leadership, but because of Kennedy\u2019s more balanced commitments.\n\nThere are at least three areas, however, in which the Roberts Court has been unrelentingly conservative. It is deeply suspicious of race-conscious efforts to ameliorate racial inequality, whether in voting or education, and it seems so committed to the ideal of color-blindness that it has frustrated efforts to achieve integration and racial diversity. Indeed, there is a risk that the Court will effectively end the practice of affirmative action in the coming term\u2014even as race and class disparities persist and, in some settings, deepen.\n\nSecond, in Citizens United and other decisions, the Court has erected First Amendment roadblocks to campaign-finance reform. It has ruled that the only legitimate rationale for regulating campaign spending is to avoid the reality and appearance of bribery, and has struck down laws aimed at the broader corruption that stems from the outsize influence of the wealthy, even without bribes. As a result, big money has been let loose in our electoral system as never before.\n\nThird, the Roberts Court has been consistently skeptical of the need for judicial redress for victims of state or corporate wrongs. It has imposed strict \u201cpleading\u201d requirements that help corporate defendants get lawsuits dismissed before having to turn over potentially damning evidence to employees or customers, and it has barred classwide remedies even when they are the only meaningful way to hold businesses accountable. In criminal cases, it has eviscerated the \u201cexclusionary rule,\u201d the principal means of enforcing Fourth Amendment privacy rights. Without exclusion as a remedy, many victims of illegal police searches have no incentive to sue. And a police force that cannot be held accountable for its wrongs can quickly become abusive\u2014as a slew of videos in recent months have vividly demonstrated.

Many of the conservative rulings that have closed the courthouse door to victims of illegal government or corporate conduct were closely divided and might be reconsidered if the people demand it\u2014especially if the Court\u2019s personnel changes. The same is true with respect to affirmative action, campaign finance, and the exclusionary rule. Whoever wins the next election is likely to shape the Court for decades to come. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 82, Kennedy and Antonin Scalia are 79, and Stephen Breyer is 77. And because the Court is so closely divided, a single appointment could have dramatic consequences. If a Republican gets to appoint Ginsburg\u2019s or Breyer\u2019s successor, Kennedy would no longer be a swing vote, and the Court would likely become consistently conservative. By the same token, if a Democrat replaces Scalia or Kennedy, the Court would have a solid liberal majority for the first time in about a half-century. More so than in any election in my memory, the fate of the Court, of constitutional law, and of justice itself is at stake in the coming election.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cole-rainbowflag-ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "David Cole", "description": "To mark the 10th anniversary of John Roberts\u2019s appointment as chief justice, The Nation asked 10 accomplished and perceptive scholars, lawyers, and writers to review a case or two from the Roberts Court\u2019s first decade.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "To mark the 10th anniversary of John Roberts\u2019s appointment as chief justice, The Nation asked 10 accomplished and perceptive scholars, lawyers, and writers to review a case or two from the Roberts Court\u2019s first decade.", "title": "This Isn\u2019t the Roberts Court\u2014It\u2019s the Kennedy Court", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/this-isnt-the-roberts-court-its-the-kennedy-court/", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cole-rainbowflag-ap_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 907}, "updated_time": "2015-09-24T14:54:10+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "To mark the 10th anniversary of John Roberts\u2019s appointment as chief justice, The Nation asked 10 accomplished and perceptive scholars, lawyers, and writers to review a case or two from the Roberts Court\u2019s first decade.", "title": "This Isn\u2019t the Roberts Court\u2014It\u2019s the Kennedy Court", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/this-isnt-the-roberts-court-its-the-kennedy-court/", "image": {"height": 907, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cole-rainbowflag-ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cole-rainbowflag-ap_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1440}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "September 24th, 2015", "sailthru.title": "This Isn\u2019t the Roberts Court\u2014It\u2019s the Kennedy Court", "keywords": "feature, supreme court, the constitution, the right, john roberts", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 187963, "sailthru.tags": "Supreme Court,The Constitution,The Right,Feature", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "john roberts", "published_time": "2015-09-24T09:45:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-24T14:54:10+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/smccroskey/"}, "sailthru.description": "The Court\u2019s results are mixed, not because of John Roberts\u2019s leadership but because of Anthony Kennedy\u2019s more balanced commitments.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cole-rainbowflag-ap_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b79\"", "article_summary": "Convention dictates that we call it the Roberts Court, but in truth this is the Kennedy Court.\nThere are at least three areas, however, in which the Roberts Court has been unrelentingly conservative.\nGeorge H.
