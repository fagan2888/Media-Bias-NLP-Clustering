His father was hospitalized with gunshot wounds and was listed in critical condition.\n\n\u201cWe took some of the body cam footage. I\u2019m not gonna talk about it, but I\u2019m gonna tell you this \u2014 it is the most disturbing thing I\u2019ve seen and I will leave it at that,\u201d State Police Col. Michael Edmonson said at a press conference late Friday. \u201cThat little boy was buckled into the front seat of that vehicle and that is how he died.\u201d\n\nNorris Greenhouse Jr., 32, and Derrick Stafford, 23, were charged with second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder. They were placed on administrative leave, as were two other marshals involved in the chase who have not been charged.\n\nGreenhouse and Stafford were working second jobs as city marshals when the shooting happened. Greenhouse is a full-time Marksville police lieutenant and Stafford is a marshal in Alexandria, Edmonson said.\n\nCNN affiliate WAFB reported that Dr. L.J. Mayeux, coroner of Avoyelles Parish, said the chase ended at a dead end street and that Few backed into the marshal\u2019s vehicle several times and would not get out.\n\nOfficials initially said there was an exchange of gunfire but later said no firearm was found in Few\u2019s vehicle.\n\nMayeux also said Chris Few had outstanding warrants, WAFB reported, but Edmonson said he found no warrants against Few with police or court offices.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what he was thinking,\u201d Few\u2019s girlfriend, Megan Dixon, told WAFB. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he wouldn\u2019t just stop.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "31.127965;-92.066236", "description": "By Faith Karimi and Ralph Ellis CNN (CNN) -- Two police officers in Louisiana are facing murder charges after a 6-year-old boy was shot to death in the front seat of his father's vehicle, authorities said.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "a9bc8fabb9f6cda780dcd354edb426e8"}, "og": {"site_name": "fox13now.com", "description": "By Faith Karimi and Ralph Ellis CNN (CNN) \u2014 Two police officers in Louisiana are facing murder charges after a 6-year-old boy was shot to death in the front seat of his father\u2019s vehicle\u2026", "title": "Officers arrested in shooting death of 6-year-old boy in Louisiana", "url": "http://fox13now.com/2015/11/06/two-officers-arrested-in-fatal-shooting-of-6-year-old-in-louisiana/", "image": {"width": 334, "identifier": "https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/s055955416-300.jpg", "height": 594}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/s055955416-300.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox13now", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox13now"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "News for Salt Lake City, Ogden, Provo and beyond", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324152525", "fb": {"pages": 75831650585}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox13now.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/98a0a4875aa0281a51f538da86df31aa?s=16", "application-name": "fox13now.com", "ICBM": "31.127965, -92.066236", "keywords": "news, louisiana, officer arrested, officer-involved shooting, shooting", "google-site-verification": "avVLxvtHokA_r9gaDC1cvuQNhoxzcJHtFAJItW79fPI", "article": {"publisher": "http://fox13now.com/facebook/", "published_time": "2015-11-07T04:35:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-07T22:19:05+00:00", "author": "http://fox13now.com/facebook/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "two officers arrested in boy's death, 6-year-old boy shot in louisiana, police arrested in young boy's death, fatal shooting, jeremy mardis, marksville louisiana,"}, "article_summary": "By Faith Karimi and Ralph Ellis(CNN) \u2014 Two police officers in Louisiana are facing murder charges after a 6-year-old boy was shot to death in the front seat of his father\u2019s vehicle, authorities said.\nMayeux also said Chris Few had outstanding warrants, WAFB reported, but Edmonson said he found no warrants against Few with police or court offices.\nThey were placed on administrative leave, as were two other marshals involved in the chase who have not been charged.\nJeremy Mardis, a first-grader, was hit by five bullets in the head and chest as the officers pursued his father\u2019s car, according to CNN affiliate WAFB.\nGreenhouse and Stafford were working second jobs as city marshals when the shooting happened."}
