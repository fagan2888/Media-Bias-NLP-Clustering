The economic downturn that helped fuel youth support for President Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign still haunts younger Americans, the reports authors find.\n\n\u201c[T]he Great Recession will at least affect Millennials\u2019 labor market performance as well\n\nas savings and investment behavior in the short-term, though at this point, it is still too soon to know how large and lasting these impacts will be,\u201d reads one of the report\u2019s conclusions. Millennials interested in home ownership are still squeezed by a tight credit market, the report finds, and lasting fallout from the recession on the labor market means millennials are staying with the same employer longer than their counterparts in Generation X.\n\n\u201c[T]he long-term impacts of these changes are unclear and there are both benefits and costs to longer tenure at jobs,\u201d the report finds.\n\nThe focus of Thursday\u2019s social media campaign \u2014 student debt and Obamacare \u2014 also get a lot of ink in the report. The Affordable Care Act means young people \u201care much more likely to have health insurance coverage than young workers in the past,\u201d the report says. But a rise in student loan payment delinquencies, especially among students enrolled in for-profit schools or those who don\u2019t graduate, shows some millennials are facing a heavy financial burden even before they enter the job market, the report finds.\n\nYounger Americans have traditionally been a Democratic base group, and Obama\u2019s team has done a masterful job of turning them out in his presidential campaigns. But college aged voters have much lower turn out rates in non-presidential election years, and the White House is hoping to prop up those numbers during next month\u2019s crucial election that will determine control of the Senate.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3471872, "userid": 568833}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Say it with tiny flexing arms and mortarboards...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
