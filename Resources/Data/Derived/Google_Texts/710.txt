The Goddess of Oil is making her way back to Tulsa.

The Goddess of Oil is making her way back to Tulsa. A long forgotten project of some Tulsa oilmen before World War 2, she’s now the namesake for a new wine from Tulsa’s Girouard Vines.

The folks at Girouard Vines were bottling the latest in their Tulsa Deco wine series, a Grenache, and it's their most decorated wine.

"We're pretty proud of the double gold," said Chris Girouard.

Decades ago Girouard's father began experimenting with wild Oklahoma grapes trying to produce something special, and they are almost there.

"After 50 years of work we'll have our first release by the end of the year," Girouard said.

It’ll be part of their deco series, where the label, like all the deco series, will feature something from Tulsa's art deco past.

It has The Goddess of Oil and her story is on the label. She was commissioned by some local oil men for the International Petroleum Exposition at the fairgrounds in 1941. She was to be a 40-foot-tall golden statue; but when World War 2 came along the project was pretty much forgotten until Girouard held a label contest for his new wine.

With a terrific story from Tulsa's past, the Goddess of Oil, will arrive in Tulsa.

Girouard Vines in located at 817 East 3rd Street. They’re open for wine tastings on Thursdays from 5 to around 8 p.m.

You can try all their Tulsa Deco series including the newest one, The Goddess of Oil.
