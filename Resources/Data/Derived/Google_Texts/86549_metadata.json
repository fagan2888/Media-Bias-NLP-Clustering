Or if Obama is slapping around Gov. Nathan Deal for his rejection of the Affordable Care Act and not expanding Medicaid.\n\n\u201cYes, I think there are some hardcore politics involved,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah, one of several Republican candidates for the Senate, this morning in an interview with Martha Zoller and Tim Bryant on WGAU (1340AM).\n\nKingston also had a taunt for Nunn, who was raising money with Vice President Joe \u201cHell or High Water\u201d Biden on Tuesday: \u201cDid she even bring it up? Does she even know where the Port of Savannah is? Or was she and Biden so busy raising money they didn\u2019t worry about the 352,000 jobs related to the Port of Savannah?\u201d\n\nBut Kingston also supplied Nunn with ammunition that she might use to reply. In the old days, a Congress that didn\u2019t agree with White House priorities simply loaded its own projects into the budget, in a bit of horse-trading.\n\nBut Republicans, particularly in the House, have placed such bargaining out of bounds \u2013 a self-imposed box on their own influence. Said Kingston:\n\n\u201cBecause, under the House rules, this is an earmark. And so for us to place something in the budget which is not in the budget already \u2013 it\u2019s not allowed. And this is considered an earmark if it doesn\u2019t come out of the White House.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWhen he qualified at the state Capitol this morning, Senate candidate David Perdue dodged the issue of whether the earmark ban is too restrictive, saying instead that Washington fails to prioritize projects that could have the biggest economic impact. Said Perdue:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one thing after another. And my frustration is the conversations we\u2019ve had in Washington are drifting with it. There\u2019s been no sense of urgency. We\u2019re on third base, but it\u2019s tough to get somebody home from third base.\u201d\n\nHe said lawmakers look at this type of project as a \u201cone-off\u201d rather than a strategic priority.\n\n\u201cThe money is there,\u201d he said, before taking a swipe at Kingston. \u201cIt\u2019s five feet. We\u2019ve been digging that port since Oglethorpe. I just hold accountable the people who have been in office. It\u2019s not just the Democrats, it\u2019s not just the president. It\u2019s the Republicans too.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe Savannah snub and Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s presence in Atlanta on Monday prompted an earlier-than-planned first shot by Georgia Victory, the Super PAC established to help keep Saxby Chambliss\u2019 seat in Republican hands.\n\nThis was the missive, in part, we received last night from GV staffer Leslie Shedd, who only last Friday was flacking for U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland:\n\nJust a few months ago in December 2013, Nunn stressed the importance of the Savannah port project and put her full support behind it saying, \u201cWe need to ensure that the port is fully funded.\u201d Yet today, we see that her priority isn\u2019t the Savannah port or the Georgia economy \u2013 it\u2019s picking up fundraising checks courtesy of Joe Biden and his liberal friends.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s decision to thumb his nose at Washington and plumb the depths of Savannah\u2019s port with state money instead of federal dollars is almost assured to set up an election-year legal battle between the state and Washington.\n\nThe move helps him win political points with residents in Savannah and with powerful business interests in metro Atlanta, who have led the charge to deepen the port to make way for the bigger ships that will soon rumble through an expanded Panama Canal.\n\nBut it also risks a protracted and costly legal fight with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who would still need to sign off on the project. And legal action could always backfire, forcing the project through new hurdles that could delay the timeline.\n\nIt seems he\u2019ll have the weight of much of the business community behind him. If you needed any proof, consider this statement that came from the Georgia Chamber late last night that commended Deal for \u201cpledging that Georgia will continue to move ahead with this this critical project.\u201d\n\n***\n\nExpect the port decision also to become a dividing line in the race to replace Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah. Five Republicans have already signed up to run for Kingston\u2019s seat, and Democratic chair DuBose Porter said he expects a solid Democratic candidate to join the race.\n\nYesterday, we heard from Dr. Bob Johnson, who previewed an attack Savannah residents will hear plenty in the coming months:\n\n\u201cThis flies in the face of statements from his own Vice President, who just last year stood in our town and said our port would be fully funded. Obama through this budget has made it clear that he is a small minded politician playing red-state, blue-state politics.\u201d\n\n***\n\nHuffington Post has a lengthy Q&A with Democrat Jason Carter, who is expected to qualify in the governor\u2019s race today. Aside from asking his take on a Washington Nationals phenom \u2013yeah, we were scratching our heads about that, too \u2014 Carter offered this take on the GOP line of attack he\u2019s facing:\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen so far is the same playbook they\u2019ve always rolled out for years and years, which is, he\u2019s going to raise your taxes, which is not true. I\u2019ve been as fiscally conservative as anybody in the legislature. They\u2019re going to say that I\u2019m a national Democrat. And also, not true.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOne thing that the furor over the Port of Savannah helped cover up: The U.S. House overwhelmingly approved changes to the flood insurance program last night, a fight that pits wealthy coastal landowners against conservative groups. From USA Today:\n\n\u201cSupporters of the measure, including Gulf Coast lawmakers, said the increases were making it impossible for many people to keep their homes or sell them. Critics, however, say taxpayers will be left to foot the bill for the financially troubled insurance program. \u201cThe premium increases were required under a 2012 law known as Biggert-Waters that was designed to designed to make the government\u2019s flood insurance program financially solvent by bringing rates in line with true flooding risks\u2026 \u201cThe House measure also would repeal a provision in the Biggert-Waters law that increases premiums \u2014 up to the full-risk rate over five years \u2014 when the Federal Emergency Management Agency adopts new flood maps.\u201d\n\nFor Georgia, coastal Republican Rep. Jack Kingston was a \u201cyes,\u201d while his U.S. Senate primary foes Phil Gingrey and Paul Broun voted \u201cno.\u201d The only other Georgia Republican in favor was Lawrenceville\u2019s Rob Woodall.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/03/05/port-of-savannah-snub-complicates-debuts-of-jason-carter-michelle-nunn/", "image": "http://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/030514_vp_biden_bs14.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "A White House budget snub of Georgia\u2019s effort to dredge the Port of Savannah has jumped up just in time to complicate the qualifying ceremonies of Democrats Jason...", "title": "Port of Savannah snub complicates debuts of Jason Carter, Michelle Nunn | Political Insider blog"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "AJC blog about Atlanta politics, Georgia politics, Georgia and metro Atlanta election campaigns.
