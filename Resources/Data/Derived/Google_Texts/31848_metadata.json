In keeping with that image, the company chose to feature its employees and their kids at a family picnic for its Obamacare enrollment campaign.\n\n\"We have been doing this for over 33 years,\" said Dr. Mario Molina, president and CEO. \"So, we've developed a lot of trust, I think, in the community and that's going to be an important part of this.\"\n\n(Read more: 8 things to know about Obamacare)\n\n\n\nMolina covers nearly 2 million Medicaid patients across nine states, including California, Texas and Florida. The insurer is offering plans on the new health insurance exchanges in all of those states. It has hired 2,000 people in the past year and is planning a major enrollment effort that includes retail storefronts in some of its biggest markets.\n\n\"We have kiosks in places that are available in shopping malls so that people can come in a nonthreatening way just to get information and not feel like they are getting the hard sell,\" said Molina.\n\nThe more important part of the outreach will involve staffers at its proprietary community health clinics. These staffers already come in contact with a high number of uninsured adult patients who may now qualify for subsidized coverage on the state health exchanges or free coverage under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion program.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Molina Healthcare has been gearing up to sign up customers on health exchanges in nine states, but there are many reasons why this is a risky bet.", "author": "Bertha Coombs", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Molina Healthcare has been gearing up to sign up customers on health exchanges in nine states, but there are many reasons why this is a risky bet.", "title": "Despite risks, Molina gambles on Obamacare rewards", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2013/09/26/molina-healthcares-obamacare-bet-has-big-risks-and-rewards.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/09/25/101063250-170867891r.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Molina Healthcare has been gearing up to sign up customers on health exchanges in nine states, but there are many reasons why this is a risky bet.", "title": "Despite risks, Molina gambles on Obamacare rewards", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2013/09/26/molina-healthcares-obamacare-bet-has-big-risks-and-rewards.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/09/25/101063250-170867891r.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@BerthaCoombs", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, US: News, Insurance, Health Insurance, Molina Healthcare Inc, Aetna Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2013-09-26T10:44:06-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2013-09-26T12:57:06-0400", "tag": "Aetna Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 101062927, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Molina Healthcare, insurers, insurance, exchanges, costs"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe31fc\"", "article_summary": "Molina Healthcare touts itself as an extended family to its Medicaid insurance clients.\nThe insurer is offering plans on the new health insurance exchanges in all of those states.\n(Read more: 8 things to know about Obamacare)Molina covers nearly 2 million Medicaid patients across nine states, including California, Texas and Florida.\nIn keeping with that image, the company chose to feature its employees and their kids at a family picnic for its Obamacare enrollment campaign.\nCNBC's Bertha Coombs takes a look at which insurance companies could be the biggest winners when the health care exchanges go live next week."}
