Whatever the unsubstantiated and private concerns of Libby Harris may be, they pale in comparison to the benefits provided by the Project, and the urgent need for action on climate change,\u201d the brief states.\n\nTo stress the urgency of an impending climate disaster, Michael Melone writes, \u201cPresident Barack Obama has rightly called climate change the greatest threat to national security,\u201d and he adds that researchers claim \u201cthe effects of climate change, pollution and deforestation have caused the Earth to enter the beginning of a new extinction phase where humans could be among the first casualties.\u201d\n\nIn an Aug. 12 petitioner\u2019s reply brief, Michael Melone disparages Harris as a \u201clone wolf\u201d objector and dismisses her worries as \u201cNIMBY concerns.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harris, such dismissive statements are characteristic of the way Allco deals with residents concerned by the firm\u2019s solar farms.\n\n\u201cThe solar company bought the land directly across from my house. From the beginning they have used so much subterfuge to be seemingly fine with what they\u2019re doing, and yet every step of the way they have used their power and deep pockets to bully us,\u201d Harris told Vermont Watchdog.\n\nA retired school teacher, Harris claims she became an intervenor because it\u2019s the only affordable way local residents can voice their objections.\n\n\u201cI decided to become an intervenor because I\u2019m an abutter [to the site]. This has become my personal mission to do what I can because I don\u2019t have all that money to go to Superior Court,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Harris said intervening at the PSB is more affordable than paying the more than $10,000 she would need to fight Allco in court, she claims that the company has treated her poorly for her role as intervenor.\n\n\u201cThey told me in a conference call that since they owned the land directly across from me, if I didn\u2019t withdraw my intervenor status they would remove every single one of the six acres of apple trees on that land that I look out on.\u201d\n\nMichael Melone did not return Watchdog\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u201cNone of us are against going to renewables,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut I think the Public Service Board, being three appointed people, has been rubber-stamping these wind and solar projects all over the state. It\u2019s already done a great deal of harm in ruining the natural habitat.\u201d\n\nOriginally published in Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A green energy mogul who protested a wind farm near his summer home is criticizing Vermonters who oppose his company\u2019s solar farm in their neighborhood.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A green energy mogul who protested a wind farm near his summer home is criticizing Vermonters who oppose his company\u2019s solar farm in their neighborhood.", "title": "'Not in My Backyard': Green Energy Mogul Who Opposed Wind Farm Adopts a Different Approach Away From Home", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150919_WindFarm.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-18T14:18:38+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QkIjn1"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A green energy mogul who protested a wind farm near his summer home is criticizing Vermonters who oppose his company\u2019s solar farm in their neighborhood.", "title": "'Not in My Backyard': Green Energy Mogul Who Opposed Wind Farm Adopts a Different Approach Away From Home", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150919_WindFarm.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "solar,wind", "published_time": "2015-09-19T03:01:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-18T14:18:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "green energy,wind,solar,renewables,vermont,allco renewable energy"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27d0\"", "article_summary": "In 2010, Thomas Melone, CEO of Allco Renewable Energy, petitioned to block Cape Wind, a large offshore wind farm sited in federal waters in Nantucket Sound.\nA green energy mogul who protested an offshore wind farm near his summer home on Martha\u2019s Vineyard is criticizing Vermonters who oppose his company\u2019s four-megawatt combined solar farm proposed in Bennington.\n\u201cThe Chelsea Project will advance the goals of fighting the devasting [sic] impacts from climate change.\n\u201cBut I think the Public Service Board, being three appointed people, has been rubber-stamping these wind and solar projects all over the state.\nDespite Melone\u2019s efforts to keep renewable energy away from his home in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Allco appears to have little sympathy for Harris\u2019 objections."}
