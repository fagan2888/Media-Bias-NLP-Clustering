Dive Brief:

A new study that was published in the Emergency Medical Journal found that people who are frequent emergency room users have a higher risk of death than non-frequent users.

The results were based on a systemic review of 31 observational studies on the mortality and health services outcomes of frequent versus non-frequent ER users. Although the definition of frequent user varied by study, the most common definition was someone who visits the ER four or more times per year.

Although the definition of frequent user varied by study, the most common definition was someone who visits the ER four or more times per year. The study found that frequent ER users tend to be high-risk patients with unmet needs.

Dive Insight:

According to the study authors, frequent ER users, also known as "frequent flyers" or "super-users", often have mental health issues, addiction issues or chronic conditions. Many of them are also homeless.

Although ER staff often view frequent users as a nuisance or drain on resources, the authors say to do so "represents a narrow, biased and potentially dangerous view of this issue." Instead, the researchers suggest that frequent ER users need focused attention and implementation of interventions designed to meet their unmet needs not only from practitioners, but also from health administrators and policymakers. The authors also say that frequent ER users could benefit from case management in many instances.
