She\u2019s like every other extreme feminist, she would do everything she could to talk any woman who was gonna have the baby, put it up for adoption, out of it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t doubt me,\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cI imagine it sounds kind of shocking to hear me say that every abortion, every lost abortion, every abortion that does not happen is a loss of momentum politically. It is, if it\u2019s publicly known. It\u2019s a political issue to \u2019em, folks. It\u2019s not about women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s just what they say it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me quote her get up,\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201c\u2018I support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved, period, end of story.'\u201d\n\nLimbaugh ensued to contradict Wasserman Schultz\u2019s Wednesday claim, saying government intervention is essential in cases she supports, specifically Obamacare and Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cBut in these two examples, the Obamacare contraception mandate or government funding Planned Parenthood, Debbie \u2018Blabbermouth\u2019 Schultz wants maximum government involvement,\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cAnd, by the way, notice that Debbie Schultz doesn\u2019t even think twice about aborting a seven pound baby. It didn\u2019t even give her pause. It didn\u2019t even become a moral question to her. She did not break a sweat. She did not break stride.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Al Weaver", "description": "conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh lashed out at DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz after she traded barbs with Rand Paul over abortion Wednesday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Continuing his support of Rand Paul after his 2016 announcement, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh lashed out at DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz after the two traded barbs over abortion on Wedn", "title": "Limbaugh: Debbie \u2018Blabbermouth\u2019 Schultz Wouldn\u2019t \u2018Break A Sweat\u2019 About Aborting 7-Pound Baby [AUDIO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/04/09/limbaugh-debbie-blabbermouth-schultz-wouldnt-break-a-sweat-about-aborting-7-pound-baby-audio/", "image": {"width": 1300, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Rush-Limbaugh-e1437570056230.jpg", "height": 559}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "She 'doesn't even think twice'", "title": "Limbaugh: Debbie \u2018Blabbermouth\u2019 Schultz Wouldn\u2019t \u2018Break A Sweat\u2019 About Aborting 7-Pound Baby [AUDIO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/04/09/limbaugh-debbie-blabbermouth-schultz-wouldnt-break-a-sweat-about-aborting-7-pound-baby-audio/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Rush-Limbaugh-e1437570056230.jpg"}, "creator": "@@alweaver22", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-09 17:39:20", "sailthru.title": "Limbaugh: Debbie 'Blabbermouth' Schultz Wouldn't 'Break A Sweat' About Aborting 7-Pound Baby [AUDIO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "debbie-wasserman-schultz,rand-paul,rush-limbaugh,al-weaver", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "debbie wasserman schultz,rand paul,rush limbaugh", "sailthru.description": "Continuing his support of Rand Paul after his 2016 announcement, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh lashed out at DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz after the two traded barbs over abortion on Wedn", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Rush-Limbaugh-e1437570056230.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca61c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAnd, by the way, notice that Debbie Schultz doesn\u2019t even think twice about aborting a seven pound baby.\n4528862Continuing his support of Rand Paul after his 2016 announcement, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh lashed out at DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz after the two traded barbs over abortion on Wednesday.\n\u201cBut in these two examples, the Obamacare contraception mandate or government funding Planned Parenthood, Debbie \u2018Blabbermouth\u2019 Schultz wants maximum government involvement,\u201d Limbaugh said.\n'\u201dLimbaugh ensued to contradict Wasserman Schultz\u2019s Wednesday claim, saying government intervention is essential in cases she supports, specifically Obamacare and Planned Parenthood.\n\u201cI imagine it sounds kind of shocking to hear me say that every abortion, every lost abortion, every abortion that does not happen is a loss of momentum politically."}
