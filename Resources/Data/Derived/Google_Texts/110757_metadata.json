Believe it or not, I just defended President Obama to a gathering of foreign nationals. Even though I\u2019m no fan of his, it still stings when non-Americans run down our president. To be fair, I also got a lot of heat about President George W. Bush in his final year in office when I traveled abroad, and I defended him as well. But trying to defend your president from angry charges that he is too tough is easier than defending your president to foreigners who are worried and anxious about him being too weak. Actually, I travel a lot, and these days, no one in any foreign capitals I visit will defend Obama\u2019s foreign policy. Based on what I see, when it comes to the president\u2019s foreign policy, the Democratic national security elite don\u2019t defend him, his former advisers don\u2019t defend him and even current U.S. ambassadors don\u2019t really know what to say. There are a lot of awkward pauses and attempts to change the subject.\n\nAnyway, at home and abroad, Obama\u2019s quest for a legacy isn\u2019t going so well. By any measure, peace and prosperity have eluded the Obama presidency. As has been pointed out, despite touting his \u201caccomplishment\u201d in \u201cending two wars,\u201d Obama \u201cfaces the prospect that he will leave office with ground troops deployed\u201d with unclear missions in \u201cat least three combat zones.\u201d\n\nAs for prosperity, Investor\u2019s Business Daily rightly points out that the president\u2019s economic policies have resulted in an 8 percent drop in the average income of families in the bottom fifth of households between 2009 and 2014; and real median household income dropped by more than $1,000 during that same time frame. Not to mention, third-quarter GDP growth was a meager 1.5 percent, and only an average of 2 percent for the year. And all this is despite the accumulation of unprecedented debt and the unexpected gift of lower-than-anticipated oil prices. Even the low unemployment rate comes with a footnote explaining that we are experiencing the lowest labor participation rate in 37 years, staggering numbers of people who are not in the labor force at all and food stamp reliance that is at an all-time high. As for Obamacare, enrollment is lagging, premiums and deductibles are skyrocketing and there are still several looming fights over key provisions in the law. That\u2019s not much of a legacy.\n\nSo what is the president\u2019s plan to make his mark? Well, he may have foreshadowed his endgame strategy in a recent interview he did with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is a reliable, friendly forum for the president, and I\u2019m sure interviewer Steve Kroft didn\u2019t mean to put Obama on the spot, but one of the president\u2019s answers to a fairly predictable question was revealing. Kroft, in questioning Obama\u2019s foreign policy, pointed out that Russian President Vladimir Putin was \u201cchallenging\u201d U.S. leadership with regard to Syria. Obama denied that Putin\u2019s actions in Syria showed leadership, then said, \u201cMy definition of leadership would be leading on climate change, an international accord that potentially we\u2019ll get in Paris.\u201d What? Does anyone think an accord won\u2019t be reached in Paris? Is there anything the president won\u2019t give away in the name of fighting climate change? Does anyone believe that he will refuse whatever plan is offered up to save the planet?\n\nHis comment reminded me of Bill Murray\u2019s character in \u201cCaddyshack,\u201d Carl Spackler, who tells a story explaining that he didn\u2019t get paid for caddying for the Dalai Lama, recounting how the Dalai Lama told him, \u201cOh, uh, there won\u2019t be any money, but when you die, on your deathbed, you will receive total consciousness.\u201d Spackler ends his story by exclaiming, \u201cSo I got that goin\u2019 for me, which is nice.\u201d So while his presidency has misfired on so many fronts, Obama has virtually nothing positive to show for his time in office, much of the world burns, the economy is stalled and race relations at home are smoldering, at least Obama will have \u201can international accord\u201d on global warming going for him.\n\nOf course, combating climate change is a bottomless pit of fantasy that lends itself to every cliche liberal program ever imagined, and best of all, there isn\u2019t really ever a day of reckoning. The way the liberals play the game, the fight against climate change can\u2019t fail \u2014 even if it can\u2019t succeed \u2014 because after all, in the future, no matter what the weather does, liberals can always make the argument that without Obama, it could have been worse. And nice, sunny days will always be thanks to him. It\u2019s a unquantifiable, lame excuse for a legacy that suits this president. He doesn\u2019t really have to do anything, because nothing agreed to in Paris could ever pass Congress. And of course, none of the expense or changes that he will want to impose on us will ever affect him.\n\nSo where does this leave us for 2016? The president\u2019s promotion of his legacy will have to coexist with the race to replace him. The Republican nominee will have no problem highlighting the failures of the past seven years, but the Democrats on the ticket \u2014 from Hillary Clinton all the way to the bottom of the ballot \u2014 will have to navigate between voters who want change and an Obama who will be declaring victory. No Democrat will pledge to deliver more of the same, but every Democrat will have to be careful not to alienate core Obama constituencies. It won\u2019t be easy, but the dance is going to be fun to watch.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At home and abroad, President Obama\u2019s quest for a legacy isn\u2019t going so well.
