We\u2019re not out of the last one, the retort might go.\n\nBut at the Brookings Institution Monday, conclusions from an \u201cexpert\u201d panel of academics, policy analysts, and investors weren\u2019t much cheerier.\n\nBen Spielberg, a research analyst with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, put it bluntly: \u201cThe short answer is no, we\u2019re not.\u201d The long answer, Spielberg continued, \u201cis still no. But we can be if we take the right lessons from our historical experience and start to prepare for it now.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s a very big \u201cif.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Spielberg on Monday released a paper co-authored with economist Jared Bernstein arguing for a stronger set of automatic stabilizers, the programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps that kick in when economic conditions pressure incomes downward.\n\nSpielberg and Bernstein also propose stronger, more direct government action in the next downturn, such as job creation programs that would subsidize hiring or help states offset the price of their own initiatives, or directly create and fund national service jobs.\n\nIn fact, because such programs are tough to start up quickly, particularly when conditions are deteriorating and nerves are frayed, they should be put into place and tested now, Spielberg said.\n\nThat\u2019s a tall order from a federal government that\u2019s so far being able to govern wisely that it had to build deep cuts into a budget in order to force itself to take action to avoid them \u2014 and still failed.\n\nAnother panelist, Philip Swagel, gave a nod to that idea by listing many of the reasons the current recovery has been especially weak. The recovery was held back by policy choices, Swagel said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just problematic that we have a \u201cdisruptive political system,\u201d Swagel argued. Also working against us was the fact that the economy had to absorb \u201cdisruptive change in a recession,\u201d via big policies like the Affordable Care Act and Dodd-Frank and ongoing questions about smaller changes like lending in the housing market.\n\nIt seems silly to pin hopes for a robust recession response on a government that draws fire for wanting to shrink itself at a time when fiscal stimulus is needed \u2014 but also gets criticized for the policies that it does enact.\n\nAnd that\u2019s playing out even as debt as a share of GDP is set to balloon about eight percentage points over the next decade, and the Federal Reserve is struggling to get enough economic traction to warrant having interest rates high enough that they can be easily reduced, other panelists reminded the audience.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Academics, policy experts, and economists see many challenges stacked against the U.S. economy that will prevent us from having a strong recession response when the next downturn comes.", "creator": "@ARiquier", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS775_capito_MG_20140116164632.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Andrea Riquier", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Academics, policy experts, and economists see many challenges stacked against the U.S. economy that will prevent us from having a strong recession response when the next downturn comes.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-the-us-isnt-prepared-for-the-next-recession-2016-03-22", "author": "Andrea Riquier", "parsely-title": "Why the U.S. isn\u2019t prepared for the next recession", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-03-22T10:59:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Academics, policy experts, and economists see many challenges stacked against the U.S. economy that will prevent us from having a strong recession response when the next downturn comes.", "title": "Why the U.S. isn\u2019t prepared for the next recession", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-the-us-isnt-prepared-for-the-next-recession-2016-03-22", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS775_capito_MG_20140116164632.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS775_capito_MG_20140116164632.jpg"}, "article.id": "12FFEBF0-F039-11E5-AC38-1787F02E5773", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "But at the Brookings Institution Monday, conclusions from an \u201cexpert\u201d panel of academics, policy analysts, and investors weren\u2019t much cheerier.\nAre we ready for the next recession?\nAnother panelist, Philip Swagel, gave a nod to that idea by listing many of the reasons the current recovery has been especially weak.\nThe recovery was held back by policy choices, Swagel said.\nFar too many ordinary Americans might snort at such a question."}
