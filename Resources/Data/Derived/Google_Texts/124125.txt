The Hill:

“These deeply troubling allegations should disqualify anyone from a seat in the U.S. Senate,” Reid said in a statement, which was first reported by The Associated Press.

“Alan Grayson used his status as a congressman to unethically promote his Cayman Islands hedge funds, and he should drop out of the Senate race immediately. His actions aren't just disgraceful to the Democratic Party, they disgrace the halls of Congress,” he continued.

Grayson, a liberal firebrand, is running in a heated primary battle against Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.) for the swing seat vacated by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is running for president. The Democratic establishment has rallied around Murphy and have tried to push out Grayson to avoid a bruising primary.

In response to Reid, Grayson on Friday fired back, arguing that he's running against the "Washington Establishment."

"Sen. Reid may well prefer corrupt Establishment errand boy Patrick Murphy, who routinely sells his vote to Wall Street lobbyists, and just last week hid from voting on his own bill providing amnesty to white-collar criminals," Grayson said in a statement.

"Those are actions that truly disgrace our party and the Halls of Congress," he added.

Grayson also pushed back on the reports about his fund, calling them "misleading statements" and "outright lies."
