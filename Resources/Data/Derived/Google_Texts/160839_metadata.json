Cruz declines to admit defeat\n\nIn the end, the federal government opened back up, Obamacare stayed funded and Republicans took a beating in the polls.\n\nBut in the final hours of the fiscal crisis, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was resolute and firm, declining to admit defeat and instead chastising the \u201cWashington establishment\u201d for waving the white flag on the health care law.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCruz, the chief crusader against the president\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement, repeatedly defended his ambitions to shred Obamacare \u2014 long viewed as a fruitless battle as long as Democrats controlled the Senate and President Barack Obama occupied the White House.\n\nAnd Cruz made sure to take one more poke at fellow Senate Republicans, who \u2014 in recent weeks \u2014 made no secret of their frustration toward him as the shutdown dragged on and a default seemed imminent.\n\n( WATCH: Timeline of Ted Cruz\u2019s Obamacare crusade)\n\n\u201cIn particular, we saw real division among Senate Republicans,\u201d Cruz told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cThat was unfortunate. I would point out that had Senate Republicans united and supported House Republicans, the outcome of this I believe would\u2019ve been very, very different.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the senator and potential 2016 presidential contender\u2019s crusade has riven the GOP, helped instigate the first federal government shutdown in 17 years and overshadowed Obamacare\u2019s bumpy rollout that began Oct. 1. The GOP took a hammering in public polls \u2014 Gallup said Oct. 9 the Republican Party\u2019s favorability rating collapsed to an all-time low of 28 percent.\n\nThat has led to questions about what Cruz gained out of this fight and whether it was worth it \u2014 for Republicans, and for him personally. Although his relationships with his GOP Senate colleagues might be at an all-time low, Cruz\u2019s national profile has been enhanced.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: House conservatives come to Boehner's defense)\n\nMore people nationwide now know who Cruz is, particularly following his 21-hour anti-Obamacare marathon speech on the Senate floor last month that galvanized grass-roots conservatives. According to Gallup figures released Oct. 10, 62 percent of Americans have an opinion of the senator \u2014 20 percentage points higher compared with numbers from June. But his net favorability was down 16 points, according to the poll.\n\nThe influential Senate freshman described the grass-roots uprising against Obamacare as \u201cremarkable\u201d and praised the House for taking a \u201ccourageous stand\u201d in its fight against the health care law, which Cruz called a \u201cprofile in courage.\u201d He insisted to reporters that there will be future opportunities to revisit the Obamacare fight, while declining to elaborate.\n\n\u201cIf the American people continue to rise up, I believe the House will continue to listen to the American people,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI hope that in time, the Senate begins to listen to the American people.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s colleagues were reluctant to directly criticize him on Wednesday as lawmakers neared the end of a federal government shutdown in its 16th day and a resolution that would lift the nation\u2019s debt limit. Several GOP senators deflected specific questions about Cruz\u2019s influence in the fiscal fight.\n\n( WATCH: Reid, McConnell announce debt ceiling, shutdown deal)\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who memorably sparred with Cruz on the Senate floor last month over the ACA defunding strategy, declined on Wednesday to comment on the Texan specifically but added: \u201cI do wish we had focused on fiscal solvency as our goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if that\u2019s what we focus on, we have a chance to be successful and have a fruitful discussion,\u201d Corker said of cutting government spending. \u201cIf it\u2019s about something that is totally unachievable, then we may end up in exactly the same place.\u201d\n\nWhen asked Wednesday what the Republican Party gained from the shutdown fight, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) quipped: \u201cSomeone would have to explain that to me.\u201d\n\n\u201dI\u2019ve expressed my deep distress throughout this process,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI\u2019ve said from the beginning that I knew how this was going to end \u2026 we weren\u2019t going to defund Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAdded Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): \u201cOur numbers have gone down, and Obamacare has somehow mysteriously gone up.\u201d\n\nRep. Peter King of New York \u2014 one of the Texas senator\u2019s biggest GOP critics on Capitol Hill \u2014 said Cruz got \u201cnothing\u201d out of his anti-Obamacare battle.\n\n\u201cProbably some campaign contributions,\u201d King said. \u201cThat\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\nCruz did rake in the cash, ringing up nearly $800,000 in the third quarter through his joint fundraising committee, according to Federal Election Commission records. His overall haul for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $1.19 million, according to multiple reports.\n\nBoth Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, Cruz\u2019s compatriot in the anti-Obamacare fight, spoke up at the closed-door party meeting on Wednesday morning at which leaders unveiled the details of the agreement. The two senators said they would not object to swift consideration of the deal but said little otherwise, according to sources.\n\nLee kept a much lower profile on Wednesday. He did not immediately issue a statement on the agreement negotiated between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and he was barely spotted by reporters roaming Capitol Hill. He delivered a floor speech early Wednesday evening, saying \u201cit\u2019s always worth it to do the right thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cFighting against an abusive government in defense of protecting the individual rights of the American people is always the right thing,\u201d Lee said. \u201cSome say we shouldn\u2019t have fought because we couldn\u2019t win, but this country wasn\u2019t built by fighting only when victory was absolutely certain.\u201d\n\nCriticism of Cruz also came courtesy of the Houston Chronicle, a large home-state newspaper which lamented in an editorial that Cruz has been \u201cpart of the problem\u201d whereas his predecessor, former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), would not have been.\n\nAlabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who sided with Cruz on a key procedural vote in the Obamacare-shutdown fight in September, acknowledged Wednesday that there had been an \u201cunfortunate series of events in some ways\u201d over the past several weeks.\n\n\u201cBut I do think the Republican Party has demonstrated that it\u2019s committed to altering Obamacare and it\u2019s committed to improving our financial situation of the republic, and the president steadfastly refused both,\u201d added Sessions, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cSo it\u2019s pretty clarifying of where each person stood.\u201d\n\nOther stalwart conservatives, like Cruz, were defiant that their attack against the health care law was not in vain \u2014 despite losing the battle over ripping it apart in the government funding fight.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWhat we did is fought the right fight.\u201d\n\nManu Raju contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He defends his push to target Obamacare during the government funding battle.", "title": "Cruz declines to admit defeat", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/ted-cruz-government-shutdown-98398.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/16/131014_ted_cruz_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Ted Cruz (314),Government Shutdown (763),Obamacare (659)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He defends his push to target Obamacare during the government funding battle.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "( WATCH: Timeline of Ted Cruz\u2019s Obamacare crusade)\u201cIn particular, we saw real division among Senate Republicans,\u201d Cruz told reporters on Wednesday.\nAlthough his relationships with his GOP Senate colleagues might be at an all-time low, Cruz\u2019s national profile has been enhanced.\nAnd Cruz made sure to take one more poke at fellow Senate Republicans, who \u2014 in recent weeks \u2014 made no secret of their frustration toward him as the shutdown dragged on and a default seemed imminent.\nCruz declines to admit defeatIn the end, the federal government opened back up, Obamacare stayed funded and Republicans took a beating in the polls.\nThat has led to questions about what Cruz gained out of this fight and whether it was worth it \u2014 for Republicans, and for him personally."}
