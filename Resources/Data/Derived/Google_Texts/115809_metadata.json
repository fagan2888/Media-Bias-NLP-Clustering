By the end of the summer all of Tulsa proper and Broken Arrow, Jenks, and Bixby will be included, he said.\n\nCustomers pay a $6 delivery fee. There is also a 5 percent processing fee that is standard with restaurant delivery services, he said.\n\nCustomers also typically tip the drivers on average about 12 percent, Favalora said.\n\nHe said that the service has been popular at places such as hospitals, where groups of nurses or medical workers place an order together because they are working long shifts and sometimes it is troublesome to move their cars or leave.\n\n\"We have a real high level of customer service from the time they place an order. We confirm with an email and send a countdown clock,\" Favalora said. \"Once the drivers leave the restaurant, our call center makes a phone call and lets the customer know the food is on its way.\"\n\nOrders less than $75 typically take between 45 and 60 minutes. If it is more than an hour, the customer receives a free delivery the next time.\n\nDrivers are equipped with heated bags so the food stays hot until delivered.\n\nThere are 18 locations across the country where Mr. Delivery operates. Eventually, they hope to have 200 locations with the entire company based in Tulsa.\n\nThe company is also working with nonprofits in the communities that it serves.\n\nIn Tulsa, they are currently working with John 3:16.\n\nThe nonprofit receives a code that it can provide to its members. The members provide that code when placing an order, and Mr. Delivery donates a meal to someone in need through John 3:16, Favalora said.\n\nThe delivery service operates from 11 a.m. until 10 p.m., he said. They are always looking for new drivers and restaurants to join them, he said.\n\n\"We are always looking to add to the list of Tulsa's finest eating establishments,\" Favalora said.\n\nFor more information go to mrdelivery.com or call 918-791-3450.\n\nNicole Marshall Middleton 918-581-8459\n\nHere are the restaurants that are currently working with Mr. Delivery:", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "The next time you feel like having food from one of your favorite Tulsa restaurants, you may not even need to leave your couch.", "title": "Service delivers culinary favorites to your door", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/food/service-delivers-culinary-favorites-to-your-door/article_691553e6-4a6f-5d97-995f-21152e31ca06.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/cd/bcd6c256-b1b5-5afc-a97a-770a62271ad2/52ff1f6172327.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C351", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The next time you feel like having food from one of your favorite Tulsa restaurants, you may not even need to leave your couch.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "delivery,customer,tulsa,restaurants,service,favalora,drivers,order,working,call,food,scene,scenelatest,scenehomepage2", "news_keywords": "delivery,customer,tulsa,restaurants,service,favalora,drivers,order,working,call,food,scene,scenelatest,scenehomepage2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c09\"", "article_summary": "The delivery service area is currently from Interstate 244 south to 93rd Street and Sheridan Road west to Riverside Drive.\nThe delivery service operates from 11 a.m. until 10 p.m., he said.\nThe next time you feel like having food from one of your favorite Tulsa restaurants, you may not even need to leave your couch.\nDelivery, a new delivery service that allows customers to order off the menus of 18 different local restaurants, launched in Tulsa a few weeks ago.\n\"We have a real high level of customer service from the time they place an order."}
