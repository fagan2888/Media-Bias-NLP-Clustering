Berthoud would beat Mullen 5-4 in a walk-off in the eighth inning, but lose its next round to Ponderosa 6-0. ( Timothy Hurst )\n\nAURORA -- Things looked horribly bleak for Berthoud in the opening round of the Class 4A tournament.\n\nDown to their final out, the Spartans trailed No. 10 Mullen by one run, but a clutch single by shortstop Sami Kouns tied the game and a RBI double in extra innings by Larissa Royer sent Berthoud on to the quarterfinals.\n\nThat's when Berthoud's good fortune ran out. The Spartans seemed flat and tapped after the exhausting first-round victory, and had trouble minimizing errorsagainst a talented No. 2 seeded Ponderosa team. They would lose 6-0, three of the runs unearned.\n\nSaturday was a hard exit to an otherwise strong season in which Berthoud picked up 17 victories and won its region. Undoubtedly disappointed, the players and coaches realize what they accomplished would be the envy of many teams.\n\n\"We're all sad and upset because we lost, but we made a good run. Going 17-6 this season is something to be proud of,\" junior Jessica Boruff said. \"It's hard to see (the seniors) go, I mean, there were eight of them. It's tough to see them go because next year I'll be the only senior.\"\n\nAlso falling in the quarterfinals Saturday was Mountain View. The Mountain Lions continued their torrid pace leading up to the tournament with a dominant 17-2 win over Valor Christian in the morning. Eighth-seeded MVHS jumped all over the ninth-seeded Eagles, sending 18 batters to the plate and scoring 12 runs in the first inning to extend their win streak to 13 games.\n\nBut in the afternoon, the Lions ran into top-seeded Wheat Ridge, which advanced to Sunday's semifinals with a 9-4 victory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We just couldn't string hits together, and we faced a tougher pitcher than we've faced for a while and a good hitting team. That's why they're Wheat Ridge, that's why they're ranked where they are,\" said Lions coach Randy Felton, whose team finished the season 16-7. \"It was tough to go down, but it happens. Every team out here is going to have this feeling we have right now except for one.\"\n\n102013 SPO MVHSSoftball001 tfh.JPG Mountain View freshman second baseman Tara Shadowen makes contact during a game against Valor Christian at the Class 4A state softball tournament. Shadowen would hit a three-run home run in the game, but the Mountain Lions fell short to top-seeded Wheat Ridge 9-4. ( Timothy Hurst )\n\nThe Lions fell behind 7-0 after three innings. But like their season as a whole, they didn't give up, scoring a run in the fourth and three more in the fifth on a three-run home run by Tara Shadowen. The freshman was 3-for-4 in the game, coming up just a double shy of hitting for the cycle.\n\nWith Shadowen one several key pieces returning next year, the future looks bright for the Lions. But, they'll be moving on without four seniors that made a big impact on the program in Mia Trujillo, Ali Reed, Taya McWilliams and Danie McFarland.\n\nAnother team that would love to have made it to the next round was Roosevelt, which was matched up with top-seeded Wheat Ridge in round one. Despite being heavy favorites, the Farmers were held at bay by a strong outing from pitcher Stevie Wadsworth, who punched out eight batters in the game.\n\nBut on offense, the RoughRiders couldn't get started against the toughest pitcher they'd seen this season.\n\n\"Against top teams you have to be on top of your game in every phase, and we were a little short of that today,\" RHS coach Alan Gibson said. \"Still, we are very proud of the girls and the season they had.\"\n\nNo. 13 Thompson Valley was also up against a big task when it faced No. 3 Pueblo East in the first round. TVHS enjoyed a brief 2-1 lead against the defending state champions thanks to a two-run home run by Allie Mason in the third inning. But Pueblo East's lineup was too much to handle, as the third seed put the game away with a five-run fifth that made it 8-2.\n\nThough loaded with young talent, Thompson Valley will have to reload next year without seniors Cheyenne Delaney, Janelle Krening and Hannah Thollot.\n\n\"Not one of them would I ever question their heart or dedication to this program,\" said TVHS coach Bryon Rutherford, whose team capped its record at 15-7. \"Those three, their passion for the game is as great as mine, and that's what I love about those three.\"\n\nCris Tiller can be reached at 669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com or on Twitter @cristiller.\n\nClass 4A State Tournament\n\nGame 1\n\nMountain Lions 17, Eagles 2\n\nAt Aurora Sports Park\n\nValor Christian (17-6) 002 0 -- 2 6 0\n\nMountain View (16-7) 1232 X -- 17 18 0\n\nW -- Mia Trujillo.
