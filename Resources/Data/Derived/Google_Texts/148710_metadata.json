But out like a lamb?\n\nScammers continue to be anything but sheepish in trying to steal your money and identity.\n\nWitness the recent return of the jury duty scam. That\u2019s when fraudsters, posing as courthouse officials or police, telephone with claims you missed jury duty.\n\nBecause of that, they threaten, you\u2019re going to be arrested unless a fine is immediately paid \u2013 sometimes requested by credit card, but usually a harder-to-track prepaid debit card such as Green Dot MoneyPak. Say you never received a jury notice, and you\u2019ll be asked for personal information \u2013 including your Social Security number \u2013 to \u201ccheck our records\u201d and possibly avoid consequences, the scammers allege.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Money newsletter\n\nNonsense. Legitimate jury notices \u2013 and \u201cno-show\u201d and other summonses \u2013 will be delivered by U.S. mail, not telephone. Jury duty assignments are based on voter registration or property records, not your SSN. And police will never call to ask for payment to avoid a warrant or arrest, nor give advance warning of impending handcuffs.\n\nBut as demonstrated by this fast-growing scheme (which in recent weeks prompted real warnings \u2013 and victims \u2013 across the U.S.), fear and threats work for scammers. Especially when they target older Americans.\n\nLast year, the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center announced that those 50 and older accounted for about half of the nearly $11 million in losses from intimidation schemes reported to that agency.\n\nAnd those were threats made only over the Internet. (Also, that figure is likely just the tip of the iceberg. Most victims are too embarrassed to report getting scammed, or too scared when told to keep mum \u201cor else.\u201d)\n\nA menacing voice on the phone can be much scarier. Especially when in addition to police, scammers pose as IRS agents to solicit money and personal information.\n\nOr as utility company reps who say your service will be terminated because of unpaid bills.\n\nOr as debt collectors, real or fake, who threaten lawsuits and arrest unless you pay them immediately.\n\nOr as cohorts in the Grandparents Scam, claiming to be jailers with the key your offspring\u2019s freedom.\n\nOr even as lottery officials who first congratulate you for winning millions, then say you need to pay taxes to claim it \u2013 and if you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll come to your home and beat you. (That\u2019s a trademark of Jamaica-based scammers, who may cite a nearby location using Google maps.)\n\nTelephone technology helps make scammers\u2019 threats more convincing; your caller ID can be spoofed to display a name and phone number of their choosing \u2013 Medicare, the IRS or \u201cUnavailable.\u201d\n\n>> Get discounts on financial services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nSo don\u2019t assume that the \u201cagency\u201d shown to be calling is actually calling. Hang up on any threatening phone call and confirm for yourself any alleged debts or infractions directly with the proper \u201caccuser.\u201d The same applies to threats received by computer.\n\nReal notices should come by U.S. mail \u2013 including at least one \u201cpayment due\u201d announcement before utility service is shut off.\n\nIf trouble comes knocking, don\u2019t open the door to unexpected servicemen or government workers; their badges can be fake. Real police will likely have a marked car outside, and their hand will hold a warrant, not be open for money.\n\nPhoto: iStock\n\nFor information about other scams, sign up for the Fraud Watch Network.
