Visitors have been able to see Kirk Vaughn-Robinson at work, creating an oversized sculpture of Cernunnos, a Celtic god of the forest, and some hard-to-miss, 4-foot origami bats for Halloween.\n\nNow the artist-in-residence has one final project to represent his time at Fontenelle Forest during its \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d exhibit. Today, he will unveil both a children's book he wrote and an outdoor sculpture he created based on characters in the book.\n\nIn keeping with the green theme, his three art projects have been created with recycled materials, such as aluminum window screens, moss, dryer lint, inner tubes and tire treads, 2-liter plastic bottles, bubble wrap, burlap, tape and a plant-fiber and limestone clay.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to take something with a common use and turn it into something more sophisticated,\u201d Vaughn-Robinson said. \u201cIt was fun to come up with new ideas.\u201d\n\nForest officials think there is a positive and fun link between artists' works and what is found at the forest.\n\n\u201cWe're a science-based organization, but art can provide a connection to nature and to science,\u201d said Brad Watkins, Fontenelle Forest director of communications.\n\nVaughn-Robinson's book, \u201cThe Chorus of the Forest,\u201d tells the story of a little boy named Kit who loves Halloween costumes and doesn't want to go to school. Kit, wearing one of his costumes, wanders into Fontenelle Forest and there he stumbles on the Beast. Kit decides he will capture the Beast, take it to school for show and tell, and then keep it at home.\n\nOf course, none of those things is a good idea, and the boy learns some important but gentle lessons: Don't be afraid to be yourself, and don't take wild things away from their home in the forest.\n\nVaughn-Robinson, who also is a singer and an actor, said he started his art career while he was touring nationally as a cast member of \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera.\u201d During downtime at the theater and in hotel rooms, he began sketching and sculpting. One of the sketches he created was \u201cKit and the Beast.\u201d\n\nWhen the tour ended, \u201cI was homeless and unemployed,\u201d he said with a laugh. He eventually ended up in Omaha, a place he had visited while touring and where he thought he could find work in its artistic community. He was right.\n\n\u201cDoors opened for me here,\u201d he said.\n\nIn August, Watkins brought him on board as an artist-in-residence at Fontenelle Forest. By then, Vaughn-Robinson had come up with a story based on the \u201cKit\u201d sketch.\n\nThe artist's work will culminate in the Saturday event, where he will discuss his art projects and unveil the sculpture as well as sign copies of \u201cThe Chorus of the Forest.\u201d There also will be activities and treats for kids.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "For the last few months, artist-in-residence Kirk Vaughn-Robinson has been hard at work, creating an oversized sculpture of a Celtic god, 4-foot origami bats for Halloween, and an outdoor sculpture based on characters in a children's book he wrote.", "title": "Fontenelle Forest provides the backdrop for artist's outdoor sculptures", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/fontenelle-forest-provides-the-backdrop-for-artist-s-outdoor-sculptures/article_9e6f4119-010c-519b-8d83-58f620d4265a.html", "image": {"width": 506, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/6c/56cfdce8-741f-5245-b05c-52e5ef45d38a/5332e04faa202.image.jpg?resize=506%2C675", "height": 675}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "For the last few months, artist-in-residence Kirk Vaughn-Robinson has been hard at work, creating an oversized sculpture of a Celtic god, 4-foot origami bats for Halloween, and an outdoor sculpture based on characters in a children's book he wrote.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "Now the artist-in-residence has one final project to represent his time at Fontenelle Forest during its \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d exhibit.\nFor the last few months, an artist has been hard at work at the Fontenelle Forest Nature Center.\n\u201cWe're a science-based organization, but art can provide a connection to nature and to science,\u201d said Brad Watkins, Fontenelle Forest director of communications.\nKit, wearing one of his costumes, wanders into Fontenelle Forest and there he stumbles on the Beast.\nIn August, Watkins brought him on board as an artist-in-residence at Fontenelle Forest."}
