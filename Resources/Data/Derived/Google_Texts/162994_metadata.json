They're called Bitcoins -- a digital form of money. And now they're being accepted at some places in Oklahoma City.\n\nThere are three main forms of currency: Check, credit or debit cards and cold hard cash. But now, at least one metro business is cashing in on a new trend: Bitcoin.\n\nThe best way to think of Bitcoin is like stock. The value can rise and fall on a daily basis resulting from the people that use them. Currently one Bitcoin is equal to $583. But in December the value was over $1,000 to 1. The risk is yours.\n\nVice President of Central National Bank said in part: Bitcoin is a fad that's unregulated...and he would not encourage customers to invest.\n\nA response Dr. Keith Smith says he expected from a banker.\n\n\"Anything the Federal Reserve gets upset about I tend to think it might be a good idea,\" said Smith.\n\nSmith runs the Surgery Center of Oklahoma and is more than willing to accept Bitcoin.\n\n\"It's a simple conversion to dollars,\" Smith said. \"My stance is if they want to pay with pigs or chickens, we can figure out a conversion.\"\n\nSo instead of you paying at the Surgery Center of Oklahoma with cash or check, if you want to pay with Bitcoins they simply make a conversion and charge accordingly.\n\n\"When they see we are willing to make arrangements on this end to accommodate their pay, it's a very customer friendly business. That's the nature of the free market. And me accepting bitcoins is just that,\" said Smith.\n\nA Bitcoin can also be converted to Euros or Yen and there is no fee to set up an account, which only takes about 15 minutes.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Already popular in Europe and Asia, a new form of currency is sweeping its way across America.
