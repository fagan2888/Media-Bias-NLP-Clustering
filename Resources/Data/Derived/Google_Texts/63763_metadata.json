You\u2019d have to live under a rock not to know something big was happening.\u201d\n\nThe results mirrored 2012, when former House Speaker Newt Gingrich took all but three South Carolina counties. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who finished second, eked out wins in Richland, Beaufort and Charleston counties \u2014 just enough to win a few delegates.\n\nTrump won Beaufort County but lost the two others to Sen. Marco Rubio, who finished second Saturday but is uncertain about getting any delegates.\n\nSabato said Trump is a polarizing candidate whose coalition runs through most demographic and geographic categories, so it transcends some of the usual political divisions in a state like South Carolina.\n\n\u201cWhile the Palmetto State really doesn\u2019t have any truly liberal areas, Charleston and Columbia could fairly be called moderate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes sense that Trump would have more problems there. Also, the higher the educational level in a locality, the smaller the probability that Trump will carry it or do as well as his statewide average.\u201d\n\nThe regional differences did play more of a role in second place. Rubio performed stronger along the coast, just enough to edge out Cruz, who finished second in most Upstate counties.\n\nWhile Ohio Gov. John Kasich managed a third-place finish in Beaufort County, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush couldn\u2019t manage a top-three showing anywhere \u2014 yet another contributing factor as to why he chose to suspend his campaign Saturday night.\n\n\u201cBush\u2019s candidacy has been dead for some time, but he had so much money and so many famous relatives that he was able to continue when other candidates would have dropped out,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cEven in pro-Bush South Carolina, three Bushes turned out to be one too many. And that\u2019s been obvious for months.\u201d\n\nAs of press time, Trump had won at least 44 of the state\u2019s 50 delegates. More votes are needed in individual congressional districts to determine who won the six other delegates.\n\nTrump leads the overall race for delegates with 55. Ted Cruz has 11 delegates, Marco Rubio has 10, John Kasich has five, Jeb Bush has four and Ben Carson has three. A Republican candidate needs 1,237 delegates to win.\n\nExit polls taken in South Carolina found that about 75 percent of GOP voters support a temporary ban on Muslims who are not American citizens from entering the United States \u2014 one of Trump\u2019s signature proposals, according to The Associated Press.\n\nReach Robert Behre at 843-937-5771 or at twitter.com/RobertFBehre.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "A record vote, a resounding result in South Carolina GOP primary, Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nMetro, \r\nPalmetto Politics, \r\nPalmetto Politics, 2016 presidential election,Anderson County,Berkeley County,Charleston County,Donald Trump,Dorchester County,Greenville County,Horry County,Jeb Bush,John Kasich,Larry Sabato,Marco Rubio,South Carolina,Ted Cruz", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "A presidential primary like no other drew a record number of South Carolina Republicans to the polls.", "title": "A record vote, a resounding result in South Carolina GOP primary", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20160220/160229855/a-record-vote-a-resounding-result-in-south-carolina-gop-primary", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160220/PC16/160229855/AR/0/AR-160229855.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160220/PC16/160229855/AR/0/AR-160229855.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A presidential primary like no other drew a record number of South Carolina Republicans to the polls.", "title": "A record vote, a resounding result in South Carolina GOP primary", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160220/PC16/160229855/AR/0/AR-160229855.jpg?201602202303", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 160229855}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "A record vote, a resounding result in South Carolina GOP primary , Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nMetro, \r\nPalmetto Politics, \r\nPalmetto Politics, 2016 presidential election,Anderson County,Berkeley County,Charleston County,Donald Trump,Dorchester County,Greenville County,Horry County,Jeb Bush,John Kasich,Larry Sabato,Marco Rubio,South Carolina,Ted Cruz", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-20T22:56:48Z", "modified_time": "2016-02-20T23:03:00Z", "author": "Robert Behre"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A presidential primary like no other drew a record number of South Carolina Republicans to the polls."}, "article_summary": "A presidential primary like no other drew a record number of South Carolina Republicans to the polls.\nThat\u2019s up from the previous turnout record for a GOP presidential primary set in 2012, when 603,770 voted \u2014 or 22 percent of state voters at that time.\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember a South Carolina race that received this kind of blanket national coverage.\nAsked about the biggest factors that fueled Saturday\u2019s record turnout, Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, offered three reasons: \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump.\u201d\u201cNews media coverage had a lot to do with it, too,\u201d he added.\n\u201cEven in pro-Bush South Carolina, three Bushes turned out to be one too many."}
