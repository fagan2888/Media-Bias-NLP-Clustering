Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) knocked the Obama administration's integrity during a Google Hangout with constituents on Monday.

Cornyn expressed his disapproval of the way the White House has handled the muddled Obamacare rollout, likening their "willingness to mislead people" on the benefits of the Affordable Care Act to, as he said, concealing information on the Benghazi attacks from the public.

“I think the current administration has taken lying to a new level,” he said. “To me, that’s the one thing I find most aggravating about what’s happening in Washington these days, particularly about this administration. Which is a lack of accountability and the willingness to mislead people or provide them just demonstrably false information and expect to be able to move on."

Cornyn has scrutinized President Barack Obama and his health care program since its debut, saying in an October interview that the president went "AWOL" during government shutdown negotiations, and expressing "concern about what Obamacare is doing to our economy."

Last week, the senator posited that the Obama administration was engaging in a nuclear deal with Iran to "distract attention" from Obamacare.
