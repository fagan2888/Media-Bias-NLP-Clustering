Today, there are over 100 thousand (100,547).\n\nDissatisfaction with the two parties, Augustana College Political Science professor Emily Wanless said.\n\nAugustana College Political Science professor Emily Wanless says voters, not only in South Dakota, but across the entire country are moving away from mainstream party affiliation for a number of reasons.\n\n\u201cWhether it's the policy stances of the parties, whether it's the candidates the parties are putting forward, Independents are seeing support from voters, its dissatisfaction,\" Wanless said.\n\nSome political pundits claim, Independent voters are just uniformed about the candidates and issues and choose Independent as their party preference as to not align themselves with any particular party.\n\n\u201cVoters like the idea of being themselves, independent thinkers, they don't necessarily like the two parties that we have, so we are going to say, 'we are Independent,' but when it comes down to it, typically we see voters having a strong preference for one party or the other,\" Wanless said,\n\nIn other words Wanless says, just because someone is registered Independent, doesn't necessarily mean they'll vote for an Independent candidate.\n\n\u201cThey typically don't do very well, I would say less than 10% get about five percent of the vote or more,\" Wanless said.\n\nThe numbers reflect that. There are only two Independents in the Senate right now and none in the house.\n\nWanless says during an election, Independent candidates usually fight an uphill battle for a number of reasons.\n\n\u201cFinancially they don't have the backing from outside organizations that support traditional Republican or Democratic candidates, parties themselves produce a lot of funding, they also have an infrastructure to get voters to the polls,\" Wanless said.\n\nCongress' approval rating is at an all-time low, but the question is, if there is truly dissatisfaction in Washington, will it be enough to cause change.\n\n\u201cI've always been sick of the politics in Washington,\" Person said.\n\n\"I don't think it has anything to do with that we just need to get the right people into office and take care of that,\" Boen said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "They&#39;re often referred to as the spoilers of any election; the Independent voter.
