BOWDOINHAM, Maine â€” A Brunswick man escaped serious injury on Tuesday after his car rammed into an Interstate 295 guardrail and subsequently caught fire, police said.

Kenneth Johnson, 50, apparently fell asleep at the wheel while heading southbound in Bowdoinham, according to Department of Public Safety spokesman Stephen McCausland.

The impact of the crash peeled back about 50 feet of guardrail, McCausland said. Johnson was wearing his seat belt and escaped with minor injuries.

The crash, which was reported at about 1 p.m., forced traffic to be reduced to one lane, McCausland said.

The vehicle fire was quickly extinguished by a fire extinguisher. Charges are not expected in the crash.
