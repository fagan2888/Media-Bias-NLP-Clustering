And with Texas acquiring Fielder, who will now be their primary first baseman, where does this leave Moreland?\n\nWell, it leaves him in a new role as an occasional first baseman, designated hitter and someone who can play both corner outfield spots. The Amory native and Mississippi State product said he\u2019s talked to Texas assistant general manager Thad Levine and manager Ron Washington about his new role and is embracing the change.\n\n\u201cI can do it,\u201d said Moreland, who appeared recently at the Rangers Winter Caravan. \u201cI kind of did it coming up. I think I played more outfield than first base in the minors. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s entirely new to me. I think with a little work, I can get back out there and hopefully pick up on it real quick.\u201d\n\nMoreland hasn\u2019t played any outfield since 2011, so he plans to work with Rangers outfield coach Gary Pettis, a former big-league outfielder who won five Gold Gloves during his 11-year career in the big leagues, to re-acclimate himself to playing there.\n\nAnd there are the rumors of him being traded to another organization before the start of spring training even though the Rangers have said they will be keeping the ex-Bulldog around. But the 28-year-old said he can\u2019t concern himself with things that are out of his hands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be here and I\u2019m looking forward to the season. Yes, I want to be here,\u201d Moreland said.\n\nBut no matter what roles he holds with the Rangers in 2014 and beyond, Washington stated last season that he wants Mitch to just relax and have fun playing the game he clearly loves, something that continues to be a work in progress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough for me because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve had to do to get to where I am. I\u2019ve always felt like I\u2019ve worked to get here,\u201d Moreland said. \u201cAt times, I go to the extreme with that. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve worked on this off-season, just more quality than quantity when I\u2019m going about my business.\u201d\n\nSteve Hunt is a freelance writer based in Frisco, Texas.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Steve Hunt Special to the Journal FRISCO, Texas \u2013 After hitting .232 with 23 home runs and 60 RBI in 88 games in 2013, a season where the Texas Rangers lost to Tampa Bay in the American League wild card play-in game, Mitch Moreland knew changes would be made this winter.
