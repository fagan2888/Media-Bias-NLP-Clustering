The second day of racing in the Flying Scot Midwinters was just another day in paradise. No postponement was needed today, since the steady west-northwest wind (10-15 mph) showed up right on time. Once again the race committee ran three races, this time two four-leg windward-leewards, and one five-leg windward leeward.The leaders frequently changed places. In the Championship Series, Paul Abdullah and Alex Krumdieck (Jacksonville) won the first race, Ned Johnston and Ryan Donahue (Maine) won the second and Mark Taylor and Andy Hayward (Tampa) won the third.Consistency paid off for Zeke and Jay Horowitz (Sarasota), who are currently the leaders (14 points), though they finished third twice and second once today. Also in the trophy hunt are Jeff and Amy Linton (Tampa), second with 18 points. Abdullah and Krumdieck are tied for third with David Ames and PJ Buhler (Tampa) with 35 points.

In the Challenger Series, Lawrence and Ruth Bigus from Kansas City won the first race. Norris Elswick (Bradenton) and crew Chuck Tanner (Sarasota) won the second and third races.

Overall, Jim Leggette and Mike Funk (Jackson, MS) are leading with 18 points, Randy Rubinstein and Jim Cavanagh (Sarasota) are second with 21 points, and David Strawbridge and Joseph Connelly (St. James City, FL) are tied with Elswick and Tanner for third with 29 points.
