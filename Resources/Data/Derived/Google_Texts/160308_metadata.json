Sri Lanka has borrowed $2.15 billion through two 10-year sovereign bonds and more than $1.7 billion from development bonds this year. It has also used a $1.5 billion swap from the Reserve bank of India.\n\n\"Weak external liquidity is a central sovereign credit weakness,\" Andrew Colquhoun, head of Asia-Pacific Sovereigns at Fitch Ratings told Reuters, adding that 2016 would be a challenging year due to an expected U.S. interest rate rise and stronger dollar.\n\nOfficial foreign currency reserves stood at $7.3 billion on Nov. 30 but are under pressure as $4.75 billion is expected to be repaid on foreign loans before November 2016, central bank data showed.\n\n(Reporting by Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal; Editing by Robert Birsel)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "COLOMBO (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday warned Sri Lanka", "title": "IMF warns Sri Lanka of uncertain outlook, loose monetary, fiscal policies", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/10/IMF-warns-Sri-Lanka-uncertain-outlook-loose-monetary-fiscal-policies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/srilanka-coin_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/10/IMF-warns-Sri-Lanka-uncertain-outlook-loose-monetary-fiscal-policies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/srilanka-coin_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "COLOMBO (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday warned Sri Lanka", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "COLOMBO (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday warned Sri Lanka of an uncertain economic outlook, loose monetary and fiscal policies and urged appropriate action including structural reforms to safeguard economic stability.\nThe global lender said tighter fiscal and monetary policies could help restrict aggregate demand, contain a recent sharp rise in imports and strengthen the external balance.\nSri Lanka has borrowed $2.15 billion through two 10-year sovereign bonds and more than $1.7 billion from development bonds this year.\nEconomists say a flexible exchange rate alone would not help Sri Lanka get rid of its external vulnerability as its loose monetary and expansionary fiscal policies weigh on the currency.\nHowever, the IMF said, these policies should be supported by greater flexibility in the exchange rate, reduced foreign exchange intervention, efforts to deepen the foreign exchange market and structural reforms to enhance competitiveness."}
