They wanted to be able to just walk in, and have more convenient hours,\u201d health director Adi Pour said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like appointments, and they just needed different hours because they\u2019re at work or at school during the day. We listened to our youth.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn 2004, the STD trend was labeled as an epidemic in Douglas County.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was unacceptable,\u201d Pour said. \u201cThe levels that we saw in our community were higher than the national average, and have been higher than the Nebraska average.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Douglas County saw over 3,000 cases of chlamydia alone.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat's not what this community wants, and that is not what we want to be known for,\u201d Pour said.\n\n\n\nThe department hopes to target youth between the ages of 15 and 20 with the extended hours. That age group has the highest number of positives within the community, according to the health department.\n\n\n\nStarting Sept. 1, walk-in hours will be from noon through 7:45 p.m. Tuesday through Friday. On Saturday, the clinic will be open from 9 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.\n\nThe clinic is located at the Douglas County Health Department in Omaha at 1111 South 41st Street.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Wed, 15 Jul 2015 11:51:43 CDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "DaVont\u00e9 McKenith", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "Testing for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) will become more convenient for youths in the metro beginning Sept. 1.", "title": "Douglas County STD clinic to expand hours", "url": "http://www.ketv.com/health/douglas-county-std-clinic-to-expand-hours/34179190", "image": "http://www.ketv.com/image/view/-/20896148/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/lw2f6cz/-/HEALTH-WATCH-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ketv.com/health/douglas-county-std-clinic-to-expand-hours/34179190", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "ketv://content/article/34179190", "iphone": "ketv://content/article/34179190", "googleplay": "ketv://content/article/34179190"}, "name": {"ipad": "ketv", "iphone": "ketv", "googleplay": "ketv"}, "id": {"ipad": 505254249, "iphone": 505254249, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}}, "site": "@ketv", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "ketv://content/article/34179190", "app_name": "ketv", "package": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}, "ios": {"url": "ketv://content/article/34179190", "app_store_id": 505254249, "app_name": "ketv"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130967633662636}, "google-site-verification": "a0PMTzs25l6fcC16_88mc37ga4Phf53uYiDWwMp4Ois", "keywords": "health, std, douglas county, health department", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/davontemckenith"}, "news_keywords": "health, std, douglas county, health department", "description": "Testing for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) will become more convenient for youths in the metro beginning Sept. 1."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda448\"", "article_summary": "The clinic is located at the Douglas County Health Department in Omaha at 1111 South 41st Street.\nWe listened to our youth.\u201dIn 2004, the STD trend was labeled as an epidemic in Douglas County.\nThe Douglas County Board of Health on Wednesday announced that express testing will soon be an option.\nThey wanted to be able to just walk in, and have more convenient hours,\u201d health director Adi Pour said.\nThe health department hopes that the expanded hours will eliminate barriers that young people might have when deciding if and when they need to be tested."}
