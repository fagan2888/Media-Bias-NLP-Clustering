(Photo: yuriz, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nWe're looking for a few friendly faces who are engaged in our community and want their voices to be heard.\n\nDoes that sound like you? Then apply to be a member of The Post-Crescent's Editorial Board!\n\nWe meet at noon every Thursday for about 30 minutes to talk about an interesting topic while we enjoy lunch together. All we ask is that you come with an open mind ready to weigh in on that week's topic.\n\nIt's a great way to become involved in our Valley Voices section and to learn how we operate as a news staff. Reporters join the meetings periodically to share their expertise.\n\nTo apply, please send me a few paragraphs about yourself and why you're interested, along with your contact information. It doesn't have to be anything fancy \u2014 we just want to get a feel for who you are.\n\nThe community members we select will serve on the board through the end of the year.\n\nPlease email your application to sriley@postcrescent.com or mail a letter to me at 306 W. Washington St., Appleton WI 54911. We'll accept them through Sept. 15.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1EKVzAB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "We're looking for a few friendly faces who are engaged in our community and want their voices to be heard.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "We're looking for a few friendly faces who are engaged in our community and want their voices to be heard.", "title": "Come join our Editorial Board!", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/09/06/come-join-our-editorial-board/71721490/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We're looking for a few friendly faces who are engaged in our community and want their voices to be heard.", "title": "Come join our Editorial Board!", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/785a3d6b7a380bbc110fb8d670efaa6ad7f88989/c=353-0-1768-1415&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/04/WIGroup/Appleton/635769840548538384-ThinkstockPhotos-468780730.jpg", "creator": "@postcrescent", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/sarahriley.appleton"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab32\"", "article_summary": "Apply to join our Editorial Board.\nThen apply to be a member of The Post-Crescent's Editorial Board!\nAll we ask is that you come with an open mind ready to weigh in on that week's topic.\nThe community members we select will serve on the board through the end of the year.\n(Photo: yuriz, Getty Images/iStockphoto)We're looking for a few friendly faces who are engaged in our community and want their voices to be heard."}
