Faced with stiff competition in the job market, young South Koreans often turn to professional certificates to gain an advantage. That trend has spawned thousands of new certificates in recent years and a growing testing service industry.

Last year, there were 6,773 different professional certificates issued by private institutions, up from 1,159 in 2010, according to South Korea’s education ministry.

Just 95 are recognized by the government, according to Kim Beom-su, a ministry official.

Part of the increase in the last year can be attributed to the government’s move in October to make registration obligatory for all certificates, following complaints about many tests that candidates found unhelpful for employment.

In February, South Korea’s youth unemployment rate reached 10.9%, the highest in over a decade, according to the national statistics agency.

A search on Naver, South Korea’s most popular search engine, yields results that include certificates supposedly proving a candidate’s proficiency in babysitting, leading tours of local plants or teaching while using an iPad, among many others.

South Korean media reports say that over half of college students use at least one private education service with the goal of gaining employment upon graduation, citing survey data from career portal websites.

“If the certificates aren’t recognized by the government, companies must assess them independently,” said Mr. Kim, adding that transparent guidelines from employers would eliminate excessive testing among candidates.
