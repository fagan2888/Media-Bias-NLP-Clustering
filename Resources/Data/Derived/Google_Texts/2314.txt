Police in Detroit have identified remains found earlier this year as a missing Baltimore City employee.

Police in Michigan's Wayne County said they found the body of Stewart Banks Jr., 56, behind a home in March.

Banks, who worked as a clerk for the Public Defender's Office, disappeared in late February. Authorities said after he left his home on East University Parkway on Feb. 21, he was captured on surveillance video outside a jewelry store on Greenmount Avenue in northeast Baltimore. He hadn't been seen since.

Investigators in Detroit said Banks' body was badly decomposed and had multiple stab wounds. They are ruling his death a homicide. Officials said dental records were used to identify him.

Baltimore police said they used social media and family members to try to find Banks earlier this year, but nothing worked.

According to Banks' family, he was last seen with his son-in-law, Robert Ricks, at a Megabus station; however, police said they had no information to corroborate Banks' getting on a Megabus.

Court documents showed that in June, Ricks was at an Alabama jail in federal custody after his arrest in March under an alias, Robert Quran Hick. He was accused of using an airline ticket in someone else's name and flying from Atlanta to Birmingham, Alabama, then getting two other boarding passes in someone else's name to fly to two other destinations. He's also accused of trying to enter secure areas at the Birmingham airport.

Police at the time said getting information from Ricks was difficult due to him being in federal custody. They also said that case against him had nothing to do with Banks' disappearance.

It's unclear so far if police currently have any suspects or motives in the case. The investigation continues.
