Both said they supported creating a legal path to citizenship for those immigrants.\n\nLast year, Trump enraged Hispanic activists by labeling Mexicans criminals and rapists when he announced his campaign, and continued making inflammatory comments, including proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.\n\nAsked by moderators point-blank if Trump is a racist, Clinton replied, \u201cHis rhetoric, his demagoguery, his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system.\u201d\n\nFor Sanders, it was his first clash with Clinton since his surprise win on Tuesday in Michigan\u2019s primary. He crowed that some had called the victory \u201cone of the major political upsets in modern American history.\u201d\n\nThe 74-year-old senator won most of the delegates up for grabs in Michigan, but Clinton, who won Mississippi on Tuesday, still leads Sanders with 1,221 delegates to his 571.\n\nWhile Florida is next Tuesday's biggest prize, contests will also be held in other states heavy in delegates: Illinois, North Carolina and Ohio.\n\nIn the two-hour debate, Clinton, 68, deflected an unusually large number of tough questions about her record as secretary of state under President Obama.\n\nAt one point, moderator Jorge Ramos asked her if she would drop out of the race if she is indicted in the Justice Department's investigation into her use of a private email server while running the State Department.\n\n\"Oh, for goodness,\" Clinton replied, visibly frustrated. \"That's not going to happen. I'm not even answering that question.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sparred over imm", "title": "Clinton and Sanders Set Sights on Trump at Florida Debate", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/10/Clinton-and-Sanders-Set-Sights-Trump-Florida-Debate", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTSA423.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/10/Clinton-and-Sanders-Set-Sights-Trump-Florida-Debate", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTSA423.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sparred over imm", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c5c\"", "article_summary": "In the two-hour debate, Clinton, 68, deflected an unusually large number of tough questions about her record as secretary of state under President Obama.\nDemocratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sparred over immigration at a debate on Wednesday night, days ahead of a crucial nominating contest in Florida, but directed their strongest fire on Republican front-runner Donald Trump.\n\u201cLook, in this country, immigration reform is a very hot debate,\" said Sanders.\nSanders and Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state and U.S. senator, spent much of their second debate this week currying the favor of Florida's Latinos, and that of the Hispanic audience watching nationwide.\nWhile Florida is next Tuesday's biggest prize, contests will also be held in other states heavy in delegates: Illinois, North Carolina and Ohio."}
