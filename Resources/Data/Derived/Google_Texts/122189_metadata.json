Later that day, Sanders spoke to thousands at a campaign rally in Boston. (Michael Dwyer/AP)\n\nUpdated October 4, 2015, 5:02 pm\n\nMore than 21,000 people streamed into the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, with thousands more outside the hall in South Boston Saturday night, to hear Bernie Sanders speak.\n\nThe candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination highlighted plans to bring workers 12 weeks paid family and medical leave \u2014 particularly for those families that just had a baby.\n\n\u201cAnd when we talk about family values, we are talking about ending the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that does not provide paid family and medical leave,\u201d Sanders said, jabbing at Republicans for stressing what he says are the wrong family values.\n\nSanders also spoke passionately about wanting to more than double the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15.\n\nThis was arguably not your typical political event at the Convention Center. For one thing, valet parking was pretty quiet. Thousands of people \u2014 most, but not all young, most, but not all white \u2014 walked along Summer Street after having taken the train or the T to get to the rally.\n\nLiam Geary, a music producer from Pembroke, was one of many young adults who came by train to hear Sanders. The 21-year-old said he feels the American economic system is broken.\n\n\u201cI think that the youth is really set up to fail, where if you decide to go to school you\u2019re going to be left with a crushing, staggering amount of debt, and there\u2019s not a lot of jobs for kids that are just freshly graduated, and the only jobs are unpaid internships, which isn\u2019t practical when it comes to paying back your student loans, which is why I dropped out of college,\u201d Geary said.\n\nGeary, an independent voter, said he fully supports Sanders. The 74-year-old U.S. senator from Vermont is officially an independent, but caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nIn his address, Sanders promised to push for free tuition at all public universities and for people to be able to refinance their student loans.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is pulling the rug out from under these young people, and we are harming the future of America, because we need to capitalize on the best intellects that we can, regardless of the income of their families,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nThe Sanders rally was free and open to the public. The campaign estimated 21,000 people in the hall \u2014 which was filled to capacity \u2014 and another 4,000 in overflow, most of whom watched Sanders speak on large screens set up on The Lawn on D around the corner.\n\nAmong those in the crowd: Jessica Van Sweringen, a recent Harvard graduate and researcher at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, who lives in Brookline.\n\nThe 23-year-old said she\u2019s considering Sanders and Hillary Clinton \u2014 and maybe even a Republican candidate. She has not yet registered to vote.\n\n\u201cI would still like to hear more about what Bernie Sanders thinks about foreign policy,\u201d Van Sweringen said. \u201cI think he touched on that, but he didn\u2019t go as in-depth as I would have liked him to.\u201d\n\nVan Sweringen came with Julia Bruce, a 22-year-old registered Democrat, who also just graduated from Harvard. The Weston resident said she\u2019s \u201cprimarily\u201d for Sanders.\n\n\u201cYou know, he\u2019s talking about really relevant issues, about racial justice, inequality, global warming,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cHe really just hit so many topics over the course of an hour that it was really amazing.\u201d\n\nAfter delivering his speech, Sanders also came outside to briefly address those who braved the chilly temperatures on The Lawn on D.\n\n#BernieSanders: \u201cyou guys are the true believers, huh? Thank you for freezing out here.\u201d #bernieinboston pic.twitter.com/uEOVgQKDFV \u2014 Peter Balonon-Rosen (@pbalonon_rosen) October 4, 2015\n\nMost campaign speeches are fairly short. Sanders spoke for about an hour and a half. Wearing a blue blazer and an open-collar button-down blue shirt, he did something else unusual for a political rally: he started on time.\n\nSanders told the crowd he\u2019s counting on increasing voter turnout. He predicts that if his campaign does that he stands good odds of securing the nomination.\n\nClarification: The story\u2019s headline has been updated to more accurately reflect that the rally drew tens of thousands of people. While the story gave the full estimate of those who attended, the headline, in saying \u201cthousands\u201d attended, was unclear.\n\nCorrection: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this post misidentified where Jessica Van Sweringen was during the rally; she was in inside, not outside. We regret the error.\n\nStory continues below\n\nMost Popular Expand", "article_metadata": {"description": "Roughly more than 25,000 people attended the Democratic presidential candidate's Boston speech Saturday.", "og": {"site_name": "wbur", "description": "Roughly more than 25,000 people attended the Democratic presidential candidate's Boston speech Saturday.", "title": "Sanders Draws Tens Of Thousands To Rally At Boston Convention Center", "url": "http://www.wbur.org/2015/10/04/sanders-boston", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/1/files/2015/10/AP_682497784055-620x410.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wbur.org/2015/10/04/sanders-boston", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/1/files/2015/10/AP_682497784055-620x410.jpg", "site": "@wbur", "card": "summary", "title": "Sanders Draws Tens Of Thousands To Rally At Boston Convention Center"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-04", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Later that day, Sanders spoke to thousands at a campaign rally in Boston.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders pauses during a campaign rally in Springfield on Saturday.\nThe Sanders rally was free and open to the public.\n\u201cI would still like to hear more about what Bernie Sanders thinks about foreign policy,\u201d Van Sweringen said.\nAmong those in the crowd: Jessica Van Sweringen, a recent Harvard graduate and researcher at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, who lives in Brookline."}
