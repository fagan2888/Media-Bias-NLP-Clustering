Dr. Maureen McKenna is the president of The Democratic Women\u2019s Club of Florida. She says that the state\u2019s new laws are a part of the social justice movement that gives equality to same sex couples\u2026\n\n\u201cWe have to overcome any discrimination that\u2019s evident in the work place and in the community. I believe that this legislation and adherence to this law will continue to make sure that equality for all is achieved in this land of liberty.\u201d\n\nAlabama remains one of ten states that still bans same sex marriage.
