They delivered 12,000 petitions to Scott\u2019s office Thursday.\n\n\n\nAbout a week ago, the Florida Legislature approved a package of new abortion restrictions. Groups like Planned Parenthood and Florida NOW\u2014that\u2019s the National Organization for Women\u2014lobbied lawmakers to block its passage. Now they\u2019re turning their attention to the governor.\n\nFlorida NOW lobbyist Barbara Devane joined a group from Planned Parenthood Thursday to deliver petitions.\n\n\u201cSo these are over 12,000 signatures requesting Governor Scott to veto Senate Bill 1722, and House Bill 1411,\u201d Planned Parenthood activist Regina Sheridan explained while dropping off the paperwork.\n\nThe legislation redefines trimesters\u2014making it more likely for procedures to fall under stricter regulations. It also blocks all taxpayer funds for organizations that provide abortions\u2014regardless of whether that money pays for the procedure. But the provision getting the most attention requires abortion providers have admitting privileges or a transfer agreement at a nearby hospital.\n\n\u201cWith what this legislation proposes it would make access much harder,\u201d Sheridan says, \u201cso although it doesn\u2019t outright outlaw abortion it does make it very, very difficult to access.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not ok.\u201d\n\nA number of abortion providers are challenging similar Texas legislation in the US Supreme Court. If the high court sides with Texas, and upholds its restrictions, the number of providers would drop to about 10.\n\nBefore the law passed there were 40.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Devane says. \u201cIt\u2019s death by a thousand cuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey know abortion is legal in this country so they know they can\u2019t get around that,\u201d she goes on, \u201cso they\u2019re shutting them down by no access.\u201d\n\nSponsors of Florida\u2019s measure argue the allowance for hospital transfer agreements instead of admitting privileges sets their idea apart from Texas. But American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Julia Kaye is skeptical. She\u2019s currently tied up in a case challenging Florida\u2019s abortion waiting period law passed last year.\n\n\u201cI think that, both the omnibus bill in Florida and the targeted regulation of abortion providers in Texas are of a piece,\u201d Kaye says, \u201cbecause they are onerous restrictions on abortion providers that are designed to shut clinics down.\u201d\n\nConsidering Governor Scott\u2019s antagonistic posture toward Planned Parenthood\u2014particularly after a series of heavily edited videos critical of the organization became public\u2014those petition signatures may fall on deaf ears. Abortion advocates appear ready to take the matter to court if he signs off on the measure. Whatever he chooses, Scott has until March 26 to decide. If he does nothing the bill would become law.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "Abortion rights advocates are trying to convince Florida Governor Rick Scott to veto sweeping new abortion legislation.\u00a0 They delivered 12,000 petitions to", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/advocates-deliver-petitions-opposition-new-abortion-bill", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201603/470871905.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Abortion rights advocates are trying to convince Florida Governor Rick Scott to veto sweeping new abortion legislation.\u00a0 They delivered 12,000 petitions to", "title": "Advocates Deliver Petitions In Opposition Of New Abortion Bill"}, "story_id": 470871874, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Nick Evans", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "Advocates Deliver Petitions In Opposition Of New Abortion Bill"}, "nid": 13996, "datePublished": "2016-03-20", "keywords": "Abortion, Florida Legislature, Florida Legislature 2016, Planned Parenthood", "wordCount": 549, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Abortion rights advocates are trying to convince Florida Governor Rick Scott to veto sweeping new abortion legislation.\nBut the provision getting the most attention requires abortion providers have admitting privileges or a transfer agreement at a nearby hospital.\nAbout a week ago, the Florida Legislature approved a package of new abortion restrictions.\nAbortion advocates appear ready to take the matter to court if he signs off on the measure.\nFlorida NOW lobbyist Barbara Devane joined a group from Planned Parenthood Thursday to deliver petitions."}
