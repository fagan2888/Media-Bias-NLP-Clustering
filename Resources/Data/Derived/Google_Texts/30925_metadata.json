His experience spans both aisles of the court, supervising and conducting litigation on behalf of the United States government as a solicitor general from 2005 to 2008, and litigating major constitutional challenges against the government as a current partner with the law firm of Bancroft PLLC.\n\nAmong the many lessons he learned is the justices' unanimous belief that they have the competency to decide any constitutional issue that comes before them \u2013 even decisions involving certain separation of powers disputes previous courts have refrained from adjudicating.\n\n\u201cWhat this shows is there is no issue, no matter how contentious, no matter what the implications might be for diplomacy or the like, that the Robert\u2019s Court (referring to the Supreme Court presided over by Chief Justice John Roberts) thinks it does not have the ability to decide,\u201d Clement said.\n\nOther lessons Clement has observed include:\n\n\u2022 The tendency for the court to announce up to a year in advance the consideration of overruling a past precedent.\n\n\u2022 Inequities between justices and the time they dedicate to interpreting federal statues vs. constitutional issues.\n\n\u2022 When it comes to purely free speech issues, all justices are universally pro First Amendment.\n\n\u2022 When it comes to issues of religious liberty, all justices are very solicitous.\n\n\u2022 While the Roberts' Court has been noted as a pro-business court, there are some particular cases justices have sided against business.\n\nWhen describing the process of oral-arguments, Clement explained that it isn\u2019t full of flowing rhetoric like in a fictional courtroom drama or some political debates on television. Attorneys have about 60 seconds for opening remarks, followed by a series of pointed questions from justices regarding the implications of each case, he said.\n\n\u201cThere has literally almost never been a court that is more about asking questions of the advocates as part of the process of arguing cases,\u201d Clement said.\n\nHe noted that the Roberts' Court has not always leaned the same way politically, and cited a study revealing a major shift to the left during the last term which included such hot-button rulings on same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe results were really striking,\u201d Clement said. \u201cUsing the same methodology they\u2019ve used for years, these political scientists determined the last term was the most liberal term of the Supreme Court since 1969.\u201d\n\nClement asked people in the audience to consider the meaning and purpose of Supreme Court decisions, pointing out that of the 10,000 cases the court is asked to hear each year \u2013 roughly only 75 are selected.\n\n\u201cThe justices don\u2019t want to just correct errors,\u201d Clement said. \u201cThey actually want to use a case as a vehicle to set a national rule on some issue of tremendous national importance.\u201d\n\nKellen McCullum, a sophomore Political Science major, said he felt privileged to hear about what it is like to work as an attorney in the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\n\u201cIt was a rare opportunity for insight from a prominent individual into one of the most revered legal occupations in this country,\u201d McCullum said. \u201cClement was extremely intuitive and down to the point regarding his delivery. There was no doubt regarding his knowledge or experience, considering his impressive list of credentials.\u201d\n\nA distinguished lecturer at Georgetown University Law Center and senior fellow at the university\u2019s Supreme Court Institute, Clement was selected by the National Law Journal in 2013 as one of the \u201c100 Most Influential Lawyers in America,\u201d and named the \u201c2012 Lawyer of the Year\u201d by the Bar Association of the District of Columbia.\n\nHe was invited to speak at Benedictine as part of the University\u2019s nonpartisan, nonprofit Center for Civic Leadership (CCL) Speaker Series, which seeks to bring dynamic speakers to campus so that students and the larger community can fully engross themselves in multiple issues and topics of public concern.\n\nFor future events sponsored by the CCL and the College of Liberal Arts at Benedictine University, please visit ben.edu/ccl.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Attorney\u2019s visit to Benedictine sheds light on inner workings of nation\u2019s highest court.
