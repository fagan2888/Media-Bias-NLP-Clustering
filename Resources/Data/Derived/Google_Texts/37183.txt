With the new ACA requirements, it is important for businesses to stay compliant and file all forms on time," said Todd Waletzki, COO of BenefitMall. "Our latest product, allCompliance, not only seamlessly integrates with other BenefitMall products, but also allows business owners to manage data, reports and IRS forms in a streamlined way."
