Healthcare Reform Puts Pressure on Hospital HR Execs

Human resource executives at hospitals and health systems say planning for healthcare reform is their top priority, but the majority of them feel challenged by too many competing initiatives.

With less than two weeks to go until health insurance exchanges , also known as marketplaces, open for business, human resource executives at hospitals and health systems are preparing for a raft of changes that will affect healthcare workers and HR processes.

From improving patient experience to reducing costs, human resource departments are implementing mandates laid out in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by putting them at the top of their hiring, recruitment, and retention priorities.

Survey results released Wednesday tell the tale. The American Society for Healthcare Human Resources Administration (ASHHRA), the professional membership organization of the American Hospital Association, and HealthcareSource, a talent management software provider, collected responses from nearly 500 U.S. healthcare HR professionals and executives in July 2013 about their top HR initiatives. (The report itself won't be released until next month.)

When asked about their top priority for the next 12 months, 64% of senior healthcare HR executives said that planning for the effects of healthcare reform is their top priority, up 10% from last year. Eighty percent of C-suite level executives, 64% of directors and managers, and 56% of HR general staff said preparing for healthcare reform is a top HR initiative.
