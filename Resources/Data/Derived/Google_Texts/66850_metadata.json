It left a sour taste in the often-cheery Halamka\u2019s mouth: \u201cThis may sound cynical, but there are probably only two rational choices for clinicians going forward \u2014 become a salaried employee delivering clinical care or become a hospital-based clinician exempted from the madness,\u201d he said. \u201c[I]t\u2019s hard for me to imagine implementing the NPRM as written in the timeframes suggested\u2026 As a practicing clinician for 30 years, I can honestly say that it\u2019s time to leave the profession if we stay on the current trajectory.\u201d\n\n\u2026.Leading medical societies aren\u2019t quite so pessimistic, but some of them may ask CMS to delay the start of MACRA\u2019s Merit-based Incentive Payment Program, according to Bob Doherty of the American College of Physicians. The doctor groups are moving toward asking CMS to start the reporting period on July 1, 2017, rather than Jan. 1, Doherty told reporters on Thursday. The start date for MIPS wasn\u2019t known until the proposed rule was released last week, and the rule probably won\u2019t be finalized until this fall, leaving only a couple of months before MIPS reporting would start.\n\n\u2026 In March, the last time he was asked in public about a possible delay in the MIPS reporting, Acting CMS Administrator Andy Slavitt said he was too busy thinking about implementation to focus on a delay.\n\nLike Halamka, former ONC head Farzad Mostashari believes MACRA in its current form penalizes small practices. But CMS means well and has shown plenty of willingness to be flexible, he told POLITICO's \"Pulse Check\" podcast this week.\n\n\u2026 Slavitt told hospital executives earlier this week that Medicare has listened to doctors and made meaningful use more straight forward under the MACRA payment programs. \u201cOur proposal to replace meaningful use in the physician\u2019s office with a new program, Advancing Care Information, is an example of where we have responded to considerable feedback to move the focus from \u2018clicking\u2019 to care provision and collaboration,\u201d he said. http://1.usa.gov/24AuLMh\n\n...We'll probably get a rosier picture next Thursday at an Energy and Commerce hearing.\n\nTweet of the day: fredtrotter @fredtrotter I am not sure if @Farzad_MD is going to Datapalooza this year. But he should, cuz our data release is going to make him very happy.\n\nWelcome to Friday, one and all, where we\u2019re counting down the few remaining days before Health Datapalooza, which makes us all nostalgic \u2018cuz it launched POLITICO\u2019s eHealth section exactly two years ago. Nostalgic and exhausted in advance. Buzz us awake at aallen@politico.com or tweet alarming news @David_Pittman, @arthurallen202, @DariusTahir @ POLITICOPro, @Morning_eHealth.\n\n\u2026 If you\u2019re in town for Datapalooza next Tuesday (i.e., May 10), make sure to drop by the District Architecture Center (421 7th St NW) a little after 5 p.m. for cocktails, snacks and conversation about the cost of keeping our data safe. Yes that\u2019s right folks, it\u2019s time for another Outside, In event, entitled \u201cUnhealthy Hacking: Medical Privacy in the Age of Cyber Attacks.\u201d\n\nYours truly will be moderating with Joanne Kenen and Dan Diamond. Watch us grill two panels loaded with health IT talent; tough questions and smart answers guaranteed.

The data include submitted charges for services and procedures by each physician and supplier, allowing a comparison by doctor, specialty, location and types of services delivered.\n\nHHS LEADERS TALK TO PROVIDER LEADERS: The agency is working to improve health information exchange by building common standards, helping doctors and hospitals give patients access to their records, and assuring that regulation improves data flow, Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told a conference of internal medicine doctors Thursday. Better use of health information helps everybody, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it is so important that hospitals and physicians stand up against data blocking.\u201d http://1.usa.gov/1SSaOJq\n\nPDMP FOR VETS: The American Academy of Family Physicians is urging the Veterans Administration to participate in prescription drug monitoring programs. AAFP Board Chair Robert Wergin wrote Undersecretary of Health David Shulkin that VA participation in the program \u2014 not mandatory at present \u2014 could help protect thousands of vets from opioid painkiller abuse. \u201cWe recognize the value of PDMPs and the interstate exchange of registry information and we see PDMPs as vital to curbing opioid misuse and diversion,\u201d Wergin wrote.\n\nGAO BEEFS UP ON HEALTH IT: The agency added three members to its Health IT Policy Committee: Jamie Ferguson, VP for health IT strategy at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif.; Karen van Caulil, CEO of the Florida Health Care Coalition; and Carolyn Petersen, senior editor of Mayoclinic.org.\n\nTELADERMATOLOGY CAN HELP: A RAND/Harvard study shows that skin-doctoring-at-a-distance makes it easier for patients to get specialized care. The researchers studied a collaboration between Palo Alto, Ca.-based Direct Dermatology and Health Plan of San Joaquin, a Medicaid managed care plan with nearly 300,000 enrollees in an area where immigrant farmworkers get their share of skin conditions. \u201cPatients covered by Medicaid have traditionally been one of the groups with limited access to dermatologists, but teledermatology is making it possible for patients to receive the care they need through a network of primary care physicians, teledermatologists and local dermatologists,\u201d said Dr. David Wong, CEO of Direct Dermatology (now DirectDerm).\n\nCAREER OPPOPRTUNITIES: The Indian Health Service is soliciting bids to provide telehealth services for its Great Plains district.
