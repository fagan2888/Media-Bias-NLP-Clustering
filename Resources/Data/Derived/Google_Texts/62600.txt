A select few special needs children and one special needs adult received customized bicycles on Saturday at an event hosted by the local Air Capital AMBUCS.

AMBUCS mission is to give mobility and independence to people with disabilities.

On Saturday, the group gave away 16 custom tricycles that allow people who cannot drive a traditional bicycle to ride.

The bikes cost between $400 to $1400 dollars and were completely donated to the children.

An AMBUCS spokeswoman tells KAKE news that this was the third year for the event. She also wanted to thank Midwest Corporate Aviation for donating the use of their hanger to host the event.
