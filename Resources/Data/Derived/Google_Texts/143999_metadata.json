Bennett Ratliff, son of former Lt. Gov. Bill Ratliff, is being challenged by Matt Rinaldi in the March 4 primary. Early voting starts Tuesday.\n\nThe winner will face Democrat Paul Stafford and Libertarian candidate Kim Kelley in the general election.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Ratliff and Rinaldi have squared off.\n\nThey were among five candidates vying two years ago to replace retiring Rep. Jim Jackson to represent the northwest Dallas County district. It includes parts of Coppell, Farmers Branch, Carrollton and Irving\n\nOn the surface, the two GOP contenders appear to have a lot in common.\n\nTheir campaign literature touts their support for property and Second Amendment rights and opposition to Obamacare and higher taxes.\n\nBut their views diverge sharply on some key issues, and they trade barbs over education, spending and campaign funding.\n\nRinaldi, who has won the endorsement of the North Texas Tea Party and Texas Right to Life, accuses his opponent of being a liberal cloaked in conservative clothing.\n\n\u201cI think he has more in common, policy-wise, with Democrats,\u201d said Rinaldi, citing low marks Ratliff has received from some conservative groups.\n\nRatliff said he tries to avoid labels and describes himself as an \u201cold-fashioned Republican.\u201d\n\nThe incumbent said he supports lower taxes and has voted for a balanced budget, and he points out that his pro-business record is reflected by endorsements from \u201cvirtually every business group in the state.\u201d\n\nBut Rinaldi argued that Ratliff supported a state budget that raised spending, voted for a bill that increased lawmakers\u2019 pensions and advocated tax increases.\n\n\u201cHis record as a whole doesn\u2019t match his campaign rhetoric,\u201d said Rinaldi, who has lived in the area for 13 years.\n\nHe said he supports school choice, including education savings accounts and school vouchers. \u201cIt\u2019s the taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should be able to use it as they want.\u201d\n\nRinaldi accuses Ratliff of partnering with Democratic Rep. Rafael Anchia to tweak the voting maps to draw Rinaldi out of the district. As a result, he said he had to move to a new home to run for the District 115 seat.\n\nRatliff scoffed at the notion. To believe that, \u201cyou\u2019d have to believe I conspired with the entire House, Senate, speaker of the House and governor,\u201d he said.\n\nIf elected, Rinaldi said his first act would be to file a bill to end the so-called \u201cRobin Hood\u201d school financing system. He said he would place a priority on fiscal responsibility, fight illegal immigration and defend Second Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cI also pledge not to vote for any budget that increases spending more than inflation plus population growth,\u201d Rinaldi said.\n\nIn his first term in office, Ratliff, a former Coppell school board member, has won praise as an education advocate.\n\nTwo of his bills \u2014 which would have required validation of accountability assessments and allowed some districts to create new assessment tools \u2014 won the support of both legislative chambers but were vetoed by Gov. Rick Perry.\n\nIf re-elected, Ratliff vows to introduce those bills again.\n\nThe freshman legislator believes that vouchers drain money from public schools and accuses his opponent of wanting to \u201cdismantle the public education system in Texas.\u201d\n\nHe defends his voting record, saying he worked to restore funding for public education, cut taxes for small businesses, eliminate \u201caccounting gimmicks\u201d and pass a \u201cconservative budget.\u201d\n\nThe incumbent stresses his strong ties to the community and service to the school district. \u201cI\u2019m the one who has lived, worked, played and prayed in the district for over 20 years,\u201d said Ratliff, who has accumulated a sizable war chest for his re-election campaign.\n\nRatliff has raised more than $200,000, including donations from Atmos Energy Corp. PAC, Oncor Political Action Committee and Texas State Teachers Association PAC.\n\nRinaldi has raised less than $50,000, with more than $14,000 of that coming from Accountability First PAC. The new conservative group is supporting selected House candidates who are asked to sign a pledge to restrict spending and oppose tax increases.\n\nRatliff accused Rinaldi of trying to buy an election with \u201cdark money\u201d from groups outside the district. He said anyone who signs a secret pledge to get funding is \u201cbreaking faith with people in your district.\u201d\n\nRinaldi acknowledged that he signed the pledge but said it\u2019s no secret. \u201cI signed a public pledge,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not raise taxes or increase spending. That\u2019s the cornerstone of my campaign.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Challenger Matt Rinaldi has questioned the conservative credentials of Rep.
