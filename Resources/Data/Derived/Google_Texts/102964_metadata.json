Chew, Icon Telecom\n\nThe government alleged \"that in the absence of legitimate forms, Icon created false recertification forms, fabricated the subscribers' signatures on the forms, and electronically submitted the fictitious forms in response to the audit.\"\n\n\"Although this program was designed to help low-income Americans have basic access to phone service, these individuals, and their companies, allegedly exploited the system to line their own pockets,\" said U.S. Attorney Coats.\n\n\"All of us must be concerned when programs like this are abused and defrauded. I commend the FCC-Inspector General, FBI, and IRS Criminal Investigation for their cooperation and coordination in this investigation.\"\n\nCoats said Perez-Zumaeta is charged in a ten-count indictment. The indictment alleges that Perez-Zumaeta directed sales personnel to use phone books to come up with names and addresses for bogus Lifeline customers and to dispose of telephones registered to fake customers by selling them on the street for approximately $5 each.\n\nU.S. v Perez-Zumaeta\n\n6 Investigates learned Icon Telecom shut down its Lifeline service in 2013.\n\n9/17/2013 Related Story: OKC-Based Icon Wireless Shuts Down Amid State Investigation\n\nIn a news release, Coats said Icon Telecom, owned exclusively by Chew, participated in the wireless Lifeline Program from July 2011 until September 2013.
