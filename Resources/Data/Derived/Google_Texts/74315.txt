Wildlife officials are asking for the public's help finding whoever illegally killed seven elk cows and calves near Steamboat Springs.

Steve Baumgartner with Colorado Parks and Wildlife tells Steamboat Today that the elk were found along Routt County Road 56 northwest of Steamboat in mid-February.

The carcasses were decomposed when they were found, and Baumgartner estimates they were shot in early or mid-January with a small-caliber firearm before wandering off to die.

Because the carcasses were so decomposed, it is not clear whether any meat had been harvested.
