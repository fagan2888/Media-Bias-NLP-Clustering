Tegan Hanlon

Grown in Pennsylvania, Tegan latched onto journalism as a kid while editing her middle schools pint-sized newspaper. Then, she kept writing. She attended the University of Pittsburgh, reporting for the universitys publications and bopping around at the student-run radio station. During summers, Tegan trekked out-of-state to work as a news intern at The Denver Post and The Dallas Morning News. She eventually drove all the way north where her love for reporting and the outdoors nicely aligned. She joined ADN in 2013.
