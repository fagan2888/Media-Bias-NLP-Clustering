The new offices are in Mountlake Terrace, Stanwood and Everett. The Everett office, at 1718 Broadway, is Sunrise\u0092s third in the city.All three new offices have \u0093open access\u0094 hours, allowing people to simply drop by and \u0093we can set them up make an appointment right away,\u0094 said Holly Morgan, director of community mental health services. \u0093People can come in, fill out some forms and then move on to their services.\u0094That shortens the steps to getting help. Typically, Medicaid patients had to call 211, the county\u0092s social service hotline, to get hooked up with mental health services through Medicaid.The expansion of services comes through the federal health care law known as Obamacare. The law calls for access to mental health services \u0093without arbitrary restrictions on the services you can receive,\u0094 said Cammy Hart-Anderson, a manager in the county\u0092s Human Services department.With the federal law expanding Medicaid eligibility to behavioral health services, \u0093we anticipate many more people accessing those services,\u0094 Hart-Anderson said.Federal money to pay for expanded services is sent to the state, which then allocates it through regional mental health planning organizations. The services provided are for those with serious mental illness, she said.Services are also provided for patients with drug or alcohol problems in addition to mental illness.The three Sunrise offices in Everett can treat up to 1,065 patients. About 150 patients can be treated in the Stanwood office and Mountlake Terrace can treat up to 450 patients, Morgan said.Sunrise, which began by providing home care services in Snohomish County, added mental health programs in 2007. Sunrise opened its first building in Everett in 2009. It added a second Everett office, also on Broadway, in 2014.The opening of the three new Sunrise offices increases the likelihood of somebody being able to access services when they decide they need those services, instead of being forced to wait up to six weeks, Hart-Anderson said.\u0093Will it fully meet all the needs?\u0094 she asked. \u0093No, but it\u0092s a step in the right direction.\u0094Sharon Salyer: 425-339-3486; salyer@heraldnet.com.Sunrise Services Inc. is offering quick access to Medicaid patients who need mental health services at three of its offices.
