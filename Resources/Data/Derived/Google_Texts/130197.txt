Former 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney had quite the Friday – making new best friends on airplane flights and hilariously ‘slow jamming’ the news with “Late Night” host Jimmy Fallon and all.



The duo sang about everything from Obama’s highly-anticipated State of the Union address Tuesday, to the failures with the Obamacare rollout and the revelations that the National Security Agency had illegally listened in on the phone calls of American citizens domestically.

“Aww, yeah,” Fallon swooned. “President Obama, look, the American people up and down said ‘I’d tap that’, but then NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden whipped out his whistle and started blowing.”

There were even some hilarious potshots at Romney’s failed presidential bids and future plans.

“Jimmy, I’m not running again,” Romney said. “There are a lot of great candidates for 2016 and I’ll be supporting the Republican nominee 100 percent.”

“Don’t you mean 47 percent?” Fallon joked.

“That’s a low blow — but it’s pretty funny,” Romney replied.

“I had to do it,” Fallon added.

Arguably the funniest moment, however, had to be when Romney discussed his new documentary “Mitt,” which chronicled his two failed presidential bids. The film, which was released on Netflix Friday, just had its cinematic debut at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.

“You ain’t lying, Rama-lama-ding-dong,” Fallon sang in response to Romney noting that the reviews for the documentary were largely positive. “I saw your documentary, it was pretty good. For a while it looked like you might have had the 2012 election, then Obama won a second term.”

“I guess it’s true what they say,” he continued. “Once you go black, you never go back.”
