Which we have none of the above, we\u2019re legal, licensed prostitutes. I see the doctor every week, it\u2019s state mandatory. And we\u2019re tested weekly and monthly for blood.

I\u2019m really for Obamacare, I\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t wait...\n\nWatch WOAI's full coverage here:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taxpayers will be happy to know they not only fund abortions under the Affordable Care Act, they also help prostitutes stay healthy. .05/26/2016 20:41:24PM EST.", "author": "Sarah Jean Seman", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Taxpayers will be happy to know they not only fund abortions under the Affordable Care Act, they also help prostitutes stay healthy.", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - Thanks Obamacare: Prostitutes Say It Is \"Truly a Blessing\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2013/11/20/texas-prostitutes-thankful-for-obamacare-n1750095", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2013/11/20/3.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Taxpayers will be happy to know they not only fund abortions under the Affordable Care Act, they also help prostitutes stay healthy.", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - Thanks Obamacare: Prostitutes Say It Is \"Truly a Blessing\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2013/11/20/texas-prostitutes-thankful-for-obamacare-n1750095", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2013/11/20/3.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Thanks Obamacare: Prostitutes Say It Is \"Truly a Blessing\" , Sarah Jean Seman, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Taxpayers will be happy to know they not only fund abortions under the Affordable Care Act, they also help prostitutes stay healthy.\nObamacare seems to be all for promoting sexual exploits.\nBay Area sex worker \"Siouxsie Q\" helped nearly 40 men to enroll in the new insurance exchanges.\nPrior to Obamacare, brothel workers at the Moonlight Bunny Ranch in Nevada said they were unable to find coverage under their profession.\nI\u2019m really for Obamacare, I\u2019m excited.\u201dCan\u2019t wait...Watch WOAI's full coverage here:"}
