Scarlett Johansson’s hardly the first star to see controversy bubble up over an endorsement.

The generally agreeable “Her” actress found herself forced out of a charitable-ambassador gig as an unexpected political controversy bloomed over a product she endorses. She’s one of a number of celebrities who signed on to an endorsement deal hoping to get some face time on TV and a little cash on the side and ended up losing face and fans. Take heart, Scarlett — some of these stars were able to get over the complications that teaming up with a corporation can throw one’s way.
