Ward doesn\u2019t want to just be a part of a good Broncos secondary. He\u2019s seeking greatness.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re light years ahead of where we were last year,\u201d Ward said Friday, the team\u2019s second day of training camp. \u201cI want (us) to lead the league in interceptions. I want (us) to lead the league in sacks from the secondary and lead the league in turnovers.\u201d\n\nLed by three Pro Bowlers \u2014 cornerbacks Chris Harris Jr. and Aqib Talib, and Ward \u2014 the Broncos have the talent. Now it\u2019s a matter of execution. Even with all their accolades, their perceived slight from being left off the NFL Top 100 list should prevent them from being complacent.\n\nLast season, the Broncos were tied for seventh in the league in interceptions with 18. Although they were second in the league in rushing yards allowed (79.8 per game), the Broncos were tied for 22nd in forced fumbles, with seven.\n\n\u201cWe dropped some interceptions last year. I would like to see us have more forced fumbles,\u201d Ward said. \u201cI want to see us score on defense. Big plays and turnovers, that\u2019s what we want and that\u2019s what we can improve on from last year.\u201d\n\nWard said the key to forcing more turnovers is simple: pressure the quarterback and play good coverage. Opportunities are great, but they mean nothing if you can\u2019t capitalize.\n\nThe fourth member of that secondary, Darian Stewart, is in his first year with the Broncos after starting 14 of 16 games with the Baltimore Ravens last season. He recorded 53 tackles (37 solo), three pass deflections, one interception and one fumble.\n\n\u201cYou never really see him flustered or out of position too much,\u201d Ward said. \u201cHe can play both free (safety) and strong (safety), so that\u2019s great for us. We\u2019ll get to interchange.\u201d\n\nHigh aspirations, but not completely far-fetched for what may be one of the Broncos\u2019 most talented Broncos secondaries.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Aqib Talib,Broncos defense,Chris Harris,Darian Stewart,secondary,T.J.
