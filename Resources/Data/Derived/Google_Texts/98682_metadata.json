There is no LeBron, no Carmelo, no Kobe, no Chris Paul, no Kevin Love and, of course, no Paul George.\n\nMost of the NBA\u2019s biggest names will stay home for this year\u2019s tournament, which begins Saturday in Spain. But there are more NBA players in this year\u2019s cup than any other.\n\nA record 45 current NBA players are set to compete in the tournament, up from 44 in 2010, the league announced Friday. This year\u2019s World Cup also features 75 players who have at one point played in the NBA, as well as 17 former draftees whose rights are held by NBA teams, bringing the total number of past and present NBA players to 92.\n\nOf the 24 teams competing in the World Cup, 21 have at least one NBA player, ex-NBA player or draftee. And 22 of the 30 NBA teams have at least one of their players on a national roster. The Cavs and Rockets have the most, with four current players in the World Cup. Forward Kenneth Faried is the lone representative for the Nuggets this year, but he is the fifth Denver player to compete for Team USA since 1992, when it started using NBA players in international play.\n\nTeam USA aside, Spain has the most current NBA players with six, while France and Australia have four. Below is the complete breakdown of the past and present NBA players competing in Spain.\n\n\n\n(Download the full 2014 FIBA World Cup schedule)\n\nNBA Players in the 2014 FIBA World Cup", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "FIBA World Cup,Kenneth Faried,NBA,Team USA", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "A record 45 current NBA players will compete for national teams in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, including the Nuggets' Kenneth Faried.", "title": "Record number of NBA players to compete in 2014 FIBA World Cup", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/08/29/record-number-nba-players-compete-2014-fiba-world-cup/11448/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/08/faried-usa-495x328.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "A record 45 current NBA players will compete for national teams in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, including the Nuggets' Kenneth Faried.", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/08/29/record-number-nba-players-compete-2014-fiba-world-cup/11448/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/08/faried-usa-495x328.jpg", "title": "Record number of NBA players to compete in 2014 FIBA World Cup", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "A record 45 current NBA players will compete for national teams in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, including the Nuggets' Kenneth Faried."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14ba\"", "article_summary": "(Download the full 2014 FIBA World Cup schedule)NBA Players in the 2014 FIBA World Cup\nA record 45 current NBA players are set to compete in the tournament, up from 44 in 2010, the league announced Friday.\nOf the 24 teams competing in the World Cup, 21 have at least one NBA player, ex-NBA player or draftee.\nThis year\u2019s World Cup also features 75 players who have at one point played in the NBA, as well as 17 former draftees whose rights are held by NBA teams, bringing the total number of past and present NBA players to 92.\nThe Cavs and Rockets have the most, with four current players in the World Cup."}
