Marmor, a Yale professor and historian of Medicare.\n\nIn a secretly recorded telephone conversation in March 1965, Mr. Cohen described the Medicare bill that had just been approved by the House Ways and Means Committee. \u201cQuite frankly,\u201d Mr. Cohen told President Johnson, \u201cthere\u2019s no longer any room for the private insurance companies to sell insurance policies for people over 65.\u201d\n\nIn the original versions of Medicare and Medicaid, beneficiaries could go to any doctor who would take them, and the government would pay providers a fee for each service. By contrast, in private managed-care plans, beneficiaries use a network of doctors and hospitals, and the federal or state government pays insurers, which receive a fixed amount per member per month.\n\nThe original setup of Medicare and Medicaid began to change in the early 1980s after Congress and the Reagan administration created incentives for private insurers to contract with Medicare. Enrollment rose and fell as federal officials tinkered with reimbursement rates.\n\nIn the last decade, as private insurers accelerated their marketing of Medicare plans and baby boomers accustomed to managed care reached retirement age, enrollment in the private Medicare plans, called Medicare Advantage, surged. About 99 percent of beneficiaries now have the option to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, and the average beneficiary has a choice of more than a dozen plans.\n\nIn interviews, Medicare beneficiaries expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the original government-run program and the private alternatives, which include health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor seniors on fixed income, an H.M.O. provides the best bang for the buck,\u201d said Ann E. Mason, 74, of Rochester.\n\nLike many older Americans, she found that a Medicare Advantage plan offered better value than the combination of traditional Medicare and a supplementary insurance policy to fill gaps in Medicare, for expenses like co-payments and deductibles.\n\nAnn C. Dorsey, 65, of Atlanta, qualified for Medicare several years ago after she developed a rare heart tumor and became disabled. She has invited insurance agents to her home to explain their plans and says she is pleased with her Cigna H.M.O.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAnybody who doesn\u2019t look at Medicare Advantage is nuts,\u201d said Ms. Dorsey, who said she saved at least $1,000 a year because of lower out-of-pocket expenses. But, she said, before selecting a plan, beneficiaries need to do their homework, comparing benefits, physician rosters and prescription drug lists of different plans.\n\nYet even with managed care, big questions remain about how to finance Medicare and Medicaid for the next 50 years.\n\nIn Congress and in state legislatures, which help pay for Medicaid, the costs continue to cause anxiety. Under the Affordable Care Act, more than half the states have expanded eligibility for Medicaid, and state officials have enrolled most new beneficiaries in private plans.\n\nIn many states that expanded Medicaid, enrollment has far surpassed expectations, evidently because state officials underestimated the demand for insurance and the proportion of eligible low-income people who would sign up.\n\nMichigan, for example, has signed up 600,000 people in 16 months \u2014 more than it expected to enroll in five years. Nearly 80 percent of the new beneficiaries are in private managed-care plans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCongress did reduce payments to private Medicare Advantage plans in the Affordable Care Act, to help offset the cost of the legislation, and insurers predicted that enrollment would decline. Instead, it has increased to 16.6 million people, from 11 million in 2010. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the number will reach 30 million by 2025.\n\nExperts say that private plans are not for everyone.\n\n\u201cMedicare Advantage plans are often more stingy with benefits,\u201d said Judith A. Stein, who has represented hundreds of beneficiaries as the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Medicare Advocacy. \u201cWe have seen many cases in which people who are really sick cannot get coverage for nursing or therapy at home or in a skilled nursing facility \u2014 coverage that they would be able to get if they were in traditional Medicare.\u201d\n\nImproper payments, including fraud, still bedevil Medicare and Medicaid, irking beneficiaries and politicians. The Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, says that improper payments cost the federal government $60 billion in Medicare last year, or 10 percent of program spending, and $17.5 billion in Medicaid, or 6.7 percent.\n\nLast month, the Justice Department, in a nationwide sweep, accused 243 people of Medicare fraud schemes involving more than $700 million in billings for services that were unnecessary or never provided. Among those charged were 46 doctors and other professionals who offered home health care, psychotherapy, physical therapy, diagnostic tests and prescription drugs.\n\nFor Medicare and Medicaid, paying for the rising cost of prescription drugs remains a daunting challenge.\n\n\u201cMedicare Advantage provides great coverage,\u201d said Nancy R. Corey, 68, a retired schoolteacher in Dayville, Conn. \u201cBut drug costs have skyrocketed. I\u2019ve spent as much on my main medications in the first six months of this year as I did in all of 2014.\u201d\n\nWith Medicaid rolls climbing to record levels, especially in states that expanded eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid officials also face a huge challenge finding enough doctors. In many states, doctors have been reluctant to accept Medicaid patients, in part, they say, because the fees are low.\n\nElizabeth A. Persaud, 36, of Alpharetta, Ga., who has a form of muscular dystrophy, receives home and community-based services through Medicaid. A personal attendant helps her get out of bed, shower, eat and go to work.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMedicaid is a boon that allows her to preserve her independence, Ms. Persaud said, but she added: \u201cIt is difficult to find doctors in my area who accept Medicaid. I often have to have someone drive me far away to see a specialist.\u201d\n\nSara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, said that Medicaid plans were \u201conce the scourge of poor communities,\u201d taking money without providing much care. But now, she said, they provide invaluable services to people with severe physical and mental health problems, as states often require those services in their contracts with insurers.\n\n\u201cThe care is light-years better than what a Medicaid beneficiary would face if she had to go find an orthopedist, a rheumatologist or a podiatrist or get specialty drugs on her own,\u201d Ms. Rosenbaum said.\n\nMany Medicare patients agree.\n\nIn a comment echoed by other Medicare beneficiaries, Judith M. Anderson, 69, of Chicago said: \u201cAfter a lifetime of an utterly boring personal health care history, I was diagnosed with cancer in 2013. Without Medicare, I would be bankrupt and probably dead by now. I had three surgeries and chemotherapy and paid less than $1,000 out of pocket. I love Medicare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150729144830, "twitter": {"description": "Enrollment in private insurance plans has soared as the government has tried to control costs and improve care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.", "title": "As Medicare and Medicaid Turn 50, Use of Private Health Plans Surges", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/30/us/as-medicare-and-medicaid-turn-50-use-of-private-health-plans-surges.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003822217"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/30/us/30HEALTHWEB1/30HEALTHWEB1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/30/us/as-medicare-and-medicaid-turn-50-use-of-private-health-plans-surges.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003822217", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/30/us/as-medicare-and-medicaid-turn-50-use-of-private-health-plans-surges.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "As Medicare and Medicaid Turn 50, Use of Private Health Plans Surges", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 29, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Medicare,Medicaid,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Elderly,United States,Johnson  Lyndon Baines,Obama  Barack", "news_keywords": "Medicare,Medicaid,Old age", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/30/us/30HEALTHWEB1/30HEALTHWEB1-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Enrollment in private insurance plans has soared as the government has tried to control costs and improve care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/30/us/30HEALTHWEB1/30HEALTHWEB1-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Enrollment in private insurance plans has soared as the government has tried to control costs and improve care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 29, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2015-07-31", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Obama, Barack", "published": "2015-07-29", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "slug": "30health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150731103312, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/30/us/as-medicare-and-medicaid-turn-50-use-of-private-health-plans-surges.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/30/us/30HEALTHWEB1/30HEALTHWEB1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Enrollment in private insurance plans has soared as the government has tried to control costs and improve care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.", "title": "As Medicare and Medicaid Turn 50, Use of Private Health Plans Surges"}, "pdate": 20150729, "des": "Elderly", "articleid": 100000003822217, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "As Medicare and Medicaid Turn 50, Use of Private Health Plans Surges", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d28\"", "article_summary": "In the last decade, as private insurers accelerated their marketing of Medicare plans and baby boomers accustomed to managed care reached retirement age, enrollment in the private Medicare plans, called Medicare Advantage, surged.\n\u201cMedicare Advantage provides great coverage,\u201d said Nancy R.
