When Gaines announced a previous verbal commitment to Florida, the Gators' coaching staff claimed not to know anything about it and declined to accept his commitment.\n\nFlorida did actively recruit Gaines, though. Members of the coaching staff offered him a scholarship while on a visit to Nash Central High School.\n\nGaines was also a winner of Tom Suiter's Extra Effort Award this fall.\n\nOn Saturday, Gaines represented North Carolina in the Shrine Bowl of the Carolinas, an all-star game that features top seniors from North Carolina against their counterparts in South Carolina.\n\nExtra Effort: Houshun Gaines, Nash Central (Dec. 18, 2014)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.highschoolot.com/rss/612&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.highschoolot.com/rss/612&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.highschoolot.com/rss/612&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.highschoolot.com/rss/612&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.highschoolot.com/rss/612&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-12-20 20:21:25", "description": "Nash Central High School defensive lineman Houshun Gaines made a verbal commitment to Virginia Tech on Saturday evening.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-12-20 20:21:25", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14297883|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.highschoolot.com/houshun-gaines-commits-to-virginia-tech/14297883/", "image": "http://wwwcache.highschoolot.com/asset/content/football/2014/08/23/13918233/13918233-1419124874-160x120.jpg", "description": "Nash Central High School defensive lineman Houshun Gaines made a verbal commitment to Virginia Tech on Saturday evening.", "card": "summary", "title": "Houshun Gaines commits to Virginia Tech"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-20T20:21:25-05:00"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.highschoolot.com/houshun-gaines-commits-to-virginia-tech/14297883/", "image": "http://wwwcache.highschoolot.com/asset/content/football/2014/08/23/13918233/tarboro_vs_nash_central_019-728x484.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Nash Central High School defensive lineman Houshun Gaines made a verbal commitment to Virginia Tech on Saturday evening.", "title": "Houshun Gaines commits to Virginia Tech"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "pinterest": "nohover", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe51bf\"", "article_summary": "Before committing to Virginia Tech, Gaines considered offers from Boston College, Duke, Florida, Miami, NC State, Wake Forest, Vanderbilt and Virginia.\nYou must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other charactersMessage: * A friend wanted you to see this item from High School OT: http://wral.com/14297883Nash Central High School defensive lineman Houshun Gaines made a verbal commitment to Virginia Tech on Saturday evening.\nMembers of the coaching staff offered him a scholarship while on a visit to Nash Central High School.\nExtra Effort: Houshun Gaines, Nash Central (Dec. 18, 2014)\nEarlier this fall, Gaines fell victim to a catfish scam in which someone claimed to be an assistant coach from Florida."}
