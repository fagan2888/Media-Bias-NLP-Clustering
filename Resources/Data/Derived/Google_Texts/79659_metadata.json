It\u2019s also the reason so many families are hopeful that the latest wave of healthcare reform could save the lives of many cancer patients.\n\n\u201cBecause cancer treatment can be very expensive and because patients and survivors often need long-term treatment and monitoring, they are among those who are likely to have difficulties navigating the U.S. health insurance system,\u201d a 2009 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the American Cancer Society explained.\n\nThe report outlined serious problems with the health insurance systems such as \u201chigh cost-sharing and caps on benefits and lifetime maximums\u201d that leave cancer patients at risk for high out-of-pocket healthcare costs, lack of protections against high healthcare costs if the person becomes too ill to work and premiums that are difficult for many low-income families to afford.\n\nA 2010 report entitled \u201cFamilies Affected by Cancer in Health Care System\u201d revealed that four in ten families impacted by cancer had difficulties affording healthcare costs, which included prescription medications, medical bills and co-payments.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, many middle- to low-income families would struggle to pay for cancer treatments even on their current salary, but many are also forced to quit working after being diagnosed.\n\nThis adds an additional burden on the patient and their families.\n\nThis occurrence is also more common among Black cancer patients.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Cancer Survivorship discovered that Black women are far more likely to quit working during the first two months of breast cancer treatment than their white counterparts. The reason for this trend is true across almost all other forms of cancer.\n\nResearchers found a stark contrast between the amount of paid sick leave Black women were offered compared to white women.\n\nEven more troubling was the fact that Black women were less likely to get employed after being diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\u201cAt both the 2 and 9 month marks African-American women were significantly less likely to be employed than non-Hispanic whites,\u201d the study reported as outlined by Living Beyond Breast Cancer.\n\nIn the midst of battling cancer, Black patients also have to battle systemic racism and employers who no longer believe they are capable of working.\n\nIt all paints a picture of a healthcare system that is failing many Americans, particularly members of the Black community.\n\n\u201cTough economic times have magnified the barriers to quality, affordable healthcare that cancer patients and their loved ones have long faced, and they reinforce why the \u2018sick care\u2019 system fails Americans with life-threatening chronic diseases such as cancer,\u201d said Dr. John R. Seffrin, CEO of the American Cancer Society, in a recent press release.\n\nThis is why Seffrin believes that the Affordable Care Act could be the saving grace for families battling cancer.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has the potential to effect meaningful reform for cancer patients, survivors and their loved ones by transforming the system to one that focuses on prevention and provides access to the full spectrum of coverage including prevention, evidence-based treatment and patient-centered care,\u201d he added.\n\nFor the Black community, access to prevention-based care is an especially important part of healthcare reform.\n\nResearch conducted by the American Cancer Society revealed that many Black patients die from cancer because they are not diagnosed until later stages. Many Blacks aren\u2019t diagnosed at early stages because they can\u2019t afford the type of regular check-ups and treatments that could help prevent cancer or eliminate it earlier.\n\nThe American Cancer Society points out that even the Affordable Care Act won\u2019t be \u201cperfect\u201d when it comes to helping cancer patients and their families fund high healthcare costs but it is certainly a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is improving the quality and cost of healthcare in the United States for people with cancer and those at risk for cancer,\u201d the study by the American Cancer Society explained. \u201cThe law is not perfect, but it will make healthcare more adequate, affordable, and available.\u201d\n\nIt will do so by eliminating co-pays for proven preventive services, requiring all health plans sold in new health benefit exchanges to cover essential benefits like cancer screenings and follow-up care, increasing focus on treating pain and improving the overall quality of a patient\u2019s life, prohibiting healthcare plans from placing lifetime caps on coverage and closing the Medicare \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d so seniors don\u2019t face a costly gap in prescription drug coverage.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "Many studies have revealed that low-income families impacted by cancer are continuously falling through the cracks of America\u2019s healthcare system.
