Arias was hired three months ago to oversee those efforts.\n\n\u201cThere are many people that are dealing with damages in their homes, and they\u2019re either being turned away or they\u2019re confused,\u201d he explains. \u201cSome of them don\u2019t speak English very well. Some of them have already struggled with social services before. There are limits. Some programs have different eligibility requirements,\u201d he continues, \u201cSo to a homeowner or a renter that is already facing adversity, having to navigate so many programs available or not available to them can be difficult.\u201d\n\nArias gives his personal cell phone number to all his clients, so his work never really ends. \u201cIf I have to go down to a meeting in Trenton, it\u2019s not fair for them not to have access to me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very nonstop. Definitely, multitasking is a virtue.\u201d\n\nHow he arrived in his current position: Having gone to Rutgers Law School, Arias says he\u2019s always had an affinity for Newark. After graduating in 2012, he took some time off to travel in South America, and returned to the States shortly before Sandy, which actually hit on his birthday.\n\nHe did some volunteer disaster relief work in Union County after the storm, and he really enjoyed it. Arias then went on to become a health policy advocate with NJ Citizen Action, where he helped teach people about the Affordable Care Act. But when he heard a few months later that there was an opportunity with ICC to work with Newark residents affected by the storm, he jumped at the chance.\n\nThough Arias doesn\u2019t practice law, his legal expertise has come in handy helping his clients.\n\nWho he services: Many people just think of the Ironbound as the lively, ethnically diverse neighborhood to go to in Newark when you want to get good Spanish or Portuguese food. But like many communities, its demographic makeup has changed over the years, Arias says, with recent waves of immigrants coming from places like Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador and Cape Verde. This influx of new arrivals means the neighborhood has also had its share of language and socio-economic challenges. A significant portion of residents live below the poverty line, and the area\u2019s industrial past means it\u2019s also dealing with problems stemming from lingering contamination.\n\nThese problems came to a head during Sandy, when water from the lower Passaic River \u2013 an EPA Superfund site \u2013 flooded into parts of the community, bringing with it a toxic mix of oil, sewage, dioxins and PCBs. Many residents are still struggling to repair their damages.\n\n\u201cPeople think, \u2018Essex County? How was Essex County affected by the storm?\u2019\u201d says Arias, noting that most of the recovery\u2019s focus has been on the Jersey Shore. But his daily work in the Ironbound has shown him that Sandy \u201chas been a significant challenge for a community that I think many people don\u2019t realize exists or was that affected.\u201d\n\nThanks to grants from the Red Cross and the New Jersey Sandy Relief Fund, the group has now also expanded its focus to include all of Essex County.\n\nUpcoming projects: Arias is currently helping a group of Ironbound residents whose homes were flooded during Sandy apply for buyouts through the NJ Department of Environmental Protection\u2019s Blue Acres program. His organization is also working with city officials on a plan to make the neighborhood more prepared for future storms. And they\u2019re working on reconstructing six homes that were damaged by Sandy.\n\nChallenges of his work: \u201cSince I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve realized that despite there being so much money available, there\u2019s still a lot of need,\u201d Arias says. \u201cI feel a very grave sense of responsibility, because these are people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s not just my job. It\u2019s people. And they are counting on you to help them get out of a situation that they didn\u2019t ask to be in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard work, for sure, but he has no qualms about it. \u201cI have friends that I graduated (law school) with who have been practicing law,\u201d he says, \u201cand I don\u2019t envy them as all. This is the most satisfying job I have ever had. I really, really enjoy it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://assets.njspotlight.com/assets/14/0304/2329"}, "google-site-verification": "eSiTqCyhbNrILKPNvPOLORFjlPbqSQLW3WfNOcpjdcg", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "NJ Spotlight", "description": "Community advocate Diego Arias notes that the mega-storm\u2019s impact \u2013 including flooding and building damage -- was not confined to Jersey Shore", "viewport": "width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a62\"", "article_summary": "I really, really enjoy it.\u201d\nName: Diego AriasJob: Disaster Relief Program Manager at the Ironbound Community Corporation.\nBut when he heard a few months later that there was an opportunity with ICC to work with Newark residents affected by the storm, he jumped at the chance.\nDefinitely, multitasking is a virtue.\u201dHow he arrived in his current position: Having gone to Rutgers Law School, Arias says he\u2019s always had an affinity for Newark.\nUpcoming projects: Arias is currently helping a group of Ironbound residents whose homes were flooded during Sandy apply for buyouts through the NJ Department of Environmental Protection\u2019s Blue Acres program."}
