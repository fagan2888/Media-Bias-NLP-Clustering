The law, passed in 2011, changed CMS from a Medicare-like fee-for-service plan, where the child goes to a doctor and the insurer pays the bill, into state-run managed care, in which the state sets aside a pot of money \u2014 which is capped \u2014 and hires insurers to divvy it up.\n\n\n\nThe overhaul of CMS is a story about rationing of services for children who are poor and disabled, a long tradition in Florida. It is about the malleable nature of words like \u201cmoratorium,\u201d and about numbers on a balance sheet.
