But the S.C. Supreme Court found the 30 phone conservations and texts he exchanged with his cousin during breaks in the proceeding violated the rules of professional conduct for attorneys. The order was handed down last week.\n\nNelson\u2019s cousin, Austin Davey of Mount Pleasant, did not disclose his relationship before he was selected for the jury, and their family ties didn\u2019t come to light until the case was well underway, authorities stated. He was removed from the panel before deliberations began.\n\nNelson\u2019s attorney, Dawes Cooke, said their conversations during the trial involved Nelson\u2019s upcoming wedding, not the murder case itself.\n\nThe contact had no apparent effect on the outcome of the case and the high court cited no ill-intent on Nelson\u2019s part, a point his former boss and the defense attorney in the case agree on.\n\n\u201cFrom everything I gathered, it was a bone-headed, naive mistake, but nothing that was malicious or untoward,\u201d 9th Circuit Solicitor Scarlett Wilson said.\n\nThe trial in question involved a murder charge against David Rocquemore, then-28, who fatally shot 36-year-old Hershall Demar Denson after a Ladson house party broke up in August 2005. After a week-long trial, a jury found Rocquemore guilty of a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and a weapons offense and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nRocquemore unsuccessfully argued on appeal that a mistrial should have been declared because the state failed to disclose Nelson\u2019s relationship with Davey and that they continued to communicate during the trial in violation of court rules. The appeals court, however, found his case was not prejudiced as a result and upheld his convictions. He remains in prison.\n\nThe state Office of Disciplinary Counsel began its investigation into the episode after Rocquemore\u2019s appeals concluded.\n\nNelson, who had worked for the Solicitor\u2019s Office since 2004, resigned in June when he learned the Supreme Court would take up the matter.\n\nHis suspension is retroactive to his June 1 resignation date. Nelson also is required to reimburse the state for the costs of investigating and prosecuting his violation, and he has nine months in which to complete a program in legal ethics, the opinion states.\n\nNelson declined comment on the episode. His cousin couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nCooke said Nelson had no intention of undermining the case and is eager to put the matter behind him. \u201cHe assumed everybody else knew about his cousin,\u201d Cooke said.\n\nNelson told court officials he had advised his cousin to disclose their relationship before jury duty began and he assumed he had done so, the suspension order states.\n\nNelson said he figured the relationship was common knowledge because the trial judge, Daniel Pieper, had texted him and asked him to leave the courtroom when he ventured into the trial one day, the order states. He explained that he and Pieper were friends and that it was not uncommon for him to text with the trial judge, the order states.\n\nPieper, who now sits on the S.C. Court of Appeals, has said his comment to Nelson that day was made in jest, the order states.\n\nWilson said the prosecutors handling the case knew Nelson\u2019s cousin was in the larger jury pool but assumed he wasn\u2019t in the running for their panel because he didn\u2019t speak up when potential jurors were questioned about possible conflicts.\n\nWilson, who traveled to Columbia to speak on Nelson\u2019s behalf during a July disciplinary hearing before the high court, said Nelson\u2019s conduct clearly violated the rules but it essentially involved an innocent mistake.\n\nAndy Savage, Rocquemore\u2019s defense attorney, said Nelson made no attempt to hide the relationship when asked about it, and he doesn\u2019t believe Nelson meant any harm.\n\n\u201cI always thought the world of Michael in terms of openness, fairness and integrity,\u201d Savage said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t change as a result of this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ex-Charleston County prosecutor suspended from practicing law, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nCharleston County, \r\nCharleston County,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "A former Charleston County prosecutor has been suspended from practicing law for six months for communicating with a cousin who was sitting on a jury during a 2007 murder trial.", "title": "Ex-Charleston County prosecutor suspended from practicing law", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20131102/131109935/ex-charleston-county-prosecutor-suspended-from-practicing-law", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/carbon/carbon-generic.png", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/carbon/carbon-generic.png"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@postandcourier", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "description": "A former Charleston County prosecutor has been suspended from practicing law for six months for communicating with a cousin who was sitting on a jury during a 2007 murder trial.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ex-Charleston County prosecutor suspended from practicing law"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 131109935}}, "keywords": "Ex-Charleston County prosecutor suspended from practicing law , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nCharleston County, \r\nCharleston County", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-02T11:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2013-11-01T16:31:00Z", "author": "Glenn Smith"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A former Charleston County prosecutor has been suspended from practicing law for six months for communicating with a cousin who was sitting on a jury during a 2007 murder trial."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2790\"", "article_summary": "A former Charleston County prosecutor has been suspended from practicing law for six months for communicating with a cousin who was sitting on a jury during a 2007 murder trial.\nNelson\u2019s attorney, Dawes Cooke, said their conversations during the trial involved Nelson\u2019s upcoming wedding, not the murder case itself.\nFormer 9th Circuit Assistant Solicitor Michael Nelson was not a member of the legal team prosecuting the trial.\nCooke said Nelson had no intention of undermining the case and is eager to put the matter behind him.\nThe appeals court, however, found his case was not prejudiced as a result and upheld his convictions."}
