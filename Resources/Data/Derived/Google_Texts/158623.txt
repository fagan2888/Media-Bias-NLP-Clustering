THOMASTON, Maine — A Spruce Head woman was injured late Saturday morning when she lost control of the motorcycle she was riding, hit a guardrail and plummeted 30 feet down an embankment at the intersection of High Street and New County Road in Thomaston.

Melissa Robbins, 40, was driving a friend’s 2002 yellow Honda Spirit, according to Lt. Kirk Guerrette of the Knox County Sheriff’s Office.

Witnesses stated she stopped at the stop sign at the intersection of High Street and New County Road, then began to turn left onto Route 1 when she lost control of the motorcycle, suddenly accelerating into the guardrail.

Robbins, who was wearing a helmet, suffered a compound fracture to her right leg, Guerrette said in a release to the media. Thomaston and Rockland Fire and EMS were able to get Robbins to the top of the hill and then to an area where she was taken by LifeFlight to Eastern Maine Medical Center for treatment.

A nursing supervisor at EMMC said Robbins was in fair condition Saturday evening.
