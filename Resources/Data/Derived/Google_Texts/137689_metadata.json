A grimace replaced his usual smile.\n\nThe Broncos won for the second time this season without scoring an offensive touchdown, trumping the Oakland Raiders 16-10. They won because their defense plays with tenacity and aggression not seen in Denver since the 1970s. They won because of their strength and their strength in numbers.\n\nWare, who entered Sunday as the league leader in sacks, exited the game in the first quarter with back spasms. And the Broncos still didn\u2019t allow a second-half touchdown, finishing with four sacks and a third defensive score in five games.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of guys who can make plays,\u201d Ware said. \u201cYou are seeing that every week.\u201d\n\nGiven the havoc caused by Ware, his tentative walk to the team bus at o.Co Coliseum created concern. At age 33, Ware has begun this season on a rampage, providing a pressure point for a defense that continues to find creative ways to make quarterbacks miserable. Ware insisted he would be fine, though the flight back to Colorado figured to be uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cIt just locked up on me. I came into the locker room, and I just couldn\u2019t get it to loosen up,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anything that would keep me out.\u201d\n\nWare suffered the injury when his right foot gave way on the new turf at the coliseum as he turned around to make a tackle on a Raiders screen pass. This was the first game Oakland has had a full 100 yards of sod as the Oakland Athletics, the shared tenet, finished their season last weekend.\n\n\u201cIt just slipped as I pushed off,\u201d Ware said.\n\nThat the defense remained stout without Ware provides compelling evidence of why it ranks tops in football in yards allowed. Ware attacks the quarterback. So does Von Miller. That was expected. What wasn\u2019t anticipated was the quality work from former Colorado State star Shaquil Barrett and first-round pick Shane Ray. Barrett finished with a sack, tackle for loss and a hit on the quarterback. Ray added a sack and a takedown behind the line of scrimmage.\n\nThe Broncos have made 22 sacks in five games, leaving them on pace for 70 on the season. The 1984 team set the franchise record with 57.\n\n\u201cOf course we miss DWare, but we have a lot of great players with a great scheme and great coaches who demand greatness,\u201d said defensive Derek Wolfe, who returned from a four-game performancing enhancing drug suspension to record five tackles. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s at practice, or in the game. They set high expectations for us.\u201d\n\nThe defense hasn\u2019t allowed a point in the first quarter this season. Ware was in the game for the latest bagel. And his teammates believe he will be back when they attempt to extend the streak Sunday at Cleveland.\n\n\u201cUnless it\u2019s something serious \u2014 and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal \u2014 he will be be out there. I think he will be all right,\u201d defensive lineman Antonio Smith said. \u201cNothing is going to keep that man off the field. He\u2019s a warrior.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
