The city of 100,000 in Michoacan state has been under effective control of the Knights Templar cartel for several years.\n\n\u201cFederal forces are working with self-defense groups,\u201d vigilante leader Hipolito Mora told The Associated Press by telephone from the center of Apatzingan. \u201cGuys from the self-defense groups are moving around the city, cooperating in certain ways with the federal government. Many, many people have been detained.\u201d\n\nMora said federal police controlled security in the city and both armed and unarmed member of the \u201cself-defense\u201d movement were working with them to identify Knights Templar hideouts. He said approximately 200 gang members were arrested, including the brother of one of its leaders, Enrique \u201cKiki\u201d Plancarte. The government made no immediate comment.\n\nThe vigilantes\u2019 presence in the city is both a symbolic and tactical boost for the movement.\n\nThe control of the Knights Templar group was once so complete that it would have been unthinkable for any rival to enter Apatzingan. The Knights Templar often traveled in vehicles marked with its symbol, a red cross, and sponsored demonstrations calling for the federal police to leave the city.\n\nThe cartel promotes itself as a mystic Christian order dedicated to protecting the population from abuse at the hands of the military and police. It ran \u201ctraining schools,\u201d including one in Apatzingan, that taught courses in leadership portraying cartel members as clean-living men of honor, steeped in Asian religion alongside Catholicism. Its members not only lived off methamphetamine and marijuana smuggling and extortion, but controlled much of the local economy.\n\nIn October, vigilantes tried to march into Apatzingan but were turned back by soldiers who said they couldn\u2019t enter with weapons. A convoy of hundreds of unarmed self-defense patrol members returned the next day and successfully entered the city, where they were met by gunfire, presumably from the Knights Templar.\n\nIn apparent retaliation to the attempted incursion, suspected cartel members mounted coordinated attacks on vigilante positions, killing five, according to police. They also destroyed government electrical facilities, including power distribution plants and electrical sub-stations, in 14 towns and cities around Michoacan, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nMora told the AP on Saturday that this latest incursion was \u201ca triumph.\u201d\n\nThe vigilantes\u2019 knowledge of the city is already boosting government operations against the Knights Templar, according to Mora, who said self-defense force members were going door-to-door pointing out suspected cartel members to federal police and helping police man check points on the roads in and out of the city.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all around the city watching to see if members of the Knights Templar are coming or going,\u201d he said.\n\nMexico legalized the growing \u201cself-defense\u201d movement in Michoacan late last month, saying they would be incorporated into quasi-military units called Rural Defense Corps. Vigilante groups estimate their numbers at 20,000 men under arms.\n\nMora said vigilantes who have been formally incorporated into the Rural Defense Corps were armed, while those not yet registered had no weapons. He said he and his close associates were unarmed, and were there primarily to attend an afternoon rally for peace and the rule of law called by an Apatzingan clergyman who has opposed the Knights Templar.\n\nVigilantes began rising up last February against the Knights Templar reign of terror and extortion after police and troops failed to stop the abuses. Vigilante leaders have been asked to submit a list of their members to the Defense Department and are being allowed to keep their weapons as long as they register them with the army.\n\nThe military is giving the groups \u201call the means necessary for communications, operations and movement,\u201d according to the agreement.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Where Mexican drug cartels rule, masked vigilantes are fighting back", "title": "Where Mexican drug cartels rule, masked vigilantes are fighting back", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/08/where-mexican-drug-cartels-rule-masked-vigilantes-are-fighting-back/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208__p_7ba20ce6-3d9d-4e58-bf98-fd0d881f3164lsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 320}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208__p_7ba20ce6-3d9d-4e58-bf98-fd0d881f3164lsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-08T17:58:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T19:31:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6163\"", "article_summary": "The city of 100,000 in Michoacan state has been under effective control of the Knights Templar cartel for several years.\nMexico legalized the growing \u201cself-defense\u201d movement in Michoacan late last month, saying they would be incorporated into quasi-military units called Rural Defense Corps.\nVigilantes began rising up last February against the Knights Templar reign of terror and extortion after police and troops failed to stop the abuses.\nIn apparent retaliation to the attempted incursion, suspected cartel members mounted coordinated attacks on vigilante positions, killing five, according to police.\n\u201cThey\u2019re all around the city watching to see if members of the Knights Templar are coming or going,\u201d he said."}
