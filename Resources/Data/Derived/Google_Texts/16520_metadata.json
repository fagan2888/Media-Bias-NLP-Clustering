For 2015 to date, the large group increases have averaged 9 percent, Coon said, \u201cbut because these don\u2019t use the metallic system it\u2019s not an apples-to-apples comparison to the small groups.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the modest rise in premiums for group plans this year is a success story that reflects efforts of Alaska employers to control health costs, and that is at least partly related to the aggressive adoption by employers of wellness programs to promote health among their workers, Coon said.\n\nAlaska is leading other Pacific Northwest states in the number of employers promoting wellness programs to control health care costs, and in fact may also be leading the nation, she said.\n\nPremera Blue Cross and Blue Shield also sells in Washington state and in Oregon under another company in the Premera group, LifeWise Health Plan of Oregon, so the company has good comparative data on employer wellness initiatives and preventative care, Coon said.\n\nIf that is good news, some not-so-good news is that Alaska is lags in another key health indicator, preventative checkups for adults and vaccinations for children. That is matter of concern to Premera, Coon said, because checkups and vaccinations result in better health and ultimately lower health insurance costs for employers.\n\nThe company has another campaign underway for that, however, the \u201cCheckup Challenge.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cOur Alaska market has definitely been the leader for the rest of Premera as it relates to embedded wellness products,\u201d or wellness programs encouraged by employers, Coon said.\n\n\u201cOther markets are starting to catch up in engagement (of wellness) but they lag behind Alaska,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s because wellness initiatives got started here earlier but also because the program have embraced by Alaska employers who were moving aggressively to control health costs, she said.\n\nPremera promotes the programs with its customers and offers discounts of up to 7 percent to 10 percent on group health premium costs depending on how many employees sign up for the wellness initiatives.\n\nGroups that are not affiliated with an Affordable Care Act plan, those sold in an ACA insurance exchange, can get up to a 10 percent discount. Groups in one of the ACA metallic plans can get up to 7 percent off on premiums, she said.\n\n\u201cCurrently we serve more than 1,000 employer groups in Alaska and approximately 25 percent of these participate in the wellness program,\u201d Coon said.\n\nThis amounts to about 30 percent of the total number of employees in the plans, she said.\n\nPremera is now stepping\n\nup its initiatives with a new program launched in July: the \u201cActivity Challenge.\u201d\n\nUntil now Premera\u2019s wellness programs have been focused more on promoting periodic health screening and checkups, with biometric screening, blood pressure and weight monitoring, but the new initiative is aimed at promoting more physical activity, which has been shown by data to be linked to improved health, Coon said.\n\n\u201cPhysical activity is the fastest and most proven way to improve one\u2019s health and health outcomes,\u201d Coon said, and encouraging activity among employees can be a key driver for employers to manage their health costs.\n\nTo promote this Premera is now offering \u201cFit Bit Zip\u201d tracking devices to large group employees and the program may eventually expand to small group plans.\n\n\u201cThese are wearable trackers that clip onto clothing and tracks steps, distance, calories burned and active minutes. People can sync their Fit Bits wirelessly to their computers or smart phones to see all their activity stats and chart their progress,\u201d Coon said.\n\nPremera\u2019s \u201cActivity Challenge\u201d campaign allow employees in large group plans to earn points by having their physical activity tracked on the Fit Bit, and logging their activity through \u201cEveryMove,\u201d an online application that compiles the data from the tracking device and can transmit tothe employee\u2019s iPhone or computer.\n\nIn the contest, \u201cif employees log 750 points in a month, or 30 minutes of activity five times a week, they get to keep the Fit Bit device and earn a $100 Visa gift card,\u201d Coon said.\n\nThe activity data remains confidential to the participant but EveryMove does keep track for Premera of how many employees are participating and when enough activity has occurred to get the incentive card. The challenge goes through September.\n\nOn the checkup and vaccination front, the Alaska statistics are not so good, Coon said. Nearly half of employees covered by Premera\u2019s policies in Alaska have had no preventative care in the last two years. Also, 35 percent of children in the 19-month through 35-month age group have not had the recommended vaccinations for children.\n\nBecause Premera is a the largest insurer in the Alaska market, in health insurance, the statistics on preventative care and vaccinations may reflect the situation across the broader Alaska population, however.\n\nTo improve this, Premera has launched yet another initiative, its \u201cCheckup Challenge,\u201d also with a gift card incentive, this one a $200 Amazon gift card. A key difference is that this incentive is available to all Alaskans, not just those covered under Premera\u2019s plans, Coon said.\n\nHowever, the card is awarded through a weekly drawing among people who sign up with Premera for the Check Up Challenge.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a member of Premera to participate. Even if you\u2019re a nonmember we\u2019ll pay for the gift card,\u201d she said. A plus for Premera is that the campaign gets people to the company\u2019s website, which in the long run could result in more business for the company.\n\nPremera is also looking to improve preventative care in Washington and Oregon where it also has a checkup initiative and a gift card, but Alaska is getting special emphasis.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen the staggering low numbers of checkups and vaccinations in those markets like Alaska,\u201d Coon said.\n\nTim Bradner can be reached at tim.bradner@alaskajournal.com.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield, the dominant firm in the state\u2019s health insurance market, has filed for a relatively modest 4.4 percent increase for its small group plans in 2016, which is down from the 5.26 percent increase filed last year for 2015.
