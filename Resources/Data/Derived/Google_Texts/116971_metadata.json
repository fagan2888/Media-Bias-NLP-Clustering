While representative democracy is dysfunctional, the Supreme Court has taken over with its own reactionary power grab. In case after case, the court\u2019s right-wing majority is making its own law\u2014expanding the power of corporations and the very wealthy, while making it harder for ordinary citizens to fight back. Ad Policy\n\nWorst of all, the Roberts Court is trying to permanently inhibit the federal government\u2019s ability to help people cope with the country\u2019s vast social and economic disorders.\n\nThis is not a theoretical complaint. Led by Chief Justice John Roberts, the conservative Republican Court is building a barbed wire fence around the federal government\u2014creating constitutional obstacles to progressive legislation in ways that resemble the Supreme Court\u2019s notorious Lochner decision of 1905. That case held that property rights prevail over people and the common good.\n\nFor more than thirty years, the conservative Justices used that twisted precedent to invalidate more than 200 state and federal laws on major social and economic concerns like child labor, the minimum wage, bank regulation and union organizing. New Deal reformers were stymied by Lochner at first, and they only managed to overturn it in 1937 and only then when FDR mobilized a take-no-prisoners campaign to reform the Supreme Court by weakening its unaccountable power.\n\nThe Roberts Court has so far produced a slew of precedent-smashing decisions designed to hobble left-liberal reform movements before they can gain political traction. Citizens United opened the floodgates for corporate money; McCutcheon scrapped the dollar limits on fat-cat donors. Roberts gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, implicitly endorsing the GOP\u2019s crude campaign to block racial minorities from voting. The US Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable have won numerous victories, large and small, expanding the rights of their corporate sponsors.\n\n\u201cWe are in an era of very aggressive corporate litigation to expand the constitutional prerogatives of business,\u201d Kent Greenfield, Boston College law professor, explained. \u201cWe are on the verge of going back to the Lochner era where every new regulation will be subject to numerous constitutional attacks\u2014any regulation of content in commercial speech attacked on First Amendment grounds, anti-discrimination law or healthcare legislation attacked on religious grounds. You\u2019ll see financial legislation challenged on due-process grounds.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/scotus_justices_ap_img_1-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "William Greider", "description": "In case after case, the Roberts Supreme Court is expanding the power of corporations and the very wealthy while making it harder for ordinary citizens to fight back.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "In case after case, the Roberts Supreme Court is expanding the power of corporations and the very wealthy while making it harder for ordinary citizens to fight back.", "title": "Thanks to the Roberts Court, Corporations Have More Constitutional Rights Than Actual People", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/thanks-roberts-court-corporations-have-more-constitutional-rights-actual-people/", "image": {"width": 615, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/scotus_justices_ap_img_1.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 399}, "updated_time": "2015-07-07T15:08:18+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In case after case, the Roberts Supreme Court is expanding the power of corporations and the very wealthy while making it harder for ordinary citizens to fight back.", "title": "Thanks to the Roberts Court, Corporations Have More Constitutional Rights Than Actual People", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/thanks-roberts-court-corporations-have-more-constitutional-rights-actual-people/", "image": {"height": 399, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/scotus_justices_ap_img_1.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/scotus_justices_ap_img_1.jpg", "width": 615}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "May 20th, 2014", "sailthru.title": "Thanks to the Roberts Court, Corporations Have More Constitutional Rights Than Actual People", "keywords": "chief justice john roberts, the supreme court, corporations, citizens united, william greider, the nation, corporate power, the constitution, the roberts court", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 111516, "sailthru.tags": "Campaign Finance,Economy,Supreme Court,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "the roberts court", "published_time": "2014-05-20T16:00:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-07T15:08:18+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/annieshields/"}, "sailthru.description": "In case after case, the Court is expanding the power of corporations and the very wealthy while making it harder for ordinary citizens to fight back.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/scotus_justices_ap_img_1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd344d\"", "article_summary": "While representative democracy is dysfunctional, the Supreme Court has taken over with its own reactionary power grab.\nThe Roberts Court has so far produced a slew of precedent-smashing decisions designed to hobble left-liberal reform movements before they can gain political traction.\nAd PolicyWorst of all, the Roberts Court is trying to permanently inhibit the federal government\u2019s ability to help people cope with the country\u2019s vast social and economic disorders.\nRoberts gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, implicitly endorsing the GOP\u2019s crude campaign to block racial minorities from voting.\nThe US Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable have won numerous victories, large and small, expanding the rights of their corporate sponsors."}
