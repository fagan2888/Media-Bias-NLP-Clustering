It will instead be populism and nationalism.\n\nFor those looking for a governing philosophy of The Donald, his checkered political history has provided little guidance. He\u2019s seemingly endorsed single-payer healthcare; he\u2019s said he rejects Obamacare. He\u2019s blasted money in politics; he\u2019s talked about the necessity for government use of eminent domain to help private parties. He\u2019s ripped overregulation of capitalistic enterprises; he\u2019s talked about tariffs on foreign goods. Trump isn\u2019t conservative, and he never was.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-TX), Trump\u2019s chief challenger in the next primary state of South Carolina, is utilizing that lack of coherent conservatism as a club against Trump. His latest ad blitz features a small boy holding a Trump action figure, shouting, \u201cLook, I got the Trump action figure! He pretends to be a Republican!\u201d He then uses the action figure to brag about giving money to Democrats and engaging in eminent domain.\n\nTrump won\u2019t be able to trump Cruz on conservatism. So now he\u2019s making clear that he isn\u2019t running a conservative campaign \u2013 he\u2019s running a nationalist and populist campaign. His enemies include both Republicans and conservatives:\n\nRemember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN\u2019T KEEP THEM! Hi DT \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 11, 2016\n\nAccording to Trump, then, conservatives helped bamboozle the Republican base, along with the Republican establishment. So the establishment sucks \u2013 and so do conservatives.\n\nTrump\u2019s move here is calculated. He\u2019s going to campaign as a post-ideological candidate. All he wants, as he said in his next tweet, is to \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\u201d If that means bigger government, that means bigger government. If that means more interventionism in the economy, that means more interventionism in the economy. Trump believes he can restore American greatness in his personage \u2013 he can make terrific deals, he can \u201cwin\u201d on behalf of America.\n\nMany of his followers believe that, too.\n\n@benshapiro @KenYounos You care more about a failed ideology than saving the country. Oh well \u2013 too bad. \u201cConservatism\u201d failed for decades. \u2014 Trumpservative (@conservinews) February 11, 2016\n\n@benshapiro Wanting to make America great again is a conservative aspiration. Leftists hate America, American greatness is the original sin. \u2014 Ken Younos (@KenYounos) February 11, 2016\n\n@benshapiro concept eludes you doesn\u2019t it?!?!?! has NOTHING TO DO with ideology but never mind what\u2019s the use you\u2019ll never comprehend \u2014 Lee Hempfling (@LeeHempfling) February 11, 2016\n\n@benshapiro Yes, Trump\u2019s a nationalist who transcends left and right, and that\u2019s why America needs him. Fuck conservatism. \u2014 Nomanslander (@GhostCatHoarder) February 11, 2016\n\nTrump stands up for America; Trump Hulk Smashes for you. He cares about America, and that\u2019s enough \u2013 he wants to restore American greatness, and that\u2019s enough. How will he do it? He just will. And he won\u2019t be held back by any conservative vision of a small government nation founded on individual liberty. Sometimes he\u2019ll do conservative things. Sometimes he won\u2019t. But he\u2019ll act with \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cdo what needs to be done.\u201d\n\nNone of this should be comforting for conservatives, but Trump doesn\u2019t mean for it to be. He\u2019s hoping that there are enough aphilosophic Americans to push him forward to victory.\n\nHe may be right.\n\nEven if he is, that\u2019s no victory for conservative principles. As Trump says, that\u2019s not a priority.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News, Editor-in-Chief of DailyWire.com, and The New York Times bestselling author, most recently, of the book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
