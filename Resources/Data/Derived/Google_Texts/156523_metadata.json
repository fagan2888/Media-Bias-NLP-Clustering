Cavuto described Welch as, \u201cmy old boss, one of the greatest CEO\u2019S of all time.\u201d\n\nWelch wasted little time launching into a pitch for Cruz. \u201cThe thing I like about Ted Cruz,\u201d Welch began, \u201cclearly, is he says what he\u2019s going to do, and he does it. I\u2019ve written a book, as you know, or two and I\u2019ve always talked about truth and trust. You say it, and then you do it.\u201d\n\nWelch said approvingly that Cruz is not liked by his colleagues because, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t play ball with you guys and your handshakes with each other in the cartel. He calls it like it\u2019s the cartel, whether it\u2019s the Republicans or the Democrats.\u201d\n\nCavuto acknowledged that Cruz is reputed to be \u201ca brilliant lawyer, brilliant Constitutionalist, solicitor general\u201d and that \u201csome of the most historic opinions in recent years were written by him.\u201d But, Cavuto added, \u201cHe\u2019s a bull in a china shop, the argument goes. He likens himself to Ronald Reagan, but Ronald Reagan was very good at reaching across the aisle because he was first effective at uniting his own. This guy is criticized for dividing his own.\u201d\n\nWelch argued that Cruz won his senate seat in 2010 by vowing to \u201ctake on\u201d ObamaCare, which Welch called \u201cone of the worst pieces of legislation in history\u201d that is \u201cfalling apart now in our hands.\u201d Cruz was \u201cright,\u201d Welch said, for wanting to \u201cshut the government down over it, he\u2019s fought hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cTed Cruz is speaking the truth,\u201d Welch continued. \u201cHe\u2019s out there saying what it\u2019s like. We\u2019re all tired of these backroom deals. \u2026We won the election, Republicans\u2026 in \u201810 and \u201814. \u2026We didn\u2019t get beans.\u201d\n\n\u201dBut you\u2019ve got to work with people. \u2026The rap against Cruz is that he can\u2019t,\u201d Cavuto said.\n\nThen, after the two agreed that Cruz\u2019s staff is \u201cfabulous\u201d and \u201cbrilliant,\u201d Welch urged viewers to \u201cGive him a chance, and let the country see.\u201d\n\nNot mentioned in this Cruz infomercial was that 67% of Cruz's comments reviewed by Politifact Texas were rated as false, mostly false, or pants on fire.\n\nBut it's not too surprising that should have been overlooked. When Welch noted that PolitiFact\u2019s top five most honest people in a list of 18 were Democrats, he accused the organization of bias. \u201cThey should be arrested,\u201d Welch said about Politico.\n\nThat got a big laugh from Cavuto.\n\nNobody considered that maybe Republicans are just less honest.\n\nWatch it below from the December 16 Your World.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "1Xa2tw36fxXpxjPAddgBkWqzoK7j9ptV8gWj4R0pzvU=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/fox_trots_out_jack_welch_to_plug_ted_cruz_for_president_121615", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Fox Trots Out Jack Welch To Plug Ted Cruz For President"}, "Title": "Fox Trots Out Jack Welch To Plug Ted Cruz For President"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe thing I like about Ted Cruz,\u201d Welch began, \u201cclearly, is he says what he\u2019s going to do, and he does it.\nOn Fox\u2019s Your World show, host Neil Cavuto helped former GE CEO Jack Welch turn an interview into an infomercial for Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz.\nCavuto described Welch as, \u201cmy old boss, one of the greatest CEO\u2019S of all time.\u201dWelch wasted little time launching into a pitch for Cruz.\nWhen Welch noted that PolitiFact\u2019s top five most honest people in a list of 18 were Democrats, he accused the organization of bias.\nI\u2019ve written a book, as you know, or two and I\u2019ve always talked about truth and trust."}
