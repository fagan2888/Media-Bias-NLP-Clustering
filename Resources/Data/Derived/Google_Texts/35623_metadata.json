Based on a nationally representative, probability-based Internet panel, the HRMS provides quarterly data for approximately 7,400 nonelderly adults and 2,400 children on insurance coverage, access to health care, and health care affordability, along with special topics of relevance to current policy and program issues in each quarter. For example, HRMS data from summer 2013 show that more than 60 percent of those targeted by the health insurance exchanges struggle with understanding key health insurance concepts. This raises concerns about some people\u2019s ability to evaluate trade-offs when choosing health insurance plans. Assisting people as they attempt to enroll in health coverage will require targeted education efforts and staff to support those with low health insurance literacy.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "NOODP", "citation_id_from_sass_path": "33/1/161", "citation_collection_id": 57, "citation_issn": "1544-5208", "HW.ad-path": "/cgi/content/abstract/33/1/161", "citation_date": "01/01/2014", "DC.Date": "2014-01-01", "citation_pdf_url": "http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/1/161.full.pdf", "citation_author_institution": "10Katherine Hempstead is a senior program officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, in Princeton, New Jersey, and a visiting research assistant professor at the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy, in New Brunswick, New Jersey.", "citation_author": "Katherine Hempstead", "citation_lastpage": 167, "citation_section": "Web First", "citation_issue": 1, "DC.Format": "text/html", "DC.Publisher": "Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation,\n                    Inc.", "citation_id": "33/1/161", "citation_journal_abbrev": "Health Aff", "DC.Identifier": "10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0934", "DC.Contributor": "Katherine Hempstead", "robots": "noarchive", "citation_journal_title": "Health Affairs", "citation_title": "The Health Reform Monitoring Survey: Addressing Data Gaps To Provide Timely Insights Into The Affordable Care Act", "citation_volume": 33, "citation_fulltext_html_url": "http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/1/161.full", "issue_cover_image": "/content/33/1.cover.gif", "citation_pmid": 24352654, "citation_firstpage": 161, "citation_abstract_html_url": "http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/1/161.abstract", "HW.identifier": "/healthaff/33/1/161.atom", "citation_doi": "10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0934", "citation_public_url": "http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/1/161", "citation_mjid": "healthaff;33/1/161", "DC.Language": "en", "DC.Title": "The Health Reform Monitoring Survey: Addressing Data Gaps To Provide Timely Insights Into The Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd807b\"", "article_summary": "Assisting people as they attempt to enroll in health coverage will require targeted education efforts and staff to support those with low health insurance literacy.\nAbstractThe Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) was launched in 2013 as a mechanism to obtain timely information on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) during the period before federal government survey data for 2013 and 2014 will be available.\nFor example, HRMS data from summer 2013 show that more than 60 percent of those targeted by the health insurance exchanges struggle with understanding key health insurance concepts.\nThis raises concerns about some people\u2019s ability to evaluate trade-offs when choosing health insurance plans.\nBased on a nationally representative, probability-based Internet panel, the HRMS provides quarterly data for approximately 7,400 nonelderly adults and 2,400 children on insurance coverage, access to health care, and health care affordability, along with special topics of relevance to current policy and program issues in each quarter."}
