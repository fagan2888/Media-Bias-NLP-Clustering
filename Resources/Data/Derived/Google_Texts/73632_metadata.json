Early childhood. Infant mortality. The environment. Education. I think we focus too much on just one issue, and now that the issue of gay marriage is kind of off the table, we\u2019re kind of down to one social issue.\n\nKasich said he presses on issues such as improving mental health care because he cares about people.\n\n\u201cConservatism is giving everybody a chance to be able to be successful,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way (Ronald) Reagan was. I mean, that\u2019s common sense.\u201d\n\nDespite Kasich\u2019s statement that he does not need to read a Bible to figure out what he thinks, he has justified both his expansion of Medicaid in his state and his acceptance of same-sex marriage in biblical terms.\n\nIn late March, Kasich cited the Bible to justify his Medicaid expansion made possible by Obamacare.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really calling into question the character and the motivation of those who disagree with him on the Medicaid expansion, pretty much literally saying that you\u2019re going to rot in hell if you didn\u2019t agree,\u201d Avik Roy of Forbes told The Columbus Dispatch following his challenge of Kasich on the issue.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\nWhile Kasich contends that the expansion is saving money by decreasing emergency-room visits, he also justifies it by scriptural references. One is Jesus\u2019 admonition in Matthew 25 to care for \u201cthe least of these,\u201d followed by a warning that those who don\u2019t will be sent to \u201ceternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.\u201d Another is a more general reference by Kasich who says when you arrive at the gates of Heaven, you won\u2019t be asked whether you balanced the budget, but whether you helped the least of these.\n\n\u201cI would say that it\u2019s highly probable that many conservative Christians will be offended that they\u2019re not good Christians if they don\u2019t support a massive expansion of government health care,\u201d Roy added. \u201cI would say that\u2019s almost disqualifying in a Republican primary.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, during the first Republican debate in his home state, Kasich was asked by moderator Megyn Kelly how he would explain his opposition to gay marriage to a son or daughter who was gay or lesbian.\n\nKasich, however, responded that despite being a person who believes in \u201ctraditional marriage,\u201d his feeling is, \u201cthe court has ruled\u2026we\u2019ll accept it.\u201d\n\nHe then launched into a story about attending his gay friend\u2019s wedding and ended with the statement, \u201cSo if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? That\u2019s what we\u2019re taught when we have strong faith.\u201d\n\nOnce again, calling upon God to justify his response, Kasich continued, \u201cSo, look, I\u2019m going to love my daughters. I\u2019m going to love them no matter what they do. Because you know what? God gives me unconditional love. I\u2019m going to give it to my family, and my friends, and the people around me.\u201d\n\nAs the Christian Post notes, Family Research Council President Tony Perkins wondered whether Kasich thought the 1973 decision in Roe V. Wade should be accepted as the law of the land for abortion as well.\n\n\u201cIf I would have been asking a follow up question,\u201d it\u2026\u201dwould be: \u2018Is that your view on Roe v. Wade?\u2019 Because if it is, you can\u2019t be pro-life,\u201d Perkins said.\n\n\u201cIt tells me that he is a judicial supremacist and believes that the court has final say on all issues,\u201d he continued. \u201cI would assume that means on the Second Amendment. I would assume that means on the right to life and on private property rights. John Kasich\u2019s view would suggest that we can save the country a lot of money by eliminating the Congress by letting the courts rule the country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP presidential contender John Kasich said during an interview Sunday he thinks conservatives focus too much on abortion.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "GOP presidential contender John Kasich said during an interview Sunday he thinks conservatives focus too much on abortion.", "title": "John Kasich: Conservatives \u2018Focus too Much\u2019 on Abortion", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/John-Kasich-AP-Photo.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/19/john-kasich-conservatives-focus-too-much-on-abortion/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP presidential contender John Kasich said during an interview Sunday he thinks conservatives focus too much on abortion.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/John-Kasich-AP-Photo.jpg", "title": "John Kasich: Conservatives \u2018Focus too Much\u2019 on Abortion", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Family Research council, GOP Debate, John Kasich 2016, Medicaid expansion, obamacare, same-sex marriage, Social Issues,2016 Presidential Race, Abortion, Big Government,abortion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Social Issues", "published_time": "2015-08-19T18:25:14-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Abortion"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERGOP presidential contender John Kasich said during an interview Sunday he thinks conservatives \u201cfocus too much on just\u201d abortion as a social issue.\nThe Ohio governor continued:I think (abortion) is an important issue, but I think there\u2019s many other issues that are really critical.\nI think we focus too much on just one issue, and now that the issue of gay marriage is kind of off the table, we\u2019re kind of down to one social issue.\nKasich said he presses on issues such as improving mental health care because he cares about people.\nAccording to the report:While Kasich contends that the expansion is saving money by decreasing emergency-room visits, he also justifies it by scriptural references."}
