Here are a few pieces of workers\u2019 rights legislation we\u2019d like to see for 2016.\n\n1. Pass laws tailored to a growing \u201cgig economy.\u201d\n\nMore workers than ever before make their living doing freelance or contract work, as opposed to working for a single employer. In fact, experts estimate that 40 percent of the workforce could end up in those on-demand positions in the next five years.\n\nThis introduces a handful of problems, says Paula Brantner, executive director of the nonprofit Workplace Fairness. For instance, she sees some more companies call their workers independent contractors when they should be employees because they work for just one company.\n\nContractors aren\u2019t guaranteed tax withholding, workers\u2019 comp, and anti-discrimination, wage and overtime protections like employees are. Legislation would make the distinction crystal clear.\n\n2. Raise the federal minimum wage.\n\nThe \u201cFight for 15\u201d campaign made headlines last year, as low-wage workers walked out for higher pay to support themselves and their families. Cities and states across the U.S. have adopted wages higher than the federal minimum of $7.25, but it\u2019s past time for the feds to step up.\n\nActivists\u2019 $15-an-hour goal may not even be enough. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a worker supporting one child in the state with the lowest cost of living, Tennessee, would need to make $20.26 an hour working full time to make a living wage.\n\n3. Pass the Equality Act.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled this summer that discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity is against federal law. The proposed Equality Act would write nondiscrimination for America\u2019s LGBT folks into the law itself.\n\n\u201cThe law is literally changing on a daily basis right now,\u201d says Brantner. \u201cI think a few years from now, we\u2019ll look back and [gender identity and sexual orientation will] be with other forms of discrimination that people expect to not have to deal with in the workplace.\u201d\n\n4. Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n\nWhile the U.K. recently passed a law requiring companies to publish what they pay men and women, U.S. law has done little recently to improve the gender wage gap. Statistics show women make an average of 77 cents to every man\u2019s dollar. While many factors figure into this number, the Paycheck Fairness Act would hold employers accountable.\n\nSadly, GOP lawmakers have blocked the act four times. Let\u2019s hope the fifth time\u2019s the charm.\n\n5. Guarantee paid sick leave.\n\nThe United States is the only rich country in the world that doesn\u2019t guarantee workers paid sick leave. Whether someone heads to work at a restaurant ill because they don\u2019t want to lose a day\u2019s wages or they send a sick child to school because they can\u2019t stay home to care for them, the need for change is great.\n\n6. Guarantee parental leave too.\n\nThe U.S. is also one of the few well-off countries that doesn\u2019t guarantee paid maternity leave. (Many others provide leave for fathers as well.) Those working at medium and large companies can take 12 weeks off and not be fired, but that\u2019s it for existing protections.\n\nPhoto credit: Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court may have ruled this year that employers can't discriminate against pregnant workers, but we still have a long way to go in empowering U.S.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3163/3162498.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "worker\\'s rights,gig economy,worker\\'s rights legislation,minimum wage,fight for 15,equality act,discrimination,paycheck fairness act,gender equality,lgbtq rights,sick leave,maternity leave", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The United States is the only rich country in the world that doesn\u2019t guarantee workers paid sick leave.\nHere are a few pieces of workers\u2019 rights legislation we\u2019d like to see for 2016.\nGuarantee paid sick leave.\nThe U.S. is also one of the few well-off countries that doesn\u2019t guarantee paid maternity leave.\nThe Supreme Court may have ruled this year that employers can\u2019t discriminate against pregnant workers, but we still have a long way to go in empowering U.S. workers."}
