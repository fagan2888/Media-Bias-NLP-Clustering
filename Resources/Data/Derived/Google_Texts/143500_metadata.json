Investors in China\u2019s Hanergy Thin Film Power Group have outdone Tesla fans in their exuberance\u2014and for more dubious reasons.\n\nThe Chinese solar-panel equipment maker\u2019s Hong Kong shares have jumped 61% since Monday. With that, Hanergy has overtaken Tesla\u2019s market capitalization, closing Thursday at $39 billion. That makes Hanergy the world\u2019s most valuable clean energy-related company, not to mention bigger than 32 of the 50 companies in Hong Kong\u2019s benchmark Hang Seng index.\n\nThe company said it didn\u2019t know why the stock got supercharged this week, though it noted a couple of minor factors. Perhaps short sellers are exiting; they\u2019d already been squeezed with the stock up 65% in 2015 before this week.\n\nWhoever is buying the stock perhaps isn\u2019t concerned that the company\u2019s biggest customer is its unlisted parent, which hasn\u2019t always paid Hanergy and whose own business is opaque. Or that in the first half of 2014 Hanergy delivered net-profit margins six times its closest peer\u2019s, despite an overall glut rendering solar panels a commodity.\n\nThese questions cut to the core of Hanergy\u2019s business. At least with Tesla, investors can plainly see the Model S cars on the streets.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Investors in China's Hanergy are hitting new heights for exuberance", "title": "Hanergy Leaves Tesla in the Shade", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/03/05/hanergy-leaves-tesla-in-the-shade/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Hanergy Leaves Tesla in the Shade", "description": "Investors in China's Hanergy are hitting new heights for exuberance", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Abheek Bhattacharya", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Investors in China's Hanergy are hitting new heights for exuberance", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-03-05T10:51:48-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/03/05/hanergy-leaves-tesla-in-the-shade/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-34001", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Investors in China's Hanergy are hitting new heights for exuberance", "title": "Hanergy Leaves Tesla in the Shade", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/03/05/hanergy-leaves-tesla-in-the-shade/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-34001", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-05T16:05:07-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd60f9\"", "article_summary": "At least with Tesla, investors can plainly see the Model S cars on the streets.\nInvestors in China\u2019s Hanergy Thin Film Power Group have outdone Tesla fans in their exuberance\u2014and for more dubious reasons.\nThat makes Hanergy the world\u2019s most valuable clean energy-related company, not to mention bigger than 32 of the 50 companies in Hong Kong\u2019s benchmark Hang Seng index.\nWith that, Hanergy has overtaken Tesla\u2019s market capitalization, closing Thursday at $39 billion.\nThe company said it didn\u2019t know why the stock got supercharged this week, though it noted a couple of minor factors."}
