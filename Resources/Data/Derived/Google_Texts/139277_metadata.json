Which left a lot of people, including us, wondering: Just what did Alito mean by a \u201cclosely held\u201d corporation, and how many such businesses (and their employees) might be affected by his ruling?\n\nIn general, a closely held corporation is one with only a limited number of shareholders. By definition, they are private companies, meaning their shares don\u2019t trade publicly. Alito didn\u2019t specify how many shareholders a company could have in order to assert a RFRA claim, noting only that Hobby Lobby and the other companies in the case were \u201cowned and controlled by members of a single family.\u201d Different government agencies, though, have their own rules regarding corporations with relatively few shareholders.\n\nThe IRS has the clearest definition: For corporate tax purposes, a closely held corporation is one where more than half of the stock is owned (directly or indirectly) by five or fewer individuals at any time in the second half of the year. (It also can\u2019t be a \u201cpersonal service corporation,\u201d such as a law firm or engineering firm owned by its employees.) The IRS says it doesn\u2019t track how many such closely held corporations there are.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another category of corporations that could be considered closely held: \u201cS corporations,\u201d which cannot have more than 100 shareholders (although all members of the same family are treated as a single shareholder). Oklahoma City-based Hobby Lobby is organized as an S corporation. Unlike regular corporations, S corporations don\u2019t pay income tax themselves. Instead, their profits and losses are passed through to their shareholders, who then report them on their own personal tax returns. According to the IRS, in 2011 there were 4,158,572 S corporations; 99.4% had 10 or fewer shareholders.\n\nHow many people work for such corporations? The Census Bureau estimates that in 2012 about 2.9 million S corporations employed more than 29 million people (many corporations don\u2019t have employees), though its figures aren\u2019t broken down by number of shareholders.\n\nWhile all closely held corporations are private, not all private companies are closely held. And while many closely held corporations are small, some are quite large. Family-owned Cargill, for example, employs 140,000 people and had $136.7 billion in revenue in fiscal 2013. Forbes magazine lists 224 private companies (not all of which would be considered closely held) with annual revenues in excess of $2 billion. Hobby Lobby ranks 135th on Forbes\u2019 list, with estimated revenues of $3.3 billion and an estimated 23,000 employees.\n\nAnother distinction is drawn by U.S. securities law, which generally requires companies with at least 2,000 shareholders (or 500 \u201cunaccredited\u201d shareholders, meaning members of the general public) to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. While the Census Bureau estimates there are nearly 6 million corporations and partnerships with employees, an SEC spokeswoman told us that approximately 9,000 companies are registered with the agency.\n\nSome legal observers have noted that, despite Alito\u2019s emphasis on the \u201cclosely held\u201d nature of Hobby Lobby and the other companies that challenged the contraceptive mandate, nothing in the language or logic of his opinion would prevent corporations with more diffuse ownership from claiming exemptions under RFRA from other types of federal mandates, though others say making such claims stick would prove difficult.\n\nTopics: Religion and Government", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court's long-awaited decision in the Hobby Lobby case says \"closely held\" corporations can have religious rights that need to be respected.
