This is the only time during the year when you can make changes to your benefits without a \u201cqualifying event\u201d (also known as a change in status). Benefit elections made during this enrollment period are effective Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nIf you plan to participate in the Health Care or Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and/or the Health Savings Account (HSA) in 2016, you must complete the online enrollment process to confirm your 2016 election(s). All other benefits require re-enrollment only if you wish to change your current enrollment selections.\n\nYou must complete the annual enrollment process to:\n\nNewly elect, change or drop medical, dental and/or vision coverage;\n\nAdd or drop family members from your coverage;\n\nContinue or add a Health Care and/or Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account election;\n\nContinue or elect a Health Savings Account for the first time if enrolling in the $2,600/$5,200 Deductible Plan-HDHP;\n\nEnroll in or cancel your MetLaw legal benefit;\n\nChange the taxable status of your Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefit; or\n\nAdd or change your Voluntary Life Insurance/AD&D coverage amount.\n\nAnnual enrollment materials will be available Nov. 13 and will provide detailed information on the 2016 benefits as well as include instructions to complete the annual enrollment process. A number of benefits information sessions will be offered to employees on both campuses, as described under \u201cBenefits information sessions.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s changing for 2016?\n\nThere will be no changes to the medical plan design or coverage levels.\n\nThe dental plan will move from Delta\u2019s standard plan to its enhanced plan. Changes includes additional covered services and less employee out-of-pocket expense for certain services, such as posterior white fillings. The university will pay all additional costs associated with the dental plan design change.\n\nThe vision plan will move to EyeMed\u2019s Access network, its most extensive network available.\n\nBenefits costs\n\nThe university expects total medical costs to increase approximately 5 percent in 2016. The university will cover 72 percent of 2016 budgeted medical costs. Employee medical premiums will increase 2.5 percent in the aggregate, and will vary based on the relative risk and benefits associated with the medical plan option elected.

The purpose of this report is to show the IRS that employees and their dependents have qualified health coverage so they won\u2019t be subject to the ACA\u2019s individual mandate tax penalty. We will be collecting this information as part of the annual enrollment process. Please note the university holds your personal information, including Social Security numbers, in the highest confidence and only shares it as mandated by law.\n\nBenefits information sessions\n\nA number of annual enrollment information sessions have been scheduled to help you learn about your benefits options and answer questions about them.
