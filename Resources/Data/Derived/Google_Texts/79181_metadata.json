Talk show host Steve Deace was emcee. The event was well attended, with some 900 people at the event.\n\nDeace noted that the Iowa Caucuses were just 13 months away, and spoke of the importance of this particular election. He said that he had lunch with Ben Carson and his wife earlier in the day, and said that Carson was \u201cthe real deal\u201d, but warned the crowd not to \u201clet him (Carson) off the hook\u201d. Deace said that Iowans needed to vet Carson as well as the other candidates, and be sure to \u201cget it right.\u201d\n\nChuck Hurley, Vice-President of The Family leader, presented the \u201cFamily Champion Award\u201d to Dwayne Alons. Alons was unable to attend the event due to health reasons, and the award was accepted on his behalf by family members. Alons responded to being given the award via pre-recorded video.\n\nBob Vander Plaats, President and CEO of The Family Leader, addressed the crowd, and spoke about immigration, reducing the debt, the life issue, and repealing both Obamacare and Common Core. He also observed that \u201creligious liberty is the cornerstone of all our rights.\u201d Speaking of Ben Carson he said \u201cWhether Dr. Carson runs for President or not, his involvement would be good for this race\u2026I myself hope he does run.\u201d\n\nCarson spoke to the crowd for about an hour. He was easy going and soft spoken. He spoke without notes, telling his personal story while blasting liberals and all things politically correct. He said it was \u201cun-American\u201d to tell us what we allowed say.\n\nHis story is a compelling one, in which he was raised in poverty by a hard working single mother in Detroit. His mother refused to make excuses and wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cvictim\u201d. She accepted no excuses from her children either. He eventually went on to a stellar career as a pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, becoming the youngest major division director in Johns Hopkins history at he age of 33, as director of pediatric neurosurgery.\n\nHe talked about the value of one\u2019s health, stating that was why he opposed Obamacare. You should be in charge of your health rather than a government bureaucrat, and if the government controls healthcare it \u201cwon\u2019t be long before they control everything.\u201d He spoke of race in relation to liberalism: \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to call a black person who is against the progressive agenda, pro-life and pro-traditional marriage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe emphasized the need for education and its importance to success in life. He also maintained that it was vital to the future of the nation because without education, the populace could be manipulated by \u201ca slick politician and a dishonest media.\u201d\n\nCarson asserted that America really was \u201can exceptional nation.\u201d He quoted Alexis de Tocqueville: \u201cAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.\u201d\n\nHe spoke of the love of God and the need to show love and compassion, and said we must solve the manifold problems that we have as a nation.\n\nOn immigration he said we need to \u201creverse the polarity of the magnet\u201d that draws immigrants here illegally. We have secure the border.\n\nHe called our national debt \u201cunsustainable\u201d and said it could destroy America, charging the voters to \u201cthrow out of office\u201d any politician that votes to increase the debt.\n\nCarson affirmed that people go into business to make money, not to support the government. He said we need to reduce corporate tax rates, and reduce unnecessary regulations, suggesting that we would see job creation and increased prosperity. If we take away impediments to our economic engine we would see people working hard to prosper. \u201cMaking people dependent is not compassion, it the cruelest thing you can do to them,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said we were in the process of throwing away everything that made us great for the sake of political correctness. \u201cEven though President Obama said we are not a Judeo-Christian nation, we are a Judeo-Christian nation,\u201d he said, and the crowd roundly applauded him.\n\nHe continued by stating that we need to stop people from bullying us. \u201cGovernment is supposed to conform to the will of the people, not the people to be confirmed to the will of the government.\u201d\n\nCarson wrapped up his remarks by bringing up sacrifice. \u201cFreedom is not free,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to work for it every day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/11/ben-carson-introduces-himself-to-iowa-conservatives/", "article_author_name": "Brian Myers", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bob-vander-plaats-ben-carson.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2014-11-24T22:34:22+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "2016 elections, ben carson, bob vander plaats, chuck hurley, steve deace, the family leader, iowa news & politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Dr. Ben Carson, a presumptive 2016 Republican presidential candidate, gave an introductory speech at The FAMiLY Leader Celebrate the Family Fall fundraiser.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson, a presumptive 2016 Republican presidential candidate, gave an introductory speech at The FAMiLY Leader Celebrate the Family Fall fundraiser.", "title": "Ben Carson Introduces Himself to Iowa Conservatives | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bob-vander-plaats-ben-carson.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-24T16:42:01-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/11/ben-carson-introduces-himself-to-iowa-conservatives/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Ben Carson, a presumptive 2016 Republican presidential candidate, gave an introductory speech at The FAMiLY Leader Celebrate the Family Fall fundraiser.", "creator": "@CaffThoughts", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bob-vander-plaats-ben-carson.jpg", "title": "Ben Carson Introduces Himself to Iowa Conservatives | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2014-11-24T16:34:22-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/brian.myers.50", "section": "Iowa News & Politics", "modified_time": "2014-11-24T16:42:01-05:00", "tag": "the Family Leader"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "(Des Moines, IA) On Saturday November 22nd, The Family Leader held it\u2019s Celebrate the Family event with Dr. Ben Carson.\nHe said that he had lunch with Ben Carson and his wife earlier in the day, and said that Carson was \u201cthe real deal\u201d, but warned the crowd not to \u201clet him (Carson) off the hook\u201d.\nDeace noted that the Iowa Caucuses were just 13 months away, and spoke of the importance of this particular election.\nDeace said that Iowans needed to vet Carson as well as the other candidates, and be sure to \u201cget it right.\u201dChuck Hurley, Vice-President of The Family leader, presented the \u201cFamily Champion Award\u201d to Dwayne Alons.\nAlons was unable to attend the event due to health reasons, and the award was accepted on his behalf by family members."}
