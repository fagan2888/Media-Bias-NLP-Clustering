Rapid City, SD

A bible ranch north of Rapid City has lost dozens of horses in an early autumn blizzard that buried western South Dakota in snow two weeks ago.



The Reinhold family lost 90 horses, 25 of which were the cornerstone of the herd used for children to ride during summer camps.



The Reinholds operate the Rainbow Bible Ranch and the Lonetree Ranch.



Owner Larry Reinhold says the family heeded the warnings about the approaching blizzard and moved the horses to the breaks, where they normally would have been safe.



The family says donations have been coming in to help replace the herd.
