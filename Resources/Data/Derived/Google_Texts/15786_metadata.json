While there, the patient repeatedly expressed \u2014 in writing and in discussions with the Trinity staff \u2014 a desire to commit suicide, telling one nurse, \u201cI took an overdose (of medication) two days ago, but it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThe patient was discharged with no psychological evaluation and no consultation with the mental health unit. A few hours later, the patient was seen in the hospital parking lot, steering his or her wheelchair into traffic in an apparent attempt to be hit by a car. The patient told one staffer of plans to commit suicide later that same night by slitting his or her throat with a scalpel. The patient\u2019s roommate then came to the hospital and told the staff that several days earlier the patient had attempted suicide by overdosing on pain medication, according to records.\n\nEight weeks ago, the Office of Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service agreed to settle allegations that Trinity\u2019s handling of the case violated the patient-dumping provisions of the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The law requires hospitals to stabilize patients who have an emergency medical condition before attempting to discharge or transfer them elsewhere.\n\nThe settlement agreement with Trinity, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, requires the hospital to pay $40,000 to the federal government.\n\nErin Platt, spokeswoman for Trinity Medical Center, said the hospital takes its EMTALA obligations seriously, and in this case chose to pay the $40,000 rather than \u201cdraw the case out via a lengthy administrative review process.\u201d She said Trinity has changed its policies to ensure that before behavioral-health patients in the emergency room are discharged, they will either see a physician or have their case reviewed by a physician. Also, chart audits are now being conducted \u201cto ensure that behavioral-health patients are being assessed for suicide risk\u201d and other issues, Platt said.\n\nIn April, Dr. Gregory Bohn agreed to pay $35,000 to the federal government to resolve allegations that he personally violated the patient-dumping law on Feb. 12, 2010, while working as the on-call surgeon at Trinity Medical Center of Bettendorf.\n\nThe inspector general alleged that Bohn refused to examine or treat a patient who had an emergency medical condition that required surgery.\n\nThe Iowa Board of Medicine, which regulates physicians in the state, has not taken any disciplinary action against Bohn.\n\nBohn could not be reached for comment. The outgoing message on his office telephone indicates he has \u201cclosed his practice and left the area.\u201d\n\nTrinity Medical Center of Bettendorf is part of UnityPoint Health, Iowa\u2019s largest integrated health system. UnityPoint affiliates employ 24,000 people and together they log more than 4 million patient visits each year. UnityPoint collects $2.7 billion in annual revenue, and is the nation\u2019s 15th largest nonprofit health system.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1omw8wd", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Bettendorf\u2019s Trinity Medical Center to pay $40,000 federal fine, Register exclusive story reveals", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Bettendorf\u2019s Trinity Medical Center to pay $40,000 federal fine, Register exclusive story reveals", "title": "Bettendorf hospital fined for \u2018patient dumping\u2019", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/2014/08/10/bettendorf-hospital-dumped-patients-federal-fine/13818685/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bettendorf\u2019s Trinity Medical Center to pay $40,000 federal fine, Register exclusive story reveals", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a032733674bb3242890ce22812214f6584dfa43c/c=300-0-1140-840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/09/iowa-news.jpg", "title": "Bettendorf hospital fined for \u2018patient dumping\u2019", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/investigations", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e26cfb82badd8e84cd9db68bc780c54591f1861e/c=405-0-1035-840/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/09/iowa-news.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dac7d256a59f84940e502b66fdba9c9126e1eda5/c=300-0-1140-840/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/09/iowa-news.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ea01a6a00dbd2496de65f37025887b7eaa790f77/c=160-0-1280-840/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/09/iowa-news.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bd64435675ed77d92ee7226039c86a4975acbcd1/c=0-15-1440-825&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/09/iowa-news.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-09T23:19:41.580000-05:00", "shorthed": "Hospital fined for \u2018patient dumping\u2019", "articleid": 13818685, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf590beeec04e793cbf8e7ec6bbd1a1289afc9ba/c=0-15-1440-825/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/09/iowa-news.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a7e9250d0c4461d31b889d1561416dbe34fc853/c=484-0-956-840/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/09/iowa-news.jpg"}, "author": "Clark Kauffman", "title": "Bettendorf hospital fined for \u2018patient dumping\u2019", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca282\"", "article_summary": "An Iowa hospital has agreed to pay $40,000 to the federal government in response to allegations that it engaged in \u201cpatient dumping\u201d by failing to provide adequate emergency care for a suicidal patient.\nThe inspector general alleged that Bohn refused to examine or treat a patient who had an emergency medical condition that required surgery.\nThe law requires hospitals to stabilize patients who have an emergency medical condition before attempting to discharge or transfer them elsewhere.\nThe settlement agreement with Trinity, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, requires the hospital to pay $40,000 to the federal government.\nThe patient\u2019s roommate then came to the hospital and told the staff that several days earlier the patient had attempted suicide by overdosing on pain medication, according to records."}
