Luis Gutierrez wants to extend the Affordable Care Act to 11 million illegal aliens. It\u2019s nothing but a taxpayer-financed rescue for the increasingly unsustainable program.\n\nThe Illinois Democrat is known as a left-wing extremist who\u2019d do anything to succor illegal aliens. So the \u201cExchange Inclusion for a Healthy America Act of 2015\u201d that he introduced Wednesday to extend ObamaCare to 11 million illegal immigrants will be dismissed as a nonstarter.\n\nAfter all, when asked in 2012 whether illegals would have access to the new health care system that he was selling, the president explicitly promised, \u201cThose individuals will not be covered.\u201d Nor should they.\n\nLast month, however, the Department of Health and Human Services warned that as of June, only 9.9 million Americans had purchased ObamaCare insurance through the state and federal exchanges, leaving a shortfall of 11 million in the collective insurance pool.\n\nThat shortfall raises questions about the entire program\u2019s sustainability, given that citizens are shunning the detested system that has limited choices, drained pocketbooks and lowered the quality of health care for the people who actually pay for it.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, which had projected 21 million sign-ups for 2016, not only got less than half of that but also learned from several states that enrollments were dropping by hundreds of thousands.\n\nWith fewer people in the pool and more older and sicker enrollees in need of care at any cost, either the premiums go up for all, or the insurance pool goes bankrupt.\n\nWhat a coincidence, then, that the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. comes to \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 11 million, according to the most conservative estimates.\n\nGutierrez\u2019s idea is to take those 11 million and have them buy the insurance that Americans won\u2019t buy. Their insurance, he says, would be subsidized by taxpayers \u201cif they qualify.\u201d With most illegals in low-wage, low-skill jobs, you can bet they qualify \u2014 in spades.\n\nSo it seems that illegals are just doing the ObamaCare-buying that Americans won\u2019t do. A scheme like this may keep ObamaCare afloat, but it will be a budget buster and damage the economy.\n\nIt will also serve as a magnet for more illegal immigrants, which of course is Gutierrez\u2019s main idea. Subsidies for the indigent are a Democratic bailiwick, and from the indigent they expect to reap votes. Everyone wins \u2014 except taxpayers who will pay for this bailout.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Care: In the wake of last week's papal visit, Rep.
