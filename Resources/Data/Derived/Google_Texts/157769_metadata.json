The cost of the Affordable Care Act is expected to climb this year as a result of more people enrolling in Medicaid but the overall cost of the program is still less than scorekeepers estimated in the early days of the legislation. A new report released Thursday by the Congressional Budget Office found that the total cost of health programs is rising but more people are getting covered. Power Post has more:\n\nAround 22 million people under the age of 65 in 2016 are expected to enroll in health care coverage provided by President Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy accomplishment, driving up the cost of law to the federal government by $110 billion in 2016, according to new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. The budget office attributed the vast majority of the expected cost increase to greater-than-expected Medicaid enrollment numbers. Overall, CBO projected, the cost to the government of those enrolled in Medicaid and in the marketplaces created under the law will be $1.4 trillion over 10 years, which is $136 billion more than the scorekeeper previously expected.\n\nFAST FACTS ON THE IRS.

So far this year, the IRS has received more than 80 million individual tax returns.\n\nEMILY\u2019S LIST SPENDING AGAINST VAN HOLLEN. The Democratic primary race to replace retiring Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) is heating up, and progressive Rep. Chris Van Hollen has become an unlikely target for attacks from the liberal Emily\u2019s list PAC. Van Hollen is running against fellow Maryland Rep. Donna Edwards, and Emily\u2019s list is sticking to its goal of electing women, no matter who they\u2019re running against.
