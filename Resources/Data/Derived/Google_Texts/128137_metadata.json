This year, music director Michael Butterman will present a program titled \"Legendary Love\" to fit with his \"Season of Legends\"campaign.\n\nIn this case, those legends are musical depictions of literature's most notoriously tragic couples. The \"Prelude and Liebestod,\" an orchestral excerpt frequently drawn from Richard Wagner's harmonically groundbreaking opera \"Tristan and Isolde,\" will be paired with Tchaikovsky's \"Romeo and Juliet\" Fantasy-Overture on the program's second half.\n\nOn the first half, the Phil is joined by Grammy-nominated virtuoso violinist Philippe Quint, who plays the \"Red Violin Concerto\" by American composer John Corigliano, a work whose origins lie in Corigliano's Oscar-winning score to the 1998 film of the same name.\n\nRegarding the Valentine's Day concert, Butterman said that it simply fits the rhythms of the orchestra's schedule.\n\n\"One of the dates we usually get Macky Auditorium is that weekend in February, so we embrace it,\" he said. \"There is more than enough great music with romantic content or in a romantic style.\"\n\nButterman originally intended for Quint to play Leonard Bernstein's \"Serenade,\" a piece built around the idea of love, but when the Colorado Music Festival programmed that piece last summer, Butterman settled on the Corigliano, which Quint has made a signature concerto.\n\n\"I knew I didn't want to do one of the big romantic-era concertos,\" Butterman said, \"and I knew that this was a piece that would fit the program.\"\n\nQuint played the concerto with the Colorado Springs Philharmonic on that group's opening concert this season.\n\nSpeaking with the Camera about the work, Quint said that it was going to become \"the next warhorse violin concerto,\" noting that more and more performers are learning, performing and recording it.\n\nThe violinist outlined the concerto's unique origins in the film score and added a personal note.\n\n\"During my school days at Juilliard, Corigliano showed up at my music history class to give a lecture,\" Quint said. \"At the time, he had written very little for the violin. In the Q&A, I was bold enough to ask why he hadn't written a violin concerto. He replied that there were plenty of concertos for the instrument, and he wanted to contribute to the repertoire of other instruments.\n\n\"Of course, once he was approached to write the score for the film and the great Joshua Bell was engaged to play in that score, things changed rapidly,\" Quint continued. \"Nobody expected that the movie would be such a success, and it created an explosion in the music world. Any film that relates to classical music and becomes a success is big news.\"\n\nAfter he won the Oscar, Corigliano was persuaded to use the film score as a launch point for a full concerto, so he employed the \"Chaconne,\" a theme heard throughout the movie, as the first movement. The newly composed second, third and fourth movements also refer to themes from the movie. He finished it in 2002.\n\n\"Because of this movie, the world has a violin concerto from one of the greatest living American composers,\" Quint said.\n\nBell, of course, did all the major premieres before other violinists picked it up, but Quint has an intimate connection to the \"Red Violin\" music. He was the first to record Corigliano's Caprices for solo violin, which also come from the score. About the composer's approach to the violin in the concerto, Quint said that \"John stretches the instrument to the next level. The soloist, conductor and orchestra can't lose focus for one second.\"\n\nQuint said the piece obviously fit with the \"love\" theme of the concert.\n\n\"Violinists have a true relationship of love with their instruments,\" he said, \"and that is shown in both the film and the concerto. It's not the first time I've played it on Valentine's Day.\"\n\nIn the \"Prelude and Liebestod,\" the opera's opening and closing music is brought together in a concert piece. The \"Liebestod\" (literally, \"love-death\"), originally a soprano solo, is performed either with or without a singer in concert.\n\n\"One piece flows into the other, as if he intended it to work that way,\" Butterman said. \"The harmonic tension is never resolved until the end, reflecting the intense progression of the relationship.\"\n\nThe familiar Tchaikovsky composition is a natural concert closer. While its love theme is universally recognized, the overture also includes dramatic, aggressive music that reflects the feud between the families.\n\nLike the Wagner, Butterman said, the piece is structured around the building of romantic tension.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_27475188/philippe-quint-boulder-philharmonic-orchestra-valentines-music", "sailthru.author": "By Kelly Dean Hansen \n \n  Camera Classical Music Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27475188:view"}, "startDate": "2015-02-08T17:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Philippe Quint will play the \"Red Violin Concerto\" from the 1998 film \"The Red Violin.\"", "title": "Violin virtuoso, Boulder Philharmonic to fill Macky with romance", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_27475188/philippe-quint-boulder-philharmonic-orchestra-valentines-music", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0206/20150206__08DCPCLAw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Entertainment", "modificationDate": "2015-02-06T13:05:26-0700", "endDate": "2025-02-06T12:57:39-0700", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Entertainment news, Boulder Colorado Entertainment news, Boulder Colorado news, Entertainment Boulder news, Entertainment Colorado news, US Entertainment news, world Entertainment news.", "byline": "By Kelly Dean", "pubDate": "2015-02-06T13:06:31-0700", "sailthru.date": "2015-02-08T17:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Violin virtuoso, Boulder Philharmonic to fill Macky with romance", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0206/20150206__08DCPCLAw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Philippe Quint will play the \"Red Violin Concerto\" from the 1998 film \"The Red Violin.\"", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_27475188/philippe-quint-boulder-philharmonic-orchestra-valentines-music", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Philippe Quint will play the \"Red Violin Concerto\" from the 1998 film \"The Red Violin.\"", "title": "Violin virtuoso, Boulder Philharmonic to fill Macky with romance"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0206/20150206__08DCPCLAw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Grammy-nominated violinist Philippe Quint will play the \"Red Violin Concerto\" with the Boulder Philharmonic on Saturday.\nIn the Q&A, I was bold enough to ask why he hadn't written a violin concerto.\n\"Because of this movie, the world has a violin concerto from one of the greatest living American composers,\" Quint said.\nAbout the composer's approach to the violin in the concerto, Quint said that \"John stretches the instrument to the next level.\nBell, of course, did all the major premieres before other violinists picked it up, but Quint has an intimate connection to the \"Red Violin\" music."}
