"Shared-decision making promotes strong dialogue between healthcare providers and healthcare consumers and builds stronger value-based care outcomes.\n\nAt its core, shared-decision making gives beneficiaries more choice about their care and treatment options, thus advancing patient-centered results.\n\nIt also gives healthcare consumers more responsibility.\n\nBut with increased responsibility comes the choice to act \u2013 or not act \u2013 towards achieving desired value-based care outcomes.\n\n\"[Individuals] continue to have more responsibility for both the larger percentage and larger absolute value of their healthcare dollar,\u201d David Josephs, Senior Vice President, Healthcare Solutions First Data Corporation, told RevCycleIntelligence.com.\n\n\"[We're] going to see payers continue to try to help doctors and hospitals and providers address the challenges associated with increased patient responsibility,\" he added.\n\nConsumers engaged in open dialogue are more likely to take needed medications as directed, receive crucial screenings and immunizations, embrace an active lifestyle, and just take better care of themselves in general, reported the Brookings Institution.\n\nBut even the best communication efforts can fall apart.\n\nProblems arise when a person\u2019s health deteriorates because at least one party failed to truly listen.\n\nChallenges exist from many interpersonal angles\n\nHealthcare executives are apparently struggling to accommodate the patient as healthcare consumer, patient, and payer \u2013 especially within a value-based care environment.\n\nAccording to research from the American Association for Physician Leadership and the Healthcare Financial Management Association, chief medical officers (CMOs) and chief financial officers (CFOs) reported \u201ca lack of benefit plans designed to engage patients in their care and encourage shared decision-making\u201d as a top concern.\n\nCMOs and CFOs additionally noted patient accountability and responsibility efforts were lagging.\n\nAnd they expressed overarching concern that lack of communication was to blame for making patients less responsible for their health outcomes.\n\nWithin a consumer-driven payment landscape, hospitals are nonetheless struggling to stay afloat.\n\n\u201cHospitals have capital and human financial tied up in all kinds of software and regulatory initiatives,\u201d said Ruby Raley, Associate Vice President of Product Strategy at Edifecs, to RevCycleIntelligence.com.\n\n\u201cThey have the rising cost of pharmaceuticals eroding margins,\" she added. \"They have the rise of consumerism.\"\n\nBut higher consumerism levels may be helping propel the healthcare industry toward greater value-based advancement.\n\n\u201cAll of the new consumers joining the exchange are great for hospitals,\u201d Raley stated. \u201cIt's really going to help many of them stay solvent and continue forward.\u201d\n\nAs healthcare consumers continue to receive care under this widespread consumer-driven dynamic, they are increasingly struggling to pay their medical bills, especially as high deductibles only grow higher.\n\n\u201cHealthcare faces opportunity for improvement, particularly in the areas of performance outcomes and patient satisfaction,\u201d confirmed the American Hospital Association\u2019s Physician Leadership Forum.\n\n\u201cThere are pockets of excellence and care models employed in the U.S. to be learned from.\u201d\n\nThree steps to promoting shared-decision making\n\nHoning in on these pockets of excellence demands new strategies and focus.\n\nThere are three primary facets of shared-decision making that can be readily and openly adapted across the healthcare industry, according to Health Affairs.\n\n\u201cFirst, both the health care provider and the patient must recognize and acknowledge that a decision is, in fact, required,\u201d the authors stated.\n\n\u201cSecond, they must both know and understand the best available evidence concerning the risks and benefits of each option,\u201d they recommended.\n\n\u201cThird, decisions must take into account both the provider\u2019s guidance and the patient\u2019s values and preferences.\u201d\n\nThe authors advised involving other parties \u2013 well beyond physicians, nurses, dieticians, and pharmacists \u2013 in the greater shared decision making process.\n\n\u201c[Adopting] an approach that involves all team members in the shared decision-making process can further efforts to improve care coordination and reduce fragmentation by helping break down the silos that divide various health professions,\u201d they added.\n\nShared-decision making improves patient outcomes\n\nThis kind of strengthened partnership may keep the shared-decision making ball rolling, especially given healthcare\u2019s design.\n\nMany different health insurance plans \u201chave quality incentives or quality improvement programs that might be unique in some aspects but shared in other aspects,\u201d Jennifer Chambers, Capital BlueCross Senior Vice President and CMO, told RevCycleIntelligence.com.\n\n\u201cThis type of collaborative raises the tides for all patients, and it also provides for that shared goal setting with all of the hospitals,\u201d she added.\n\nThe overall shared-decision making process is particularly beneficial in the strengthening of palliative care initiatives across multiple settings, confirmed the Pew Charitable Trusts (Pew).\n\n\u201cProactive [care] means not wondering why patients are non-compliant or non-adherent, but rather what is it about the care system that is not enabling them to take full advantage of it,\u201d said Pew.\n\nBut as anyone with a fear of needles, blood, and beyond knows all too well, going to see a doctor is often a scary, anxiety-producing ordeal.\n\nPatients may not be willing to openly communicate because they are just too intimidated to do so, said Chambers.\n\nFurther complicating matters is the fact that many patients are simply opting to stay out of the doctor\u2019s office entirely as healthcare costs soar.\n\n\u201cThe cost of health care has long been a concern in the U.S., on both a national and a personal level,\u201d confirmed researchers with the Kaiser Family Foundation and The New York Times.\n\n\u201cFor individuals, this concern plays out most prominently among those who face difficulty paying medical bills or who are unable to pay such bills at all,\u201d they stated.\n\n\u201c[Even] a bill of $500 or less can present a major problem for someone who is living paycheck to paycheck.\u201d\n\nLimitations of a patient-centered approach demand addressing\n\nShared-decision making may help close these and many other gaps. For one thing, patient education is imperative.\n\nInteractive patient decision aids \u2013 such as books, videos, and websites \u2013 may help patients make more intelligent, educated decisions during a physician consultation, Health Affairs reported.\n\nBut handing a patient a series of leaflets or referencing a series of website links to later peruse is far from a viable solution.\n\nThe art of how to communicate must not be overlooked.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for medical decision makers and decision aid developers is to address the difficult question of whether, under what circumstances, and how patients should be nudged toward one option or another,\u201d the report\u2019s authors explained.\n\nThe most successful healthcare executives recognize the importance of a well-educated staff to help achieve this goal. Nonetheless, gaps need filling, and quickly so.\n\n\u201c[CFOs and CEOs] don\u2019t listen to patients,\u201d said Ginalisa Monterroso, CEO of Medicaid Advisory Group, to RevCycleIntelligence.com.\n\n\u201cThere's just so much going on internally financially where they lose the person they need to focus on.\u201d\n\nLack of staff training remains a top concern for healthcare providers, added Monterroso.\n\nMatters of housekeeping on behalf of a billing staff may mean value-based care takes a back seat at times of critical patient need.\n\nWhen patients walk in the door, they naturally have good questions about whether or not their health insurance is accepted, if their care delivery will be performed in-network, and what their copay amounts to.\n\nBut providers often struggle to deliver succinct, linear answers.\n\nEven well prepared patients may have gathered information from a provider directory through the health insurance marketplace that is not correct.\n\nEven though information is available online, it is perhaps updated too infrequently to keep up with live changes.\n\n\u201cEverybody's walking in with the wrong insurance. Everybody's walking in with the wrong drug coverage. What the executives are missing internally is that education component,\u201d added Monterroso.\n\nHealth plans need to \u201cimprove their provider education processes to make sure network providers understand exactly which products they're participating in,\u201d Brian Hoyt, Managing Director at Berkeley Research Group, told RevCycleIntelligence.com.\n\nWhat impacts a health plan member most is physician participation with a particular health insurance product, he said.\n\n\u201cIf a member needs to see a doctor and they go to their health plan\u2019s provider directory and see a provider listed in the provider directory, there's a presumption that that particular provider is actually participating with that health insurance product,\u201d stated Hoyt.\n\n\u201cIf that turns out not to be the case, then that member could be hit with a bill for out of network charges.\u201d\n\nHoyt advised that health plans either consider consolidation of offerings or take action to improve their provider education process to make sure even the most confusing, disorienting information is more clearly understood all around.\n\nKeeping up with the evolving payment landscape\n\nThe assessment of accountable care organizations\u2019 (ACOs) quality metrics is yet another challenge when it comes to the future advancement of shared-decision making opportunities.\n\n\u201cWith a growing emphasis being placed on shared decision making, and patient engagement being measured as a critical component of ACOs\u2019 quality metrics, ACOs will need an information technology infrastructure that allows for providers to effectively and efficiently communicate with patients,\u201d reported the Journal of Managed Care Pharmacy.\n\nNot many ACOs are practicing care team integration, researchers said.\n\nA \"troubling finding,\" researchers confirmed, is there are not enough protocols in place to communicate and efficiently handle adverse events.\n\nConsequently, care quality may drop and value-based care outcomes may suffer accordingly.\n\n\u201cWithout medication adverse-event protocols or clinical pharmacist integration into care teams, ACOs may lack the ability to ensure appropriate medication use and safety,\u201d researchers claimed.\n\nThe role of the patient-centered medical home\n\nBut the creation of new ACOs alone is not enough to create actionable change.\n\nPatient-centered medical homes (PCMHs) are gaining traction as a means of keeping care quality high and costs low.\n\nLast year, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provided over $35 million in nationwide funding for nearly 150 PCMHs.\n\n\u201cWe need to change the way we pay for care delivery at the practice level,\u201d Marci Nielsen, PhD, MPH, CEO of the Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative (PCPCC), told HealthITAnalytics.com.\n\nThe PCMH model is effectively promoting more personalized coordinated care, she said.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things patient-centered medical homes often do is bring a care coordination professional on board, whether that person is a social worker or a medical assistant,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cThat care coordinator is helping patients find the right person at the right time for their care needs. That, too, leads to utilization changes that ultimately impact costs,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cEngaging with innovative payment models that reward the same activities the PCMH requires will help primary care providers make the most of both programs while ensuring that they are meeting the needs of patients requiring high quality, coordinated care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shared-decision making promotes strong dialogue between healthcare providers and healthcare consumers and builds stronger value-based care outcomes.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/shared-decision-making-advances-value-based-care-outcomes", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_6_6208632197.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Shared-Decision Making Advances Value-Based Care Outcomes"}, "twitter": {"description": "Shared-decision making promotes strong dialogue between healthcare providers and healthcare consumers and builds stronger value-based care outcomes.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_6_6208632197.jpg"}, "title": "Shared-Decision Making Advances Value-Based Care Outcomes", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Shared-decision making improves patient outcomesThis kind of strengthened partnership may keep the shared-decision making ball rolling, especially given healthcare\u2019s design.\nShared-decision making promotes strong dialogue between healthcare providers and healthcare consumers and builds stronger value-based care outcomes.\nAt its core, shared-decision making gives beneficiaries more choice about their care and treatment options, thus advancing patient-centered results.\nAnd they expressed overarching concern that lack of communication was to blame for making patients less responsible for their health outcomes.\nThe overall shared-decision making process is particularly beneficial in the strengthening of palliative care initiatives across multiple settings, confirmed the Pew Charitable Trusts (Pew)."}
