Considering its inability to police the existing tenancy regulations on rental housing, the city seems much too willing to turn over the oversight of an expanding co-op market to a coalition dedicated to the promotion of co-op housing. Furthermore, the Planning Board, at every turn, has shown its intent upon ignoring community concerns by easing the standards such units must meet regarding parking, the number of tenants/square foot, and the distribution of co-op units. And most certainly, particular neighborhoods should not be targeted. Co-ops must be allowed throughout the city, not just in ascribed "transitional" neighborhoods. By most definitions, "transitional" could be applied to the neighborhood west of Broadway and north of Dellwood where scrape-offs are so in vogue. The square footage there could go a long ways to easing Boulder's housing shortage. And shouldn't the university be doing more to meet the needs of its overflow population? Oh, right, the university is a business venture. Robert Porath Boulder
