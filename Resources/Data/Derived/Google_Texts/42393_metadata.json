It would also allow up to a year\u2019s worth of contraception to be provided at one time.\n\n\u201cNew Yorkers should not be penalized by their insurance companies for using the birth control method that they and their medical provider agree is most appropriate for them,\u201d Schneiderman said.\n\nThe legislation comes after Schneiderman\u2019s office last week sent letters to several insurers asking for information about their contraception policies.\n\nSchneiderman\u2019s office said the letters were in response to reports that women were being denied coverage and that some insurers were imposing improper co-pays.\n\nNew Yorkers should not be penalized by their insurance companies for using the birth control method that they and their medical provider agree is most appropriate.\n\nAmong the complaints were charges that insurers were using \u201cmedical management techniques,\u201d which are allowed under the Obamacare law, to restrict access to contraception, officials said.\n\nSchneiderman\u2019s proposed legislation would prohibit insurers from using medical management procedures to limit or delay contraception coverage.\n\nLeslie Moran of the New York Health Plan Association said insurers in New York already abide by the Obamacare provisions and have their plans approved by state regulators.\n\n\u201cThere is a shared goal of the state and the health plans to provide access to coverage, including contraception,\u201d Moran said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Glenn Blain", "twitter": {"description": "State Attorney General Eric
