Doug Ducey\u2019s desk.\n\nA portion of the legislation requires voter approval because it changes benefits for current employees. The Senate must act on the revisions Monday to meet a deadline for placement on the May 17 special election ballot.\n\nThe 10 Republicans who voted against the bills said they were concerned with the math used to measure the small savings in the proposal. They worried that it did little to actually fix the retirement system.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this really fixes anything,\u201d Rep. Eddie Farnsworth, R-Gilbert. \u201cI think it puts a Band-Aid on it for a period of time.\u201d\n\nFarnsworth also said the constitutional changes in the plan were poorly enacted.\n\nSenate President Andy Biggs said he believes the overhaul, while bringing modest savings in early years, sets the state police and fire pension plan on a path to stability. The state Constitution and contract law means the state can\u2019t lower promised pensions.\n\n\u201cThe thing to remember is the people who are under the contracts already, you can\u2019t change a contract that\u2019s already there,\u201d Biggs said. \u201cBut what you can do is lay a foundation for a stable and balanced fund going forward \u2014 and that\u2019s really what this bill does.\u201d\n\nThe House action, which came after a week of fears the overhaul would be delayed by fiscal conservatives in the House, means one of the legislative session\u2019s first major issues appears to have been resolved without major problems. The Senate passed the legislation last week unanimously, so it is expected to win quick passage again.\n\nPeoria Republican Sen. Debbie Lesko negotiated the deal with public safety unions and cities, towns and counties that have seen the costs of their pension contributions soar. She said she was pleased with the House vote.\n\n\u201cMy goal was always unanimous, but I\u2019m happy with 49-10,\u201d she said after the House voted.\n\nA major component of the plan changes how yearly cost-of-living increases for current employees and retirees are calculated and requires voter approval. Other major provisions include a new tier for newly hired police and firefighters that limits maximum pension payments and requires employers and employees to share equally in payments to retirement accounts. New hires also would be given a choice of opting for a 401(k)-style retirement plan rather than a plan with a guaranteed pension.\n\nCurrent employees pay about 11 percent of their pay into the retirement plan, but employer contributions aren\u2019t capped.\n\nThe system\u2019s current 49 percent funding status has led to massive increases in employer contributions, crimping budgets for cities and towns as their average retiree contributions near 50 percent of salary. Some contributions are higher.\n\nThe cities will continue to pay those high rates for about two decades, but gradually see them decrease as the current employees retire and new employees go into a cheaper system.\n\nThe Public Safety Personnel Retirement System plan has $6.2 billion in assets but $12.7 billion in liabilities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Arizona House has passed a proposal overhauling the state's badly underfunded public safety worker pension plan after adopting a pair of amendments.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Bob Christie, Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "Arizona Capitol Times", "description": "The Arizona House has passed a proposal overhauling the state's badly underfunded public safety worker pension plan after adopting a pair of amendments.", "title": "Arizona House passes police and fire pension overhaul", "url": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2016/02/11/arizona-house-passes-police-and-fire-pension-overhaul/", "image": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2016/02/pension-calculator-620.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Arizona House passes police and fire pension overhaul Arizona Capitol Times", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "pension reform, pension, public safety, police and fire, pension overhaul, legislature,legislature,pension,pension overhaul,police and fire,public safety", "google-site-verification": "yBUjZkZhQp3gSLHDjf3ORiAV2B17Yp4XZVxbpx8h4_M", "y_key": "7be161f96cdbc5bc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "New hires also would be given a choice of opting for a 401(k)-style retirement plan rather than a plan with a guaranteed pension.\nPeoria Republican Sen.
