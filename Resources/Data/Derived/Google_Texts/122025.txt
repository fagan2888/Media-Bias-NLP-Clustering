A 47-year-old man has been arrested on DUI and other charges, after an accident involving a box truck in Fresno.

The suspect is identified by Fresno Police as Michael Allen Childers of Fresno.

According to a statement by Fresno Police, officers were dispatched to a call of a reckless driver in a "Boost Mobile" truck swerving in and out of traffic. Other calls, according to police, state that the truck was involved in several crashes.

According to police, an officer on an unrelated call saw the truck careen through the intersection of San Jose and Brawley, and collide with a sedan. The truck, according to police, then continued north on Brawley from San Jose, and was then cut off by a Chevrolet truck, which pinned it against the curb.

According to Fresno Police, Childers allegedly crashed into the Chevrolet truck while at a store on Shaw Avenue. The Chevrolet truck, according to police, was chasing Childers.

In addition to the two accidents, Fresno police also said Childers allegedly crashed into another victim, at a grocery store. That victim, however, has not identified himself to police at this time.

Childers, according to Police, suffered moderate facial injuries, but no one else suffered injuries that required hospitalization.

According to Fresno police, officers found empty alcoholic beverage cans inside the cab of the Boost Mobile truck, and both alcoholic beverages contain very high alcohol content. In addition, police said Childers' Blood Alcohol Content was over three times the legal limit.

Fresno Police said it is quite possible that Childers struck other vehicles, and then departed the scene of those accidents. Anyone who had a collision with the truck are encouraged to call Fresno Police.
