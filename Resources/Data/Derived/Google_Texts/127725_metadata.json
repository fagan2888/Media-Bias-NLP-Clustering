Mr Cameron used his Christmas message to affirm that Britain is a Christian country, but liberals, many of whom are not themselves Christian, have accused him of failing to show sufficient Christian charity to the poor.\n\nYesterday the Prime Minister used his annual Christmas address to highlight the suffering of Syrian refugees and to praise the British armed forces fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBritain is a \u201cChristian country\u201d, he said, adding that Christmas was a time to \u201ccelebrate the birth of God\u2019s only son, Jesus Christ \u2014 the Prince of Peace.\n\n\u201cIt is because of these important religious roots and Christian values that Britain has been such a successful home to people of all faiths and none,\u201d he added.\n\nBut socialists and liberals jumped on his words as an excuse to attack conservatism.\n\nPensioners to be charged \u00a326 \u2018falling fee\u2019 to be helped back on their feet by Tory council #YouAintNoChristianBruv pic.twitter.com/Gmg3O2y3Ar \u2014 Tom Pride (@ThomasPride) December 24, 2015\n\n#Cameron When bible talks of \u2018false prophets\u2019 not sure it meant your chancellor\u2019s fancy fiscal footwork ;) #YouAintNoChristianBruv \u2014 Quinonostante (@Quinonostante) December 24, 2015\n\nCameron changes the whole nativity #YouAintNoChristianBruv pic.twitter.com/viSPoZD619 \u2014 JS2 (@___JS2) December 24, 2015\n\nThe hashtag parodies the #youaintnomuslimbruv, which went viral after a man shouted the phrase at a Muslim terrorist midway through a knife attack in an east London underground station. Mr Cameron later hailed the man, known only as John as he fears reprisals from Islamic State over his remark.\n\n\u201cSome of us have dedicated speeches and media appearances and soundbites and everything to this subject, but \u2018you ain\u2019t no Muslim, bruv\u2019 said it all much better than I could have done.\n\n\u201cThank you, because that will be applauded around the country,\u201d Mr Cameron said.\n\nJeremy Corbyn is more JC than you will ever be @David_Cameron.
