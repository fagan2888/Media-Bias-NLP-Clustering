Being able to return to normal action is just as important as surviving the actual procedure and not having any life-threatening complications, Dr. Daniel Anaya, the senior author of the study, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to identify what the high-volume hospitals are doing differently from other hospitals that lead to improved outcomes,\u201d lead author Dr. Courtney J. Balentine, from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told Reuters. \u201cOnce we figure out why some hospitals do better than others, we can help every hospital adopt the practices that really work so that all patients get the best outcomes no matter where they have the operation.\u201d\n\nThe researchers analyzed over 1,000 U.S. hospitals, grouping them into three tiers based on how many colon surgeries were performed at each in 2008. The highest-ranked hospitals were called \u201chigh-volume,\u201d considered the busiest. Colon surgery included procedures done for colon cancer as well as for polyps \u2014 growths in the colon \u2014 or blocked colons.\n\nOut of the 280,000 patients involved in the study, three quarters of them received colon surgery at high-volume hospitals; they were often younger, had higher incomes and were more likely to have private insurance compared to those who had surgery at low-volume hospitals. At busy hospitals, 86 percent of colon surgery patients were sent straight home after the procedure. This was a sign that these patients were able to recover more quickly than those at lower-volume hospitals, which sent 76 percent of patients home after surgery.\n\nRegardless of where your surgery is completed, it's important to be prepared \u2014 and to know who will be taking care of you post-operation. Talking to your doctor about diet, smoking, and other lifestyle habits before a surgery may make a big difference in mitigating potential complications. \"Examples of things to do include stop smoking and increase activity and exercise,\" Dr. Farhood Farjah, associate medical director of the Surgical Outcomes Research Center at the University of Washington in Seattle, told Reuters. \"Also, patients should consider what support they have in terms of family and friends in the event that they need care when they go home.\"\n\nHowever, Farjah thinks that patients shouldn\u2019t choose surgeons based on where they work. \u201cJust because your surgeon works at a hospital that doesn\u2019t do many colorectal procedures, it doesn\u2019t mean that your surgeon isn\u2019t qualified or won\u2019t do a good job,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just showed that, overall, hospitals with higher volumes of colorectal surgeries tend to produce better outcomes, in regards to the postoperative recovery process.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "colon surgery, busy hospitals, surgery recovery", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People who undergo colon surgery at high-volume hospitals experience a better recovery, a new study found.", "title": "Colon Surgery Patients Recover More Quickly At Busier Hospitals", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/patients-undergoing-colon-surgery-recover-more-quickly-busier-hospitals-study-267596", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/21/surgeons-work.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People who undergo colon surgery at high-volume hospitals experience a better recovery, a new study found.", "title": "Colon Surgery Patients Recover More Quickly At Busier Hospitals", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/patients-undergoing-colon-surgery-recover-more-quickly-busier-hospitals-study-267596", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/21/surgeons-work.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/21/surgeons-work.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-21T20:47:34-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-21T20:54:34-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People who undergo colon surgery at high-volume hospitals experience a better recovery, a new study found."}, "article_summary": "Colon surgery included procedures done for colon cancer as well as for polyps \u2014 growths in the colon \u2014 or blocked colons.\nAt busy hospitals, 86 percent of colon surgery patients were sent straight home after the procedure.\nThis was a sign that these patients were able to recover more quickly than those at lower-volume hospitals, which sent 76 percent of patients home after surgery.\nThe study, which focused on colon surgeries, defined a successful recovery as being able to go about daily activities independently after the surgery.\nOut of the 280,000 patients involved in the study, three quarters of them received colon surgery at high-volume hospitals; they were often younger, had higher incomes and were more likely to have private insurance compared to those who had surgery at low-volume hospitals."}
