Eliot Spitzer, the mayor\u2019s office confirmed Thursday.\n\n\u201cLis was contracted to work with our team through the transition. She did exemplary work and we are grateful for the support she provided,\u201d Laura Stantucci, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s chief of staff, said. \u201cNow that the transition is concluding, she is returning to her work as a political consultant.\u201d\n\nThe news was first reported by Capital New York.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud to have worked on @Billdeblasio\u2018s historic campaign and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what he does as mayor,\u201d Ms. Smith wrote on Twitter Thursday morning. She was not immediately available for any further comment.\n\nMs. Smith drew headlines last month when the media discovered she is dating Mr. Spitzer, who resigned in 2008 after he was caught patronizing prostitutes. Mr. Spitzer lost his comeback bid for city comptroller in September.\n\nLast month, Mr. Spitzer and his wife, Silda Spitzer, announced that their marriage was over following newspaper reports that Ms. Smith and Mr. Spitzer were dating.\n\nMs. Smith worked as a press aide to Mr. Spitzer during his campaign for comptroller. After Mr. Spitzer lost the primary to Scott Stringer, who became the city\u2019s comptroller on Wednesday, Ms. Smith joined Mr. de Blasio\u2019s mayoral campaign. In November, after Mr. de Blasio won the general election in a landslide, Ms. Smith became the chief spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s transition team.\n\nSince reports broke about Ms. Smith\u2019s relationship with Mr. Spitzer, she has not been seen at any of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s press events. She did not attend Mr. de Blasio\u2019s inauguration at City Hall on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just not going to get into individual personal matters,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said last month when asked about Ms. Smith and Mr. Spitzer. Several days ago, Mr. de Blasio said Ms. Smith was on \u201cvacation,\u201d even though the transition team was in high gear preparing for the inaugural ceremony.\n\nMr. de Blasio was put in a delicate position as he was putting the finishing touches on his first-term administration; in the past, he has been particularly critical of Mr. Spitzer. In an August televised interview, Mr. de Blasio called Mr. Spitzer a \u201cchild of the elite\u201d and said he had \u201cinvalidated himself by his actions when he was in public office.\u201d\n\nMr. de Blasio, the city\u2019s 109th mayor, has not yet announced who will serve as his press secretary.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has decided not to bring Lis Smith, his chief transition spokeswoman who is reportedly  dating former Gov.
