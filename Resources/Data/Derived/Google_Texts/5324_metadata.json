Cecchini spent the afternoon advising supermarket shoppers on what to buy. (Photo: Heidi de Marco / TNS)\n\nWhen Lisa Tamura goes to the grocery store, she usually picks up a few frozen pizzas for the nights she doesn\u2019t want to cook.\n\nBut on a recent Thursday afternoon at the Ralphs supermarket in Laguna Hills, California, she strolled right by the frozen food and headed straight to the fruits and vegetables.\n\nThat\u2019s because she had some help from the ultimate personal shopper \u2014 a family doctor named Phil Cecchini.\n\n\u201cWhat do you like to eat?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cBad food,\u201d she responded, laughing.\n\nCecchini, who works for St. Joseph Hoag Health in Orange County, spent the afternoon advising shoppers on what foods to buy \u2014 and what to avoid.\n\n\u201cIf you stick with the periphery, you are probably doing okay,\u201d Cecchini told Tamura, who recently moved from Hawaii to California. \u201cYou are avoiding all the pre-packaged, processed foods.\u201d\n\nHospitals and health clinics around the country are increasing their efforts to promote exercise and healthy eating. They\u2019re offering yoga and cooking classes, sponsoring farmers markets and writing prescriptions for fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nSuch programs attract new patients and build loyalty, but many nonprofit hospitals are also driven by a federal mandate to improve health outcomes in the communities they serve. In addition, some hospitals are working under new payment models as a result of the Affordable Care Act in which they are compensated and held accountable for results more than ever before. That has led to more projects and campaigns to help reduce chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes.\n\nNearly 37 percent of Americans were obese between 2011 and 2014, according to a recent report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even in affluent Orange County, California, where obesity levels are lower, Cecchini said patients don\u2019t always know what foods cause weight gain or raise their blood sugar.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to know a lot more about nutrition, but there are still a lot of misconceptions out there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of room for improvement.\u201d\n\nSt. Joseph Hoag Health\u2019s recent campaign is called \u201cShop with Your Doc\u201d and is based at Ralphs supermarkets throughout Orange County.\n\nGrocery stores are an ideal place to teach people that they can become healthier by making small dietary changes and eating in moderation, said Vanessa Rosales, community affairs manager for Ralphs & Food 4 Less.\n\n\u201cWhat better place to reach the public with that message,\u201d Rosales said.\n\nShe also said that the doctor and dietician help ease confusion for shoppers as they try to make healthy choices. \u201cIt can be pretty intimidating to someone who may not know how to read those labels,\u201d Rosales said.\n\nThe shoppers didn\u2019t have to be St. Joseph\u2019s patients to get guidance from physicians as they fill up their shopping carts. Cecchini and a hospital nutritionist stood next to the pharmacy behind a table answering questions. One woman said she wanted to sweeten her tea and coffee and asked about the best substitute for sugar. A man said he was a vegetarian and took medication daily, but that his cholesterol was still too high.\n\nAs Tamura and Cecchini pushed her cart through the store, she grabbed a few fruits, including apples and pears. Then they stopped in front of the bread aisle. She picked up a loaf of country potato bread and they looked at the label together. Tamura said she didn\u2019t realize that the bread had so much sodium. And that\u2019s before you add salted butter and garlic, he said.\n\nCecchini encouraged her to keep an eye on sodium levels in future shopping trips. But he also assured her that it\u2019s okay to make exceptions.\n\n\u201cYou have to satisfy the mind and heart, as well as your stomach,\u201d he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1YQ1Mzl", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Health clinics around the country are increasing efforts to educate people to avoid processed, pre-packaged foods", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Health clinics around the country are increasing efforts to educate people to avoid processed, pre-packaged foods", "title": "Doctors advise shoppers to skip \u2018bad food\u2019", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/2015/12/29/nutrition-skip-bad-food-doctors-say/78018686/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health clinics around the country are increasing efforts to educate people to avoid processed, pre-packaged foods", "title": "Doctors advise shoppers to skip \u2018bad food\u2019", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5dfeb3d2d80d6c4404eab35cc33c91caa4ba887f/c=500-0-2501-2001&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/29/DetroitNews/B99339874Z.1_20151229122403_000_G9QO5SS3.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "health and exercise, avoiding pre-packaged foods, nutrition, healthy choicces"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb97\"", "article_summary": "The shoppers didn\u2019t have to be St. Joseph\u2019s patients to get guidance from physicians as they fill up their shopping carts.\nCecchini, who works for St. Joseph Hoag Health in Orange County, spent the afternoon advising shoppers on what foods to buy \u2014 and what to avoid.\n\u201cIf you stick with the periphery, you are probably doing okay,\u201d Cecchini told Tamura, who recently moved from Hawaii to California.\nShe also said that the doctor and dietician help ease confusion for shoppers as they try to make healthy choices.\nAs Tamura and Cecchini pushed her cart through the store, she grabbed a few fruits, including apples and pears."}
