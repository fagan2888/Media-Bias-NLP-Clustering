The U.S. presidential race just got a little more amusing, if that’s possible.

The usual hallmarks of a conservative Republican candidate — religious devotion to protecting gun rights no matter how bad the statistics get, relentless mentions of securing the border, maybe some homophobic sentiment — are nowhere to be seen on TedCruzForAmerica.com. (Cruz’s official website, tedcruz.org, continues to work).

Instead, the site is redirecting to the Canadian government’s immigration page, which offers instructions on your eligibility and links to apply for citizenship.

Ironically, one of Donald Trump’s most-commonly used barbs against Cruz is demanding he go back to Canada, his place of birth.

The redirect seems to be an attempt to undermine Cruz’s political views, rather than a simple humorous move offering Americans a way out if he wins the Republican nomination and subsequently, the presidency.

The domain has previously redirected to the Human Rights Commission and U.S. government’s healthcare website, featuring the finer points of Obamacare.

Cruz, and Republican presidential candidates en masse, have repeatedly disparaged Obamacare. The human rights redirect could be a reference to Cruz’s views on abortion and criticism of Planned Parenthood.

It’s not the only website hi-jinx from supporters or opponents of Republican candidates. Since Dec. 8, JebBush.com has been redirecting to Trump’s website.



Another website proclaims to offer Americans an escape route into Cape Breton if Trump wins.

“Don’t wait until Donald Trump is elected president to find somewhere else to live!” the website reads.

“Start now, that way, on election day, you just hop on a bus to start your new life in Cape Breton, where women can get abortions, Muslim people can roam freely, and the only ‘walls’ are holding up the roofs of our extremely affordable houses.”
