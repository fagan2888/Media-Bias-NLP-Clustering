As a report in the Washington Post explained in January 2013, there isn\u2019t just one line to wait in. The processing time for a visa application can vary wildly and depends on the home country of the applicant and the type of visa being requested: \u201cFor those applying for work visas because of their \u201cextraordinary ability,\u201d including high-ranking professors and international business executives, there is virtually no wait time. By contrast, a brother or sister of a US citizen from the Philippines applying for a family-sponsored visas may have been waiting 24 years, as those visas have been oversubscribed, according to the State Department\u2019s latest figures.\u201d\n\nThe average wait time for a Mexican national applying for a visa can vary from no time at all to twenty years. For example, if you\u2019re a Mexican professional with an advanced college degree, you can get a visa very quickly. If you\u2019re a Mexican skilled worker with a specialty that requires at least two years of training, the wait is roughly six years. But if you have a US citizen sibling, the wait is, on average, 17 years, and up to twenty years if you are the child of a US citizen born in Mexico.\n\nThis begs the question, why would someone from Mexico or Central America want to wait in line for so many years to say they followed the rules when it is becoming increasingly easy to emigrate to the US illegally? It is much easier to obtain a non-immigrant visa, enter the US legally, and just stay past the expiration date of the visa. According to a September 2013 Pew Research Center report, \u201cThe vast majority of unauthorized immigrants entered the country without valid documents or arrived with valid visas but stayed past their visa expiration date or otherwise violated the terms of their admission.\u201d\n\nEven though federal government officials have said repeatedly that unaccompanied alien children, or UACs, will still go through deportation proceedings, the reality on the ground is that they and adult immigrants from countries other than Mexico (OTMs) are being released on the basis of \u201ccredible fear claims,\u201d and only being told to appear before an ICE official within 15 days. Chris Cabrera, a leader of the south Texas chapter of the National Border Patrol Council, told CNN, \u201cI\u2019d say between 95 and 97% of adults or youths don\u2019t show up for court.\u201d\n\nWith the legal process for coming to the United States so incredibly backlogged and inefficient, and currently the illegal method for crossing the border and being released hampered only by the dangerous\u2013and expensive\u2013physical journey to the border, it is easy to see why tens of thousands of immigrants choose the illegal route over \u201cwaiting in line like everyone else.\u201d\n\nSylvia Longmire is a border security expert and Contributing Editor for Breitbart Texas.
