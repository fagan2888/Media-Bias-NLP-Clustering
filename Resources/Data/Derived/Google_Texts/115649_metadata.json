Gans from the Constitutional Accountability Center argues that the debate over the religious rights of corporations is akin to the Citizens United case.\n\nThe next big test of corporate personhood is inching closer to Supreme Court review. Deepening an already existing circuit split, the Sixth Circuit has become the second federal court of appeals to reject the argument that business corporations can evade the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and its regulations requiring them to provide their female employees with access to the full range of FDA-approved contraceptives because the law allegedly burdens the corporations\u2019 right to the free exercise of religion.\n\nIn a ruling handed down on Constitution Day itself, the Sixth Circuit unanimously held that Autocam Corporation, a for-profit corporation engaged in auto manufacturing, was not a \u201cperson capable of religious exercise as intended by RFRA [the Religious Freedom Restoration Act]\u201d and thus was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its claim that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive coverage requirement violated RFRA.\n\nRespecting the Constitution\u2019s promise of religious liberty as a fundamental human right owed to all persons, the Sixth Circuit rejected Autocam\u2019s efforts to impose its owners\u2019 religious beliefs on its employees, many of whom have a different set of religious views and want and need access to the full range of contraceptives.\n\nThe court\u2019s opinion, authored by Judge Julia Smith Gibbons, a conservative jurist appointed by President George W. Bush, made two important holdings.\n\nFirst, the court held that the Kennedy family, Autocam\u2019s individual owners, cannot invoke their own religious beliefs to justify disregarding the ACA\u2019s contraception coverage requirement, a legal obligation that falls on Autocam, not its individual owners\n\nInvoking the black-letter law that \u201cshareholders of a corporation cannot bring claims intended to redress injuries to a corporation, even when the corporation is closely held,\u201d Judge Gibbons explained that \u201c[w]e are without authority to ignore the choice the Kennedys made to create a separate legal entity to operate their business.\u201d\n\nTo permit individual owners to assert their own free exercise rights to redress an injury to the corporation \u201cabandon[s] corporation law doctrine at the point it matters most.\u201d\n\nThis is no technical detail. The individual owners of Autocam are seeking to raise their own religious beliefs \u2013 which of course are protected by the Constitution and RFRA \u2013 because the corporation\u2019s claim that it has free exercise rights is such a weak one. (Indeed, it is meritless.) Judge Gibbons and her colleagues were right to reject this attempt to circumvent the very foundations of corporate law.\n\nSecond, in her opinion for the court, Judge Gibbons concluded that \u201cCongress did not intend to include corporations primarily organized for secular, profit-seeking purposes as \u2018persons\u2019 under RFRA,\u201d agreeing with the Third Circuit\u2019s prior ruling in Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Secretary of the U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Services (which we discussed at length here).\n\nJudge Gibbons reasoned that, as the Act\u2019s title suggests, \u201cCongress\u2019 express purpose in enacting RFRA was to restore Free Exercise claims,\u201d previously recognized by the Supreme Court, \u201cclaims which were very fundamentally personal,\u201d that is exercised by human beings. Far from serving a restorative purpose, \u201c[r]eading the term \u2018person\u2019 in the manner suggested by Autocam would lead to a significant expansion of the scope of the rights the Free Exercise Clause protect[s] . . . . \u2018During the 200-year span between the adoption of the First Amendment and RFRA\u2019s passage, the Supreme Court consistently treated free exercise rights as confined to individuals and non-profit religious organizations.\u201d\n\nNothing in RFRA, Judge Gibbons concluded, required overriding the basic, common sense difference between business corporations, which are given special privileges to make running a business more lucrative, and churches and other religious bodies, which exist to foster the exercise of religion by communities across our nation.\n\nBusiness corporations, hoping to build on their huge success in the Roberts Court, have pushed the idea that for-profit corporations should have the same constitutional right to the free exercise of religion as individuals have, even though corporations cannot, in any meaningful sense, pray, express devotion to a God, or act on the basis of a religious conscience.\n\nBut, as Judge Gibbons showed in Autocam, business corporations do not exercise religion, people do. Her Constitution Day ruling is a fitting tribute to our Constitution\u2019s fundamental protection of basic human rights.\n\nDavid H.
