No matter the facts, the GOP is committed to the message that Obamacare has failed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago when Republicans were deeply concerned over the quality of the president\u2019s healthcare website.\n\nIn a letter to Kathleen Sebelius, head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Rep. Darrell Issa and Sen. Lamar Alexander demanded answers for the massive glitches that attended the rollout of Healthcare.gov. \u201cWe are concerned by recent comments to the media that the system suffers from architectural problems that need design changes,\u201d wrote the two GOP lawmakers, \u201cWe seek information about these problems as well as whether you still expect individuals to suffer a tax penalty if they do no purchase government-approved health insurance.\u201d\n\nLikewise, in a statement, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said that \u201cObamacare is collapsing under its own weight.\u201d This was echoed by the Senate Republican Policy Committee, which called the website an \u201cinexcusable train wreck\u201d and wondered \u201chow President Obama can tax uninsured Americans for not having something that they can\u2019t purchase.\u201d\n\nThe administration responded to all of this criticism\u2014and more\u2014with a promise that Healthcare.gov would work for the majority of users by December 1st. And it does. According to the administration, a five week \u201ctech surge\u201d has doubled the capacity of the online interface to the health care exchanges that form the core of the Affordable Care Act. As of this month, the website can handle 50,000 simultaneous users, for a total limit of 800,000 users per day. The site is functional more than ninety percent of the time, up from fifty-five percent of the time in October.\n\nThere is still a whole host of work to finish, especially on the back-end, where critical communications are made to insurers with regards to subsidies and eligibility. Overall, however, the White House has achieved more than 400 of the 600 fixes on its \u201cpunchcard\u201d of repairs. Healthcare.gov is on the fast track to full stability, which will be a significant boost to the law and its prospects.\n\nGiven the extent to which Republicans were so concerned with the status of the website, you\u2019d think they would greet this as good news, even as they continue to oppose the law. The message doesn\u2019t have to be extensive. Something as simple as, \u201cWe still oppose the law, but we\u2019re glad Americans haven\u2019t been left in the cold,\u201d would suffice.\n\nEven that, however, is too generous for Republicans, who can\u2019t concede any goodwill to the president\u2019s health care law. \u201c[The] website is least of Obamacare\u2019s problems,\u201d tweeted Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about a broken website, it\u2019s about a fundamentally-flawed law,\u201d wrote Michael Steel, a spokesperson for Speaker of the House John Boehner. And on ABC\u2019s This Week, Oklahoma Senator Tom Cole said that \u201cYou never get a second chance to make a first impression, and the first impression here was terrible.\u201d\n\nThe Republican complaints of two months ago were purely opportunistic. For them, it just doesn\u2019t matter if Healthcare.gov is working, since Obamacare is destined to fail, reality be damned! At most, the broken website was useful fodder for attacks on the administration. Now that it\u2019s made progress, the GOP will revert to its usual declarations that the Affordable Care Act is a hopeless disaster. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Americans have gained access to health insurance thanks to the Medicaid expansion or the exchanges, and many more will join their ranks as the deadline for coverage approaches.\n\nRepublicans haven\u2019t offered a response to this because, as of this moment, the party doesn\u2019t have a response. Yes, there are conservative intellectuals with ideas for reform, but as an institution, the GOP has little to say about the constellation of problems in American health care. Even in their drive for repeal, Republicans failed to offer an alternative. At most, lawmakers like Bob Corker of Tennessee have tentatively called for \u201cmarket-driven\u201d reforms, like changes to the tax code, and allowing insurers to sell across state lines. Ironically, the Affordable Care Act allows for these changes, but that doesn\u2019t seem to matter to the GOP.\n\nIt\u2019s almost clich\u00e9 to say that the Democratic Party is gambling its success on the Affordable Care Act. If it works, the party can point to a broad program that delivers needed benefits to millions of Americans. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s hard to imagine how Democrats will re-earn the trust of a skeptical public, to say nothing of the fate of the uninsured and the broader consequences for liberalism.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201312021845, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "Healthcare.gov is well on its way to full stability, but Republicans refuse to acknowledge it.
