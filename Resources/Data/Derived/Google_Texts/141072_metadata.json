Yesterday I was having my coffee and watching Morning Joe (you know\u2026 like ya do), when they had economics \u201cexpert\u201d Steve Rattner on to explain who is being affected by Obamacare and to what extent. He kicked things off with the following chart \u2013 Steve always brings charts\u2026 it\u2019s his thing \u2013 and his opening explanation of the first line.\n\n\u201cThis chart basically breaks down all Americans into five groups. We start, of course, with those who are unaffected. These people, this 80%, are people who either get their health insurance through their employer, as probably most of us here do, or they\u2019re on Medicare or they\u2019re on Medicaid and for them, for the most part, life goes on.\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019ll see in the video below, he breezes right past that 80%, presenting the assumption that the vast majority of Americans are simply unaffected by Obamacare and goes on to talk about the tiny sliver of people who might be experiencing problems. (That must be a real treat for the literally millions of people who fall into some of those other categories, but that\u2019s a story for another day.) This is a constant theme being pushed by Obamacare supporters in the media these days, and the reason I wanted to highlight it is that it\u2019s complete garbage. For some admittedly anecdotal testimony on this, I present two examples I\u2019ve run into personally.\n\nMy wife has been doing some work these last few years through a temp agency here in upstate New York. (Don\u2019t ask.. it works for our schedule.) The company offered a health care plan which I (and this is only in my opinion based on our personal needs) thought was relatively poor quality. The employer contributed nothing to the premium cost (being a temp agency), the deductibles were rather high and it didn\u2019t cover a lot of basic family care needs. It was, in short form, emergency insurance against disaster, and the premiums really weren\u2019t all that high. But a lot of temp workers are young, single, healthy people, so quite a few of them had signed up for it. It wasn\u2019t right for me, but it worked for them.\n\nEarlier this year they were notified that the plan was being cancelled entirely. It didn\u2019t \u201cqualify\u201d under the Affordable Care Act, so it had to go. They sent out a letter saying they would offer a new plan (no details offered) in December, but in the meantime they encouraged everyone to sign up for Obamacare. When the details of the new plan came out, the employer was still not going to contribute to the premiums, but the rates had gone up and the coverage hadn\u2019t improved noticeably in any area. Nobody was happy.\n\nThe second story is from the contracting group that I do quite a bit of work through. They held a meeting to explain to everyone the upcoming \u201cchanges\u201d in their healthcare plan, with a representative from United Healthcare Services coming in to go over the details. I don\u2019t get my coverage through them, but was invited to the meeting anyway. The woman who arrived handed out fliers detailing all of the wonderful new items which were going to be covered in the revised health plan. They primarily had to do with contraception, pre-natal, well baby coverage and the like. She was also very clear that these benefits were mandated by Obamacare. (Yes, she used the word \u201cObamacare\u201d in her presentation.) She then went on to brief everyone on the new employee premium contributions which had shot up in some cases by 25% or more, depending on whether or not you had single, single plus one or family coverage.\n\nOne woman I know who was at the meeting has four kids and a husband who is now taking part time jobs after being laid off from Lockheed Martin. She is the larger breadwinner of the family as well as being the one getting benefits. She left the meeting stammering to everyone in the hall, \u201cthat\u2019s half my paycheck. What am I going to do?\u201d\n\nThat was because of Obamacare. Both of the above stories were. And when I told these stories to others I heard similar ones coming right back at me. It may not be everyone, but a lot of people are getting hit hard in the pocketbook as a direct result of mandated changes to the insurance industry by the Affordable Care Act. So\u2026 80% are \u201cunaffected\u201d if they get their health insurance through their employer and \u201clife goes on\u201d for them?\n\nNot by a long shot. This is complete lie and it\u2019s being spoon fed to the public on cable news every week. And those pimping these tales should be called out on it. Here\u2019s the video so you can hear the entire \u201cexplanation\u201d for yourself.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Lies and damned lies", "title": "The myth of the \u201c80% unaffected by Obamacare\u201d meme", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/21/the-myth-of-the-80-unaffected-by-obamacare-meme/", "image": {"width": 450, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WhoPayMore.jpg", "height": 237}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-21T13:01:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-21T00:14:46+00:00"}, "keywords": "Democrats, Morning Joe, MSNBC, ObamaCare, Steve Rattner,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "So\u2026 80% are \u201cunaffected\u201d if they get their health insurance through their employer and \u201clife goes on\u201d for them?\nThe company offered a health care plan which I (and this is only in my opinion based on our personal needs) thought was relatively poor quality.\nThe woman who arrived handed out fliers detailing all of the wonderful new items which were going to be covered in the revised health plan.\nThe myth of the \u201c80% unaffected by Obamacare\u201d memeposted at 8:01 am on November 21, 2013 by Jazz ShawThis is one of those \u201cI have a bone to pick\u201d columns in terms of the media\u2019s coverage of the ongoing Obamacare train wreck, so bear with me.\nMy wife has been doing some work these last few years through a temp agency here in upstate New York."}
