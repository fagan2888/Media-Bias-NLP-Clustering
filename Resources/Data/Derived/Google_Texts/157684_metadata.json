Acting Attorney General John Hoffman says the 35-year-old Newark resident admitted that he and 40-year-old Delrese Hardy of East Orange arranged to have 22 kilograms of cocaine transported from Houston to New Jersey.\n\nHoffman called Braswell and his co-defendants major interstate suppliers of cocaine that was distributed in northern New Jersey.\n\nThe investigation into the drug ring began after a 2007 shooting outside Braswell\u2019s house in Newark in which he killed another man.\n\n\u201cBraswell and his co-defendants were major interstate suppliers of cocaine, and their activities fueled the type of gun violence that inevitably attends drug dealing, as evidenced by Braswell\u2019s own involvement in a fatal shooting in Newark,\u201d said Elie Honig director of the Division of Criminal Justice.\n\nBraswell\u2019s five co-defendants were sentenced in 2011 to between seven and 15 years in prison.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1oSn6Hk", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A one-time New Jersey state corrections officer has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for his role in an interstate cocaine trafficking network.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "A one-time New Jersey state corrections officer has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for his role in an interstate cocaine trafficking network.", "title": "Former corrections officer sentenced in drug case", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2014/08/20/former-corrections-officer-sentenced-drug-case/14355077/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A one-time New Jersey state corrections officer has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for his role in an interstate cocaine trafficking network.", "title": "Former corrections officer sentenced in drug case", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e09e7c4dc4c519bdb9aa5203a53eb61daf7978c0/c=0-0-252-252&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/08/20/-crime6.jpg20090409.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Braswell worked at Northern State Prison in Newark and was one of six people arrested in 2008.\nBuy Photo File photo (Photo: File photo )Buy PhotoTRENTON \u2014 A one-time New Jersey state corrections officer was sentenced Wednesday to 15 years in prison for his role in an interstate cocaine trafficking network.\nHoffman called Braswell and his co-defendants major interstate suppliers of cocaine that was distributed in northern New Jersey.\nBraswell\u2019s five co-defendants were sentenced in 2011 to between seven and 15 years in prison.\nThe investigation into the drug ring began after a 2007 shooting outside Braswell\u2019s house in Newark in which he killed another man."}
