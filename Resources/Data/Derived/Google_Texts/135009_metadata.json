(REUTERS/Mike Blake)\n\n4048499\n\nTwo political groups have risen up in the last nine months to oppose state legislatures adopting the federally-backed Common Core education standards, testing and data collection, according to education policy scholar at the Cato Institute Neal McCluskey.\n\nMcCluskey highlighted the small-government conservatives and libertarians in one camp, as well as the progressives in another in an exclusive interview with The Daily Caller. Both groups dislike connecting standards to testing and teacher assessments and are bristling at federal intrusion on a new scale.\n\nThey are increasingly pushing back against \u201cestablishment\u201d types in both political parties. Although these two camps rarely work together, McCluskey sees signs that this may be about to change.\n\nThe Common Core standards are \u201calmost an establishment versus regular people, you\u2019d almost say, dispute,\u201d McCluskey said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who think somebody \u2014 and they won\u2019t usually say the federal government, but they\u2019re the only entity that has the power to do what they want \u2014 somebody needs to be engineering the education system to produce workers that these people think will be needed in the future,\u201d he explained.\n\nElites will often say \u201cneed a public schooling system that primarily produces people to work in factories, [that] produces a small number of people to be the leaders of society,\u201d McCluskey continued.\n\n\u201cWe are reaching the capstone of that, where the federal government, the ultimate centralization, at least for the nation, is saying we will tell you what kids will learn. We will tell you what tests you can use,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCluskey also discussed the massive conflicts of interest as groups like the Gates Foundation, Democrats for Education Reform and Pearson Publishing aim to influence policy makers.\n\nHe also warned of privacy issues where school districts have recently been empowered to distribute identifiable individual student data to contractors with the school system, raising the likelihood that privacy of data will not be protected.\n\nWatch Part 2:\n\nIn a previous segment, McCluskey talked about the process of nationalizing college loan programs to help pay for Obamacare.\n\nMrs. Thomas does not necessarily support or endorse the products, services or positions promoted in any advertisement contained herein, and does not have control over or receive compensation from any advertiser.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ginni Thomas", "description": "Cato scholar: Common Core fight is 'establishment vs. regular people'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Two political groups have risen up in the last nine months to oppose state legislatures adopting the federally-backed Common Core education standards, testing and data collection, according to educati", "title": "Cato scholar: Common Core fight is \u2018establishment vs. regular people\u2019 [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/05/cato-scholar-common-core-fight-is-establishment-vs-regular-people-video/", "image": {"width": 639, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/common-core-schools-reuters-e1388956930422.jpg", "height": 275}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cato scholar: Common Core fight is 'establishment vs. regular people' [VIDEO]", "title": "Cato scholar: Common Core fight is \u2018establishment vs. regular people\u2019 [VIDEO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/05/cato-scholar-common-core-fight-is-establishment-vs-regular-people-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/common-core-schools-reuters-e1388956930422.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-05 22:36:16", "sailthru.title": "Cato scholar: Common Core fight is 'establishment vs. regular people' [VIDEO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "common-core,ginni-thomas", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "common core", "sailthru.description": "Two political groups have risen up in the last nine months to oppose state legislatures adopting the federally-backed Common Core education standards, testing and data collection, according to educati", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/common-core-schools-reuters-e1388956930422.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Common Core standards are \u201calmost an establishment versus regular people, you\u2019d almost say, dispute,\u201d McCluskey said.\n(REUTERS/Mike Blake)4048499Two political groups have risen up in the last nine months to oppose state legislatures adopting the federally-backed Common Core education standards, testing and data collection, according to education policy scholar at the Cato Institute Neal McCluskey.\nBoth groups dislike connecting standards to testing and teacher assessments and are bristling at federal intrusion on a new scale.\nAlthough these two camps rarely work together, McCluskey sees signs that this may be about to change.\nGrade four students react to a camera in their classroom at Monarch School in San Diego, California October 8, 2013."}
