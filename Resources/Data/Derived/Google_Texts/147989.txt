>> LET ME SUSPEND TIME TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING MORE DIFFICULT, RELIGIOUS VIEWS, CONTRACEPTION, POLITICS. AFTER THE HOBBY LOBBY, WHEATON COLLEGE CASE, PRESIDENT OBAMA SENT A TWEET OUT, WHICH GIVES YOU SOME INSIGHT HOW HE VIEWS THIS POLITICALLY IN THE MIDTERM ELECTION YEAR. THE TWEET WAS THROW BACK TO LAST WEEK WHEN A WOMAN, NOT HER BOSS, MADE HER LEMONE DECISIONS ABOUT HER HEALTH CARE. AGAIN, RELIGIOUS EXCEPTIONS ON THE PART OF BUSINESSES OR A COLLEGE, THEY DON'T HAVE TO PROVIDE CERTAIN KINDS OF CONTRACEPTION, THIS BECOMES A READY MADE POLITICAL ISSUE NOW. >> IT IS A POLITICAL ISSUE. ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING KIND OF FASCINATING DYNAMICS YOU SAW THIS WEEK AFTER THE HOBBY LOBBY CASE, MANY PEOPLE WERE READING THE HOBBY LOBBY CASE AS THE COURT SAYING THE ADMINISTRATION HAD COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE FOR RELIGIOUS GROUPS TO -- THERE WAS A PATH FOR WOMEN EMPLOYEES TO GET CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE. THE DECISION OR ORDER ON THURSDAY REALLY SEEMED TO BE SHOWING THESE DEEP AND VERY PROFOUND VIGS WITHIN THE COURT. AND BASICALLY THE COURT WAS SAYING WHEATON COLLEGE DOES NOT EVEN HAVE TO COMPLY WITH WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION SAID TO PROVIDE CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE. SO YOU'RE SEEING THESE REALLY RAW FEELINGS ON THE COURT AND VERY UNUSUALLY KIND OF FEARS FROM WOMEN MEMBERS. >> IT WAS A VERY NARROW RULING. THE WHEATON RULING WAS ESSENTIALLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO IMPOSE THE HHS RULE INTO THERE'S A DECISION ON THE BROADER ACCOMMODATION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEY HAVEN'T DECIDED ON THIS ISSUE. WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT IS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT, WHICH SAYS YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE LEAST INTRUSIVE MEANS TO ACHIEVE THESE PURPOSES. THE COURT LOOKED AT THIS AND SAID THIS IS NOT THE LEAST INTRUSIVE MEANS. THE REAL QUESTION IS, IS THE BROADER RELIGIOUS EFFORTS THE PATH TO TAKE HERE. THE PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED ON THAT AND DOESN'T WANT TO PREVIEW. >> THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU FIND A WAY TO GET CONTRACEPTION TO WOMEN WHO WANT IT THROUGH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AS A WAY TO GET AROUND PEOPLE WHO HAVE RELIGIOUS -- >> OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHAT THE FIX WOULD BE. LETS GO TO THE RAW POLITICS OF THIS. USED TO BE SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT HOPED QUIETLY FOR LOSSES ON SUPREME COURT, IT GAVE THEM A POLITICAL REASON FOR EXISTING, SOMEBODY TO CAMPAIGN FOR, BEAT UP ON THE COURTS. WHAT'S FASCINATING FOR HOBBY LOBBY HOW EXCITING DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGNS ARE RUNNING ON. WE HAVE SOMETHING ON THE LEFT. THE SWING VOTE IS WHEN IT'S WHITE WOMEN OF BASICALLY 40 TO 55 IF YOU WANT TO ID THE EXACT DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP. THESE ARE THE WOMEN THAT IN 2010 THEY WERE LEANING REPUBLICAN AT THIS TIME. THIS TIME IT HASN'T BEEN. IT STARTS WITH THE CONTRACEPTION AD CAMPAIGN THAT THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN -- >> THIS IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT OBAMA CARE, TOO. DOES IT STIFLE YOUR RELIGIOUS OBJECTION, IT IS FOR OBAMA CARE WHO WANT TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT. >> THE DECISION IS A POLITICAL SWORD, OPENS A PANDORA'S BOX WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT. NOT ONLY THAT, YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAYING NOT ONLY WILL IT AFFECT OBAMA CARE BUT ANOTHER WAY FOR PEOPLE TO BEGIN THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY OBTAIN HEALTH CARE. MAYBE IT'S NOT THROUGH THEIR JOB. MAYBE IT'S THROUGH GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. I JUST THINK THAT THE RULING IS, LIKE I SAID BEFORE, IS OPENING
