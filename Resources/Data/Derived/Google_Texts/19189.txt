Nov. 27, 2013 -- To put it in surgical terms, the Affordable Care Act has had some work done. Here are six major changes made in recent months.

1. Consumers Have an Extra Week to Buy 2014 Coverage

Because of all the technical glitches affecting health insuranceMarketplace web sites, the federal government is giving consumers more time to buy coverage that will begin on Jan. 1, 2014. People can now buy coverage as late as Dec. 23, 2013, instead of Dec. 15. This only applies to the federally run Marketplaces. States that run their own may have different deadlines.

Consumers will still be able to buy coverage for 2014 after this deadline. But it won't start on Jan. 1, and they must buy it no later than March 31, 2014, when open enrollment ends.
