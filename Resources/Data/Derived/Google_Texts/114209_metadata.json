But he says storytelling is \u201cdeeply rooted in who he is.\u201d\n\nWhiteman, a member of the Northern Cheyenne nation, will bring his traditional storytelling to the 40th Denver March Powwow, March 21 to 23.

His father, the late Phillip Whiteman Sr., was part of the Northern Cheyenne Chiefs of the Council of 44 and was the drum-keeper for the Chief Society. His drum group, the Lame Deer Singers, attended Denver\u2019s first pow wow gatherings four decades ago. Phillip was the first recording artist for Indian Records.\n\nWhiteman\u2019s mother, the late Florence Whiteman, was the last Warrior Woman of the Elk Scraper Society. She also was the last Cheyenne woman to be married for a bride price of four horses, in a traditional ceremony at age 14.\n\nRELATED Like a Big Hug From Grandma: Denver March Pow Wow Celebrates 40 Years\n\n\u201cBoth of my parents played significant roles with the Northern Cheyenne, and my grandparents on both sides were chiefs and leaders at the Battle of the Little Bighorn,\u201d Whiteman said. \u201cNow, I take on these roles.
