The students were in kindergarten through second grade.\n\nAccording to the press release, researchers \u201cwatched to see whether each of the six-through-eight-year-olds chose a fruit, vegetable, whole grain, low-fat milk and/or a lean protein, taking before and after photos of the trays.\u201d They discovered:\n\nWhile 75 percent of the kids chose the lean protein (the entr\u00e9e), only 58 percent chose a fruit and 59 percent chose a vegetable. And among those who put the various types of food on their trays, only 75 percent took even a single bite of the protein, while only 24 percent ate a bite of their vegetables.\n\nResearchers also noted that there are several factors that influenced how much food the students ate, such as the presence or absence of their teacher, the noise level in the cafeteria, the length of the lunch period and even the size the pieces of food had been cut into.\n\n\u201cWe have been thinking that if young children choose healthy food, they will eat it,\u201d said Susan Gross, a research associate at Johns Hopkins. \u201cBut our research shows that is not necessarily so.\u201d\n\nAccording to Daren Bakst, a research fellow in agricultural policy at The Heritage Foundation:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthier lunches have become available in schools across the nation.
