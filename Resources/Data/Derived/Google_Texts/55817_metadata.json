We are not buying what they are selling.\n\nGlobal warming has been the most expensive and extensive \u201cpublic relations campaign in history\u201d\u2014as David Harsanyi calls it in his post at TheFederalist.com. He identifies the \u201c25 years of political and cultural pressure,\u201d as including \u201cmost governmental agencies, a long list of welfare-sucking corporations, the public school system, the universities, an infinite parade of celebrities, think tanks, well-funded environmental groups and an entire major political party.\u201d Yet, despite all the \u201cgentle nudging,\u201d \u201cstern warnings,\u201d and \u201cfear mongering,\u201d Harsanyi states: \u201cSince 1989, there\u2019s been no significant change in the public\u2019s concern level over global warming.\u201d\n\nDrawing on new polling data from Gallup, Harsanyi points out that with the past 25 years of messaging, even among Democrats those who \u201cworry greatly\u201d about global warming has only increased \u201cby a mere four percentage points\u201d\u2014with no change in the general public in the past two years.\n\nA Pew research poll on the Keystone pipeline\u2014also the target of years of intense messaging and fear mongering\u2014offers similar insights: \u201cSupport for Keystone XL pipeline is almost universal,\u201d reads the Washington Post headline. The poll results indicate that only those who self-identify as \u201csolid liberals\u201d oppose the pipeline.\n\nClearly, Americans aren\u2019t that stupid after all. We can smell a rat.\n\nIt isn\u2019t that we don\u2019t believe the climate changes\u2014it does, has, and always will\u2014but, as Harsanyi states: \u201cthere is a difference in believing climate change is real and believing that climate change is calamitous.\u201d He continues: \u201cas the shrieking gets louder, Americans become more positive about the quality of their environment and less concerned about the threats.\u201d And: \u201cas the fear-mongering becomes more far-fetched, the accusations become more hysterical, and the deadlines for action keep being pushed right over the horizon, fewer people seem to really care.\u201d\n\nHarsanyi concludes: \u201cif you haven\u2019t been able to win over the public in 25 years of intense political and cultural pressure, you are probably down to two options: You can revisit your strategy, open debate to a wide range of ideas, accept that your excited rhetoric works on a narrow band of the Americans (in any useful political sense), and live with the reality that most people have no interest in surrendering prosperity. Or, you can try to force people to do what you want.\u201d\n\nWith the huge investment of time and money, it appears the fear mongers have chosen the latter option. The regulatory scheme coming out of Washington reflects an acknowledgement that the PR campaign has failed, but that the effort is continually being forced on people who don\u2019t want it\u2014though they may not be following it closely; they may not be politically engaged.\n\nThe climate campaigners are continuing to do that which hasn\u2019t worked for the past 25 years\u2014somehow believing they\u2019ll get different results. (Isn\u2019t that the definition of insanity?)\n\nOn March 6, \u201cA documentary that looks at pundits-for-hire,\u201d Merchants of Doubt, was released. It aimed to smear the reputations of some of the most noted voices on the realist side of the climate change debate\u2014specifically Fred Singer who has been one of the original climate skeptics. But nobody much wanted to see it. In its opening weekend, BoxOfficeMoJo.com reports Merchants of Doubt took in $20,300.\n\nA week later, former Vice President Al Gore, as reported in the Chicago Tribune, called on attendees at the SXSW festival in Austin, TX, to \u201cpunish climate change deniers\u201d\u2014which is the tactic being used now.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen it in the widely publicized case of Dr. Willie Soon, a scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian center for Astrophysics, who \u201cclaims that the variations in the sun\u2019s energy can largely explain recent Global warming.\u201d The New York Times accused him of being tied to funding from \u201ccorporate interests.\u201d\n\nSimilar, though less well known, attacks have been made on Henrik M\u00f8ller\u2014Denmark\u2019s leading academic expert on noise research, who was fired by his university after exposing a wide reaching cover-up by the Danish government of the health risks caused by wind turbine noise pollution. And, on eminent meteorologist Lennart Bengtsson, who received world-wide pressure after he stated: \u201cI believe it is important to express different views in an area that is potentially so important and complex and still insufficiently known as climate change.\u201d\n\nEven Senator Edward Markey and Congressman Raul Grijalva recently joined the crusade. Paul Driessen draws attention to a letter they sent to \u201cinstitutions that employ or support climate change researchers whose work questions claims that Earth and humanity face unprecedented manmade climate change catastrophes.\u201d The lawmakers warn of potential \u201cconflicts of interest\u201d in cases where evidence or computer modeling emphasizing human causes of climate change are questioned\u2014but no such warning is offered for its supporters. Driessen states: \u201cConflicts of interest can indeed pose problems. However, it is clearly not only fossil fuel companies that have major financial or other interests in climate and air quality standards\u2014nor only manmade climate change skeptics who can have conflicts and personal, financial or institutional interests in these issues.\u201d He quotes Dr. Richard Lindzen, MIT atmospheric sciences professor emeritus and one of Grijalva\u2019s targets: \u201cBillions of dollars have been poured into studies supporting climate alarm, and trillions of dollars have been involved in overthrowing the energy economy.\u201d\n\nBut somehow, only those who may receive funding from \u201cfossil fuel companies\u201d are suspect. The anti-fossil fuel movement has been vocal in its funding for candidates who support its agenda.\n\nI\u2019ve experienced this on a small scale. I wrote an op-ed for the Albuquerque Journal warning New Mexico residents about concerns over SolarCity\u2019s arrival in the state\u2014which included offering 30-year financing for rooftop solar panels. A week later the paper published an op-ed that didn\u2019t discount my data, but accused my organization of receiving funding from the fossil-fuel industry. The op-ed was written by an employee of SolarCity\u2014but this didn\u2019t seem incongruous.\n\nThe little attack on me allowed me to ask for people to counteract the claim that the Citizens\u2019 Alliance for Responsible Energy is not an \u201calliance of citizens.\u201d The outpouring of support astounded me\u2014though the newspaper didn\u2019t post every comment.\n\nOthers, with whom I have been in contact while researching for this writing, provided similar stories of support following the attacks.\n\nIn a Desmog post titled \u201cClimate deniers double down on doubt in the defense of Willie Soon,\u201d the author states that Soon\u2019s supporters \u201ccircled the wagons.\u201d\n\nIn a Scientific American story on Merchants of Doubt, Andrew Hoffman, a professor at the University of Michigan, who studies the behavior of climate skeptics, says: \u201ctit-for-tats between mainstream and contrarian researchers tend to raise the profile of skeptical scientists.\u201d He concludes: \u201cFrankly, this degradation benefits the skeptics.\u201d\n\nBecause of the failure of the manmade climate-crisis campaign to capture the hearts and minds of the average American\u2014who, after all, isn\u2019t that stupid\u2014we can expect the Gore-ordered attacks to continue. Expect the fear mongering to become more far-fetched, the accusations to become more hysterical, and the deadlines for action to keep being pushed right over the horizon. When this happens, \u201cfewer people seem to really care.\u201d\n\nLike the mythical Hydra, when one \u201cskeptic\u201d is cut down, supporters \u201cdouble down\u201d\u2014two more grow to take its place. While designed to silence, the attacks draw attention to the fact that there is another side to the \u201cdebate.\u201d\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcddfd\"", "article_summary": "It aimed to smear the reputations of some of the most noted voices on the realist side of the climate change debate\u2014specifically Fred Singer who has been one of the original climate skeptics.\nGlobal warming has been the most expensive and extensive \u201cpublic relations campaign in history\u201d\u2014as David Harsanyi calls it in his post at TheFederalist.com.\nClearly, Americans aren\u2019t that stupid after all.\nWe are smarter than they think.\nA week later, former Vice President Al Gore, as reported in the Chicago Tribune, called on attendees at the SXSW festival in Austin, TX, to \u201cpunish climate change deniers\u201d\u2014which is the tactic being used now."}
