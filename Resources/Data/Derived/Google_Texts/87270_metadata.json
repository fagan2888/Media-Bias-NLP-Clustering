When asked whether government should prevent profiteering pharmaceutical companies, Dr. Ben Carson admitted some companies are not considering patients, but went on to argue that costs come not from greed, but from regulations: \u201cEvery single regulation costs in terms of goods and services,\u201d which hurts real people he argued, more than companies who rip off customers. Government employee Rand Paul said \u201cI want government so small I can barely see it,\u201d which would be easier to do if we eliminated 100 Senators and their staff, including Paul\u2019s. Jeb Bush, the son and brother of former presidents, claimed that DC politicians continue to make things worse.\n\nTwo candidates even argued that government caused consolidation in private companies. In the Kiddie Table debate earlier in the evening, Rick Santorum claimed ObamaCare caused insurance companies to consolidate. While he\u2019s right that the insurance market is dominated by a few players, that was true long before ObamaCare. Santorum claimed to be a lot less worried about consolidation in the watery beer market because, \u201cThere\u2019s no town in American anymore that doesn\u2019t have a brewery.\u201d Given that alcohol is one of the most regulated markets, it\u2019s odd that government involvement hasn\u2019t created dangerous consolidation in bad beer.\n\nMeanwhile, Carly Fiorina claimed that banks consolidate because they are afraid of government. Given that Fiorina herself contributed to the consolidation of the computer industry \u2014 but has always given market-based reasons, and not fear of the federal government, for her decision to merge HP with Compaq \u2014 that claim is particularly incredible.\n\nChris Christie, for his part, was outraged that various governments, mostly states, were considering regulating fantasy football companies Fan Duel and DraftKings, and that moderators might ask about regulating it. Christie, the governor of a state with a shrinking gambling industry, made the claim shortly after Jeb Bush bragged about being 7-0 in his fantasy football league, which was probably Bush\u2019s most successful moment of the night.\n\nUltimately, though, these candidates were making an argument about the efficacy of government, an argument that is particularly odd from people auditioning to run the entire federal government. \u201cEvery time government gets involved in something,\u201d Fiorina claimed. \u201cIt gets worse.\u201d\n\nIf Fiorina\u2019s claim, that every time \u2014 every single time! \u2014 the government gets involved in something it gets worse, then clearly the government should get out of the business of making war, right? It sounds like a good idea, because government involvement in making war will only make the ability for the U.S. to wage war worse. And without the half a trillion dollars the government spends on war each year, we\u2019d probably have a lot fewer wars.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Basically every candidate on stage last night trumpeted a set of assumptions that makes literally zero sense VIDEO", "title": "The broken logic of last night\u2019s GOP debate: How conservative ideology just tore itself apart", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Basically every candidate on stage last night trumpeted a set of assumptions that makes literally zero sense VIDEO", "title": "The broken logic of last night\u2019s GOP debate: How conservative ideology just tore itself apart", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/29/the_broken_logic_of_last_nights_gop_debate_how_conservative_ideology_just_tore_itself_apart/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-29-at-9.43.29-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Basically every candidate on stage last night trumpeted a set of assumptions that makes literally zero sense VIDEO", "title": "The broken logic of last night\u2019s GOP debate: How conservative ideology just tore itself apart", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-29-at-9.43.29-AM.png", "creator": "@emptywheel", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Marcy Wheeler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie, GOP debate, GOP primary, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, The Republican Party, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d0b\"", "article_summary": "It sounds like a good idea, because government involvement in making war will only make the ability for the U.S. to wage war worse.\nMeanwhile, Carly Fiorina claimed that banks consolidate because they are afraid of government.\n\u2014 the government gets involved in something it gets worse, then clearly the government should get out of the business of making war, right?\n\u201cEvery time government gets involved in something,\u201d Fiorina claimed.\nIn the Kiddie Table debate earlier in the evening, Rick Santorum claimed ObamaCare caused insurance companies to consolidate."}
