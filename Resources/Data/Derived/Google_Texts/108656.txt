The Emergo Group recently published its Medical Device Industry Outlook for 2014 — a comprehensive study that polls corporate leaders and influencers in the medical device industry worldwide to gain an overarching view of how the previous year concluded for the industry and what the general consensus is for the future of the industry in the new year. After compiling results, Emergo has found that there is general agreement among the industry that the outlook is positive on a global scale, with certain regions expressing more optimism for 2014 than others.

Emergo’s new report is based on the feedback taken from nearly 4,000 medical device industry professionals from around the world, which covered all of the top level issues that are important to the medical device industry, including business and regulatory challenges, sales performance, market growth potential, and effects of the U.S. Medical Device Excise Tax, a major fixture of Obamacare and point of political contention in 2013. The results indicate the U.S. and Europe remain cautiously optimistic about the industry for 2014, with developing markets in the Asia-Pacific rim and South America showing the highest optimism and growth potential.

The higher level of optimism in these regions, according to Emergo, appears to be related to 2013 sales performance, as well as concerns over the effect of the U.S. medical device tax which, although not reported to be a factor in 2013, is anticipated to be an issue for medical device companies in 2014. In spite of the fact that more than 40% of firms reported increased sales for 2013, and more than 80% of firms are positive about their 2014 sales prospects, the chart below indicates that North and South America did not perform as well as EMEA and Asia-Pac:
