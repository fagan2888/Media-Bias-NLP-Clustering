Mark Warner Mark WarnerArmy posthumously awards female veteran who served as WWII spy The Hill's 12:30 Report Clinton urged to go liberal with vice presidential pick MORE (D-Va.) have pitched their commission legislation as a compromise solution that will allow every voice to be heard.\n\n\u201cThere are no easy or simple solutions to the challenges posed by the growing use of secure technologies,\u201d Warner said on Monday. \u201cI believe that we can strike an appropriate balance that protects Americans' privacy, American security and American competitiveness, but we won't achieve that while all sides continue to talk past each other.\u201d\n\nThe measure obtained quick buy-in from key constituents, including encryption advocates on Capitol Hill, the tech industry and some civil libertarian groups.\n\n\u201cSolutions for today's toughest challenges can only be found once a thoughtful dialogue begins, and this is the beginning of the conversation,\u201d said Dean Garfield, CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents top tech firms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter.\n\nBut the bill hasn\u2019t gotten full-throated support from digital rights groups and privacy advocates, critical voices in the discussion. They expressed concerns that the commission \u2014 despite attempts at inclusiveness \u2014 is merely a longer route to getting law enforcement what it wants: guaranteed access to encrypted data.\n\nThe McCaul-Warner commission would consist of 16 members, including tech industry executives, privacy advocates, cryptologists, law enforcement officials and members of the intelligence community.\n\n\u201cWith its members appointed by political leadership, and therefore likely to include inside-the-Beltway establishment experts with security clearances, we fear that this commission may end up stacked in favor of law enforcement and intelligence interests,\u201d said Bankston, who attended a December sit-down on encryption policy with top White House cybersecurity and technology officials.\n\nThe commission would have six months to create an interim report and a year to deliver its full findings. Its scope would expand beyond encryption, exploring how authorities can maintain security with the proliferation of modern technology.\n\n\u201cWith such a broad mandate, there\u2019s no shortage of new and dangerous proposals that such a commission might generate that those who care about digital security and privacy would have to fight off,\u201d Bankston added.\n\nJoe Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), had similar reservations. CDT was also at the December meeting on encryption policy.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that the commission may focus on shortsighted solutions involving mandated or compelled backdoors [into encrypted platforms],\u201d he said. \u201cMake no mistake, there can be no compromise on backdoors.\u201d\n\nHall suggested that the panel narrow its focus to improving \u201cexisting investigator practices.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to encryption, civil society, academics, the tech industry and technologists are unanimous that strong encryption makes our nation more secure,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The bill would establish a commission to study the challenges encryption creates for police.", "description": "The bill would establish a commission to study the challenges encryption creates for police.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The bill would establish a commission to study the challenges encryption creates for police.", "title": "Privacy groups wary of compromise encryption bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/271265-privacy-groups-wary-of-compromise-encryption-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/warnermark_032415gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-01T11:57:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-01T11:57-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/271265-privacy-groups-wary-of-compromise-encryption-bill", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-01T10:15-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Mark Warner,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-01T10:15:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-01T11:57:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/271265-privacy-groups-wary-of-compromise-encryption-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The bill would establish a commission to study the challenges encryption creates for police.", "card": "summary", "title": "Privacy groups wary of compromise encryption bill"}, "dcterms.title": "Privacy groups wary of compromise encryption bill"}, "article_summary": "But the bill hasn\u2019t gotten full-throated support from digital rights groups and privacy advocates, critical voices in the discussion.\nPrivacy advocates are already concerned about legislation to establish a national commission to explore how police can obtain encrypted data without endangering Americans\u2019 privacy.\nADVERTISEMENTThe bill, introduced Monday, was intended as a compromise move that could bring together opposing sides in the divisive encryption debate.\nThe McCaul-Warner commission would consist of 16 members, including tech industry executives, privacy advocates, cryptologists, law enforcement officials and members of the intelligence community.\nWhile law enforcement officials warn that encryption is increasingly helping terrorists and criminals \u201cgo dark\u201d and hide from investigators, privacy advocates and tech companies insist this type of unbreakable encryption is necessary to maintain digital security and online privacy."}
