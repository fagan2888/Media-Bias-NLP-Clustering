BOSTON (AP) - President Barack Obama has signed into law a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch aimed at giving federal workers who are also veterans extra time off to seek medical care.

The new law provides the employees with 104 hours of what Lynch calls “Wounded Warrior leave” during their first year in the federal workforce so that they can seek medical treatment for service-connected disabilities without being forced to take unpaid leave or forego their appointments.

The Massachusetts Democrat said getting the proposal to Obama’s desk was a bipartisan effort.

The measure passed the House unanimously on September 28 and then passed the Senate, also unanimously, on October 26.

Lynch said the new law reflects Congress’ gratitude and appreciation for the hardship and sacrifices made by veterans.
