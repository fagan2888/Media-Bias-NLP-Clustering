And in this town, getting back on your feet doesn't take many hands.\n\n\"A small town with a big heart\" is exactly how the big hearted small towners describe Vernon. Though they may be small, the things they accomplish together are much larger than they ever anticipate.\n\n\"I expected it a little bit,\" Johnny Curlee said. \"But I didn't know it was gonna be like this, like this big.\"\n\nThis is love, dished out in bigger heaps than Freddie Whitfield's shrimp n' grits.\n\n\"I've lived here all my life,\" Jimmy Cook said. \"And this is the kind of thing people do.\"\n\nThe kinds of \"things they do\" is much like what Cook has done, volunteering his plot of land for a benefit concert for Gunner's Oyster Bar. The benefit concert is a direct benefit to the crew at Gunner's after the restaurant burned down several weeks ago.\n\n\"People just found out about it,\u201d co-owner and manager Vic Starling said. \u201cThey were starting to pour in the place. Waiting lines on Friday and Saturday night and then we had this catastrophe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a hang out spot,\u201d Jordan Tomlin said at the concert. \u201cI mean, they took our Tom Thumb so we had to re-migrate.\u201d\n\nInvestigators say arson is to blame.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been weird,\u201d Gunner\u2019s employee Andrea Wright said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t the same.\u201d\n\nBut they say they aren\u2019t too bitter, just a little, and they are just hoping to get better.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough two or three weeks,\u201d Starling said. \u201cWe finally licked our wounds and we\u2019re trying to come out of it. We\u2019ve had a great fundraiser today.\u201d\n\nDozens of concert goers streamed onto Cook\u2019s property as the sun and the temperature dropped. Earlier in the day, Gunner\u2019s cooks helped a cookout at Vernon High School. They donation dishes sold out at 300 plates.\n\n\u201cPut money in the pockets of the people that lost their job,\u201d a Cypress Spring lead singer, Kalan Miller, said. \u201cTo help them for Christmastime.\u201d\n\n\u201cGunner\u2019s has always been a big part of the community,\u201d another lead singer, Paul Roche, said. \u201cWe go down there. We drink beer. We eat their seafood\u2026 We found out it got burnt down and the community took a hit.\u201d\n\nThe band members, in addition to Christon Birge, said they felt obligated to give back to their hometown. From the ashes \u2013 a rebirth.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s coming together,\u201d Starling said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting quotes from our wood and what it\u2019s gonna take to build this place. And all I can tell you is it\u2019s gonna be bigger and better. The quality is gonna be back and we\u2019re gonna be back to a packed house very soon.\u201d\n\nStarling said he\u2019s been overwhelmed with the passion of the community and \u201chow they\u2019ve just all come together.\u201d\n\n\u201cY\u2019all just come out and have a good time,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a popular restaurant in Vernon burned down a few weeks ago, the community has mobilized to get everyone back on their feet.
