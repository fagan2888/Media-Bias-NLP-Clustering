On their account, it\u2019s the liberal leeches in the blue states who want free stuff from Uncle Sam, who live off the tax dollars of hard-working Americans. This is the narrative continually spun by the GOP and by right-wing ideologues.\n\nWell, it\u2019s not even remotely true, and the data proves it. The latest study, published Wednesday by the Tax Foundation, confirms what we\u2019ve known for a long time: Conservative states rely disproportionately on federal funding for revenues.\n\nThe Washington Post summed up the findings nicely:\n\n\u201cThe relationship is loose, although the overlap is real: Five states are among both the 10 most conservative and the 10 most reliant on federal funds. Four states are among both the 10 most liberal and the 10 least reliant on federal funds\u2026A rough pattern emerges by region, too. The South is home to five of the 10 most reliant states. The West and Midwest are each home to two, and the Northeast is home to one. Of the 10 states least reliant on federal revenue, four are in the West, three are in the Northeast, two are in the Midwest and one is in the South.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s the rugged individualists in the South who suck endlessly on the government\u2019s teat, not the \u201climousine liberals\u201d in New York and California. If you live in Mississippi or Kentucky or Louisiana or Tennessee or Georgia or Alabama or South Carolina, you likely receive more in federal assistance than you pay in taxes.\n\nThe reality, in other words, is that the blue states have subsidized the red states for decades.\n\nThe new Tax Foundation study is but another reminder of the rank hypocrisy of conservatives, especially as it relates to federal spending. Republicans lament the mushrooming government year after year, and they foment hysteria about socialism and minorities on food stamps and welfare queens. And yet it\u2019s Republicans who depend most on government while condemning it in the abstract.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Republicans understood how poor they really are, they'd stop backing candidates who aren't looking out for them", "title": "Listen up, Trump voters: Red states are the real moochers, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re better off backing Bernie", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If Republicans understood how poor they really are, they'd stop backing candidates who aren't looking out for them", "title": "Listen up, Trump voters: Red states are the real moochers, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re better off backing Bernie", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/07/listen_up_trump_voters_red_states_are_the_real_moochers_and_thats_why_youre_better_off_backing_bernie/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/trump_sanders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If Republicans understood how poor they really are, they'd stop backing candidates who aren't looking out for them", "title": "Listen up, Trump voters: Red states are the real moochers, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re better off backing Bernie", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/trump_sanders.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean Illing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, aol_on, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Republican Party, Socialism, Tax Foundation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The new Tax Foundation study is but another reminder of the rank hypocrisy of conservatives, especially as it relates to federal spending.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, aol_on, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Republican Party, Socialism, Tax Foundation, Elections News, News, Politics NewsThe Republican Party, and conservatives in general, complain constantly about the \u201cmoochers\u201d and the \u201ctakers\u201d and the \u201cfreeloaders\u201d on the Left.\nThe South is home to five of the 10 most reliant states.\nThe reality, in other words, is that the blue states have subsidized the red states for decades.\nThe latest study, published Wednesday by the Tax Foundation, confirms what we\u2019ve known for a long time: Conservative states rely disproportionately on federal funding for revenues."}
