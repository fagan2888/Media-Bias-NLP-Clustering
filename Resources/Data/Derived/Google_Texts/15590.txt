Also in today’s Jolt, the headline from a new poll of Minnesota likely voters commissioned by American Encore and conducted by Magellan Strategies:

Only 41 percent of respondents had a favorable view of Sen. Franken, while 45 percent had an unfavorable view of him. Only 44 percent approve of the job he is doing. • 54% of respondents disapprove of the Affordable Care Act, and only 38% approve. • Only 40% of respondents think Al Franken deserves re-election.

Obviously, Minnesota is not easy territory for Republicans, and very few folks had this race on even the broadest target list for 2014. But maybe he’s not quite good enough, not quite smart enough, and doggone it, people just don’t like him enough.

Among the survey’s other findings:

• Among all respondents, in order, 50% think freedom of speech is the most important, followed by 25% for freedom of religion, 6% for freedom of the press, 4% for the right to assemble, and 3% for the right to petition. • The voter mood does not bode well for incumbents, with only 31% thinking the country is heading in the right direction and 60% feeling things are on the wrong track. The results were based on a statewide automated voice recorded and live cell phone interview survey of 1,081 likely 2014 Minnesota general election voters. “Given that Senator Franken is now publicly attacking those exercising their free speech rights, it’s significant that Minnesotans rank this freedom so highly. This poll underscores the importance of standing up for free speech and holding those like Senator Franken accountable for their actions in attempting to destroy it,” said American Encore President Sean Noble.
