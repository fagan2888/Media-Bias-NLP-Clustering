Five suspects are in custody after shooting at a Logan County sheriff's deputy late Sunday night.

According to the sheriff's department, the deputy was driving west from Broadway on Seward, responding to a call concerning livestock out of their fences.

As the deputy approached the area of the bridge at Cottonwood Creek, a suspect who was on the roadway fired a shot at the deputy's vehicle, striking the driver's side from windshield. The deputy was not injured.

The suspects then took off in a white pickup truck and the chase began. As the suspects' vehicle hit some train tracks heading back toward Broadway, it lost control, rolled and came to a rest in a yard near Railroad Ave. and Seward.

Three of the suspects in the truck were injured in the crash. They were all taken by EMSA to a hospital in Edmond where they were treated. Two other suspects who had fled the crash were taken into custody a short time later.

Authorities have identified the suspects as Carl Gallian, 47, Christian Gallian, 19, Albert Holcomb, 24, Andrew Duncomb, 19, and Allen Valentine, 19.

Two of the five suspects are still in the hospital being treated for injuries suffered in the crash. The severity of those injuries has not been released at this time.

The other three suspects are in custody at the Logan County Sheriff's Office Detention Center on the initial charges of Shooting with Intent to Kill. Additional charges may be filed as the investigation goes forward.
