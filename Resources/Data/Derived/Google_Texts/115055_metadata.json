That geekmeister from the \u201980s who did hilarious parodies of pop hits? He\u2019s back, and critics are calling him one of the most relevant voices of the moment, one going so far as to pronounce him \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest living artist.\u201d His new album, \u201cMandatory Fun,\u201d just rocketed to the top of the Billboard 200 on its debut week \u2014 the first parodic album ever to do so.\n\nLooks like something\u2019s percolating in pop culture, revealing our growing discontent with America\u2019s twisted brand of capitalism. Is it any wonder? We know we\u2019re lied to. We know we\u2019re manipulated. We get that the country is stuck in airtight self-obsession. So we\u2019re starting to gravitate toward artists who confront our slow-boiling anxiety. If death-obsessed pop siren Lana Del Rey (whose \u201cUltraviolence\u201d album topped the charts earlier in July) is the zombie bride of capitalism, Weird Al is the court jester.\n\nMaybe we really need him just now.\n\nWho is this guy, anyway?\n\nRaised on Mad Magazine and encouraged by his parents to learn the accordion, Weird Al cut his comedic teeth on Dr. Demento\u2019s radio show in the late \u201970s and early \u201980s, where he began to conjure catchy parodies of songs like \u201cMy Sharona\u201d (\u201cMy Bologna\u201d) and \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust\u201d (\u201cAnother One Rides the Bus\u201d). If you\u2019re Gen X, you remember gleefully sharing and savoring these tunes along with your Cheetos during lunchtime.\n\nEventually he grabbed the national spotlight with his 1984 monster hit \u201cEat It,\u201d a parody of Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBeat It.\u201d A hero to sci-fi nerds and to every kid burdened with an inner bullshit detector on high alert, Weird Al became a crusader against clich\u00e9s and an antidote to the toxic inanities of pop culture.\n\nSomewhere along the way, he started moving beyond simply goofy and spoofy to something deeper. Obesity, grunge rock, the Amish \u2014 there was no sacred cow he would not poke. He held up a funhouse mirror to our foibles. By 2006, he was introducing a younger generation to his comedic gifts with the hit \u201cWhite and Nerdy,\u201d a send-up of the hip-hop song \u201cRidin,\u2019\u201d in which he portrays a Dungeons & Dragons-playing science dork with dreams of bling and hangin\u2019 with the gangstas.\n\nOff the Charts\n\nComedians typically get less cred than other artists, but that doesn\u2019t make them any less essential to us. With \u201cMandatory Fun,\u201d Weird Al takes his rightful place among those who have explored our strained relationship with the American dream, forcing us to grapple with its contradictions and disappointments. From Charlie Chaplin up through the Yes Men, Russell Brand and Stephen Colbert, these clear-eyed tricksters have connected us to our pain and channeled our collective revulsion.\n\nWhy does Weird Al stick to comedy? His answer, in typical fashion, mocks the question and inverts its logic. \u201cThere\u2019s enough people that do unfunny music,\u201d Weird Al once said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the serious stuff to Paris Hilton and Kevin Federline.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "His comeback is no coincidence.
