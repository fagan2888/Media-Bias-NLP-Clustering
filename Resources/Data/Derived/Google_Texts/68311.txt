2013 Year in Review

This past year was a hopeful one in many ways, with the American economy slowly continuing to improve and more people getting back to work. This, it seems, almost more despite what our elected officials have been doing in Washington than because of it. And legislation regarding marriage equality and marijuana legalization is encouraging – though not necessarily here in the Hoosier state.

2013 also marks my tenth — and final — year of writing this annual news roundup. Much thanks to publisher Kevin McKinney and former editor Jim Poyser (also thanks and good luck to new managing editor Ed Wenck). This has been both the most time-consuming and most fun writing project ever.

Finally, some journalistic honesty: years ago I stole the idea to do decade birthdays from a women's magazine I was thumbing through while waiting to get my hair cut – what little there is – at a chain haircut place. (The only time I ever violated the decade birthday rule was when Paul McCartney turned 64.)

I hope 2014 is a great year for everyone at NUVO and for all its readers.
