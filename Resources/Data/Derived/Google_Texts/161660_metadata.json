Wednesday wrote a manifesto including the names of his targets, a vow to \u201ccut someone\u2019s head off\u201d and as many as five reminders to \u201cpraise Allah,\u201d police said.\n\nBut authorities involved in the investigation maintain that there is no evidence that the stabber, 18-year-old Faisal Mohammad, is tied to a terrorist group or was inspired by terrorists.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing to indicate he was doing this because of Allah, or because he was going to be rewarded with 72 virgins, or because of ties to a terror group,\u201d Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnketold Fox news.\n\nIn the two-page, handwritten document found in Mohammad\u2019s pocket by the county coroner, the University of California Merced freshman wrote a numerical list outlining who he wanted to kill and how, including beheadings and shooting his victims, Mr. Warnke said.\n\n\u201cNo. 27 was to \u2018make sure people are tied down,\u2019 No. 28 was \u2018sit down and praise Allah,\u2019\u201d Sheriff Warnke told Fox. \u201cI remember seeing four or five times, scribbled on the side of the two-page manifesto, where he wrote something like \u2018praise Allah.\u2019\u201d\n\nSheriff Warnke said Mohammad wrote that he wanted to \u201ccut someone\u2019s head off and kill two people with one bullet, and he planned to shoot police.\u201d\n\nMohammad claimed in his manifesto that he was angry over being kicked out of a study group.\n\nThe manifesto has not yet been released, but Sheriff Warnke said he expects it will be within the next few days.\n\nThe FBI is investigating whether Mohammad had any terrorist ties, Sheriff Warnke said.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing on his computer or in his dorm room or in the manifesto to suggest any ties to terrorism or terrorist groups,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mohammed burst in to a classroom and began slashing and stabbing people with an 8-inch hunting knife.\n\nHe injured four people, including two students, a student aide and Byron Price, a 31-year-old construction manager who intervened during the attack.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Calif. college student who carried out a campus stabbing spree on Wednesday,
