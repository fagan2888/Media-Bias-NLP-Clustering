Syria has become a patchwork of areas controlled by the government, an array of rebel groups, Islamic State militants, and Kurdish militia.\n\nMediators have struggled to get Syria's combatants to honor a Feb. 27 cessation of hostilities deal to enable peace talks to proceed. On Friday, the U.N. special envoy for Syria vowed to take the talks into next week despite a walkout by the main armed opposition with both sides gearing up to escalate the war.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Barrington in Beirut and Rodi Said in Hasaka, Syria; Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Kurdish Asayish forces said in a statement that the accord took effect at 3:30 p.m", "title": "Kurdish, Syrian government forces declare truce in Qamishli area: statement", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/23/Kurdish-Syrian-government-forces-declare-truce-Qamishli-area-statement", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-hasaka_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/23/Kurdish-Syrian-government-forces-declare-truce-Qamishli-area-statement", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-hasaka_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Kurdish Asayish forces said in a statement that the accord took effect at 3:30 p.m", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4663\"", "article_summary": "During the fighting, Asayish forces seized control of a number of government-controlled positions in the city of Qamishli, in Hasaka province, as well as its main prison.\nSyrian Kurdish forces now dominate wide areas of northern Syria and set up their own government there.\nThe Kurdish Asayish forces said in a statement that the accord took effect at 3:30 p.m. (1230 GMT) on Friday and a Reuters witness said the truce was holding on Saturday.\nA Syrian Kurdish official has said this was the second biggest outbreak of fighting between President Bashar al-Assad's government and regional Kurdish forces since Syria's civil war began in 2011.\nQamishli, near the Turkish border, is mostly controlled by Kurdish security forces, though pro-Assad forces still hold a few areas in the city center, and its airport."}
