But this year differed from those past in the slightest way, as the Republican National Committee and other conservative groups actively participated in the March, reaffirming the GOP\u2019s public embrace of its reputation as the \u201cpro-life party.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s March for Life marks the first time in recent memory the Republican National Committee has taken an active role in the annual event. Typically, the March conflicts with the RNC\u2019s winter meeting, which is taking place in Washington, D.C., this week. But RNC Chair Reince Priebus delayed the start of the gathering to allow state party chairs and delegates to attend the March. Priebus himself, joined by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), even appeared onstage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be there to send a message: We are a pro-life party,\u201d Priebus wrote in an op-ed earlier this week. \u201cLife is a gift, and it must be protected. That means advocating for our beliefs, embracing the right to life, and celebrating the blessing of adoption.\u201d\n\nThe RNC\u2019s appearance at the March for Life demonstrates the party\u2019s newfound commitment to pro-life policies and legislation. In its 2012 platform, the term \u201cpro-life\u201d doesn\u2019t appear, though the party does focus on its commitment to allowing faith-based institutions the ability to adhere to their beliefs in regards to abortion. The GOP platform also outlines the party\u2019s refusal to allow public revenues to \u201cpromote or perform\u201d abortions, including through taxpayer-subsidized health coverage.\n\nWhile the RNC has shied away from social issues, instead redirecting the focus to the GOP\u2019s sound fiscal policies, Obamacare and the economy, its outspoken support of the March demonstrates its commitment to this specific cause.\n\n\u201cThese are people who would be voting for our candidate,\u201d Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, told Red Alert Politics of the RNC\u2019s participation. \u201cIt makes total sense for them to be out there taking an active role in the March.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic National Committee took aim against the RNC for its participation in Wednesday\u2019s March, slamming its counterpart for rallying \u201cagainst women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nHowever, the RNC fought back, reaffirming its stance as the pro-life party.\n\n\u201cSadly, the Democratic National Committee sees this as an opportunity to go on the attack. It\u2019s disheartening that they would try to disparage the marchers and misrepresent their cause,\u201d RNC Deputy Director of Communications Sarah Isgur Flores said in a press release. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason Democrats try to distort Republicans\u2019 respect for life. It\u2019s because the majority of Americans agree with Republicans on important life-related issues. For example, a majority support protecting life after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\u201d\n\nBut the RNC wasn\u2019t the only organization that went against its norm and took an active role in this year\u2019s March for Life. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, also participated, passing out literature and marching. Though the nonprofit typically hosts a reception celebrating the March for Life, Hawkins said, Heritage was out in full force this year.\n\n\u201cAs a conservative, this is something that I want to see,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to see the conservative movement and the pro-life movement marching together. At the end of the day, there are two political parties in the country. One is extremist on abortion \u2026 and the other believes in human rights.\u201d\n\nThe Heritage Foundation did not return Red Alert Politics\u2019 request for comment regarding their participation.\n\nThis year\u2019s March, held on the 41st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, saw more than 500,000 participants, a slight drop from 2013\u2019s 650,000 marchers. Participants Wednesday, however, battled below-freezing temperatures, wind and snow. While the crowd of marchers featured an array of genders, races and ages, young people\u2019s participation was overwhelming.\n\nMillennials, those between the ages of 18 and 34, have been become known as the \u201cpro-life generation\u201d for their unwavering support of anti-abortion legislation and the right to life. According to a recent Knights of Columbus/Marist University poll, 62 percent of Americans believe abortions are morally wrong in today\u2019s society. Additionally, more than half argue life begins at conception.\n\nBeing pro-life, Hawkins said, is a winning issue for candidates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something they have to run away or shy away from,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd as demonstrated by the College Republican National Committee\u2019s postmortem outlining how the GOP can reach young voters, concentrating on pro-life issues is not only a winner for candidates, but young people, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a human rights cause, and it\u2019s something young people are always involved in,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cThey\u2019re standing up for the little guy.\u201d\n\nCongress has begun to take action on pro-life legislation making its way through the House. Cantor told marchers yesterday the House plans to vote next week on a bill aimed to prohibit taxpayer-funded abortions. Meanwhile, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which restricts abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, already passed the House. It has yet to leave the Senate Judiciary Committee.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Hundreds of thousands gathered in the nation's capital Wednesday to march down the National Mall to the United States Supreme Court for the 2014 March for Life.
