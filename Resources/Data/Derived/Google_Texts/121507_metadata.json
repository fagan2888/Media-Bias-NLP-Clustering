Mounting Medicare Cuts Hurt.\u201d The reduction is the effect of cuts and underpayments for care being delivered to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries.\n\nBeginning in 2010, the United States Congress and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services enacted Medicare payment reductions for hospital services. The cutbacks were an attempt to address the federal deficit and offset other program costs, like the expanding insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2024, changed in Medicare FFS payment will cost hospitals in Hawai\u2019i an estimated $838 million, according to the study.\n\nAccording to the study, as reductions are carried into the future, they will serve as the base for additional cuts, a snowball effect that will continue to decrease hospital payments. The cuts will continue Medicare\u2019s underpayment for care, which occurs when the amount that it costs to treat a patient is greater than how much is reimbursed for the care.\n\nThe federal government determines Medicare reimbursement rates through an analysis of cost of care in jurisdictions. The payment rates in Hawai\u2019i don\u2019t cover the cost of care. Instead, it pays 86 percent of the cost hospitals in Hawai\u2019i make for the care.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHHIC\u2019s study determined that about $766 million was underpaid from Medicare to Hawai\u2019i hospitals between 2010 and 2014. An additional $1.7 billion could be incurred from 2015 to 2024 if patient volume, case-mix, and reimbursement rates continue down the current path.\n\nFurther Medicare payment cuts maybe be considered in the future, as the federal government determines ways to further reduce federal spending. Additional recommendations to reduce areas such as rural hospital programs, outpatient department payments, and federal support for medical education have also been considered.\n\n\u201cHawai\u2019i\u2019s situation is different from much of the rest of the nation because our population is healthier and healthcare expenditures are low per capita,\u201d said Peter Sybinsky, CEO of HHIC. \u201cMedicare expenditures per beneficiary in Hawai\u2019i are among the least nationwide so cuts from the federal government are likely to have a disproportionate effect on Hawai\u2019i compared to states in which overall expenditures are higher.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"expires": 0, "description": "Hospitals in Hawai'i may lose $3.3 billion in funding from Medicare through 2024, according to a recent study, \u201cOuch!
