LOMA LINDA >> The rate of health care cost increases in the U.S. during 2015 were the smallest in 50 years, Melissa Stafford Jones, Region 9 director the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said here Wednesday.

Last year, for example, the insurance marketplace created by Covered California, the state-run health insurance exchange authorized by the Affordable Care Act, saw its costs rise 4.1 percent, far less than the double-digit growth experienced in many years prior to the passage of the ACA, Jones said.

“Progress. Keep the shirt sleeves rolled up. We have more work to do,” Jones told about 60 doctors, nurses and administrative staff members at Loma Linda University Medical Center Wednesday.

Additionally, 17.6 million previously uninsured Americans have health insurance under the ACA, said Jones, who oversees Health and Human Services operations in California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and several other Pacific islands.

The ACA, known informally as Obamacare, was approved in by Congress 2010, although some of the major provisions did not kick in until 2014.

Jones arrived at the Loma Linda campus early Wednesday and toured the medical center as well as nearby facilities, including the Behavioral Medical Center in Redlands and the campus under construction in San Bernardino, officials said.
