Q: How does walking compare with working out on an elliptical machine?

A: Using an elliptical machine is likely to burn more calories than walking.

According to recent estimates by the Mayo Clinic, a 160-pound person using an elliptical machine for an hour would burn 365 calories. The same person walking for an hour would burn 314 calories. (If that person used a stair-stepping machine, he or she would burn 657 calories.) You generate forces equivalent to about 110 percent of your body weight with each step while walking, according to a 2014 study, but only about three-quarters of your body weight while using an elliptical machine, making the latter training preferable for people with achy, arthritic knees and hips.

On the other hand, walking provides a substantially better workout than elliptical machines for the hamstrings, calves and small muscles around the ankles. These muscles are important for balance and can reduce the risk of falls as people age.

It’s also worth noting that elliptical machines were voted the least enjoyable and most confusing equipment in a 2014 test of gym machines.

Overall, the latest research suggests that elliptical machines are a good choice for people with creaky knees and the patience to master the machine’s operations. Others may prefer to walk.
