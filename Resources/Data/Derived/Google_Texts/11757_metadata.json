Examples include head injuries or broken bones following attempted suicide.\n\n\"Suicide is a common exclusion,\" Sara Rosenbaum, a health policy professor at George Washington University, told KHN. \"Insurers are all over the place on this, and state law varies tremendously.\"\n\nYet mental health advocates and government experts question the legality of these exclusions. Citing HIPAA rules prohibiting discrimination against members, experts told KHN source-of-injury exclusions aren't allowed when claims result from a medical condition.\n\n\"A plan may not exclude coverage for self-inflicted injuries (or injuries resulted from attempted suicide) if the individual's injuries are otherwise covered by the plan and if the injuries are the result of a medical condition (such as depression),\" HIPAA nondiscrimination rules state.\n\nThe rules apply to all employer-based health insurance plans and affect the individual market, including marketplace products offered pursuant to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe mental health parity law prohibits insurers from restricting mental health and substance abuse benefits more than their medical and surgical counterparts, FierceHealthPayer reported. But if insurers deny claims payment after attempted or actual suicide, it's probably not a parity issue since it doesn't involve prescription drugs or therapy services covered by parity requirements, a U.S. Department of Labor representative told KHN.\n\nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans said the issue hasn't raised major concerns within the health insurance industry, KHN noted.\n\nFor more:\n\n- read the Kaiser Health News article\n\n- check out the HIPAA nondiscrimination rules\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAffordable Care Act may improve access to substance abuse treatment\n\nMental health coverage mandates could strain system\n\nMental parity leaves insurers unclear of coverage requirements\n\nKaiser fined $4M for failing to provide mental health access\n\nHHS issues mental health, addiction parity final rule", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some health plans exclude benefit payment for healthcare costs stemming from suicide-related injuries, though experts say these exclusions aren't allowable in many cases under federal law,\u00a0according to Kaiser Health News.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Some health plans exclude benefit payment for healthcare costs stemming from suicide-related injuries, though experts say these exclusions aren't allowable in many cases under federal law,\u00a0according to Kaiser Health News.", "title": "Suicide-related benefit exclusions may be illegal", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/suicide-related-benefit-exclusions-may-be-illegal/2014-02-18", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "exclusion policy,Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),mental health parity,Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "America's Health Insurance Plans said the issue hasn't raised major concerns within the health insurance industry, KHN noted.\nSome health plans exclude benefit payment for healthcare costs stemming from suicide-related injuries, though experts say these exclusions aren't allowable in many cases under federal law, according to Kaiser Health News.\nThe mental health parity law prohibits insurers from restricting mental health and substance abuse benefits more than their medical and surgical counterparts, FierceHealthPayer reported.\nYet mental health advocates and government experts question the legality of these exclusions.\nThe rules apply to all employer-based health insurance plans and affect the individual market, including marketplace products offered pursuant to the Affordable Care Act."}
