Live streaming by Unedited Media showed what looked like several hundred people participating in the protest that began around 3 p.m.\n\nThe neo-Nazi invasion of Leith was announced in the Bismarck Tribune in a September 6 story about Craig Cobb, a white supremacist who has been living in Leith for more than a year and has purchased 13 lots, some for as little as $500, including one where he lived. He has been promoting Leith on white supremacist websites as a place where others like him could live, take over the city government and fly Nazi flags, the Tribune reported.\n\nCobb told the Tribune he was grateful for support from Jeff Schoep, \u201ccommander\u201d of the National Socialist Movement (NSM), according to the group\u2019s website. In a video on the website Schoep announces \u201cOur trip to Leith is a gesture of goodwill as we plant the seeds of National Socialism in North Dakota.\u201d Unidentified orchestral music plays softly in the background with the sound of boots marching loudly in the foreground. The website displays the group\u2019s motto \u2013 \"Putting Family, Race and Nation First while Fighting to Secure American Jobs, Manufacturing & Innovation\" \u2013 and describes itself as \"America's Premier White Civil Rights Organization \u2013 Fighting for White Civil Rights.\" Schoep planned to be in Leith September 22-23 on a \u201cfact-finding tour\u201d to protect Cobb's legal standing in the community and to hold a press conference, the Tribune said.\n\nAround a dozen armed state troopers dressed in SWAT team gear were on hand. UnityND reported that none of the armed troopers had badge numbers displayed. The protesters gathered around Cobb\u2019s residency where a Nazi flag flew and about a dozen neo-Nazis gathered. The neo-Nazis had strung a banner across his yard that said, \u201cAnti-racist is code for anti-white.\u201d\n\nVarious protest speakers took the mike and denounced the neo-Nazis peacefully, but emphatically. \u201cWe want the Nazis to know this is not a one day protest. We\u2019ll be watching everything you do.\u201d The protestors chanted, \u201cNo Nazis, no KKK!\u201d A World War II Veteran said, \u201cLet these creepy Nazi-Ku Klux people get out.\u201d \u201cHey, hey! Ho ho! These Nazis have got to go!\u201d the protesters chanted. \u201cOur grandmothers will stand up to you! Our women will take you on!\u201d one speaker said. \u201cThis is not your land. This is my land and you can go back home.\u201d \u201cOn behalf of everybody here I\u2019d like to say, go home.\u201d \u201cGo home, go home!\u201d the crowd chanted. \u201cGo back to Germany!\u201d one protester said, but another replied that Germany would not have them. \u201cThey have laws against Nazis in Germany.\u201d Some of the speakers eloquently rejected the hatred that Nazism represents. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you we\u2019ve evolved. We do not hate white people. You come here and think you can exploit the ignorance of our own people, you think that we\u2019re going to react out of fear or a place in our hearts that wants to do you harm, but we won\u2019t do that\u2026We are evolved human beings and we think you know you people are a dying cause.\u201d\n\nAt around 4 p.m. many of the protesters moved into Leith town hall for the neo-Nazi press conference while bagpipe music played incongruously in the background. When Cobb entered the hall the protesters booed loudly. Many of the protesters left the town hall when one of the neo-Nazis on stage began a speech. Those who remained listened politely. By posting time \u2013 three-quarters of an hour later \u2013 neo-Nazi was still speaking.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of neo-Nazis who converged on Leith, North Dakota with plans to create an all-white enclave were met by hundreds of protestors.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/22/hundreds-protest-attempted-neo-nazi-takeover-leith-nd-151394", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/antinazitwostory1.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Neo-Nazis Try to Take Over Leith, ND; Hundreds Protest"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-09-22T18:19-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Neo-Nazis Try to Take Over Leith, ND; Hundreds Protest"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/22/hundreds-protest-attempted-neo-nazi-takeover-leith-nd-151394", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Last Real Indians, Neo-Nazi, Protest, White Supremacists, Peaceful Protests, Leith, Nazi Flags, Tribal Protestors", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 5}, "dcterms.title": "Neo-Nazis Try to Take Over Leith, ND; Hundreds Protest"}, "article_summary": "Many of the protesters left the town hall when one of the neo-Nazis on stage began a speech.\nThe neo-Nazis had strung a banner across his yard that said, \u201cAnti-racist is code for anti-white.\u201dVarious protest speakers took the mike and denounced the neo-Nazis peacefully, but emphatically.\nLive streaming by Unedited Media showed what looked like several hundred people participating in the protest that began around 3 p.m.\nThe protesters gathered around Cobb\u2019s residency where a Nazi flag flew and about a dozen neo-Nazis gathered.\nHe has been promoting Leith on white supremacist websites as a place where others like him could live, take over the city government and fly Nazi flags, the Tribune reported."}
