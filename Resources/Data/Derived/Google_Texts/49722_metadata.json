Known for their seventies hits Love Will Keep Us Together and Muskrat Love, Toni Tennille, 73, filed for divorce from musical mate Daryl Dragon, 71, in their home state of Arizona after 39 years of marriage. Among the legal documents pertaining to the pending divorce was a notice dealing with health care. In 2009, Tennille blogged that her husband had been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease. In 2011, she said that her husband\u2019s condition had worsened to the point that he could not go out in public, which has some people speculating that his health-insurance coverage would be better if they split. Despite the divorce announcement, Tennille and Dragon still live together in the same house.\n\nSource: WSJ MarketWatch\n\nSHOE SHINES\n\nDespite his arrest for DUI and other charges, Adidas is standing by Justin Bieber, for the time being.

CBS News has released a preview clip from this Sunday\u2019s edition of 60 Minutes in which Leno admits that walking away from the late-night talkfest wasn\u2019t his call. \u201cIt\u2019s not my decision and I think I probably would have stayed if we didn\u2019t have an extremely qualified, young guy [Jimmy Fallon] ready to jump in.\u201d Leno also said that he hasn\u2019t completely forgiven NBC for pushing him out of the late-night franchise the first time in 2009: \u201cI was blindsided,\u201d he says. \u201c[NBC executives said] \u2018You\u2019re out\u2019 and I went, \u2018Okay\u2019.\u201d Leno\u2019s last episode of The Tonight Show airs February 6.

The helmet company Motoblouz has publicly thanked Hollande for wearing their Dexter helmet en route to his alleged trysts with French actress Julie Gayet. Motoblouz CEO Thomas Thumerelle took out a quarter-page ad in the national news daily Liberation this week to personally thank Hollande. Reads the ad copy: \u201cThank you Mr. President \u2013 for having used our helmet for your personal protection. We salute your choice of a French-made helmet for your scooter outings. And you will find other models on our website for your future escapades. You will also see that we have a collection of women\u2019s jackets, which would make an ideal Valentine\u2019s Day gift.\u201d\n\nSource: France24\n\nMETHOD MAN\n\nActor Aaron Eckhart says he once pretended his child died to help him prepare for an intense film role. The I, Frankenstein star says he employed the dark mental imagery to film the 2010 drama Rabbit Hole, in which he and Nicole Kidman played parents coping with the death of their young son. During an appearance on The Howard Stern Show, Eckhart admitted he even attended support groups for grieving parents. \u201cIt\u2019s very sensitive to go in there, of course it is,\u201d said Eckhart. \u201cThe gathering is very quiet. There\u2019s 10 people, couples. Their children had passed away very recently. You\u2019re sitting in sort of a circle.\u201d For the record, Eckhart has no children in real life.\n\nSource: BANG Showbiz\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.333", "description": "Known for their seventies hits Love Will Keep Us Together and Muskrat Love, Toni Tennille, 73, filed for divorce from musical mate Daryl Dragon, 71, in their home state of Arizona after 39 years of marriage.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=429228415", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "Known for their seventies hits Love Will Keep Us Together and Muskrat Love, Toni Tennille, 73, filed for divorce from musical mate Daryl Dragon, 71, in their home state of Arizona after 39 years of marriage.", "title": "Now Trending: Captain and Tennille\u2019s divorce: Is Obamacare responsible for the split?", "url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/celebrity-news/the-a-list/now-trending-captain-and-tennilles-divorce-is-obamacare-responsible-for-the-split/article16485987/", "image": {"width": 400, "secure_url": "https://sec.images.theglobeandmail.com/media/www/images/flag/gam-square.png", "type": "image/png", "identifier": "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/6eb/life/celebrity-news/the-a-list/article16485986.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/lf-web-Tennille-Divorce.JPG", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "tgam://article/16485987", "iphone": "tgam://article/16485987"}, "country": "CA", "name": {"ipad": "The Globe And Mail", "iphone": "The Globe And Mail"}, "id": {"ipad": 429228415, "iphone": 429228415}}, "description": "Known for their seventies hits Love Will Keep Us Together and Muskrat Love, Toni Tennille, 73, filed for divorce from musical mate Daryl Dragon, 71, in their home state of Arizona after 39 years of marriage.", "account_id": 1512948019, "card": "app", "site": "@globeandmail"}, "robots": "noarchive", "last-modified": "2014-01-24 11:48:16 EST", "fb": {"app_id": 126045934076200}, "location": "Canada", "application-contextName": "globeandmail", "keywords": "Justin Bieber;Toni Tennille;Selena Gomez;Aaron Eckhart;Daryl Dragon;Jimmy Fallon;Dr. Dre;Jay Leno;Barack Obama;CBS Corporation;divorce;source;helmet;tennille;interview;motorcycle helmet manufacturer;endorsement contracts;parents coping;actress thrust;divorce announcement;", "article": {"engagement": "true", "type": "blog", "id": 16485987, "comments": "false", "pages": 1}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "identifier-URL": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd524\"", "article_summary": "Despite the divorce announcement, Tennille and Dragon still live together in the same house.\nTHE BIG SPLITWas Obamacare responsible for the breakup of Captain and Tennille?\nAmong the legal documents pertaining to the pending divorce was a notice dealing with health care.\nSource: WSJ MarketWatchSHOE SHINESDespite his arrest for DUI and other charges, Adidas is standing by Justin Bieber, for the time being.\nReads the ad copy: \u201cThank you Mr. President \u2013 for having used our helmet for your personal protection."}
