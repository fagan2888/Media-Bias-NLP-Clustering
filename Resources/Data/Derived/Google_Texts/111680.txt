JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Prince Harry has named the buildings of a new children's center in Lesotho after the two most important women in his life — his mother and his nanny.

Britain's Press Association said Harry opened the Mamohato Children's Centre on Thursday, along with Lesotho's Prince Seeiso.

The Press Association said the center's dining hall is named after the prince's late mother Princess Diana. The welcome block, in part designed by Harry, is named after his late nanny, Olga Powell.

Reports said the prince described the center as a "milestone" in the work of the charity organization he founded with the Lesotho prince in 2006.

According to its website, the Sentebale charity helps HIV positive minors and children orphaned by AIDS in the southern African country.
