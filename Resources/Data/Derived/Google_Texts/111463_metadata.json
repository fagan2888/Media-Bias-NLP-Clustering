From common core, to the 3rd grade reading test, and now for the battle of Initiative 42. Lauderdale County Superintendent Randy Hodges says these challenges are good for the public school system, as they have been demanding and schools have been able to move forward.\n\n\"Mississippi is going to be only as good as public education is,\" said Hodges. \"Public education is important, to the point that we need everybody supporting educators when it comes to public education. We have our challenges, common core was a tremendous challenge.\"\n\nHodges says that for schools to continue to provide adequate education along with the best teachers, more funding is going to have to flow into the hallways of many schools.\n\n\"Legislators must realize, both Republicans and Democrats, both parties, that we must have more support when it comes to funding,\" Hodges stated. \"Facilities, classrooms, resources, teacher salaries, I could go on and on, but we've got to have more help.\"\n\nHodges says it is a challenge to keep teachers not only in Lauderdale County, but across the state, because of pay and that funding is the key to make education the backbone that it needs to be.\n\n\"It's a must that we regroup. We all need to work together and have a better Mississippi,\" said Hodges. \"I think we can do it, but I think we need some goals.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Lauderdale County Superintendent Randy Hodges says schools in Mississippi have to receive more funding", "language": "english", "author": "Aaron Morrison", "og": {"description": "Lauderdale County Superintendent Randy Hodges says schools in Mississippi have to receive more funding", "title": "The Battle for Better Education in Mississippi", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/The-Battle-for-Better-Education-in-Mississippi-331942091.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/2CC/261/2CC2618C8AAD4D9483E49281B948C236", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/F9F/BCC/F9FBCCAAF4D6431EA572D90A5F8C2082.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Lauderdale County Superintendent Randy Hodges says schools in Mississippi have to receive more funding", "title": "The Battle for Better Education in Mississippi", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/The-Battle-for-Better-Education-in-Mississippi-331942091.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/se+middle+school.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "The Battle for Better Education in Mississippi", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "The Battle for Better Education"}, "article_summary": "\"Public education is important, to the point that we need everybody supporting educators when it comes to public education.\nThe battle for better education in the state of Mississippi has been an ongoing topic for several years.\n\"Mississippi is going to be only as good as public education is,\" said Hodges.\n\"Legislators must realize, both Republicans and Democrats, both parties, that we must have more support when it comes to funding,\" Hodges stated.\nWe all need to work together and have a better Mississippi,\" said Hodges."}
