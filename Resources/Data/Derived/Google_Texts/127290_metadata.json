In response, the hospital filed a lawsuit to appoint a limited legal guardian and strip the girl\u2019s parents of their right to make medical decisions for their daughter. A few days before an appellate court granted the hospital\u2019s application, Sarah and her parents traveled to a natural treatment center in Central America, where she received holistic substitutes for conventional therapies. The family has been in hiding ever since.\n\nSarah\u2019s parents argue that the two-year chemotherapy program is unnatural, and that its curative capacity founders on the harsh side effects. The drugs, they say, will only make their daughter sick. \"We've seen how sick it makes her,\" her father, Andy Hershberger, told reporters in August \"Our belief is the natural stuff will do just as much as that stuff if it's God's will.\"\n\n\u201cIf we do chemotherapy and she would happen to die, she would probably suffer more than if we would do it this way and she would happen to die,\u201d he added.\n\nBut the hospital assert that without the treatment, Sarah\u2019s chances of survival will be dismal. Her parents\u2019 proposed alternatives, which all fall well outside the parameters of conventional oncological care, will imperil her prognosis and undo the treatment she has so far received, hospital officials say. \u201cWhile the short-term side effects like nausea, lack of energy and loss of hair, and the potential long-term side effects like organ damage and infertility, cannot be minimized, the question of her treatment is life and death,\u201d Akron Children\u2019s Hospital wrote in its complaint. \u201cThe plan presented by her parents is almost certain to lead to her death.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to ABC News, Sarah\u2019s attorney, Maurice Thompson, said that although the parents risk being held in contempt of court for failing to comply with the order, they are ultimately exercising a moral right. \"It's the constitutional right, but [there's a] moral right to refuse conventional medical treatment,\" he told reporters. \"Sarah's condition has gotten a lot better since the family has been pursuing the alternative treatment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "amish girl cancer hiding, akron children's hospital, lymphoblastic lymphoma, chemotherapy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "11-year-old Sarah Hershberger and her family have been in hiding since an appellate court ordered them to resume chemotherapy.", "title": "Amish Girl With Cancer In Hiding To Avoid Chemotherapy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/amish-girl-cancer-hiding-avoid-chemotherapy-11-year-old-sarah-hershbergers-parents-disregard-264106", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/01/amish.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "11-year-old Sarah Hershberger and her family have been in hiding since an appellate court ordered them to resume chemotherapy.", "title": "Amish Girl With Cancer In Hiding To Avoid Chemotherapy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/amish-girl-cancer-hiding-avoid-chemotherapy-11-year-old-sarah-hershbergers-parents-disregard-264106", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/01/amish.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/01/amish.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-12-01T19:27:48-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-01T19:29:21-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "11-year-old Sarah Hershberger and her family have been in hiding since an appellate court ordered them to resume chemotherapy."}, "article_summary": "\"It's the constitutional right, but [there's a] moral right to refuse conventional medical treatment,\" he told reporters.\nSarah\u2019s parents argue that the two-year chemotherapy program is unnatural, and that its curative capacity founders on the harsh side effects.\nBut the hospital assert that without the treatment, Sarah\u2019s chances of survival will be dismal.\nAn 11-year-old Amish girl with cancer has gone into hiding following an Ohio court judgement ordering her to disregard her family\u2019s religious objections and resume the treatment doctors say will save her life.\nIn response, the hospital filed a lawsuit to appoint a limited legal guardian and strip the girl\u2019s parents of their right to make medical decisions for their daughter."}
