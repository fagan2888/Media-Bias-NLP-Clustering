As the city\u2019s population doubled and then doubled again, residents were forced to visit sometimes overwhelmed hospitals in Wildomar or Murrieta or drive to Riverside or San Diego County for treatment. Stories of people dying because they were unable to get to a far-flung hospital in time were common.\n\nIn city elections, one of the first questions asked of a prospective council candidate was what he or she planned to do about the lack of a Temecula hospital.\n\nThat inglorious era \u2013 which was pockmarked by lawsuits, broken promises and a frustrated population of 100,000 \u2013 came to an end when Universal Health Services opened the 140-bed Temecula Valley Hospital on Temecula Parkway, a facility that this month celebrated one year of service.\n\n\u201cThis is a blessing,\u201d said DiLullo, a 75-year-old who was recently treated for heart blockages at the hospital, one of two in the Southwest County region that is authorized to treat severe strokes and heart attacks. \u201cI went in for an out-of-breath experience and ended up getting a triple bypass. They diagnosed it and attended to it immediately.\u201d\n\nDarlene Wetton, the hospital\u2019s CEO, said there are hundreds of other area residents who share DiLullo\u2019s appreciation for the facility, which became the fourth hospital in the region when it opened Oct. 14, 2013.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got letters and letters and emails saying how wonderful it is to have a local hospital,\u201d she said during a recent phone interview. \u201cThe community has embraced us.\u201d\n\nWhen the hospital was initially proposed in the mid-2000s, area politicians were bemoaning a hospital bed shortage. Southwest Healthcare System, operator of Wildomar\u2019s Inland Valley Medical Center and Murrieta\u2019s Rancho Springs Medical Center, responded by bankrolling expansions of both facilities.\n\nIn 2011, Loma Linda University Medical Center opened a 106-bed hospital in northeastern Murrieta.\n\nWith the addition of Temecula Valley Hospital in 2013, there are now plenty of hospital beds for area residents, and Wetton said the supply should be adequate in coming years, which likely will find outpatient medical centers or clinics serving a growing number of people who traditionally have visited a hospital.\n\n\u201cIs every hospital bed full?\u201d she asked rhetorically. \u201cIf they\u2019re not, there are enough beds.\u201d\n\nAccording to Temecula Valley officials, the hospital is running at 35 percent capacity on average. The long-term plans for the facility include the possibility of expansion \u2013 another 140-bed tower could be added \u2013 but Wetton said that won\u2019t be considered until there is a need.\n\nSouthwest spokesman Brian Connors said in a statement the new Temecula hospital has helped meet the growing demands of the surrounding communities.\n\n\u201cOur region combined \u2013 Temecula Valley, Rancho Springs and Inland Valley \u2013 has seen a marked increase in our emergency department visits,\u201d he said.\n\nWetton said the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, has also boosted the number of people who are visiting ERs.\n\nLooking forward, Wetton said she expects the hospital will start to see an increase in the number of patients who have been referred to the facility by friends or family members because of positive patient survey data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about trust and reputation. As soon as you develop a high-quality reputation, that word spreads very quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very different than a lot of industries ... when it comes to your health and safety, the quality of your service has got to be paramount.\u201d\n\nDiLullo said the staffers he interacted with were all friendly and they helped put his mind at ease during a rough time for his body.\n\n\u201cThe personnel there all have a sense of humor and professionalism. ... I really didn\u2019t have any fear.\u201d\n\nContact the writer: aclaverie@pe.com, 951-368-9698, @PE_Claverie", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "sailthru.author": "AARON CLAVERIE", "content_author": "AARON CLAVERIE", "ICBM": "33.948100, -117.396100", "sailthru.tags": "news, hospital, temecula, valley, bed, wetton, dilullo, medical, facility, opened, murrieta", "content_section": "news", "content_title": "TEMECULA: Long-awaited hospital celebrates first birthday", "geo.position": "33.948100;-117.396100", "author": "AARON CLAVERIE", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2014-10-25 15:32:12", "sailthru.title": "TEMECULA: Long-awaited hospital celebrates first birthday", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/ne0upv-b88232088z.120141025153212000gfb5rlnu.10.jpg", "geo.placename": "Riverside", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/ne0upv-b88232088z.120141025153212000gfb5rlnu.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "publication_date": "2014-10-25", "Description": "News: TEMECULA: Long-awaited hospital celebrates first birthday | hospital, temecula, valley, bed, wetton, dilullo, medical, facility, opened, murrieta", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "News: TEMECULA: Long-awaited hospital celebrates first birthday | hospital, temecula, valley, bed, wetton, dilullo, medical, facility, opened, murrieta", "title": "TEMECULA: Long-awaited hospital celebrates first birthday", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/ne0upv-b88232088z.120141025153212000gfb5rlnu.10.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/hospital-752760-temecula-valley.html", "type": "article"}, "Keywords": "hospital, temecula, valley, bed, wetton, dilullo, medical, facility, opened, murrieta", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/ne0upv-b88232088z.120141025153212000gfb5rlnu.10.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Southwest spokesman Brian Connors said in a statement the new Temecula hospital has helped meet the growing demands of the surrounding communities.\nIn city elections, one of the first questions asked of a prospective council candidate was what he or she planned to do about the lack of a Temecula hospital.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not, there are enough beds.\u201dAccording to Temecula Valley officials, the hospital is running at 35 percent capacity on average.\n\u201cOur region combined \u2013 Temecula Valley, Rancho Springs and Inland Valley \u2013 has seen a marked increase in our emergency department visits,\u201d he said.\nSouthwest Healthcare System, operator of Wildomar\u2019s Inland Valley Medical Center and Murrieta\u2019s Rancho Springs Medical Center, responded by bankrolling expansions of both facilities."}
