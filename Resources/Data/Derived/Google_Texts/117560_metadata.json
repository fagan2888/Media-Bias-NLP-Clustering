Specifically, 22 states have decided not to go along with the Affordable Care Act's provisions for expanding Medicaid coverage to their poorest residents.\n\nMedicaid expansion will kick in January 1. So far, its uneven rollout is disproportionately affecting minorities, a higher percentage of whom qualify for the federally funded coverage. As the authors of a recent report by the Kaiser Family Foundation explain, \"People of color make up the majority of uninsured individuals with incomes below the Medicaid expansion limit in both states moving forward and not moving forward with the expansion at this time.\" (The 2012 Supreme Court decision that spared Obamacare turned Medicaid expansion into a state-by-state decision.)\n\nUnder Obamacare, states may offer Medicaid coverage to anyone whose income is at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty line. (The poverty line is currently $11,490 for one person and $19,530 for a family of three.) By that benchmark, 25 million Americans without health insurance are now eligible for expanded Medicaid coverage. Of those, 59 percent are people of color.\n\nHowever, nearly half of the people of color who might enroll in Medicaid live in states that currently are not expanding coverage.\n\nWhile 47 percent of whites now eligible for the Medicaid expansion live in states that are not increasing coverage, 60 percent of eligible blacks and 53 percent of eligible Hispanics do.\n\nIn the states that do not offer the new Medicaid coverage, Kaiser predicts that \"poor, uninsured adults will not gain a new coverage option and likely remain uninsured.\"\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nFront page image: iQoncept/Shutterstock", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "By rejecting Medicaid expansion, 22 states are leaving millions of Americans\u2014mostly people of color\u2014out in the cold.", "title": "How Republicans blocked a key Obamacare benefit\u2014without the shutdown", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/10/charts-obamacare-medicaid-expansion-states-race", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/rejected425x320.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "How Republicans blocked a key Obamacare benefit\u2014without the shutdown", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/10/charts-obamacare-medicaid-expansion-states-race", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/rejected425x320.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/rejected425x320.jpg"}, "creator": "daudig", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Health+Care,Race+and+Ethnicity,Top+Stories", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f26\"", "article_summary": "Under Obamacare, states may offer Medicaid coverage to anyone whose income is at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty line.\n(The 2012 Supreme Court decision that spared Obamacare turned Medicaid expansion into a state-by-state decision.)\nMedicaid expansion will kick in January 1.\nSpecifically, 22 states have decided not to go along with the Affordable Care Act's provisions for expanding Medicaid coverage to their poorest residents.\nBy that benchmark, 25 million Americans without health insurance are now eligible for expanded Medicaid coverage."}
