Eric cantor is at right.\n\nIn public, the White House has greeted this week\u2019s ouster of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor with no hint of lament, as President Barack Obama deemed the stunning defeat of a top Republican an \u201cinteresting election.\u201d\n\nBut in private, Vice President Joe Biden reached out to Mr. Cantor the day after the primary, a White House official confirmed.\n\nThe response to the majority leader\u2019s downfall \u2013 much like the White House\u2019s relationship with the Virginia Republican \u2013 has been nuanced.\n\nThe president and Mr. Cantor have clashed frequently, concurring on little and offering dueling versions of their conversations that played out behind closed doors. But despite their intense disagreements, the two continued to talk. And for his part, Mr. Biden sometimes helped smooth interactions between the White House and the majority leader.\n\nThe complexities of the Obama-Cantor relationship were on display in April when the two stood together at the White House as the president signed a pediatric research bill that the majority leader had championed. Two weeks later, Messrs. Obama and Cantor were sparring over a phone call, providing conflicting accounts of who said what.\n\nThe president described it as a pleasant conversation that started with a wish for a happy Passover and segued to talk about immigration laws. Mr. Cantor put out a statement chiding Mr. Obama and saying that the president does not know how to work with Congress.\n\n\u201cYou do not attack the very people you hope to engage in a serious dialogue,\u201d Mr. Cantor said.\n\nThe incident was just one of several skirmishes that played out in public as the president and Mr. Cantor wrangled with a long list of issues. In 2010, Mr. Obama complained when Mr. Cantor brought a copy of the more than 2,000-page Democratic health care bill and sat behind the pile of paper during a bipartisan summit.\n\nThe president said health care is complicated and suggested that Mr. Cantor was using the lengthy document as a prop.\n\nAlthough the president and the majority leader found little common ground over the years, Mr. Obama pledged early on to continue trying.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep on talking to Eric Cantor,\u201d Mr. Obama said in 2009. \u201cSome day, sooner or later, he is going to say, \u2018Boy, Obama had a good idea.\u2019\u201d\n\nTheir relationship hit a low point in 2011 during negotiations to raise the debt ceiling. Mr. Cantor said the president stormed out of a meeting at the White House \u2013 a characterization that Democrats disputed.\n\nA few months later, signs of a thaw with the White House emerged as Mr. Biden and Jill Biden invited Mr. Cantor and his wife for a \u201cpersonal\u201d dinner at the Naval Observatory.\n\nLast year, Mr. Cantor wrote an essay about the vice president for Time magazine\u2019s list of the 100 most influential people.\n\n\u201cThe best way to find solutions and common ground is to build personal relationships based on trust,\u201d Mr. Cantor wrote. \u201cNo one in Washington understands this better than Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nWhile Messrs. Obama and Cantor had their ups and downs, their negotiations often were serious and substantive, said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cConstraints on both sides imposed severe limits on the extent to which these discussions could yield viable compromise,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we now know, Cantor went further than the Tea Party was willing to stomach.\u201d\n\nNow, as many conservatives suggest that the lesson from Mr. Cantor\u2019s defeat is that Republicans should stand even firmer against the White House, it\u2019s not clear whether the lines of communication will remain open once a new majority leader is installed.\n\nStill, the White House has betrayed no qualms about Mr. Cantor\u2019s departure in public comments. A White House official declined to offer details of Mr. Biden\u2019s phone conversation with the majority leader. And White House spokesman Josh Earnest repeated Friday that despite the Republican shake-up, there still should be a path forward for overhauling immigration laws.\n\nDespite the show of confidence, though, some Democrats have noted that the president\u2019s often strained relationship with Mr. Cantor might be better than the alternative.\n\nThe toppling of Mr. Cantor \u201cwill further reduce \u2014 perhaps to zero \u2014 the chances for compromise in the few areas where it might have been possible previously,\u201d Mr. Galston said.\n\nJeffrey Sparshott contributed to this article.\n\nGet more news from Washington, first thing in the morning, by signing up for the Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter: on.wsj.com/CapitalJournalSignup", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The White House's response to the Eric Cantor\u2019s downfall \u2013 much like the White House\u2019s relationship with the Virginia Republican \u2013 has been nuanced.", "title": "Rebukes, Talks Marked Obama-Cantor Relationship", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/06/14/rebukes-talks-marked-obama-cantor-relationship/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DG222_cantor_P_20140614095646.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Rebukes, Talks Marked Obama-Cantor Relationship", "description": "The White House's response to the Eric Cantor\u2019s downfall \u2013 much like the White House\u2019s relationship with the Virginia Republican \u2013 has been nuanced.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Colleen McCain Nelson", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "The White House's response to the Eric Cantor\u2019s downfall \u2013 much like the White House\u2019s relationship with the Virginia Republican \u2013 has been nuanced.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-14T14:08:00-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/06/14/rebukes-talks-marked-obama-cantor-relationship/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-46562", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The White House's response to the Eric Cantor\u2019s downfall \u2013 much like the White House\u2019s relationship with the Virginia Republican \u2013 has been nuanced.", "title": "Rebukes, Talks Marked Obama-Cantor Relationship", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/06/14/rebukes-talks-marked-obama-cantor-relationship/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DG222_cantor_P_20140614095646.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-46562", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-14T14:09:53-04:00"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe best way to find solutions and common ground is to build personal relationships based on trust,\u201d Mr. Cantor wrote.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep on talking to Eric Cantor,\u201d Mr. Obama said in 2009.\n\u201cYou do not attack the very people you hope to engage in a serious dialogue,\u201d Mr. Cantor said.\nDespite the show of confidence, though, some Democrats have noted that the president\u2019s often strained relationship with Mr. Cantor might be better than the alternative.\nAnd for his part, Mr. Biden sometimes helped smooth interactions between the White House and the majority leader."}
