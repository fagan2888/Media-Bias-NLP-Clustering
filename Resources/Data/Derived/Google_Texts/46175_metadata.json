Scientific research has shown that HIIT improves both aerobic and anaerobic fitness, impacts muscle tissue at a cellular level, and produces the same anaerobic and aerobic improvement as cardio in less than half the time. While many workout enthusiasts have been quick to adopt this method of exercise, not all of them truly understand what an HIIT program consists of.\n\nFirst, what exactly is HIIT? Generally, it combines two of the most effective fat-burning methods: maximum effort to achieve muscle fatigue and maximum oxygen use in a quick burst of exercise. A term that commonly gets thrown around when discussing HIIT is VO2 MAX \u2014 the largest amount of oxygen our bodies consume during exercise. Getting our bodies as close to VO2 MAX as possible triggers the afterburn effect, meaning the body continues to consume O2 hours after we\u2019re done working out.\n\nHIIT programs are not all the same. They tend to have different lengths of time for both high- and low-intensity training intervals, different ratios of high- to low-intensity levels, and different levels of intensity during lower-intensity intervals. There are three leading HIIT programs: the Tabata Method, the Little Method, and Turbulence Training. Before you start any HIIT program, find out which one is best for you based on your skill level and the amount of time you can spend on exercise.\n\nby voltiercreative.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "complete, guide, hiit, everything, you, need, know, about, high, intensity, interval, training", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Find out which HIIT program works best for you based on how much time you have to workout and your skill level.", "title": "Everything You Need To Know About High-Intensity Interval Training", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/complete-guide-hiit-everything-you-need-know-about-high-intensity-interval-training-338676", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/06/17/hiit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Find out which HIIT program works best for you based on how much time you have to workout and your skill level.", "title": "Everything You Need To Know About High-Intensity Interval Training", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/complete-guide-hiit-everything-you-need-know-about-high-intensity-interval-training-338676", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/06/17/hiit.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/17/hiit.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-06-17T16:14:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-17T16:14:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Find out which HIIT program works best for you based on how much time you have to workout and your skill level."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfe6\"", "article_summary": "There are three leading HIIT programs: the Tabata Method, the Little Method, and Turbulence Training.\nHIIT programs are not all the same.\nWhile many workout enthusiasts have been quick to adopt this method of exercise, not all of them truly understand what an HIIT program consists of.\nBefore you start any HIIT program, find out which one is best for you based on your skill level and the amount of time you can spend on exercise.\nHigh-Intensity Interval Training has taken the fitness world by storm, and for good reason."}
