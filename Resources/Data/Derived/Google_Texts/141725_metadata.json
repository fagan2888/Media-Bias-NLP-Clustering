While competition is intense in many populous regions, rural areas and small towns have far fewer carriers offering plans in the law\u2019s online exchanges. Those places, many of them poor, are being asked to choose from some of the highest-priced plans in the 34 states where the federal government is running the health insurance marketplaces, a review by The New York Times has found.\n\nThis afternoon, \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d takes another blow. Philip Klein reports that 76,000 of Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s individual market customers will lose their current plan. Now, as the president might say, let me be clear. It was always a lie that everyone could keep your plan if you liked it because Obamacare\u2019s new mandates and \u201cessential health benefits\u201d made it literally impossible and illegal for certain existing plans to continue to exist. So, it wasn\u2019t a matter of opinion or paranoia or mere possibilities of unintended consequences. The fact that you could not keep your plan was in the law, and yet, President Obama got away with saying \u201cIf you like your plan you can keep it,\u201d and calling those who noticed the impossibility \u201cfearmongers.\u201d\n\nFlash forward:\n\nCareFirst BlueCross BlueShield is being forced to cancel plans that currently cover 76,000 individuals in Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., due to changes made by President Obama\u2019s health care law, the company told the Washington Examiner today. That represents more than 40 percent of the 177,000 individuals covered by CareFirst in the states. Though Obama famously promised that those who liked their health care coverage could keep it under his program, in reality the health care law imposes a raft of new regulations on insurance policies starting Jan. 1 that are forcing insurers across the country to terminate existing plans. In theory, rules were supposed to allow pre-existing plans to be \u201cgrandfathered in,\u201d but they were written so narrowly as to leave out many plans. \u201cOf the 177,000 individuals under age 65 who are covered by CareFirst, about 76,000 of them are in a non-grandfathered plan \u2013 a plan that will not comply with the guidelines imposed by the Affordable Care Act at their time of renewal this year or next,\u201d CareFirst said in an email in response to an inquiry by the Examiner.\n\nThe argument of an Obamacare supporter, when confronted with this reality, is to ignore the solemn promise of Obamacare, made so very many times. Instead, they say something along the lines of, \u201cWell, who\u2019d be dumb enough to like a plan like that? Of course those plans aren\u2019t sticking around. They\u2019ll get better plans.\u201d Those \u201cbetter\u201d plans are often more expensive than the plans with low monthly costs and high deductibles many liked and counted on before Obamacare. Some of the people who will lose their plans and be allowed to buy \u201cbetter\u201d plans may not be eligible for subsidies. And, even if they are, there\u2019s no telling when they\u2019ll be able to find that out on the federal or state exchanges which are, to use a technical term, still a total Charlie Foxtrot.\n\nLike this Missouri man, whose family is learning Obamacare\u2019s not going to help them at all. He\u2019s also a Blue Cross Blue Shield customer:\n\nThe Free Beacon is keeping good track of the personal and local stories of the havoc Obamacare is wreaking. When it comes to breaking its promises, the legislation is indeed more than just a website. Texans gripe about rising costs while an Indiana hospital is forced to let go hundreds to bring its cost of care into compliance and stay above water.\n\nAnd, no, the call centers and in-person sign-ups were never meant to substitute for the website and won\u2019t be able to serve you, as Matt Lewis reported:\n\nIn recent days, Petno has noted that it\u2019s a 10-step process to obtain health care coverage, and that the operators can\u2019t even give you a specific timeframe for when they will even respond (other than to say you will have a chance to enroll by January 1). Most importantly, they won\u2019t even give you a specific quote for your health insurance over the phone (though there is a rough estimator on the website.) So the notion that you can actually easily sign up for health care coverage by calling the 1-800 number seems to be overstated. \u201cThe phone call is Rube Goldberg 2.0,\u201d Petno tells me during a phone interview.\n\nKaiser Health News confirms:\n\nIt\u2019s 10 a.m. Monday inside the call center of Connecticut\u2019s new insurance exchange established under the federal health law. On the 21st floor of the downtown Prudential Building, about 25 operators in blue shaded cubicles are talking on telephone headsets while a dozen more callers wait on hold. \u201cIt\u2019s controlled chaos,\u201d said David Lynch, the call center manager for the marketplace. Centers like these were touted by President Barack Obama this week as one of several alternatives for consumers having trouble shopping and enrolling in plans through healthcare.gov, the bug-ridden website run by the federal government for residents of 36 states. \u201cThe call centers are available,\u201d he said, reciting the telephone number \u2014 1-800-318-2596. \u201cYou can talk to somebody directly and they can walk you through the application process\u2026Once you get on the phone with a trained representative, it usually takes about 25 minutes for an individual to apply for coverage, about 45 minutes for a family.\u201d But consumer advocates say the centers were never meant to be an alternative to the insurance exchange website. They were conceived of as a supplement \u2013 a way to offer some consumers more help to understand their options. \u201cThe telephone call center is not a realistic alternative to the website,\u201d said Adam Linker, health policy analyst for the North Carolina Justice Center, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cThe marketplace was billed as a place to easily shop and compare plans, but on the phone there is no real way to do that.\u201d\n\nIf only Obamacare could do anything else as efficiently as it breaks its promises.\n\nOh, there\u2019s another one.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Broken promises.", "title": "CareFirst says 76,000 of its customers will lose plans because of Obamacare", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/10/24/carefirst-says-76000-of-its-customers-will-lose-plans-because-of-obamacare/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-25T00:41:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-25T01:42:14+00:00"}, "keywords": "call centers, exchanges, healthcare.gov, Individual Mandate, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5dd1\"", "article_summary": "So the notion that you can actually easily sign up for health care coverage by calling the 1-800 number seems to be overstated.\nPhilip Klein reports that 76,000 of Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s individual market customers will lose their current plan.\nThey\u2019ll get better plans.\u201d Those \u201cbetter\u201d plans are often more expensive than the plans with low monthly costs and high deductibles many liked and counted on before Obamacare.\nKaiser Health News confirms:It\u2019s 10 a.m. Monday inside the call center of Connecticut\u2019s new insurance exchange established under the federal health law.\nSome of the people who will lose their plans and be allowed to buy \u201cbetter\u201d plans may not be eligible for subsidies."}
