In the legislative flurry before Congress broke for summer vacation, bipartisan legislation was introduced that would provide nondiscrimination relief to frozen pension plans.

Reps. Pat Tiberi, R-Ohio, and Richard Neal, D-Mass., both on the House Ways and Means Committee, cosponsored the bill, which would provide that frozen pension plans were in compliance with nondiscrimination or minimum participation requirements so long as the plan was in compliance when it was closed to new enrollees.
