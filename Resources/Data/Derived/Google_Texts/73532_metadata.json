Even though he has only five years of organized basketball experience, the 7-foot center went into Saturday night\u2019s exhibition game against the Los Angeles Clippers in Las Vegas ranked sixth in the NBA in rebounds, averaging 9.4 per game.\n\nNurkic is one part of a rookie duo \u2014 20-year-old Gary Harris, the other \u2014 that is showing flashes of becoming the players the Nuggets hope they can be.\n\n\u201cThey are pretty mature,\u201d said Denver forward Danilo Gallinari. \u201cThey know how to play basketball already; the IQ is at a good level.\u201d\n\nHarris, a 6-foot-4 guard from Michigan State, has had an up-and-down preseason, like Nurkic \u2014 good in some spots, suspect in others, but full of promise.\n\nA first-round draft pick, Harris arrived as much more of a known quantity. During the summer, rookie peers in the NBA voted him among the most undervalued players in this year\u2019s draft class. They know Harris as an effective defensive specialist at Michigan State, with a catch-and-shoot offensive game. They\u2019re sure he will turn out to be more than that with the Nuggets.\n\nBut the first thing Harris has to learn is the NBA game, as does Nurkic.\n\nBoth had butterflies in their first preseason game. Nurkic\u2019s showed up more than Harris\u2019, and the big man was so distraught about his performance afterward that he wept and apologized profusely to his teammates. He made amends by grabbing 15 rebounds in his next game.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, just wanted to slow himself down.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m playing too fast,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to let the game come to me, just get more comfortable.\u201d\n\nHarris has averaged about 21 minutes per game in the preseason, while Nurkic has averaged just under 20. Going into Saturday\u2019s game against the Clippers, Harris was averaging 7.4 points and shooting 35.7 percent from the 3-point line. In addition to his rebounding prowess, Nurkic was averaging 6.8 points and one block per game.\n\n\u201cThey just want to see us play hard and continue to get better,\u201d Harris said. \u201cContinue to learn and try to get better and do whatever they ask.\u201d\n\nHarris is projected to back up Arron Afflalo and Randy Foye at shooting guard, while Nurkic went into camp as the third-string center behind Timofey Mozgov and JaVale McGee. McGee, though, has yet to start practicing full time as he recovers from surgery to correct a stress fracture in his tibia. The Nuggets are quietly getting Nurkic ready to be the backup center should McGee not be ready when the season starts Oct. 29.\n\nNurkic has lost some weight during camp and is now at around 290 pounds, with a physical game to match.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just say he\u2019s a rookie and he\u2019s not going to play,\u201d Mozgov said. \u201cHe wants to play and he\u2019s going to show the coach and show everybody he wants to play. He will go hard.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jusuf Nurkic, Gary Harris have looked like keepers", "title": "Jusuf Nurkic, Gary Harris have looked like keepers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/18/jusuf-nurkic-gary-harris-have-looked-like-keepers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141018__20141019_CC4_SP19BKNNUGSp1.jpg", "height": 463}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141018__20141019_CC4_SP19BKNNUGSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-18T19:42:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:30:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3dd\"", "article_summary": "But the first thing Harris has to learn is the NBA game, as does Nurkic.\nBoth had butterflies in their first preseason game.\nNurkic is one part of a rookie duo \u2014 20-year-old Gary Harris, the other \u2014 that is showing flashes of becoming the players the Nuggets hope they can be.\nGoing into Saturday\u2019s game against the Clippers, Harris was averaging 7.4 points and shooting 35.7 percent from the 3-point line.\nNurkic has lost some weight during camp and is now at around 290 pounds, with a physical game to match."}
