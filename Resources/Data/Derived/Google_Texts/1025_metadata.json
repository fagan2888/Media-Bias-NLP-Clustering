I\u2019ll offer one very remote option presently, but on the surface, it seems like horrendously bad news more than anything else. Sure, Boehner\u2019s hardly been a ally of the Democratic Party during his tenure. Given who\u2019s waiting in the on-deck circle, however, it might be smart to jam the corks back in the champagne bottles and hold off on the onslaught of celebratory Facebook memes.\n\nThe irony of Boehner\u2019s ouster, following pressure from Tea Party extremists in his caucus, is that he\u2019s done their bidding at just about every turn, obstructing the president\u2019s agenda while, for example, presiding over 50 successful-yet-pointless votes to repeal Obamacare. He presided over the de-funding of ACORN, based on fraudulent videos, and, most recently, he presided over yet another vote to de-fund Planned Parenthood, coincidentally based on an entire series of provably deceptive videos.\n\nIndeed, the House of Representatives under John Boehner has been one of the most radically obstructionist congresses in generations. There\u2019s simply no calculus in any universe to suggest that Boehner hasn\u2019t been, at the end of the day, a royal pain in the ass to the Obama administration, going all the way back to the stimulus debate and especially during the crafting of the Affordable Care Act when Boehner famously stood on the floor of the House and declared \u201cHell no!\u201d to the passage of the law.\n\nTo review: Boehner is rabidly anti-choice, ranked with zero percent by NARAL; he\u2019s anti-same-sex-marriage, voting \u201cyes\u201d on an anti-LGBT marriage amendment; he\u2019s vocally pro-gun, winning an \u201cA\u201d grade by the National Rifle Association; he supports a border fence and he supports English as our official language; he\u2019s anti-tax, anti-Iran-deal, anti-science, anti-Obamacare, and he\u2019s generally anti-Obama.\n\nThe problem, however, is that John Boehner isn\u2019t a political zealot, at least in contrast with the new wave of fire-eating Republicans that emerged seven years ago. Ever since the GOP legitimized and absorbed the Tea Party, empowering the buggy-eyed newcomers and dooming itself to the whimsy of political lightweights, Boehner\u2019s party has become an incoherent, uncivilized mess \u2014 far worse than it has been at any other time in recent memory. Boehner did his best to pander to the Tea Party, giving its leadership the scalps they demanded and generally allowing them to make the entire caucus look ridiculous. What\u2019s clear, though, is that as vigorously anti-choice as Boehner is, he simply refused to go along with the Tea Party on shutting down the government based on deceptively-edited videos (which, by the way, are rapidly being proven as hooey by more than a half-dozen state investigations).\n\nBoehner\u2019s behind-the-scenes opposition to a Planned Parenthood-based shutdown evidently makes Boehner a RINO. Or a traitor. Or an Obama loyalist. Worse, Boehner hasn\u2019t been loath to meet with Obama at the White House or to knock some golf balls around with the president in the spirit of, at the very least, collegiality, even if legislative cooperation has been consistently sparse. Such cooperative behavior led Ted Cruz to reportedly suggest that Boehner, upon his resignation, will \u201cpresumably land in a cushy K Street job after joining with the D\u2019s to implement all of President O\u2019s priorities.\u201d So, then, even though Boehner has done next-to-nothing to implement any of Obama\u2019s priorities, Cruz believes that he\u2019s such an Obama loyalist that he\u2019ll spend his retirement helping the Obama White House via lobbying activities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Boehner is on the way out, which means the extremist faction of the GOP is on the way up VIDEO", "author": "Bob Cesca", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "John Boehner is on the way out, which means the extremist faction of the GOP is on the way up VIDEO", "title": "\u201cCrazies have taken over the party\u201d: Why even Republicans are worried about John Boehner\u2019s ouster", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/28/crazies_have_taken_over_the_party_why_even_republicans_are_worried_about_john_boehners_ouster/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/health-overhaul-qampa.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Boehner is on the way out, which means the extremist faction of the GOP is on the way up VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/health-overhaul-qampa.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "title": "\u201cCrazies have taken over the party\u201d: Why even Republicans are worried about John Boehner\u2019s ouster", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cCrazies have taken over the party\u201d: Why even Republicans are worried about John Boehner\u2019s ouster", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Government shutdown, House of Representatives, John Boehner, The Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The problem, however, is that John Boehner isn\u2019t a political zealot, at least in contrast with the new wave of fire-eating Republicans that emerged seven years ago.\nIndeed, the House of Representatives under John Boehner has been one of the most radically obstructionist congresses in generations.\nBoehner did his best to pander to the Tea Party, giving its leadership the scalps they demanded and generally allowing them to make the entire caucus look ridiculous.\nSure, Boehner\u2019s hardly been a ally of the Democratic Party during his tenure.\nEver since the GOP legitimized and absorbed the Tea Party, empowering the buggy-eyed newcomers and dooming itself to the whimsy of political lightweights, Boehner\u2019s party has become an incoherent, uncivilized mess \u2014 far worse than it has been at any other time in recent memory."}
