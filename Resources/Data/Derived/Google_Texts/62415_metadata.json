(Editor\u2019s note: Answer: Yes.) It is easily one of the most important books published in 2014 and certainly one of the most important I have ever read.\n\nProfessor Hamburger has graciously taken time out from his vacation to comment at our request on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision earlier this week in Michigan v. EPA. Professor Hamburger writes:\n\nWhatever you think of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions, the really seismic constitutional development that is rumbling underneath them is not Obamacare, marriage, or the environment, but a reconsideration of Chevron. What is Chevron? And why does it matter?\n\nChevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council was a 1984 Supreme Court case that greatly expanded the power of administrative agencies. For three decades, it has required judges, where a statute is ambiguous, to put aside their own judgment of what the statute means and, instead, defer to any reasonable interpretation by an administrative agency that administers the statute. This has been a cornerstone of administrative power, for it allows agencies to legislate under the guise of interpretation. No wonder that so much administrative power these days comes in the form of \u201cinterpretation\u201d! And no wonder that administrative power has expanded far beyond any specific congressional intent!\n\nThis week\u2019s writing on the wall \u2014 or at least what one can read between the lines \u2014 does not bode well for Chevron deference. When the Supreme Court upheld the IRS\u2019s interpretation of Obamacare in King v. Burwell, it did not rely on Chevron. The government asked the Court to apply Chevron deference, but the Court exercised its own judgment about what the statute meant, and this already was interesting, for it suggested that the Court was unwilling to uphold so significant an agency interpretation under Chevron. Four days later, when the Court rejected the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Air Act in Michigan v. EPA, it relied on Chevron, but only to reject the agency interpretation.\n\nTopping it off was Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence. Justice Thomas has repeatedly distinguished himself by speaking honestly about the deep constitutional problems that face the Supreme Court, and his concurrence observed that the EPA\u2019s \u201crequest for deference raises serious questions about the constitutionality of our broader practice of deferring to agency interpretations of federal statutes.\u201d\n\nThomas notes that, under Chevron, agencies could be viewed as lawmakers or as authoritative interpreters, and \u201c[e]ither way, Chevron deference raises serious separation-of-powers questions.\u201d The Constitution vests its legislative powers in Congress and the judicial power in the courts, consisting of judges. And this has consequences. On the one hand, if Chevron allows authoritative agency interpretation, it takes from the judges their constitutional duty to exercise independent judgment, including their duty to interpret \u2014 what Chief Justice John Marshall in Marbury v. Madison called the \u201cduty . . . to say what the law is.\u201d On the other hand, if Chevron allows agency lawmaking, it collides with Congress\u2019s legislative power, for it gives the force of law to \u201cagency pronouncements on matters of private conduct as to which Congress did not actually have an intent.\u201d\n\nThomas concludes that \u201cwe seem to be straying further and further from the Constitution without so much as pausing to ask why. We should stop to consider that document before blithely giving the force of law to any other agency \u2018interpretations\u2019 of federal statutes.\u201d\n\nIndeed, what really is at stake here is not simply the Constitution, but the very legitimacy of the federal judiciary. Whatever their failings in departing from the Constitution, federal judges generally enjoy the reputation of being unbiased. But what if, in fact, they are systematically biased in favor of the government? Of course, this is not to say they are personally biased, but Chevron forces them to engage in institutional bias. This is the allegation of my essay \u201cChevron Bias.\u201d It points out that in their Chevron deference, the judges have abandoned their duty of independent judgment. It adds that where the government is a party to a case (as in Michigan v. EPA), Chevron requires the judges to favor one of the parties \u2014 the most powerful of parties. This is systematic prejudice, and it delegitimizes the entire judiciary.\n\nThis is why Chevron is in play. Many judges, on the Supreme Court and below, are becoming deeply concerned about Chevron, lest it require them to give up their independent judgment and even become systematically biased.\n\nFor more about these problems, read my \u201cChevron Bias\u201d essay by clicking here (and then hitting the download button). Administrative power is utterly corrupting, and because Chevron has institutionally corrupted the judiciary, at least some of the justices are beginning to have buyer\u2019s remorse.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Philip Hamburger is the Maurice and Hilda Friedman Professor of Law at Columbia Law School and the author, most recently, of Is Administrative Law Unlawful?
