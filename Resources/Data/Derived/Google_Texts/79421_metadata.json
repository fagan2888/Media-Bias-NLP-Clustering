The press release reads: House Republicans have pledged to continue making the American people\u2019s priorities \u2013 jobs and the economy \u2013 our priorities and are wasting no time getting started, kicking off the first week of the new American Congress with action on three bipartisan jobs bills. Here\u2019s a look at what they are, and how they\u2019ll help more Americans find work: Hire More Heroes Act: The president\u2019s health care law \u201cis prompting many\u201d small businesses \u201cto hold off on hiring and even to shed jobs in some cases,\u201d CNBCreports. The Hire More Heroes Act will help by exempting veterans who are \u201calready enrolled in healthcare plans through the Department of Defense or the VA from being counted toward the employee limit under the health care law,\u201d the bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Rodney Davis (R-IL), explained in this week\u2019s Republican Address. \u201cSo not only are we providing small businesses \u2013 and our economy \u2013 with much-needed relief, but we\u2019re also helping more of our veterans find work.\u201d Save American Workers Act: Thousands of workers have seen their hours and wages slashed thanks to ObamaCare\u2019s employer mandate that forces businesses to hold hours down to 30 per week or face a penalty. Women and low-income workers are particularly hard hit by the mandate, according to an analysis by the Hoover Institution, which found that the 30-hour rule puts 2.6 million Americans earning less than $30,000 a year - 63% of whom are women \u2013 at risk of having their hours and their wages cut. The Save American Workers Act restores the traditional 40-hour work week to protect these workers and help our economy grow. Approving the Keystone Pipeline: President Obama has stood in the way of thewidely-popular Keystone pipeline for more than six years, putting his own political interests ahead of thousands of jobs and increased energy security for the American people. The House will once again act where the president has not and approve the Keystone pipeline, keeping the pressure on the White House to finally move forward with what one labor union calls a \u201clifeline\u201d for American workers.\n\nDaniel Halper\n\nhttp://cdn.weeklystandard.biz/cache/280x280-.jpg", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Daniel Halper", "og": {"url": "http://www.weeklystandard.com/gop-house-kicks-off-new-congress-with-jobs-bills/article/822730", "site_name": "Weekly Standard", "type": "article", "description": "The office of House speaker John Boehner announces it's kicking off the new Congress with a series of jobs bills.\nThe press release reads:\n\nHouse Republicans have&nbsp;pledged&nbsp;to continue making the American people\u2019s priorities \u2013 jobs and the economy \u2013 our priorities and are wasting no time getting started, kicking off the first week of the new American Congress with action on three bipartisan jobs bills.
