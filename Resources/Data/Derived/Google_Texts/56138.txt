Police say a Dallas man celebrating his 21st birthday with his relatives accidentally shot himself and died early Saturday.

The shooting was reported about 1:20 a.m. at a home in the 1500 block of Harlendale Avenue, which is in east Oak Cliff, police spokeswoman Melinda Gutierrez said in an email.

Joseph Perez, who turned 21 on Thursday, started firing a handgun while he was celebrating his birthday with his relatives, Gutierrez said.

She said Perez’s relatives took the gun away from him, but he got it back and accidentally shot himself with it.

He was taken to Methodist Dallas Medical Center, and died about 2 a.m., according to the Dallas County medical examiner’s office.

Gutierrez said detectives believe alcohol was a factor in the shooting.

Police ruled Perez’s death accidental after interviewing family members.
