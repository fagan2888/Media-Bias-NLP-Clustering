Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) criticized Obamacare during a meeting with business leaders Monday, saying the rollout of the health care law is "a mess," according to Patch .

"All of the issues that you have raised show this right now to be a mess," Ayotte told Seacoast business leaders in the meeting.

Ayotte's comment comes as the Obama Administration claims the Obamacare website is on track to work for a "vast majority" of people after weeks of glitches .

HealthCare.gov is greatly improved after more than a month of intense repair work, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama said Sunday.

Software and hardware upgrades put in place since late October have been effective, said Jeffrey Zients, the Obama aide overseeing the repair effort to the online portal for health insurance enrollment in more than 30 states.

"HealthCare.gov on Dec. 1 is night and day from where it was on Oct. 1," when the health insurance exchanges debuted, Zients said during a conference call with reporters Sunday. "While we still have work to do, we've made significant progress with HealthCare.gov working smoothly for the vast majority of consumers." The website can now handle 50,000 users at a time, which was the original goal, and 800,000 visitors a day, he said.
