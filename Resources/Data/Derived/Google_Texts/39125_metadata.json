He claimed it cost his business, his health, and $3 million in legal and accounting fees to fight the ATO in a four-year dispute over a \u201cfalse and reckless assessment\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve destroyed me,\u2019\u2019 Mr Byrt said.\n\n\u201cThey \u00adruined my business, my reputation, and stole my dreams.\u201d\n\nHe said a victory in the Federal Court would be a win for all Australians fighting unfair decisions by the taxman.\n\nThe ATO declined to publicly discuss the multi-million dollar claim, citing privacy \u00adissues. But, in its legal defence, it will argue it did not owe a duty of care and there is no proof of alleged negligence.\n\nThe ATO is under intense scrutiny over botched tax bills, handling of disputes and unfairly imposed penalties.\n\nA Senate Committee and the Inspector-General of Taxation (IGT) head three separate inquiries into a Taxpayer Charter and protection, ATO dispute conduct, and unfair imposition of penalties.\n\nIn July, an IGT \u00adreport found up to 35 per cent of the $4.25 billion in tax penalties over the past three years had been unfairly imposed and later had to be reduced.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stitch-up,\u2019\u2019 Mr Byrt said.\n\n\u201cYou have a go, an average Aussie battler, and the taxman cuts you down. If you try to fight it, to prove they got it wrong, they send you broke.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to sue them and take it on, hammer and tongs.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Townsville identity once presided over an empire of mining tenements, shares, property, earthmoving equipment, and fleets of fishing trawlers, ships, and aircraft. In his claim, the Ansett Resources and Industries Pty Ltd founder said his company was wrongfully wound up in 2010 by a \u201cfalse and reckless assessment\u201d.\n\nThe assessment was later overturned by the ATO in full by an objection which was fully allowed, the claim says, and lodged by the liquidator, KordaMentha Townsville.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, the ATO did not lodge any proof of debt in the disbursement of funds by the liquidator,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThis claim is for the recovery of personal loss by the claimant caused by the actions of the ATO.\u201d\n\nMr Byrt cited loss of assets such as Macair Airlines ($84.6m), Carabella Resources shares ($82m), Kwikship ($4.4m), fishing trawlers ($3.5m), property ($2m), and aircraft ($2.8m) among the total claim.\n\nIt does not include \u201cfinancial compensation for pain and suffering over the past four years as a result of the wrongful and reckless wind-up,\u2019\u2019 the claim said.\n\nMark Chapman of lobby group Taxpayers Australia said civil suits against the tax office were rare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anything on this scale. It is the biggest dollar hit by an individual against the ATO I\u2019ve ever heard of,\u2019\u2019 Mr Chapman said.\n\nHe said most taxpayers did not have the money or stomach for a prolonged fight.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how much coercive power the tax office has if they wish to use it,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "FALLEN tycoon Terry Byrt has filed a 243 million civil lawsuit \u2014 the nations biggest ever \u2014 against the Australian Taxation Office.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/fallen-tycoon-terry-byrt-files-243-million-lawsuit-against-australian-tax-office/news-story/112c3cfc0e75159595ab50808a81565e", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/686246fc711cc82748f594cd5ebfe8b7", "type": "article", "description": "FALLEN tycoon Terry Byrt has filed a $243 million civil lawsuit \u2014 the nation\u2019s biggest ever \u2014 against the Australian Taxation Office.", "title": "Taking on the taxman ... for $243m"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/686246fc711cc82748f594cd5ebfe8b7", "description": "FALLEN tycoon Terry Byrt has filed a $243 million civil lawsuit \u2014 the nation\u2019s biggest ever \u2014 against the Australian Taxation Office.", "site": "@couriermail", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Taking on the taxman ... for $243m"}, "robots": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/112c3cfc0e75159595ab50808a81565e?domain=couriermail.com.au"}, "articleid": "112c3cfc0e75159595ab50808a81565e", "keywords": "tax office, Fallen tycoon, Courier Mail, reckless assessment, civil lawsuit, ordinary taxpayers, financial compensation, tax penalties, multi-million dollar claim, tax bills, legal action, taxman cuts, fishing trawlers, personal loss, mining tenements, civil suits, unfair imposition, unfair decisions, legal defence, alleged negligence, earthmoving equipment, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, Inspector General, Federal Court, Mark Chapman, Terry Byrt, MICHAEL, Jack Tran", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-29T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-11-29T12:00:13.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae5a\"", "article_summary": "FALLEN tycoon Terry Byrt has filed a $243 million civil lawsuit \u2014 the nation\u2019s biggest ever \u2014 against the Australian Taxation Office.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve destroyed me,\u2019\u2019 Mr Byrt said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stitch-up,\u2019\u2019 Mr Byrt said.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how much coercive power the tax office has if they wish to use it,\u201d he said.\nMark Chapman of lobby group Taxpayers Australia said civil suits against the tax office were rare."}
