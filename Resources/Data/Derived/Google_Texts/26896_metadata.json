Peder Zane\n\nLinda and Gary Childs go almost everywhere with their \u201clittle girl.\u201d\n\nThe retirees, from West Boylston, Massachusetts, love to parade 3-year-old Chino down busy streets in her stroller. They take her to restaurants dressed in her fur-lined vest or polo hoodie where \u201cshe sits in her own chair, very polite.\u201d\n\nBut their favorite place may be the seashore, where Chino wears sunglasses and one of her four beach dresses while lounging in a chair embroidered with her name.\n\n\u201cChino gives us so many laughs and so much love,\u201d Linda Childs, a 67-yearold retired schoolteacher, said of the 12-pound Chihuahua-pug mix. \u201cShe just makes everything better.\u201d\n\nThe Childses are unusual in some respects. Retirement remains a time when many Americans move away from things they have to paint, feed or nurture. Only 41 percent of Americans 65 and older live in households with pets, compared with 68 percent of those 45 to 54 and 76 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds, according to a 2014 survey by Mintel, a market research agency.\n\nThe golden years may have less bark, bite and meow, but in the last decade new scientific studies, evolving attitudes about pets and changing family structures have reshaped the relationship between retirees and animals, even if much of the new research is not universally accepted.\n\nErika Ribaudo, a senior adviser at A Place for Mom, which helps about 200,000 families a year find living arrangements for retirees, noted a growing demand for pets by retirees and the willingness of senior living communities to accept them.\n\n\u201cAs recently as 2005 there were very few communities that accepted pets,\u201d Ribaudo said. \u201cNow, probably 40 percent of them are pet-friendly, and that number is growing. Science tells us that pets make people feel so much better, and more clients just don\u2019t want to give up their beloved family member. Today, they don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nFor retirees, smaller is better. Younger pet owners are more likely to own dogs than cats \u2014 by a roughly 60-40 split. This gap begins to narrow with age, so that the 65-and-older crowd is slightly more likely to own cats than dogs.\n\nThere are no definitive statistics on the breeds of dogs favored by various age groups, but the American Kennel Club suggests that less active retirees \u2014 as well as those living in apartments or who travel a lot \u2014 consider smaller breeds like Chihuahuas or Dachshunds. It is easier to trip over smaller dogs, but it is harder for them to knock down their owners.\n\nAs more Americans live alone and families have fewer children, \u201ctheir attachment to pets is deepening,\u201d said Hal Herzog, a psychology professor at Western Carolina University and author of \u201cSome We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat: Why It\u2019s So Hard to Think Straight About Animals.\u201d \u201cThey think of them as people, and they are making greater emotional and financial investments in their pets.\u201d Retiree pet owners seem especially devoted as they buck older Americans\u2019 tendency to give up pets.\n\n\u201cAs boomers become empty nesters, they look for other things to nurture,\u201d said Richard Rosso, a certified financial planner in Houston. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this business for 26 years, and during the last seven to 10 years I have noticed that the retirement dream for many clients is still drinking a pi\u00f1a colada on the beach, but now they see a Lab next to them.\u201d\n\nSince the average U.S. pet owner spends more than $1,600 per year on a dog and $1,100 on a cat, Rosso said, he now includes pet budget lines in his financial plans for retirees.\n\nThe growing belief that pets are not just good, but good for you, may make ownership more appealing to retirees. Some studies find that pet ownership can help reduce blood pressure, triglycerides and cholesterol while increasing one-year survival rates after a heart attack, according to Alan Beck, a researcher who is the director of the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/07/1003141684-FL_SAR_HFconte5.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c40\"", "article_summary": "It is easier to trip over smaller dogs, but it is harder for them to knock down their owners.\nToday, they don\u2019t have to.\u201dFor retirees, smaller is better.\nThe growing belief that pets are not just good, but good for you, may make ownership more appealing to retirees.\nThis gap begins to narrow with age, so that the 65-and-older crowd is slightly more likely to own cats than dogs.\n\u201cAs boomers become empty nesters, they look for other things to nurture,\u201d said Richard Rosso, a certified financial planner in Houston."}
