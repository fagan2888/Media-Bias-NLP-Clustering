People interested in how a proposed peak-period shoulder lane on Interstate 70 near Idaho Springs might work can take a video “tour” of the concept online through Feb. 14.

The Colorado Department of Transportation proposes building the tolled peak period shoulder lane to help ease weekend and holiday congestion on eastbound I-70 between U.S. 40/Empire Junction and the Twin Tunnels in Idaho Springs.

CDOT says it has formed multiple teams of community representatives, special interest groups and local, state and federal agency representatives to provide input on the project, which is proposed to begin this summer and be completed by mid-to-late 2015.

The online meeting, which is available starting Friday, includes videos and animations describing the current traffic conditions as well as how the peak period shoulder lane could benefit travelers.

CDOT says motorists are encouraged to comment on environmental impacts and mitigation solutions for this proposed project, currently in the environmental analysis and design phase.
