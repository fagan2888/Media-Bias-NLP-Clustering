SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Hard-throwing Jairo Diaz, the 24-year-old right-hander on the verge of breaking into the Rockies’ bullpen, will need Tommy John surgery after tearing a ligament in his right elbow, the team said.

Diaz injured his right elbow in a game Saturday. The outlook for him pitching anytime soon was “not good,” according to a major league source. And after double-checking MRI results Sunday afternoon, doctors found a torn ulnar collateral ligament.

“I didn’t feel it pop or anything,” Diaz said Sunday morning. “It just feels weird.”

Diaz said he was worried the injury is serious. He pitched wildly Saturday against San Diego, allowing three runs on three hits. Six batters into the inning, he threw a 97-mph fastball and two 90-mph sliders to Alexei Ramirez. But he followed with eight consecutive balls — and his fastball sank to 86 mph.

“The last hitter, especially, he didn’t look right,” Colorado manager Walt Weiss said.

Colorado acquired Diaz in a trade before the 2015 season with the Los Angeles Angels. He pitched 19 innings in 21 games for the Rockies last season, with a 2.37 ERA. He battled wildness at times, but his 18 strikeouts against six walks seemed promising.

Diaz was set to battle with Scott Oberg, Justin Miller, Miguel Castro and Carlos Estevez for a spot in the bullpen. The elbow reconstruction surgery facing Diaz usually requires 12 to 16 months of recovery and rehabilitation.

The Rockies have another reliever, closer Adam Ottavino, currently recovering from Tommy John surgery after he injured his elbow early last season.
