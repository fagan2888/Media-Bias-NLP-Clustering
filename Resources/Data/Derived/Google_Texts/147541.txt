The final night of the Dick Stull Memorial PRCA Rodeo was on Friday, concluding an action-packed week of rodeos at the Logan County Fair.

While there was no coronation of Ms. Rodeo Logan County this year, the dozens of cowboys and cowgirls, predominately from Colorado — there were 29 Colorado natives that took to the arena on Friday night — provided the evening's highlights.

After a rough first night for bull riders on Thursday where only one participant, Drew Antone, was able to record a clean run; the cowboys treated the fans to a nail-biting finale as four riders complete runs on Friday, with the four scores separated by just three points.

Zeke Mora from Wiggins and Clayton Savage, who competed on Tuesday in the PBR Bull Riding event, each posted runs of 85 to tie for first place.

Jason Blasdel from Fruita finished third with an 83, while Alabama native Josh Carden finished fourth with a score of 82.

New top times were set in Bareback Riding (Blaine Kaufman, 80) and in Saddle Bronc Riding (Cody Martin, 81), while top scores in Barrel Racing (Kelly Yates, 17.28 seconds), Steer Wrestling (Brady Hageman, 4.0), Tie-Down Roping (Calvin Brevik, 8.2), and Team Roping (J.D. Yates and Trey Yates, 5.5) held up from Thursday night's rodeo.

J.D. Yates, a Pueblo native, won All-Around Cowboy, netting him $2,709.
