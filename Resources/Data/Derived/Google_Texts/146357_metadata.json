At least in the case of Social Security.\n\nThe Overton Window \u2014 named for the late Joseph P. Overton of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy \u2014 is the frame through which acceptable options for public policy are viewed at any given time. Options that are outside of the frame (or \u201coutside the box,\u201d to use another metaphor) are deemed unworthy of consideration or mention by the bipartisan establishment, no matter how compelling those options may actually be. The Overton Window tends to be positioned by the owners and bureaucrats of the major media, who tend to share an elite consensus with politicians and the donors who fund them.\n\nUntil recently, in discussions of the future of Social Security the Overton Window was positioned to exclude any discussion of raising, rather than cutting, Social Security benefits. For the last generation, the range of permissible opinion with respect to the program \u2014 which most Americans depend on for nearly all of their income in old age \u2014 ranged from conservatives who wanted to abolish Social Security altogether, to press-anointed \u201cprogressives\u201d and token Democrats who merely wanted to cut Social Security benefits. The option of maintaining scheduled Social Security benefits, and paying for them with higher taxes, was considered unworthy of discussion by the guardians of Overton Orthodoxy, both in the press and in the two major parties. As for expanding Social Security benefits \u2014 why, that\u2019s crazy talk!\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that, within the bipartisan oligarchy, the alleged need to cut Social Security remains the consensus. But the Overton Window has shifted just a little to the left, and the idea of expanding Social Security, hitherto invisible through the frame, is now in the public field of vision.\n\nThe movement of the idea of expanding Social Security \u2014 from lunatic fringe idea to respectable subject of discussion \u2014 has been remarkably swift. For decades there have been a few lonely voices calling for benefits to be expanded, but they were consistently ignored. In recent years, the idea of expanding Social Security benefits has been promoted by the blogger Duncan Black (\u201cAtrios\u201d), the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Social Security Works and others. And in 2012 Sen. Tom Harkin introduced a bill to use a different inflation measure to raise Social Security \u2014 rather than using different measurements of inflation to cut benefits for the elderly, as President Obama and some other centrist Democrats and conservative Republicans had proposed.\n\nMy colleagues Robert Hiltonsmith, Steven Hill, Joshua Friedman and I may have played a small role in shifting the Overton Window in the spring of this year, by publishing \u201cExpanded Social Security: A Plan to Increase Retirement Security for All Americans.\u201d Knowing that our plan failed the test of political realism at the present moment, we proposed a truly radical expansion of Social Security to shock the commentariat into acknowledging the fact that the program is becoming more important to most Americans, thanks to the decline and failure of the other two \u201clegs\u201d of the traditional retirement security tripod \u2014 employer-provided defined contribution pensions and 401Ks. Widespread and surprisingly favorable reaction to our proposal among bloggers and journalists showed that the message was getting out.\n\nMost important of all was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s speech on Nov. 18, in which she endorsed the heretical idea of expanding Social Security, voiced support for the Harkin proposal and declared:\n\n\u201cWe should be talking about expanding Social Security benefits \u2014 not cutting them.\u201d\n\nReaction from the defenders of orthodoxy was swift. Jon Cowan and Jim Kessler, the president and vice president, respectively, of Third Way \u2014 a \u201ccentrist\u201d think tank funded largely by Wall Street financiers, and associated with the right wing of the Democratic Party \u2014 published an Op-Ed in the conservative Wall Street Journal denouncing the \u201ceconomic populism\u201d of Warren and newly elected New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nCowan and Kessler wrote:\n\nSocial Security is exhibit A of this populist political and economic fantasy. A growing cascade of baby boomers will be retiring in the coming years, and the Social Security formula increases their initial benefits faster than inflation. The problem is that since 2010 Social Security payouts to seniors have exceeded payroll taxes collected from workers. This imbalance widens inexorably until it devours the entire Social Security Trust Fund in 2031, according to the Congressional Budget Office. At that point, benefits would have to be slashed by about 23%. Undeterred by this undebatable solvency crisis, Sen. Warren wants to increase benefits to all seniors, including billionaires, and to pay for them by increasing taxes on working people and their employers. Her approach requires a $750 billion tax hike over the next 10 years that hits mostly Millennials and Gen Xers, plus another $750 billion tax on the businesses that employ them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The years-long campaign to slash Social Security benefits has finally met its match", "title": "Take that, Paul Ryan!
