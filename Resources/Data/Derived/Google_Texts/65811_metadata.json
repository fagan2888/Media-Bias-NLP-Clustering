Which political party took Social Security from the independent trust fund and put it into the general fund so that Congress could spend it? Which was the same political party that eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security withholding and the same political party that started taxing Social Security annuities? It was the Democrats and they tell you that the Republicans want to take your Social Security away.\n\nJim Dandy\n\nI\u2019d like to make a comment about the Cluster. I think they do a good job providing for the needs of the people who need food items. I\u2019d like to see it moved actually back towards Robinson Street where all the other help is for the people. I think it would be best. It\u2019s just not a good time for Pottstown to see that for anybody who wants to come live here.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing about the transgender bathrooms. We already have them. Many stores have he, she and family bathrooms. Others have he and she bathrooms, one bathroom for everybody. You go in and you lock the door. What\u2019s going on now is ridiculous.\n\nNight Light\n\nDonald Trump has offended women, African Americans, Mexicans, Muslims, people with disabilities, people\u2019s appearance and most of all he has personally bad-mouthed the party he claims to be a part of. I don\u2019t know about you but I don\u2019t see any way Donald Trump can win with burning every bridge that he had to cross to get where he is today. What a disaster for the Republican Party. Better luck in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one is especially for you Ted Cruz. You are out of here. Yippee. Yahoo. Hurray.\n\nYou hear all these Republicans saying they want it to be like Ronald Reagan and trickle-down economics. Did any middle- or lower-class people see any increase in their pay? How did that affect them? Besides that, Reagan fired the air traffic controllers when they went on strike for more money. So he wasn\u2019t for the middle class. He was for the higher-ups just like Donald Trump. Do you think a billionaire is going to help the middle and lower class? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nA Bunch of Hot Air\n\nAfter Indiana\u2019s primaries, Sen. Cruz dropped out and he was going to stay until the end and do the contest in Cleveland. I think he really dropped out because he didn\u2019t want to bring any embarrassment to his father. What Donald Trump said might have been half true but I think he dropped out because of his father.\n\nVince Papale, yes you are a hero. What happened to you since you retired? And to vote for Pat Toomey? What a disgrace.\n\nThe Beast\n\nI would like to give a shout-out to the Gilbertsville Ambulance Company. They picked me up off the floor twice and took me to the hospital. They did a wonderful job and they were very compassionate.\n\nCarol from Gilbertsville\n\nThis is to answer Big John North Coventry. Not all people are included in not being able to afford Obamacare. The only ones who can\u2019t afford Obamacare are the ones who have to work and pay for their own and pay for the ones who don\u2019t want to work. As long as you don\u2019t work you get free health care while the working man still suffers.\n\nWalmart founder Sam Walton said there was only one boss, the customer, and he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down simply by spending his money elsewhere. Over the last year that customer has indeed taken his business elsewhere fueling a series of epic setbacks for the retail giant.\n\nChief Wahoo\n\nShort and sweet. Here we go. We got Trump versus Clinton. Trump I guess you could say is a bad dream and Clinton is a nightmare. That\u2019s it.\n\nIn West Virginia, Hillary Clinton met the press to cover a question-and-answer group. She knew the questions ahead of time and the answers but she got caught off guard when a miner asked her what she would do for them. Her answer was to close the mines. She forgot the miners are union members and she needs their votes and their money. The answer should have been \u201cI will do my best to bring new jobs here.\u201d She does not work very good under pressure.\n\nJohn Kennedy gets a pass but not his brother Ted. Regarding the Catholic/Democrat debate, John served and died long before the Democratic leadership turned the party to the left and evil path where it continues to progress worse each year. I was a Democrat until their fall and voted for John Kennedy as well as Harry Truman.\n\nInfo Depot\n\nSound Off is a forum to spur dialogue from residents of the communities we serve on topics of interest in those communities.
