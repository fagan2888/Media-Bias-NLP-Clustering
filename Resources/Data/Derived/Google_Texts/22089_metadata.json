Crews continued containment efforts starting at 8 a.m. Sunday.\n\nPrevious story:\n\nCrews say they have a containment line set up around the entire fire, and they're letting it burn itself out.\n\nAs of just after 5:00 p.m. crews said the fire had grown to 700 acres, and was burning in grass and brush in a Fort Carson practice range, just east of the Pikes Peak International Raceway.\n\nInitially Fort Carson was being assisted by crews from Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, El Paso County, and the Fountain Fire Department, but now only Fort Carson crews remain on scene.\n\nFort Carson officials say that crews are confident that their containment lines will hold; now they will let the fire burn up to those lines and put itself out.\n\nCrews will stay on scene to monitor it. They say it could burn and smoke for the next few hours.\n\nThere is no word yet on what started the fire.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE:\n\nFort Carson firefighters are working to contain a fire on one of their training ranges south of the Springs.\n\nThe fire is estimated at 5 to 6 acres, and was first reported late Saturday morning. It only took firefighters 30 minutes to get the fire to 50 percent containment.\n\nFort Carson says they are confident they won't have issues getting the other half contained quickly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A fire burning on Fort Carson is 700 acres and 80% contained.
