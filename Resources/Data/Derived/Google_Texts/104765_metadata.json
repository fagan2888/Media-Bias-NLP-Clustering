Live music, food and vendors will be on scene from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. for a grand opening celebration.\n\nVisitors will need tickets to tour the building during the grand opening. Those will be available at booths at the festival or on unionstationindenver.com.\n\nFor the grand opening, Wynkoop Street between 16th Street and 18th Street will be closed. Also, 17th Street from Wykoop to Wazee streets will be closed.\n\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Noelle_Phillips", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver\u2019s Union Station ready to open its doors", "title": "Denver\u2019s Union Station ready to open its doors", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/10/denvers-union-station-ready-to-open-its-doors/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140710__20140711_A4_CD11UNIONSTATIONp1.jpg", "height": 423}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140710__20140711_A4_CD11UNIONSTATIONp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-10T20:47:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:00:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff3c\"", "article_summary": "The opening of Denver\u2019s Union Station is almost here, and there are multiple celebrations in the works.\nFor the grand opening, Wynkoop Street between 16th Street and 18th Street will be closed.\nFor that event, Denver police intermittently will stop traffic on Wynkoop Street to make way for party-goers.\nLive music, food and vendors will be on scene from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. for a grand opening celebration.\nUnion Station managers are throwing their big public to-do July 26."}
