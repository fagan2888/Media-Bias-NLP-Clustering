There was a lot of the latter this Sunday.\n\nWORST: Ben Carson\n\nNeurosurgeon headline generator Ben Carson\u2019s statements likening Obamacare to slavery and so forth are so outlandish Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace dragged him onto the show and basically asked if he was kidding. Carson responded by overturning Marbury v Madison, which would have been a far more impressive maneuver had he given any indication he knew what Marbury v Madison was. Instead Wallace explained to him the origins of judicial review and Carson said nah, we don\u2019t need that.\n\nFWIW, Carson continues to talk movingly about his own personal story of rising out of childhood poverty to become not just a successful neurosurgeon but what appears to be an all around active citizen. The problem is this story of grit-driven economic and civic mobility capsizes his comparisons of the U.S. to Nazi Germany.

(Fiorina was fired by HP in 2005; the company\u2019s stock rebounded upon the news.) Challenged to do so by Meet the Press\u2019 Chuck Todd, she unfurled some Silicon Valley-grade sophistry:\n\n\u201cI was fired in a boardroom brawl\u2026It is a leader\u2019s job to challenge the status quo. When you do, you make enemies.\u201d\n\nThanks to overuse by the pundit class the concept of \u201cleadership\u201d has become elasticized. When the definition is stretched so broad that it can encompass running a tech company into the ground, we may safely retire the term.\n\nFiorina then wedgied her own logic, arguing that the brilliant-on-a-harvest-moon moves she made at HP were done against the dictates of the shareholders, those elitist bullies, and for the benefit of employees:\n\n\u201cA CEO cannot run a company based on conventional wisdom or current emotion. A CEO\u2019s job is to build sustainable value over the long term for as many employees, as many customers, and as many communities as possible.\u201d\n\nCarly Fiorina laid off 30,000 people while at HP, which is to \u201csustainable value over the long term\u201d what \u201cfired with a $21 million severance package\u201d is to leadership.

Presumably he knows better?

Mediaite won\u2019t honor Bush in this roundup because a) his full interview with Megyn Kelly doesn\u2019t air until tomorrow, and b) his claim that he still would have invaded Iraq was a tad muddy. Kelly asked him whether he would have done so knowing what we know now; he answered according to the intelligence available in 2003, a sleight of hand that keeps Hillary Clinton in the conversation. Given that she isn\u2019t appearing on the Sunday shows at all, we guess something has to.\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n>> Follow Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Until the campaigns begin in earnest, the proliferation of the presidential hopefuls largely serves the media's yawning need for content, as less established", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GOP.jpg", "title": "Which GOP Candidate Had the Worst Sunday?"}, "twitter": {"description": "Until the campaigns begin in earnest, the proliferation of the presidential hopefuls largely serves the media's yawning need for content, as less established candidates gamble for exposure on the Sunday shows against the risk of appearing bush league.
