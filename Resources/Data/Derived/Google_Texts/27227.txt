'Tis the night before Christmas, and all through D.C.

Not a cloture's occurring, 'tis still as can be.

Some bills have been passed, neatly stacked, clearly labeled

Then sent to the House and instantly tabled.

The leaders are nestled in bars with their beers

To toast the most inactive Congress in years.

The White House is bustling with aides who still truck

With the notion Obama's not yet a lame duck.

When out on the Mall there erupts such a clatter,

They rush from their desks to see what is the matter.

Away to their windows they fly in a flitter,

To check out the action, then share it on Twitter.

The glow of their phones on the new-fallen snow,

Gives a luster of midday to objects below,

When what then appear like great apparitions,

But an irate St. Nick and eight politicians.

While the pols look around, a little perplexed,

The onlookers all take a pause from their texts.

For the old elf's eyes flash with a furious flame,

As he paces, and shouts, and calls them by name:

"Ted Cruz and Issa! Obama and Weiner!

Paul Ryan! John Thune! And Stutzman and Boehner!

I've brought you all here to account for yourselves.

Your behavior this year has confounded my elves.

They know how to make every game, toy, and treat.

But the lists we've received make that all obsolete.

We're wizzes at handling all sorts of appeals,

But we can't beef up Head Start or fund Meals on Wheels.

World leaders are begging me for untapped phones,

While children are asking for skies free of drones."

His brow furrows deep at the thought of their trauma

And then, like a flash, he turns on Obama.

"Magic works wonders â€“ its power is stunning.

But not even it can get your website running."

"You tell 'im, old man," Stutzman shouts with delight.

Santa turns, eyebrow arched: "I'd hoped you'd be contrite.
