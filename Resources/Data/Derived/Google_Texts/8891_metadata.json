That person will determine where patients nees to go for care.\n\nCare options include critical, pediatric and an area called the Rapid Unit.\n\nThe Rapid Unit is a space designed to serve patients with less-severe conditions. It features10 private rooms that can serve patients with dental, eye, orthopedic other problems.Lab and imaging facilities also are available in the unit, as well as a separate waiting area for patients.\n\nThe critical care area serves patients with severe conditions. It has 19 private exam rooms and three resuscitation rooms.\n\nTowards the back of the department are three pediatric rooms that are somewhat separate from the rest of the emergency care area.\n\nOverall, the emergency department is designed so that traffic flows through outer corridors, while private rooms are located in the center.\n\nThe first phase of the project, which was completed in February 2015, was construction of a larger helipad \u2013 3,000 additional square feet \u2013 that incorporated an automatic snow-melt system.\n\nWellSpan Hospital is the only designated Level I trauma center in York, Adams, Lancaster and Franklin Counties.\n\nDerry Township-based Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in Dauphin County is the only other Level I trauma center in the midstate, but there are several Level II trauma centers.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe remaining phase of the renovation includes renovating space for additional specialty care areas that the emergency department does not currently have.\n\nA behavioral health unit, a sexual assault forensic exam suite and a transitional care unit for emergency treatment are on the way.\n\nThe behavioral health unit will address the increased demand for services, partly due to the opioid epidemic, which is creating an increase in overdoses in the state, according to Vega.\n\nPatients who are coming in for emergency behavioral health often have a wait between their emergency visit and being placed in some form of long-term treatment.\n\nThis new space will give WellSpan the ability to keep those patients comfortable and start that process.\n\nThe unit will have six private rooms, two interview rooms and two quiet rooms.\n\nBehavioral health efforts have been of special interest to the health system, as it became affiliated with Lebanon County-based Philhaven of Mount Gretna, the 14th-largest mental and behavioral health provider in the nation, in spring 2015.\n\nThe sexual assault forensic exam, or SAFE, unit will have private rooms with forensic exam capabilities.\n\nThere will be 22 private rooms, including six for chest pain observation, in the emergency transitional care unit.\n\nThe final phase will complete the health system\u2019s vision of more efficient service in the emergency department.\n\n\u201cWhen we started this project 18 months ago, we had a vision for a new, modern emergency department that would make us more efficient but would also improve the overall experience for our patients and their families,\u201d Keith Noll, senior vice president of WellSpan Health and president of WellSpan York Hospital said. \u201cWith the opening of this latest phase, that vision is starting to take shape.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Central Penn Business Journal", "description": "The latest phase in the renovation of WellSpan York Hospital's emergency department was completed this week.", "title": "An ER makeover for WellSpan York Hospital | CPBJ", "url": "http://www.cpbj.com/article/20160407/CPBJ01/160409892/an-er-makeover-for-wellspan-york-hospital", "image": "http://www.cpbj.com/images/cpbj-logo-share.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "cpbj.com", "description": "The latest phase in the renovation of WellSpan York Hospital's emergency department was completed this week.", "title": "An ER makeover for WellSpan York Hospital | CPBJ", "image": {"src": "http://www.cpbj.com/images/cpbj-logo-share.jpg"}, "site": "@cpbj", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The latest phase in the renovation of WellSpan York Hospital's emergency department was completed this week.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The latest phase in the renovation of WellSpan York Hospital's emergency department was completed this week.\nThe hospital underwent extensive planning and consulting to improve its systems and design the ultimate space for emergency care, according to David Vega, medical director and chairman of emergency medicine at York Hospital.\nA nurse, or as WellSpan is calling it, a \u201cquick nurse,\u201d will assess patients upon their arrival to the emergency department.\nA behavioral health unit, a sexual assault forensic exam suite and a transitional care unit for emergency treatment are on the way.\nThere will be 22 private rooms, including six for chest pain observation, in the emergency transitional care unit."}
