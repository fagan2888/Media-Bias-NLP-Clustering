And although the L.A-born actress now calls the United Kingdom home, she still supports ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been living in London for 11 years where healthcare is the right of everyone,\u201d Paltrow told FOX411 at Monday\u2019s premiere of the comedy/drama \u201cThanks for Sharing.\u201d \u201cAnd I feel like the taxes that we pay, people should have the right to health care here.\u201d\n\nShe also said there are things we can all do to be a little healthier.\n\n\u201cNot eating processed foods. Nothing you buy off the shelf and have to open, like Oreos,\u201d Paltrow advised. \u201cThings that have a lot of ingredients in them and are processed, they are hard on the body. The body doesn\u2019t know what to do with that stuff. Just eat fresh food. I eat French Fries and cheese, but it\u2019s just good quality.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress\u2019s character Phoebe takes obsession with healthy eating and exercise to extremes in the forthcoming \u201cThanks for Sharing,\u201d which tackles the often taboo 12-step program for sex addiction and the challenges sobriety brings.\n\n\u201cI learned a lot about addiction. Essentially it is a way to band-aid pain. People are looking for something to mask their pain for a minute and feel a bit better and it can take many forms,\u201d Paltrow said. \u201cI learned the way out of it is to really face your pain, to sit with it and really face your emotions. Those are the first steps.\u201d\n\nShe also expressed some concerns about the over-sexualized direction society seems to have taken.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sex, especially as a mother and having children with access to the Internet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite scary how accessible sex is and how it\u2019s everywhere. It is definitely not a very innocent time.\u201d\n\nHowever, it seems two of Paltrow\u2019s co-stars don\u2019t quite agree with her.\n\n\u201cIn America, we have the wrong idea completely. I wouldn\u2019t say that it is oversaturated or oversexed, but I think we grow up with a really unhealthy, secretive, Puritan idea of sexuality, expression, freedom and healthy love and relationships,\u201d explained acting newcomer Alecia Moore, better known as her pop princess alter-ego \u201cPink.\u201d \u201cAnd when you communicate and educate, and you know how to love your body and use your body\u2026 than you have a healthy society.\u201d\n\nTim Robbins, who plays a longtime sobriety sponsor still plagued by old demons when the going gets tough, concurred.\n\n\u201cThere is a puritanical edge in this country that is judgmental and horrible and condemning of sexual activity,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say maybe there is an obsession people have with youth and beauty, but I don\u2019t see a healthy sexual attitude in this country.\u201d\n\nRobbins also said sex addiction too is a widely \u201cmisunderstood\u201d concept.\n\n\u201cPeople think it is an excuse people use when they get caught cheating. But I went to a couple of meetings and talked to some sex addicts and it is a real problem,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople\u2019s whole lives are ruined by the addiction, just like alcoholism or narcotics addiction. It is a real problem and going to those meetings, seeing the courage those people have was really inspiring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for Sharing\u201d opens in select theaters Friday, September 20.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "movies", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/COLUMNS/Pop Tarts", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-07 01:03:10 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "These days Gwyneth Paltrow is just as famous for her toned body and wellness website Goop as she is for starring on the silver screen.
