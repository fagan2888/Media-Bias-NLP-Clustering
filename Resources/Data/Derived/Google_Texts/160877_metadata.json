A sample of charges totaling $152,600 in 2012 showed that half of that, or about $79,300, were \u201cprohibited, improper and erroneous,\u201d the auditor said.\n\nRelated: Agency Workers Bill Taxpayers for BMWs, High-Def TVs\n\nEmployees spent about $29 million on EPA charge cards in fiscal year 2012, so it\u2019s possible that half of that is also \u201cmisspent.\u201d Once again, the issue sheds light on lax oversight at the agency.\n\n\u201cThis indicates an ongoing risk,\u201d the auditor said. \u201cImproved purchase-card oversight could save the government money, which would be especially helpful in the EPA\u2019s current budget environment.\u201d\n\nThe auditor said that the government issues employees charge cards to bypass the complicated procurement process for small purchases. The card program was created over 30 years ago to \u201cstreamline the federal acquisition processes by providing a low-cost, efficient vehicle for obtaining goods and services directly from vendors,\u201d the IG report said. Yet a spate of inspector general reports have highlighted routine abuse within the purchase card program for years.\n\nLast summer, employees at the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) reportedly used their federal purchase cards to buy big-ticket items such as home theater systems and BMWs, as well as smaller routine purchases such as grocery-store items.\n\nRelated: Meet the Federal Government\u2019s Fraudulent Five\n\nIn another instance a few years ago, a handful of Postal Service officials used their federal charge cards to buy Apple computers and anonymous items at \u201cadult entertainment stores,\u201d Talking Points Memo reported.\n\nThe ongoing abuse of federal charge cards prompted Congress to pass a bill in 2012 requiring agencies to periodically review their purchase-card programs in order to curb illegal and improper payments. And under new guidelines by the Office of Management and Budget, federal workers who are caught using their charge cards improperly could face dismissal.\n\nStill, the abuse has continued at agencies like the EPA. The auditor found that despite the new law, the agency failed to conduct a review of employee transactions.\n\n\u201cSince the biennial review process was not followed, corrective actions and improved internal controls did not occur and weaknesses continued from 2008 onward,\u201d the IG report said.\n\nRelated: How John Beale Swindled the EPA Out of $1 Million\n\nThe lack of oversight within the EPA is nothing new. Just last fall, the agency\u2019s top-paid executive, John Beale, was charged with defrauding the government out of nearly $1 million by pretending to be a CIA agent as an excuse to miss work for months at a time. He got away with his elaborate rouse for nearly a decade before anyone noticed.\n\nThe EPA also has struggled to maintain proper oversight over its contractors. Last year, an IG report found that agency contractors were using a federally owned building as their personal gym and hangout.\n\nIn both reports, the IG suggested that the agency implement a better strategy to increase oversight by developing reporting procedures and fulfilling periodical reviews of charge cards.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Employees at the Environmental Protection Agency have been shopping, dining and hittin", "title": "More Federal Workers Abusing Government Credit Cards", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/11/More-Federal-Workers-Abusing-Government-Credit-Cards", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Credit%20Card%20%28REUTERS%3AIssei%20Kato%29.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/11/More-Federal-Workers-Abusing-Government-Credit-Cards", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Credit%20Card%20%28REUTERS%3AIssei%20Kato%29.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Employees at the Environmental Protection Agency have been shopping, dining and hittin", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "And under new guidelines by the Office of Management and Budget, federal workers who are caught using their charge cards improperly could face dismissal.\nThe ongoing abuse of federal charge cards prompted Congress to pass a bill in 2012 requiring agencies to periodically review their purchase-card programs in order to curb illegal and improper payments.\nRelated: Meet the Federal Government\u2019s Fraudulent FiveIn another instance a few years ago, a handful of Postal Service officials used their federal charge cards to buy Apple computers and anonymous items at \u201cadult entertainment stores,\u201d Talking Points Memo reported.\nLast year, an IG report found that agency contractors were using a federally owned building as their personal gym and hangout.\n\u201cSince the biennial review process was not followed, corrective actions and improved internal controls did not occur and weaknesses continued from 2008 onward,\u201d the IG report said."}
