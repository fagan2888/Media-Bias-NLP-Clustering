It also is suspected of causing a rare neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre syndrome, that can result in paralysis.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest welcomed \"any sort of forward momentum in Congress\" while continuing to push for the full $1.9 billion.\n\n\"It could not be clearer that Congress needs to take action to help our states and our local officials fight the Zika virus. That is critical for health and safety of the American people,\" Earnest said.\n\nFlorida's senators, Bill Nelson, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, called for the full $1.9 billion, saying $1.1 billion was inadequate.\n\nThey noted that the Florida Department of Health has reported a total of 112 Zika virus cases, the most of any U.S. state, as the mosquito season goes into high gear with hotter temperatures.\n\nOne proposal now before the Senate would provide Obama with his full $1.9 billion request for emergency funds. A second one would scale back Obama's request to $1.1 billion.\n\nThese two options would not require spending cuts elsewhere to cover the Zika costs, Senate aides said.\n\nA third one would take money from Obamacare to pay for $1.1 billion in Zika response funds.\n\nEven if the Senate approves one of these proposals, its fate is uncertain in the House of Representatives, where Republicans are deeply divided over new Zika funding, according to aides.\n\nTwo senior Republican aides said the party's House leadership has been unable to formulate a plan on Zika legislation and is preoccupied with internal party strife over Donald Trump becoming the presumptive presidential nominee, as well as a deadlock over Puerto Rico debt legislation and a budget blueprint that has been stuck in the House.\n\nWhile plans to unveil a new Puerto Rico bill on Wednesday were canceled, a third senior House Republican aide noted there is progress on that legislation and that \"discussions\" on a budget \"are moving forward as well.\"\n\nSenate backers of each amendment will try to attach their competing proposals to an unrelated spending bill the Senate started debating on Thursday.\n\n(Reporting by
