Fox’s Gretchen Carlson bravely took on the world of senior citizen sex Monday when she sat down with psychotherapist Beatty Cohan to discuss a new study from the Department of Health and Human Services that shows Medicare recipients are getting sexually-transmitted diseases at similar rates to 20-24-year-olds.

First Cohan gave Carlson the “good news”: “I see so many people in their 70s and 80s and 90s who are very sexually active,” she said. But the issues of safe sex never come up because “they’re very busy enjoying their new found closeness and sexuality as they’re living in their communities and enjoying a sexual experience that most of them never dreamed that they were going to have.”

When Cohan suggested that TV commercials for Viagra and Cialis include warnings about STDs, Carlson said, “When I hear those commercials, and I’m usually try to turn them down when my eight-year-old’s watching,” she said, “but I’m thinking, you hear so many things they are saying at the back end of those commercials, why wouldn’t they just say that?”

By the end of the slightly uncomfortable segment, Carlson was giggling a bit as she thanked Cohan for providing her unique insight on this “very interesting discussion and one that you’re familiar with.”
