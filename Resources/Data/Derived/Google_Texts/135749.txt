A new federal rule amending portions of the Affordable Care Act contains a paragraph that those who have pushed for changes to the risk adjustment formula find "very encouraging," the CEO of insurer Evergreen Health tells FierceHealthPayer.

In the rule--which adjusts the regulations for special enrollment periods and consumer operated and oriented plans (CO-OPs)--the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) indicates that it is "sympathetic" to the concerns some insurers have expressed about the risk adjustment program and is exploring changes to address them.

Some insurers, including the remaining CO-OPs, have argued the formula is flawed because it has resulted in smaller health plans paying large proportions of their premium collections into the program, while larger payers reap the benefits. One of the more vocal critics has been Peter Beilenson, M.D., the top executive of Maryland's CO-OP, who has said the program threatens the viability of smaller health plans.

"Everyone admits, even CMS admits, that the risk adjustment process and formula is flawed and that there have got to be changes made," Beilenson (right) tells FierceHealthPayer in an exclusive interview.

But while he predicts federal officials will make many of the changes industry stakeholders have requested by 2018, he argues that if no alterations have occurred by then, it is "going to be too late for a lot of small carriers."

Thus, he is pleased with CMS' new rule, in which the agency says it encourages states "to examine whether any local approaches, under state legal authority, are warranted to help ease this transition to new health insurance markets."
