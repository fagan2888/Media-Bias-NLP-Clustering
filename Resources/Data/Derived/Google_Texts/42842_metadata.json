A tongue-in-cheek tweet directed at the governor of Wisconsin caused a minor controversy earlier this summer within Colorado political circles. Her casual but sincere love of her vape pen (as evidenced at the Emmys) has also made her an icon in the growing legal-cannabis movement, whose heart is currently beating in the Mile High City.\n\nWe caught up with Silverman via e-mail this week to talk touring, big outdoor crowds at comedy shows, and, of course, marijuana.\n\nQ: Does it feel like a lot of travel and trouble just to do 20 minutes of stand-up at these Oddball shows, or do you like the get-in, get-out nature?\n\nA: I love it. I just did a special (last year\u2019s \u201cWe Are Miracles\u201d on HBO, which is being released by Sub Pop on Sept. 22) so I\u2019m starting over with new material. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get to tour this soon \u2014 and to get to do it with other comedians \u2014 it\u2019s such a treat. Touring for comics is usually so, SO solitary, so to travel and perform with good friends is a blast. I love getting to do a short 20-25 minute set. I love being a part of this festival \u2014 this traveling show of oddballs.\n\nQ: I can\u2019t recall ever seeing you perform at Red Rocks. Do you think the choice of venue for the Denver stop helped attract bigger names such as yourself, Louis, Aziz, etc.? I feel like we\u2019re getting a New York or L.A.-quality lineup here as compared with some cities.\n\nA: It\u2019s an amazing venue and yes, I think we\u2019re all drawn to it. It\u2019s the home of epic shows, and I think we wanna be a part of it.\n\nQ: What are the challenges of doing comedy outdoors and for thousands of people? I saw Dave Chappelle at Red Rocks a couple weeks ago and despite his adoring fan base, he still had a bit of trouble keeping the crowd quiet.\n\nA: So far the crowds have been really great. I prefer an intimate crowd but the sound quality is so excellent and there are giant screens with cameramen capturing every moment in real time, so it actually feels fairly intimate considering there are over 10,000 people. And the crowds, though they are giant, are comedy fans and they know that listening to the words is the experience and laughter is the participation. Of course there are douche bags \u2014 lemme rephrase that \u2014 hurting inner children who need to yell shit out, but a surprisingly small amount considering the sizes of venues. Am I making sense? I\u2019m sick and on NyQuil.\n\nQ: Do you think Oddball is helping people think differently about comedy, i.e. something on par with bigger music tours and festivals? Would you like to see more events like this, or do you think that might oversaturate the market?\n\nA: I dunno, Doll. I\u2019m not a businessman, I\u2019m a comic.\n\nQ: Since I write for The Cannabist, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t ask: Do you plan to visit any pot shops while in Denver, since it\u2019s recreationally legal here?\n\nA: Maybe! I\u2019d love to, but I never smoke before a show. Plus we pretty much get to town, nap till show time, do the show, then onto the next town. I have my vape pen, and though I am a pot person (I don\u2019t drink), I\u2019m a lightweight. A couple puffs when I get off stage and maybe a puff before bed is more than good news for me.\n\nJohn Wenzel: 303-954-1642, jwenzel@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnwenzel", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Sarah Silverman on the 2014 Oddball Comedy Fest, legal weed and more", "title": "Sarah Silverman on the 2014 Oddball Comedy Fest, legal weed and more", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/04/sarah-silverman-on-the-2014-oddball-comedy-fest-legal-weed-and-more/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140904__454166880p1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140904__454166880p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-04T11:12:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:28:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Comedy"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccab9\"", "article_summary": "Last year\u2019s inaugural Oddball Comedy and Curiosity Festival tour was a fun, if dude-centric, affair that presented some of the country\u2019s best comics on a massive stage.\nWe caught up with Silverman via e-mail this week to talk touring, big outdoor crowds at comedy shows, and, of course, marijuana.\nQ: Do you think Oddball is helping people think differently about comedy, i.e.\nI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get to tour this soon \u2014 and to get to do it with other comedians \u2014 it\u2019s such a treat.\nQ: Does it feel like a lot of travel and trouble just to do 20 minutes of stand-up at these Oddball shows, or do you like the get-in, get-out nature?"}
