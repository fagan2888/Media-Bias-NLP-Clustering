Seems a study conducted by a non-profit \u201c99 Days of Freedom\u201d shows that most of us actually have a \u2018complicated relationship\u2019 in regard to the social networking giant.\n\nWhether it was being tagged in unflattering photos, getting into arguments with other users, or simply regretting time lost through excessive use, there seems to be a surprising degree of negative sentiment. In which increased (with a multitude of users deleting profiles) after Facebooks controversial mood manipulation study.\n\nSo the subsequent question was posed \u201cIf Facebook is adding this new layer of drama to your already maxed-out plethora of emotions, how do you feel when you don\u2019t use Facebook?\u201d\n\nThe non-profit \u201c99 Days of Freedom,\u201d created the social experiment by asking users to refrain from Facebook use for a period of 99 consecutive days and report-back on how the hiatus affects personal notions of happiness.\n\nThe website provides a set of simple user instructions, which include posting a \u201ctime-off\u201d image as a profile picture and starting a personalized, 99-day countdown clock. From there, participants are asked to complete anonymous \u201chappiness surveys\u201d at the 33, 66 and 99-day marks, with results posted to the initiative\u2019s website as they\u2019re compiled.\n\nThe initiative will also host a message board through which participants can post anonymous accounts of how an extended break from Facebook is impacting their lives.\n\n17 Minutes a Day\n\nA cursory look at Facebook usage stats certainly supports the question\u2019s legitimacy. According to Facebook, it\u2019s 1.2 billion users spend an average of 17 minutes per day on the site, reading updates, following links or browsing photos. Over a three-month period, that ads-up to more than 28-hours which, the initiative\u2019s creators contend, could be devoted to more emotionally fulfilling activities- learning a new skill, performing volunteer work or spending time (offline) with friends and family. What to speak of the roller coaster of emotions a personal Facebook experience can put you through when you are on it.\n\nThe obvious question: Considering the remarkable levels of Facebook use, isn\u2019t 99 days a pretty big ask? Art Director (of parent company Just) Merijn Straathof explains\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of arguments about the experiment\u2019s duration. If it\u2019s too extended, participants will lose interest. If it\u2019s too short, there\u2019s no meaningful behavioral change to assess. In the end, we landed on a 99-day program with periodic surveys and posts, hoping that such interaction will serve as a support group of sorts. As everyone at our firm is participating in the experiment, we\u2019ll be testing that one first-hand.\u201d\n\nAlthough Straathof and his colleagues are eager to see the experiment\u2019s results, he stresses that the initiative is neither an anti-Facebook protest nor an attempt to harm the web\u2019s most popular site.\n\n\u201cFacebook is an incredible platform, we\u2019re all fiercely loyal users and we believe that there\u2019s a lot to love about the service,\u201d says Straathof. \u201cBut we also feel that there are obvious emotional benefits to moderation. Our prediction is that the experiment will yield a lot of positive personal experiences and, 99 days from now, we\u2019ll know whether that theory has legs.\u201d\n\nSource: 99 Days\n\nAdam Omkara is a Mind/Body Health and Spiritual luminary who has worked as a consultant and coach to some of the most influential people in the country, including: High Level Politicians\u2013 Hollywood Stars- Billboard Musicians- High Profile CEO\u2019s- Award Winning Scientists- Professional Athletes- Sport Team Owners- and a Former Miss Olympia.\n\nAdam Omkara on Twitter l Omkara World on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seems a study conducted by a non-profit \u201c99 Days of Freedom\u201d shows that most of us actually have a \u2018complicated relationship\u2019 in regard to the social networking", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Adam Helfer", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "Seems a study conducted by a non-profit \u201c99 Days of Freedom\u201d shows that most of us actually have a \u2018complicated relationship\u2019 in regard to the social networking giant.", "title": "Could you give up Facebook for 99 days", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/life/facebook-99-33905/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/freedom-800.jpg", "height": 482}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Seems a study conducted by a non-profit \u201c99 Days of Freedom\u201d shows that most of us actually have a \u2018complicated relationship\u2019 in regard to the social networking giant.", "creator": "@AdamOmkara", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/freedom-800-435x375.jpg", "title": "Could you give up Facebook for 99 days", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "keywords": "facebook,social media,drama,facebook 99,adam helfer", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-25T22:57:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-05T07:57:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Adam Helfer, Facebook, social media"}, "article_summary": "The obvious question: Considering the remarkable levels of Facebook use, isn\u2019t 99 days a pretty big ask?\nSeems a study conducted by a non-profit \u201c99 Days of Freedom\u201d shows that most of us actually have a \u2018complicated relationship\u2019 in regard to the social networking giant.\nWhat to speak of the roller coaster of emotions a personal Facebook experience can put you through when you are on it.\nSo the subsequent question was posed \u201cIf Facebook is adding this new layer of drama to your already maxed-out plethora of emotions, how do you feel when you don\u2019t use Facebook?\u201dThe non-profit \u201c99 Days of Freedom,\u201d created the social experiment by asking users to refrain from Facebook use for a period of 99 consecutive days and report-back on how the hiatus affects personal notions of happiness.\nAdam Omkara on Twitter l Omkara World on Facebook"}
