But not all of these meetings are as efficient or productive as they need to be. Because of their position and level of power relative to others, executives can do a lot to help improve meetings by taking three (relatively) simple steps.\n\nDon\u2019t be part of the problem. Be on time. This may sound basic, but as the senior person it is very important that you show up on time for meetings because it demonstrates that you value others\u2019 time. Also, the meeting really won\u2019t start until you\u2019re there anyway, even if they\u2019ve already started talking.\n\nIf there are pre-reads for the meeting, make sure you\u2019ve done them. Just as showing up late delays everyone, not having done your homework wastes meeting time. You may say that you didn\u2019t have time to get to it, and you may be right. You may believe that it is OK to take time in the meeting to be caught up on the relevant information because your time is more valuable than theirs (and you may be right in that your hourly rate is higher), but not being prepared wastes the time of everyone in the meeting, and contributes to a culture where not being prepared for meetings is acceptable. And that inefficiency will affect you as well.\n\nStop talking. As an executive, people will often look for cues from you as to what they should be thinking. If you want to hear the ideas of the room, you should be quiet and not express a strong opinion that will undoubtedly shape the conversation.\n\nMake sure others aren\u2019t part of the problem. Just as you should show up on time having prepared adequately for the meeting, so should others at the meeting. If they are late or unprepared and you let it slide, others will come to the conclusion that behavior is acceptable and will behave with that in mind in the future.\n\nSimilarly, if you want everyone to participate in a meeting, make sure that \u201cairtime\u201d isn\u2019t all taken by one or two people. You know who the people are who feel a need to talk a lot. If you want the meeting to include all participants, don\u2019t let them dominate. While you might believe that everyone should feel as if they can speak up whenever they feel a need, the reality is that often people feel shut out in meetings because of a couple of people who simply won\u2019t shut up. If you\u2019re the person with the most power in the room, you have the authority to redirect the conversation in such a way to prevent it being inappropriately dominated by a few voices. And if you don\u2019t it sends the message that you think it is OK for the meeting to be dominated by a couple of people.\n\nMake sure your staff follows best practices for meeting including making sure each meeting has:\n\nn A clear, defined purpose, whether it is decision making or information sharing or juggling. Meetings that are primarily for political posturing or catching up should be discouraged.\n\nn An agenda organized to get to the most important items. While some believe that making meetings shorter makes them more efficient, not completing important issues just results in more meetings.\n\nn All information and all people necessary to achieve the meeting\u2019s goal are present. There\u2019s no point in having a meeting if the key personnel can\u2019t attend.\n\nWhile following these recommendations won\u2019t fix all that ails meetings (humans are humans after all), an executive following them and encouraging staff in their span of control follow them would significantly improve the efficiency of their meetings, and would hopefully have a ripple effect to improve meetings throughout the organization.\n\nJennifer Deal is a senior research scientist at the Center for Creative Leadership and an affiliated research scientist at the Center for Effective Organizations at the University of Southern California.\n\nRead the latest Leadership Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "JENNIFER DEAL: Like everyone else in corporate America, most executives have a lot of meetings they have to attend, either virtually or in person.", "title": "The Best Way to Run a Corporate Meeting", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/02/26/the-best-way-to-run-a-corporate-meeting-2/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "The Best Way to Run a Corporate Meeting", "description": "JENNIFER DEAL: Like everyone else in corporate America, most executives have a lot of meetings they have to attend, either virtually or in person.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "JENNIFER DEAL: Like everyone else in corporate America, most executives have a lot of meetings they have to attend, either virtually or in person.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-02-26T17:10:37-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/02/26/the-best-way-to-run-a-corporate-meeting-2/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-5194", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "JENNIFER DEAL: Like everyone else in corporate America, most executives have a lot of meetings they have to attend, either virtually or in person.", "title": "The Best Way to Run a Corporate Meeting", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/02/26/the-best-way-to-run-a-corporate-meeting-2/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-5194", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-02-27T01:08:09-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5a6\"", "article_summary": "Make sure your staff follows best practices for meeting including making sure each meeting has:n A clear, defined purpose, whether it is decision making or information sharing or juggling.\nWhile some believe that making meetings shorter makes them more efficient, not completing important issues just results in more meetings.\nJust as you should show up on time having prepared adequately for the meeting, so should others at the meeting.\nAlso, the meeting really won\u2019t start until you\u2019re there anyway, even if they\u2019ve already started talking.\nSimilarly, if you want everyone to participate in a meeting, make sure that \u201cairtime\u201d isn\u2019t all taken by one or two people."}
