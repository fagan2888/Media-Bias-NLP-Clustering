On the way there, his coach made a pit stop at a strip club.\n\n\u201cIt was called the Cheetah lounge. They were supposed to go out for a bite to eat,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had a lot of faith in this person who went places with a lot of the kids.\u201d\n\nKleinert-Cohn says the coach paid for Wes to get a lap dance, despite his protests and repeated requests to leave. He was in his mid-20s, but Kleinert-Cohn says her son is essentially a child with the mentality of 14-year-old. But that\u2019s not the way he was treated when he tried to report what happened to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe went to the police at that time, and they pretty much laughed it off because, I guess, he had autism they didn't get it,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn't really care, and this was 14 months after the incident, which occurred in January 2010.\u201d\n\nKleinert-Cohn says if police had taken him seriously, charges for sexual abuse may have been brought. She and her husband eventually took their case to their local lawmakers, Rep. Bill Hager (R-Delray Beach) and Sen. Jeremy Ring (D-Margate).\n\nShe says, \u201cOur goal is to lessen the probability of this happening to people like Wes during the interview process. The people that are similarly situated to Wes with autism, mental disabilities, shouldn\u2019t be taken advantage of like this.\"\n\nIf passed, the bill would mandate a mental-health expert be present during any interview of a developmentally disabled person, whether he's a suspect or a victim. If approved, a pilot program would first be set up in Broward County to test the proposal\u2019s effectiveness.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Florida could soon be the first state to require a mental-health expert to be present during police interviews of developmentally disabled suspects or", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/florida-bill-would-protect-developmentally-disabled-during-police-interviews", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201601/461633765.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Florida could soon be the first state to require a mental-health expert to be present during police interviews of developmentally disabled suspects or", "title": "Florida Bill Would Protect Developmentally Disabled During Police Interviews"}, "story_id": 461633740, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Ryan Benk", "org_id": 447, "dc": {"title": "Florida Bill Would Protect Developmentally Disabled During Police Interviews"}, "nid": 13137, "datePublished": "2016-01-04", "keywords": "mental health, developmentally disabled, Wes Kleinert Fair Interview Act", "wordCount": 493, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Florida could soon be the first state to require a mental-health expert to be present during police interviews of developmentally disabled suspects or victims.\nListen to the story airing on 89.9 WJCTFive years ago, Ellen Kleinert-Cohn\u2019s autistic son Wes was being driven home by his coach in South Florida.\nIf passed, the bill would mandate a mental-health expert be present during any interview of a developmentally disabled person, whether he's a suspect or a victim.\nThat\u2019s if lawmakers approve a bill called the Wes Kleinert Fair Interview Act.\nShe says, \u201cOur goal is to lessen the probability of this happening to people like Wes during the interview process."}
