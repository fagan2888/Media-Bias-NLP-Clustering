Norman police are now investigating a homicide after a shooting victim died from his injuries.

It happened on Lindsey Street near 12th Avenue Southeast. Police got the call just before 10 p.m. from the Summerfield Village apartment complex, which is just a half a mile east of the OU campus. Officers arrived and found the victim, 41-year-old Kenneth Keeling, lying on the ground suffering from a gunshot wound.

Keeling was transported to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries, according to police.

Detectives spent several hours here collecting evidence and talking to whoever may have heard or saw anything leading up to this shooting. But police said the problem is they're getting multiple stories from multiple people.

They also spent several hours canvassing the area, but still, the search for a suspect has come up empty.

Right now they don't know the reason behind the shooting or how many people could be involved.

If you have any information which can help them you're asked to call Norman Police.
