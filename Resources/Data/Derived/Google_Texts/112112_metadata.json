I\u2019ve been looking for a news peg on which to hang some comments on Lilla\u2019s argument, and I think I\u2019ve found one in the news that the ISIS terrorist organization, a.k.a. the de facto government of eastern Syria and western Iraq, has taken the high-risk step of actually declaring a reborn caliphate in its conquered territory. The connection here is that one of Lilla\u2019s themes is the way our ongoing end-of-history era has constricted the Western political imagination, leaving us unable to reckon with the complexities of a wider world where liberal democracy isn\u2019t obviously spreading anymore:\n\n\u2026 During the cold war, scholars convinced of democracy\u2019s absolute and unique goodness abandoned the traditional study of non-democratic forms of government, such as monarchy, aristocracy, oligarchy, and tyranny, and took instead to distinguishing regimes along a single line running from democracy (good) to totalitarianism (bad) \u2026 This way of thinking gave rise to the na\u00efve assumption that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, countries would naturally begin making \u201ctransitions\u201d from dictatorship and authoritarianism to democracy, as if by magnetic attraction. That confidence has now evaporated, and our political scientists have seen that under the cloak of elections many unpleasant things can grow. But they still want to hold on to their little line and so they write articles about electoral authoritarianism, competitive authoritarianism, clan authoritarianism, pseudo-democracies, fa\u00e7ade democracies, and weak democracies. And, just to cover the bases, \u201chybrid regimes.\u201d But in the mind of America\u2019s political and journalistic classes, only two political categories exist today: democracy and le d\u00e9luge \u2026\n\n[And yet] the truth is that billions of people will not be living in liberal democracies in our lifetimes or those of our children or grandchildren\u2014if ever. This is due not only to culture and mores: to these must be added ethnic divisions, religious sectarianism, illiteracy, economic injustice, senseless national borders imposed by colonial powers \u2026 the list is long \u2026 So the only sensible question to ask when thinking about today\u2019s non-democracies is: what\u2019s Plan B? \u2026 if the only choices we can imagine are democracy or le d\u00e9luge, we exclude the possibility of improving non-democratic regimes without either trying forcibly to transform them (American-style) or hoping vainly (European-style) that human rights treaties, humanitarian interventions, legal sanctions, NGO projects, and bloggers with iPhones will make a lasting difference. These are the utterly characteristic delusions of our two continents. The next Nobel Peace Prize should not go to a human rights activist or an NGO founder. It should go to the thinker or leader who develops a model of constitutional theocracy giving Muslim countries a coherent way of recognizing yet limiting the authority of religious law and making it compatible with good governance. This would be a historic, though not necessarily democratic, achievement.\n\nAs with many points in the essay, I\u2019m in what you might call very strong partial agreement. The intellectual constriction Lilla is describing is quite real: To pluck a minor example from the world of punditry, you can see it at work in the way the word \u201cautocracy,\u201d a perfectly serviceable term for a system of government that formally concentrates power in a single individual, is now routinely employed to describe just about any regime (from Moscow to Beijing to Caracas) that isn\u2019t liberal and democratic, thereby effacing crucial distinctions between what are usually actually different forms of oligarchy \u2014 some more meritocratic, some more clannish, some more ideological, etc. (The irony is that it\u2019s been neoconservatives, whose long-ago and mostly-correct critique of a certain strain of realism was that it was often blind to the strategic implications of the differing nature of regimes, who have been most inclined to collapse categories this way.) And Lilla is right that Western policymaking has suffered, in Iraq and elsewhere, from a deep failure of political imagination, which (among other things) has made it harder to figure out what kind of non-liberal regimes it\u2019s in our interest to accept or support.\n\nBut \u2014 and here I\u2019ll let my Fukuyaman sympathies show \u2014 is it really right to imply that this constriction is exclusively an American and European intellectual phenomenon? Aren\u2019t we also responding to the fact that most non-Western regimes themselves don\u2019t want to abjure the democratic ideal, and instead either aspire to or pretend to represent some variant on our system? Even when they\u2019re really tyrannies, almost every government on the planet at least calls itself a democratic republic; almost every military coup, from Thailand to Egypt, is accompanied by promises that democracy will eventually be restored; almost every dictator or ruling clique feels an obligation to hold some sort of elections to rubber-stamp their rule. We have, as Lilla says, many functional oligarchies and pseudo-monarchies and combinations thereof around the world, but we have many fewer that self-identify that way, and even many states that do make some sort of distinctive self-identification \u2014 notably Iran, with its presiding theocratic guardians \u2014 still tend to also ground their claim to legitimacy in some version of democracy, some kind of ballot box procedures.\n\nThere are, yes, full exceptions: The Gulf monarchies are actual monarchies, and the Chinese regime, notwithstanding the \u201cpeople\u2019s republic\u201d label, doesn\u2019t hold potemkin presidential elections or consistently pretend that a democratic transition is just around the corner. But China\u2019s exceptionalism is also incoherent: It represents an alternative system of government, but it\u2019s an alternative that cannot speak its name, because acknowledging its real status as a quasi-meritocratic corporatist (fascist?) oligarchy would require stripping away the faded patina of Marxist-Maoist orthodoxy, with uncertain and unsettling consequences for the regime. And nobody setting up a new government looks to the gulf monarchies as a model; they\u2019re treated as either necessary anachronisms or relics of barbarism by just about every contending party. We don\u2019t see major monarchist parties emerging dictatorships unsettled by the Arab Spring, and none of today\u2019s populist authoritarians have followed Napoleon\u2019s example and crowned themselves as emperors or kings. For all the windy nationalistic theorizing and \u201cHoly Alliance\u201d ambitions associated with Putin\u2019s regime, he\u2019s still President Putin, not Tsar Vladimir IV.\n\nNow there\u2019s a chicken-and-an-egg issue here: Non-western states don\u2019t want to explicitly identify as illiberal or non-democratic in part because it\u2019s still (mostly) in their interest to remain in American and European good graces and at least pretend to play by the international community\u2019s (Western) rules, so you can\u2019t just say that we\u2019re responding to their choices; we\u2019re obviously shaping those choices as well, and who gets the Nobel Peace Prize is the least of the ways in which we do. But non-Western agency is still a very important part of the story here, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why the democracy-or-the-deluge framework is so intellectually resilient. It isn\u2019t that that we can\u2019t envision alternatives; it\u2019s that even where they half-exist, nobody else wants to take full ownership of one either, or to attempt to ground their government\u2019s legitimacy in a completely different form of soil.\n\nExcept, as of the last week, for the ruthless gentlemen of ISIS. I do not expect that their caliphate will long endure, but their declaration points to a deeper truth. If anything happens to shake the Western elite\u2019s post-1991 assumptions about liberal democracy and its rivals, it probably won\u2019t be an intellectual shift within our own ranks. Rather, it will take the emergence of a rival that isn\u2019t merely different but fully owns its difference, and that finds a way to prove, against what I still think are reasonable Fukuyaman assumptions, that a regime that\u2019s truly and self-consciously different can actually succeed.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140702140901, "BN": "douthat", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/douthat", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/douthat/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 2, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1404324541, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/rossdouthat/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-07-02T18:11:55-04:00"}, "keywords": "Fukuyama Francis,Lilla Mark,Democracy (Theory and Philosophy),Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS),Beijing (China),Europe,Iraq,Moscow (Russia),Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/douthat/No One Expects the Caliphate ( 20140702 )", "description": "Political imagination at the end of history.", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "douthat", "sourceApp": "blogs", "per": "Fukuyama, Francis;Lilla, Mark", "twitter": {"description": "Political imagination at the end of history.", "title": "No One Expects the Caliphate", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/no-one-expects-the-caliphate/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@DouthatNYT", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002977934, "news_keywords": "Beijing,Democracy,Europe,Iraq,Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS),Moscow", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "July 2, 2014", "org": "Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS)", "geo": "Beijing (China);Europe;Iraq;Moscow (Russia)", "utime": 20140702181155, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140702, "pdate": 20140702, "des": "Democracy (Theory and Philosophy)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Ross Douthat", "description": "Political imagination at the end of history.", "title": "No One Expects the Caliphate", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/no-one-expects-the-caliphate/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/no-one-expects-the-caliphate/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "No One Expects the Caliphate", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1595\"", "article_summary": "I do not expect that their caliphate will long endure, but their declaration points to a deeper truth.\nthe de facto government of eastern Syria and western Iraq, has taken the high-risk step of actually declaring a reborn caliphate in its conquered territory.\nIf anything happens to shake the Western elite\u2019s post-1991 assumptions about liberal democracy and its rivals, it probably won\u2019t be an intellectual shift within our own ranks.\nThat confidence has now evaporated, and our political scientists have seen that under the cloak of elections many unpleasant things can grow.\noligarchy would require stripping away the faded patina of Marxist-Maoist orthodoxy, with uncertain and unsettling consequences for the regime."}
