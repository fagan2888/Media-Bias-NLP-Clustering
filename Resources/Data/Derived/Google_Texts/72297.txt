It might be one of the few examples where an acquisition resulted in a buyer’s stock taking off but that seems to be the case with Forest Laboratories Inc.’s purchase of privately held drug maker Aptalis, as Forest shares were up more than 15% pre-market and stayed that way into the first hour of trading Wednesday.

Forest /quotes/zigman/226825/delayed /quotes/nls/frx FRX blew past its 52-week high after announcing the $2.9 billion purchase of Aptalis from investment firm TPG and was up $8.64 to $67.40 in recent action.

Forest makes an array of drugs, treating everything from high blood pressure to depression, and is now adding an arsenal of cystic fibrosis and gastrointestinal medications to its product lineup with the Aptalis purchase.

Forest has a few products in those two arenas but has not ventured into the market to the same degree as Aptalis, which has several products in the gastrointestinal disorder sector and is introducing treatments for cystic fibrosis.

In a conference call, Forest Chief Executive Brenton L. Saunders said he expects the deal to be accretive immediately to earnings, adding roughly 78 cents a share for fiscal 2015. The deal should add $700 million to fiscal 2015 sales, he added.

Aptalis’s fiscal 2013 revenue was $688 million, he said, up 12% from 2012. Adjusted earnings were $350 million, up 29%. Aptalis has 1,000 employees spread out over three divisions: U.S. drug sales, overseas drug sales and a pharmaceutical manufacturing services group.
