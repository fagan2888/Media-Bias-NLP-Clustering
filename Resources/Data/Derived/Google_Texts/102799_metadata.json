Credit: Journal Sentinel files\n\nBy of the\n\nSTARTERS\n\n44 Frank Kaminsky (7-0 Sr. C): The Big Ten preseason player of the year has looked fantastic in preseason.\n\n15 Sam Dekker (6-9 Jr. F): Dekker is physically stronger and clearly more confident than last season.\n\n10 Nigel Hayes (6-8 Soph. F): Hayes has dropped more than 10 pounds to 235 and has added a three-point shot.\n\n21 Josh Gasser (6-4 Sr. G): With his surgically repaired left knee stronger, Gasser should be able to finish at the rim more frequently.\n\n12 Traevon Jackson (6-3 Sr. G): Jackson shined in the NCAA Tournament with 12.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.2 assists.\n\nRESERVES\n\n13 Duje Dukan (6-10 Sr. F): Dukan is ineligible for UW's first two games but he will provide scoring, rebounding and energy when he returns.\n\n24 Bronson Koenig (6-4, Soph. G): A natural point guard with incredible court vision, Koenig must be more consistent and assertive.\n\n3 Zak Showalter (6-2 Soph. G): After redshirting last season, Showalter should provide tenacity and energy.\n\n30 Vitto Brown (6-8 Soph. F): Brown should give UW rebounding and defense but he must learn to slow down.\n\n22 Ethan Happ (6-9 Fr. F): Happ probably should redshirt because of the frontcourt logjam, but he will be a player sooner rather than later.\n\n35 Riley Dearring (6-5 Fr. G): Despite redshirting last season, Dearring needs to get stronger, but he can shoot and his length will help eventually on defense.\n\n11 Jordan Hill (6-3 Soph. G): A tenacious defender who has improved his perimeter shot, Hill is contemplating redshirting because UW has enough guards.\n\n2 Jordan Smith (6-3 Jr. G): Smith is a valuable member of the scout team because of his perimeter shooting.\n\n5 Aaron Moesch (6-8 Fr. F): Moesch redshirted last season and will again push the starters in practice.\n\n20 T.J. Schlundt (6-5 Fr. G): Schlundt is a terrific perimeter shooter who could help down the road.\n\n4 Matt Ferris (6-6 Fr. G): A standout high school quarterback, Ferris will contribute on the scout team.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Wisconsin roster at a glance", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/badgers/wisconsin-roster-at-a-glance-b99383640z1-282053651.html", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99383640z.1_20141108233208_000_gpq8kfrk.1-1.jpg", "height": 1282}, "type": "article", "description": "Starters and reserves for the 2014-\u201915 Badgers.", "title": "Wisconsin roster at a glance"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99383640z.1_20141108233208_000_gpq8kfrk.1-1.jpg", "title": "Wisconsin roster at a glance", "description": "Starters and reserves for the 2014-\u201915 Badgers.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@journalsentinel"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0556\"", "article_summary": "12 Traevon Jackson (6-3 Sr. G): Jackson shined in the NCAA Tournament with 12.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.2 assists.\nRESERVES13 Duje Dukan (6-10 Sr. F): Dukan is ineligible for UW's first two games but he will provide scoring, rebounding and energy when he returns.\n15 Sam Dekker (6-9 Jr. F): Dekker is physically stronger and clearly more confident than last season.\n21 Josh Gasser (6-4 Sr. G): With his surgically repaired left knee stronger, Gasser should be able to finish at the rim more frequently.\nG): Despite redshirting last season, Dearring needs to get stronger, but he can shoot and his length will help eventually on defense."}
