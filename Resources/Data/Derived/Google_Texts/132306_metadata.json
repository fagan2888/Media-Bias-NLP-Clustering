(WFLA) \u2013 Barry and Jane Elson are stuck in an insurance nightmare. The couple thought a plan through the Affordable Care Act was the ticket to affordable health insurance. But so far, they\u2019ve spent hundreds only to have no insurance at all.\n\n\u201cWe started to get rejections on all of our bills,\u201d Jane Elson said. \u201cThe doctors weren\u2019t getting paid, and the pharmacy said they could no longer fill prescriptions.\u201d\n\nFirst, they bought a Florida Blue plan in September. But their doctors\u2019 claims were denied because of computer errors. And now, they owe thousands and face threats from collectors.\n\n\u201cNumber one, they listed my husband\u2019s gender as female and they had my date of birth incorrect,\u201d Jane Elson said.\n\nNo one at Florida Blue or the insurance marketplace would help. Then it got worse. Still fighting with Florida Blue, the couple decided to go with a different carrier for the new year. They paid nearly $500 for a plan with United Health Care. They received insurance cards and then, this week, an email stating they have \u201cno medical coverage.\u201d\n\nThe Elsons turned to 8 On Your Side for answers. 8 On Your Side went straight to the state regulators, the watchdogs for insurance companies. The case is now under review by the state to find out what went wrong and make it right.\n\n\u201cThis just turned into a huge problem,\u201d Barry Elson said. \u201cWe\u2019re just hoping it finally gets resolved.\u201d\n\nA state spokeswoman tells 8 On Your Side this should have never happened and promises an insurance expert will contact the couple next week to straighten out the issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barry and Jane Elson are stuck in an insurance nightmare.
