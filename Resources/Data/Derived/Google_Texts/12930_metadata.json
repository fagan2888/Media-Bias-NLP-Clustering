Krill with 58 seconds left in the game.\n\nAfter the game, Healy was asked if the loss could lead to a similar fall as a year ago, when Air Force stumbled to a 2-10 record, its worst ever.\n\nHealy hit as hard as he could with an emphatic no.\n\n\u201cLast year\u2019s team is in the rearview mirror,\u201d Healy said. \u201cThis is a completely new team. We ended up with a loss tonight and it hurts. We didn\u2019t play well enough. It wasn\u2019t one or two players, it was the whole team. That\u2019s football.\u201d\n\nAir Force coach Troy Calhoun agreed.\n\n\u201cWe had too many missed chances,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cWhen you get opportunities, you have to seize them.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons, 1-1 overall, 0-1 in the Mountain West, scored just one touchdown and their vaunted running game gained just 151 yards.\n\nQuarterback Kale Pearson had a career game with 226 yards on 17 completions, but the Air Force option offense is not designed to throw the ball that much.\n\nWyoming is 2-0 under first year coach Craig Bohl.\n\n\u201cThis was a hard fought win and we\u2019re going to enjoy it,\u201d Bohl said.\n\nAir Force consistently came up short on offense. In the third quarter, Air Force had just 50 yards.\n\n\u201cWe shot ourselves in the foot a couple of times between penalties and somebody not making a play,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cI think everyone wished they had some plays back tonight. Wyoming was keying on the run, but there were plays in our passing game we had to make.\u201d\n\nNext up for Air Force is a trip to Atlanta to play Georgia State. Wyoming plays at Oregon.\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or twitter.com/irvmoss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Late loss to Wyoming doesn\u2019t deter Air Force\u2019s confidence about season", "title": "Late loss to Wyoming doesn\u2019t deter Air Force\u2019s confidence about season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/07/late-loss-to-wyoming-doesnt-deter-air-forces-confidence-about-season/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140906__wyo-afap1-1.jpg", "height": 539}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140906__wyo-afap1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-07T16:42:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:48:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Air Force Academy"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e68\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe shot ourselves in the foot a couple of times between penalties and somebody not making a play,\u201d Pearson said.\nWyoming plays at Oregon.\nAfter the game, Healy was asked if the loss could lead to a similar fall as a year ago, when Air Force stumbled to a 2-10 record, its worst ever.\nLARAMIE \u2014 As a linebacker, Connor Healy plays with a relentess determination.\nIn the third quarter, Air Force had just 50 yards."}
