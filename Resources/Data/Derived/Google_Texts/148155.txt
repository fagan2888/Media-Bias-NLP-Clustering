The Thunder Beach Spring Rally may be a couple months away, but some rumbles of thunder could be heard in Panama City Beach Saturday.

Local bikers rode through Panama City Beach in the second annual "Hawgs with Hearts" event.

"Hawgs with Hearts" benefits the American Heart Association and this is one of the first fundraising events of the year.

One of the bikers says they attend this event to support the American Heart Association and all their hard work.

"There is so much help the American Heart Association gives all across the United States," said Michael Husava. "From small children, to the elderly, everybody that has heart conditions, heart problems, the training. There is really nobody in America who doesn't know somebody who hasn't been touched by the American Heart Association."

If you want to find out more about the American Heart Association, their website is www.heart.org. The next event from the American Heart Association will be the "Heart Ball" on March 14th. Information for that event can be found at http://bayheartball.ahaevents.org/
