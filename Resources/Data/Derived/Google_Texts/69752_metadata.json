Breitbart Texas reported that the man, 46-year-old Christopher David Dunn, a former sheriff\u2019s deputy, was fighting a Texas hospital that wanted to stop the care.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe local ABC affiliate in Houston has reported that one of Dunn\u2019s attorneys has confirmed that he has died.\n\nDunn was fully-conscious and asked his mother and attorneys to fight for his life. When asked whether he wanted to hire lawyers to fight for him, Dunn placed his hands in the prayer position. A video was made showing that the former peace officer and EMT wanted to fight for his life.\n\nHis mother, Evelyn Kelly, said a hospital administrative death panel from Houston Methodist Hospital, was \u201cplaying God.\u201d\n\nDunn is a former sheriff\u2019s deputy and has worked as a Homeland Security officer but had no health insurance when he got sick. He had been in the hospital for approximately ten weeks since a noncancerous mass was found where his small intestine connects to the pancreas. Ms. Kelly said the mass was squeezing off the small intestine and was affecting his liver and kidneys.\n\nThe distraught mother told Breitbart Texas in early December, \u201cThe hospital wants to turn Chris\u2019 nutrients and extra air off and they are playing God. They want to kill my son. They say there is nothing else they can do for him, but I don\u2019t believe that.\u201d \u201cWhen they found out that Chris did not have insurance, they said they were done,\u201d Chris\u2019 mother exclaimed.\n\nAs reported by Breitbart Texas on December 11, Dunn\u2019s mother said the hospital wanted to turn the breathing machine off and administer a dose of morphine and another drug she did not know the name of. She was told it would only take three to five minutes for Chris to die if the drugs were administered.\n\nThe man, his mother, and his lawyers, filed a lawsuit in an attempt to save the man\u2019s life. His attorney, Joe Nixon, told Breitbart Texas at the time, \u201cA criminal on death row in Texas has more rights than a patient in a Texas hospital.\u201d He says a Texas statute denies a patient all due process rights and is unconstitutional.\n\nAnother lawyer who was representing Dunn, Trey Trainor, says Texas law gives a hospital the right to make life or death decisions without consulting the patient or the patient\u2019s family.\n\nDunn was fully conscious but was receiving oxygen and antibiotics through two tubes down his throat. He was receiving fluids and nutrients intravenously. His lawyers and his mother said he was capable of making his own decisions but had difficulty speaking because of the two tubes in his throat.\n\nHospital officials were fighting to stop his treatment and filed for a court to appoint a guardian to make decisions for him. Dunn filed suit but the hospital filed their own lawsuit asking that a guardian be appointed for Dunn. Dunn and his mother, Evelyn Kelly, had been making choices regarding his care.\n\nDunn and his lawyers were not able to get a court hearing date in the guardianship suit before he died.\n\nLana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.
