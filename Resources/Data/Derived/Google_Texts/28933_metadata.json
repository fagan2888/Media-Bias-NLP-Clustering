The Apple iPhone 5S unveiling will take place on September 10 at some sort of special Apple event.\n\nA leaked Apple employee calendar seems to confirm the Apple iPhone 5S release date in September because it restricts the amount of time off AppleCare employees can take from September 15 through September 28.

Apple will be upgrading the iPhone lineup with iOS 7\u2032s new interface and also Apple iTunes Radio. The latest Apple iPhone 5S and 6 rumors say Apple is expected to upgrade to a faster processor, improved retina display, NFC support, 4G, 802.11ac wireless networking, and a low-cost version of its popular iPhone line. Apple iPhone 6 and 5S rumors also say the iPhone 5S will incorporate fingerprint detection security measures since Apple purchased Authentec.\n\nAre these new features enough to make you stand in line on the Apple iPhone 5S release date?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The iPhone 5S release date rumor may have inadvertently been confirmed by the Apple employee calendar.
