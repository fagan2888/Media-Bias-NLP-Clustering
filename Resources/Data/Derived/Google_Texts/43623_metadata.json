This is not leadership. This is paramount to stealing from hard working law enforcement officers.\n\n\u201cThe New Jersey pension system is not one monolithic fund that is losing money daily. In fact, the State manages five pension plans for State and local employees. Of those five, PFRS is financed mainly by local governments, law enforcement officers and firefighters who have been making their required pension payments, even with the additional 1.5% required from Governor Christie\u2019s own Chapter 78 legislation of 2011. The PFRS system is stable at almost 77% and the only thing holding it back from operating at an almost 90% funding level is the governor\u2019s broken promise.\u201d\n\nIf Chapter 78 purports to be the law, why keep it when the court\u2019s decision this morning mowed it down?\n\nThat was the rationale behind Colligan\u2019s case in the aftermath.\n\n\u201cChapter 78 mandated both employer and employee sacrifices to provide funding to support the pension system,\u201d he said, citing Christie\u2019s and the Democratic Legislature\u2019s 2011 Act creating the pension overhaul. \u201d If it is only the employees who are required to make those sacrifices now under the Court\u2019s ruling, then I am hereby calling on the Legislature to immediately repeal Chapter 78 in its entirety. It is only fair that this broken bargain be taken off our backs if the Administration refuses to do what it promised so clearly in 2011.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/njspba-president1.jpg?w=50", "description": "New Jersey State Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association President Patrick Colligan expressed disappointment in the Supreme Court's ruling today and zeroed in on the crux of the court's argument, calling the Legislature to immediately repeal Chapter 78.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "description": "New Jersey State Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association President Patrick Colligan expressed disappointment in the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling today and zeroed in on the crux of the court\u2019s argu\u2026", "title": "After High Court ruling, PBA Prez Colligan demands the burial of Chapter 78", "url": "http://politickernj.com/2015/06/after-high-court-ruling-pba-prez-colligan-demands-the-burial-of-chapter-78/", "image": {"width": 250, "identifier": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/njspba-president1.jpg", "height": 250}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/njspba-president1.jpg?w=240", "site": "@PolitickerNJ", "card": "summary", "creator": "@PolitickerNJ"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-09 11:05:13", "sailthru.title": "After High Court ruling, PBA Prez Colligan demands the burial of Chapter 78", "fb": {"app_id": 710865528969413}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politickernj.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "keywords": "pat colligan", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PolitickerNJ", "published_time": "2015-06-09T15:05:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-09T15:05:13+00:00", "author": "http://wordpress.com/author/max"}, "sailthru.description": "New Jersey State Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association President Patrick Colligan expressed disappointment in the Supreme Court's ruling today and zeroed in on the crux of the court's argument, calling the Legislature to immediately repeal Chapter 78.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/njspba-president1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Pat Colligan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccbd9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cToday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling is disappointing because it fails to make Governor Christie keep his promise to hard working law enforcement officers.\nThis is paramount to stealing from hard working law enforcement officers.\n\u201cChapter 78 mandated both employer and employee sacrifices to provide funding to support the pension system,\u201d he said, citing Christie\u2019s and the Democratic Legislature\u2019s 2011 Act creating the pension overhaul.\nNew Jersey State Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association President Patrick Colligan expressed disappointment in the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling today and zeroed in on the crux of the court\u2019s argument, calling the Legislature to immediately repeal Chapter 78.\n\u201cThe New Jersey pension system is not one monolithic fund that is losing money daily."}
