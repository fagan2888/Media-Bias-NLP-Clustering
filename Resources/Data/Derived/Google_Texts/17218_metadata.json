None of them seem to have any problem now, however, unloading about just how much of a mess it is.\n\n\u201cIf you repeal the Affordable Care Act, you\u2019ve got to have a serious way to expand coverage to replace what you have taken away,\u201d said Gail R. Wilensky, who was the administrator of Medicare and Medicaid under President George Bush from 1990 to 1992. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I see in Trump\u2019s plan that would do anything more than cover a couple million people.\u201d Robert Laszewski, a former insurance executive and frequent critic of the health law, called Mr. Trump\u2019s health care proposals \u201ca jumbled hodgepodge of old Republican ideas, randomly selected, that don\u2019t fit together.\u201d [\u2026] James C. Capretta, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative nonprofit group, said Mr. Trump underestimated how difficult it would be to uproot a law that was now embedded in the nation\u2019s health care system. [\u2026] \"I just don\u2019t see that in Trump\u2019s vague plans to repeal the law and replace it with something beautiful and great.\u201d [\u2026] Grace-Marie Turner, the president of the Galen Institute, a champion of free-market health policy, said Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals were sketchy and inadequate.\n\nAll of which Trump's chief policy adviser, Sam Clovis, dismisses in a manner that's totally emblematic of the entire campaign. When it comes to policy, there just isn't any beyond a bunch of catch phrases and emphatic bluster from Trump.\n\nClovis says that his candidate is running against the political establishment, so these criticisms just don't matter because he's not relying on \"traditional establishment Republican people\" like them. Instead he has a half-dozen or so advisers who are \"very prominent people,\" but who \"are not ready to have their support of the Trump campaign known.\"\n\nYeah, I bet they're not anxious to be known.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Donald Trump's objectively awful healthcare \"plan\" continues to baffle and \"exasperate\" Republican policy types who are going to have be responsible for defending it\u2014and him\u2014should he get the nomination.
