Liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat, Americans by the millions are rightly wondering, \u201cWho\u2019s running the show?\u201d\n\nThese twin blunders transcend party politics and cut to something more fundamentally frustrating \u2014 rampant incompetence.\n\nThe \u201cI\u201d word isn\u2019t used much in Washington. Partisans tend to ascribe nefarious motives to every move made by their political opponents when oftentimes the culprit is simple human foibles.\n\nGranted some foibles are writ larger than others; unconnected dots led to the Sept. 11 attacks and \u201cfaulty\u201d intelligence justified the invasion of the wrong country, Iraq, when the terror attacks came from Afghanistan with Saudi Arabian terrorists flying the planes.\n\nStill, the Obamacare mess and iPad snafu are not bumps in the road. They\u2019ve become par for the course, emblematic of governmental bungling at every level.\n\nAs reported in the Daily News, the giant retaining walls along the 405 were crumbling before they were even completed and now we learn the new runway at LAX is also failing apart.\n\nAdded to an epidemic of sexual shenanigans by elected officials and the mean-spirited and self-serving posturing that passes for political discourse and it\u2019s small wonder we\u2019re suffering from a crisis in confidence.\n\nEvery day I encounter remarkable men and women who are great at what they do and work hard to be great at what they do. They rarely hold public office.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say private industry doesn\u2019t produce its share of doofuses and maddening bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo. Try reading your cellphone contract if you don\u2019t believe me. But commercial transactions are voluntary, government isn\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best and the brightest? I\u2019d like some names please.\n\nInstead we get mistake after mistake, and it\u2019s never anyone\u2019s fault.\n\nWe\u2019re told that kids easily working their way around the LAUSD\u2019s security firewalls to surf for porn, video games and other areas of academic interest on their free iPads was simply overblown nonsense \u2014 minor bumps in the road anticipated by the IT savants at LAUSD.\n\nThen there was the issue of the $38 million keyboards necessary to make the iPads compatible with the Common Core tests the state of California will offer only in digital form.\n\nAnd there appears to be a little confusion over who\u2019s on the hook for the loss, theft or damage to the $678 iPads.\n\nNow we learn the actual price of the iPads isn\u2019t $678, but $770 per tablet, a 14 percent hike, and the special educational software is still in \u201cdevelopment.\u201d\n\nThose bells you hear ringing aren\u2019t school bells, they\u2019re alarm bells. Remember the LAUSD\u2019s computer payroll system? Software problems ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nUltimately the Affordable Care Act and the iPad program may prove to be not only successful but visionary. I\u2019m open to that possibility.\n\nBut skepticism is justified based on the long history of misinformation, spin and outright lies that have been fed to a too-patient public left holding the bag for every blunder ... pardon me, every bump in the road.\n\nDoug McIntyre\u2019s column appears Sunday and Wednesday.
