But the underlying cost of healthcare in the United States is so high that too many Americans remain underinsured \u2013 both in employer-sponsored insurance and in the individual market. Two surveys released this week document the toll that underinsurance takes.\n\nA Commonwealth Fund survey found that among those American adults under age 65 who were insured throughout 2014, 23 percent were underinsured \u2013 that is, their deductibles and copays were high enough to cause severe financial strain. That top line is almost unchanged since 2010; the real damage on this front was done from 2005 to 2010, when employers started shifting costs en masse to employees.\n\nBut deductibles in employer-sponsored plans do keep rising \u2013 especially for employees of small firms. In 2010, 7 percent of small-firm employees had deductibles that were more than 5 percent of their income; by 2014, 20 percent did.\n\nCommonwealth defines as underinsured those who are exposed to out-of-pocket costs that equal 10 percent or more of household income \u2013 or 5 percent for those whose income is less than twice the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) \u2013 and those whose deductible is 5 percent of more of family income. Half of survey respondents in this category said that they have problems paying their medical bills or said that they were paying off medical debt. That\u2019s almost an eighth of the insured adult population under 65.\n\nLow-income insureds do a bit better\n\nCommonwealth did find an improvement in the share of low-income people who are underinsured \u2013 from 49 percent in 2010 to 44 percent in 2012 to 42 percent in 2014. \u201cLow-income\u201d here means a household income under 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL).\n\nCommonwealth locates the drop mainly among Medicaid beneficiaries. Going forward, relatively robust insurance available to low-income buyers of private plans on the exchanges established by the ACA may also be a factor. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey of those who purchased health insurance on the individual market indicates that low-income buyers\u2019 inherent disadvantage is partially offset by the ACA\u2019s sliding subsidy structure, which reduces out-of-pocket costs as well as premiums for lower income buyers.\n\nOverall, the Kaiser survey, conducted in early 2015, found that 85 percent of those who bought ACA-compliant plans rate their plans as \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201cexcellent.\u201d That\u2019s lower than the approval rate for employer-sponsored plans, but it does indicate a solid baseline of satisfaction.\n\nWhen we come to measures of underinsurance, the picture is more mixed. Among those with ACA-compliant plans (including those sold off-exchange), 38 percent say that they still feel vulnerable to high medical bills. Fifty-seven percent say that they feel well-protected by their plans.\n\nThe uneasiness extends both to premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Among those in ACA-compliant plans, 31 percent say it is somewhat difficult to pay the monthly premium, and 15 percent say it is very difficult. Sixteen percent say they have had problems paying medical bills, and 18 percent that they did not fill a prescription because of the cost.\n\nKaiser respondents with higher deductible plans are more likely than those with lower deductibles to say they feel vulnerable to high medical bills, 55 percent to 22 percent. But in the individual market, those with high-deductible plans have higher incomes on average \u2013 the reverse of the situation in employer-sponsored insurance. They therefore are about equally likely to report problems paying medical bills as those in low-deductible plans. The vulnerability \u2013 too high across the board \u2013 is evenly spread. Why is that?\n\nA little-known subsidy goes a long way\n\nShoppers on ACA exchanges with incomes under 200 percent FPL are eligible for Cost Sharing Reduction subsidies (CSR) in addition to premium subsidies \u2013 albeit only if they buy Silver-level plans instead of the cheapest Bronze level (or more expensive Gold or Platinum). CSR vastly reduces deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for those under 200 percent FPL (and much more weakly for those in the 200-250 percent FPL range). A CSR-enhanced silver plan pays 94 percent of the average user\u2019s yearly out-of-pocket costs for buyers under 150 percent FPL and 88 percent of those costs for buyers between 150 and 200 percent FPL. That\u2019s better coverage than most employer-sponsored plans offer.\n\nKaiser\u2019s respondents self-report their deductibles to be lower at lower income levels. Among those below 138 percent FPL, 14 percent report themselves to be in a high-deductible plan \u2013 defined by Kaiser as more than $1,500 per individual \u2013 versus 44 percent in low deductible plans. Among those with incomes between 138 and 250 percent FPL, the split is nearly even: 23 percent high, 24 percent low (many in each category are unsure). The percentage of those with high-deductible plans rises with each step up in income bracket.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that Kaiser does not provide a figure on this question for buyers with incomes below 200 percent FPL, because that is the level at which CSR tapers off abruptly. My own analysis of HHS enrollment figures indicates that over 80 percent of buyers on the federal exchange with incomes under 200 percent FPL buy Silver plans and so access CSR \u2013 but Silver plan takeup falls off abruptly above that 200 percent threshold. Though Kaiser lumps the 200-250 percent FPL cohort together with those at a lower level, its numbers still indicate that CSR is providing significant protection against underinsurance to lower income buyers.\n\nStrapped Americans stretched thin\n\nNot enough, though. Taken together, Kaiser and Commonwealth show that large numbers of insured Americans in all forms of insurance \u2013 Medicaid and disability Medicare as well as private and employer-sponsored insurance \u2013 suffer severe financial harm and forego needed medical care because they are underinsured.\n\nCompounding the problem of underinsurance is the overall financial precariousness of American households. Kaiser asked respondents what they would do if they were faced with an unexpected medical bill of $500 or $1500 that insurance did not cover (as Americans all too frequently are).\n\nOnly 44 percent overall said that they would pay the $500 bill without borrowing; only 26 percent could manage to do so for the $1,500 bill. Those results jibe with a survey recently conducted by Bankrate, which found that only 38 percent of Americans would pay for a $500 or $1000 emergency out of savings.\n\nThe ACA has dramatically cut the ranks of the uninsured \u2013 to 11.9 percent of the population, down from 18 percent in mid-2013, according to Gallup. For buyers with incomes under 200 percent FPL in the individual market \u2013 who constitute 68 percent of all buyers on HealthCare.gov \u2013 Cost Sharing Reduction reduces the risk of underinsurance for most. But many buyers at higher income levels \u2013 and a significant minority below 200 percent FPL \u2013 do face very high deductibles and copays.\n\nThe ACA has improved Americans\u2019 access to affordable healthcare. But we have a long way to go.\n\nPostscript\n\nA third study released this week, from the Urban Institute, finds that 9.4 million fewer Americans are having trouble medical bills as of the first quarter of 2015 than in the first quarter of 2013, prior to the ACA launch.\n\nBut the study does not differentiate between those who have trouble paying bills because they are uninsured and those who have trouble because they are underinsured, nor does it speculate as to the causes of the drop.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act has taken a big bite out of the ranks of the uninsured.
