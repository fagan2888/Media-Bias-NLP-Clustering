Ibank Houlihan Lokey Buys Bridge Strategy Group

Los Angeles investment bank Houlihan Lokey has acquired Bridge Strategy Group for an undisclosed amount.

Bridge, headquartered in Chicago, is a strategy, operations and performance-improvement consulting firm. Houlihan made an investment in the group in August.

The deal gives Houlihan Lokey, which already has corporate finance, financial restructuring and financial advisory services, a new business line Â– strategic consulting. Bridge CEO Steve Sheridan will lead the new strategic consulting business.

The buyer made another acquisition in March, adding ArchPoint Partners, a San Francisco-based software and technology adviser.

Other recent financial advisory deals have come from AlixPartners, which picked up Evidence Exchange in November, and KPMG, which acquired the global trade management practice of EntryPoint Consulting, also in November.
