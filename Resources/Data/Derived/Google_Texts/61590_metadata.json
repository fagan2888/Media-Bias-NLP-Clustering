File/Grace Beahm/Staff\n\nMedicaid expansion under Obamacare would save nearly 200 lives in South Carolina each year, a new White House report claims.\n\nThis \u201cleaves no doubt that the consequences of states\u2019 decisions are far-reaching, with major implications for the health of their citizens and their economies,\u201d Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in a news release about the report.\n\nThe federal health care law intended to expand eligibility for the low-income health insurance program to millions more Americans, but the U.S. Supreme Court decided three years ago that states could decline federal money to participate.\n\nAn unrelated Supreme Court ruling will determine this month if HealthCare.gov customers may use federal subsidies to lower the cost they pay for private insurance policies.\n\nGov. Nikki Haley\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a question about the White House report on Thursday, but she has steadfastly opposed expanding Medicaid since the high court issued its 2012 ruling.\n\nTwenty-one other states are also opting out of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAn estimated 160,000 South Carolina residents would qualify for Medicaid next year if the state expanded the health insurance program, the White House report shows. Other reports push that estimate closer to 250,000.\n\nThe White House also projects an additional 23,300 people in South Carolina would get a cholesterol screening, 6,500 more women would get a mammogram and 9,700 more women would get cervical cancer screening next year if the state expanded Medicaid.\n\nThis access to the health care system would save 190 lives in South Carolina, the report said. By comparison, Medicaid expansion would prevent 900 deaths in Florida and 1,330 deaths in Texas.\n\nRepublicans in those states chose not to expand Medicaid either.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s economy stands to benefit from Medicaid expansion, too, the White House argued. The analysis shows 22 states that have not expanded Medicaid would receive an additional $29 billion in federal funds next year if they changed course.\n\nRozalynn Goodwin, vice president for community engagement for the S.C. Hospital Association, said this state will forfeit nearly $12 billion federal dollars available for Medicaid expansion between 2014 and 2020.\n\n\u201cWhy would we not take these dollars? I think people are hearing that more,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s resounding with them that we\u2019re sending those dollars to other states and not using them on our own citizens.\u201d\n\nThe Hospital Association supports Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe S.C. Chamber of Commerce never took an official position on the issue, but Chamber President Ted Pitts implied that the White House report is biased.\n\n\u201cSouth Carolina should not read too much into a report commissioned by the federal government that says the federal government was right on the Affordable Care Act, especially in the early stages of some states expanding Medicaid,\u201d said Pitts, who resigned as Haley\u2019s chief of staff last year to lead the state Chamber of Commerce. \u201cStates should decide what is best for their state.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina residents whose income falls below 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $16,000 a year for a single adult or about $33,500 for a family of four \u2014 would qualify for Medicaid if this state participated in the expansion.\n\nBut Medicaid eligibility rules, as they stand, are very strict in South Carolina. Childless adults, with few exceptions, do not qualify for coverage, no matter how poor they are.\n\nStill, more than 1 million people in South Carolina, most of them children, are already enrolled in a Medicaid plan. The program costs the state about $7 billion to administer each year, most of which is covered by the federal government.\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at 937-5598.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "White House says Medicaid expansion in South Carolina would save lives, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Medicaid expansion under Obamacare would save nearly 200 lives in South Carolina each year, a new White House report claims.", "title": "White House says Medicaid expansion in South Carolina would save lives", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150604/150609670/white-house-says-medicaid-expansion-in-south-carolina-would-save-lives", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150604/PC16/150609670/AR/0/AR-150609670.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150604/PC16/150609670/AR/0/AR-150609670.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Medicaid expansion under Obamacare would save nearly 200 lives in South Carolina each year, a new White House report claims.", "title": "White House says Medicaid expansion in South Carolina would save lives", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150604/PC16/150609670/AR/0/AR-150609670.jpg?201506041645", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150609670}}, "keywords": "White House says Medicaid expansion in South Carolina would save lives , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-04T15:51:19Z", "modified_time": "2015-06-04T16:45:00Z", "author": "Lauren Sausser"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Medicaid expansion under Obamacare would save nearly 200 lives in South Carolina each year, a new White House report claims."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce683\"", "article_summary": "File/Grace Beahm/StaffMedicaid expansion under Obamacare would save nearly 200 lives in South Carolina each year, a new White House report claims.\nConservative leaders in South Carolina will not expand Medicaid eligibility under Obamacare, even though the White House says it would save lives.\nAn estimated 160,000 South Carolina residents would qualify for Medicaid next year if the state expanded the health insurance program, the White House report shows.\nStill, more than 1 million people in South Carolina, most of them children, are already enrolled in a Medicaid plan.\nSouth Carolina\u2019s economy stands to benefit from Medicaid expansion, too, the White House argued."}
