The office provides nonpartisan budget analysis for members of Congress that includes estimates of the cost of legislation.\n\nElmendorf, 52, an economist with experience at the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, was appointed to run the CBO in 2009 when then-director Peter Orszag was picked by President Barack Obama to run the White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\n\u201cHis background insulates his rulings and the congressional Republicans who choose to reappoint him from accusations of bias.\u201d Keith Hennessey\n\nIn 2011, Elmendorf won a full four-year term, after Republicans took control of the House while Democrats retained the Senate. A CBO conclusion that Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement -- the 2010 Affordable Care Act -- was cutting costs pleased Democrats, while Republicans appreciated the office\u2019s finding that the health-care law and a proposed minimum wage increase would cost jobs.\n\nEven as Democrats lost their Senate majority in the November election, some economists who side with Republicans said that Elmendorf should keep his job.\n\nAnalysis Questioned\n\n\u201cHis background insulates his rulings and the congressional Republicans who choose to reappoint him from accusations of bias,\u201d wrote Keith Hennessey, who served as President George W. Bush\u2019s final director of the National Economic Council and is now a lecturer at Stanford University\u2019s business school.\n\nRepublican lawmakers who have questioned the office\u2019s analysis were unmoved. They agreed with calls from incoming House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price for a new director who might introduce so-called dynamic scoring to CBO analysis.\n\nDynamic scoring is the idea that policy changes can induce significant macroeconomic effects, such as tax cuts partially paying for themselves. Democrats say the method is unproven and relies on too many assumptions.\n\nPrice, a Georgia Republican, had previously introduced a bill to require a dynamic score from the CBO, and the Republican House passed the measure.\n\nPrice\u2019s office declined to comment.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "Conservatives would like to change the way the CBO conducts its budget analysis.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ism9M1qRznn0/v7/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "Conservatives would like to change the way the CBO conducts its budget analysis.", "title": "Republicans Block Reappointment of CBO Chief Doug Elmendorf", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-22/cbo-chief-elmendorf-said-not-to-win-reappointment-by-republicans", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ism9M1qRznn0/v7/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives would like to change the way the CBO conducts its budget analysis.", "title": "Republicans Block Reappointment of CBO Chief Doug Elmendorf", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-22/cbo-chief-elmendorf-said-not-to-win-reappointment-by-republicans", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ism9M1qRznn0/v7/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "Conservatives would like to change the way the CBO conducts its budget analysis."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Republicans Block Reappointment of CBO Chief Doug Elmendorf", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NH05T16K50XY01", "parsely-author": "David Weigel", "date": "2014-12-22T21:32:42.118Z", "keywords": "Minimum Wage,Partisan Accounting", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Minimum Wage,Partisan Accounting", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-12-22T21:32:42.118Z", "parsely-tags": "Minimum Wage,Partisan Accounting,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-22/cbo-chief-elmendorf-said-not-to-win-reappointment-by-republicans"}, "article_summary": "Price, a Georgia Republican, had previously introduced a bill to require a dynamic score from the CBO, and the Republican House passed the measure.\nIncoming Republican leaders in Congress won\u2019t reappoint Doug Elmendorf to another term as head of the Congressional Budget Office, according to a party aide briefed on the decision.\nThey agreed with calls from incoming House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price for a new director who might introduce so-called dynamic scoring to CBO analysis.\nEven as Democrats lost their Senate majority in the November election, some economists who side with Republicans said that Elmendorf should keep his job.\nThe office provides nonpartisan budget analysis for members of Congress that includes estimates of the cost of legislation."}
