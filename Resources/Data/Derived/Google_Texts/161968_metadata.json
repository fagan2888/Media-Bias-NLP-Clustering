More than a dozen people on the bus and the other occupant of the vehicle were injured, authorities said.\n\nThe accident happened about 5:30 a.m. on Interstate 30, Arlington Police spokesman Lt. Christopher Cook said.\n\nGreyhound spokeswoman Lanesha Gipson says there were 40 passengers and a driver aboard the bus, which was headed from Dallas to Amarillo. Sixteen people sustained injuries that weren\u2019t life-threatening, Cook said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear if the deceased woman was the driver or passenger of the sport utility vehicle. Cook said a man in the vehicle was taken to the hospital with serious injuries.\n\nCook said that just minutes before the bus hit the vehicle, authorities had gotten a call that a vehicle being driven erratically had hit a concrete barrier and become disabled. He said authorities are trying to determine what caused the erratic driving.\n\nThe westbound lanes of Interstate 30 were closed while police investigated and reopened at about 1:30 p.m.\n\nGipson said another bus picked up the remaining passengers to take them on to Amarillo.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A woman died Sunday morning after the vehicle she was traveling in stalled on a North Texas interstate after crashing into a barrier and was hit by a Greyhound bus.
