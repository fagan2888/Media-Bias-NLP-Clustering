JLI Associates, a Philadelphia-area based health and ancillary brokerage firm serving over 500 business clients of varying employee levels, has been acquired by Ascela Partners.

Ascela Partners is an expanding regional consulting organization focused on financially investing in partnerships with small- to mid-size brokerages in order to share resources and best practices to better serve their clients. Ascela Partners currently has offices located in New York City, Newark, Del., and now Pennsylvania. Ascela Partners provides professional services to its clients including benefits technology, Human Resources consulting, ERISA compliance, underwriting and access to exclusive, unique products.

John Lynam, previous owner of Glen Mills, Pa.-based JLI Associates, will oversee sales and operations as the president of Ascela Partners. “With the additional resources provided by Ascela Partners, we are in a position to better serve the ever increasing consulting needs of small to mid-size businesses within this new post-reform landscape,” said Lynam.

With the bulk of the requirements under the Affordable Care Act starting in 2014, Lynam believes, “Business owners will be searching for innovative solutions to many new compliance requirements and cost increases resulting from the law – and we are in an advantageous position to provide professional support that typically was only available to larger companies as well as access to exclusive products and private exchange technology for individuals and businesses.”

Lynam said Ascela Partners is also seeking brokers interested in potential partnerships.
