But her offsets, which come mostly from tax hikes, would save an estimated $1.9 trillion over that same period (or closer to $1.6 trillion if you don\u2019t count those as-yet-unspecified business tax proposals). The net fiscal impact of her plans, then, is pretty close to zero. \u2026 Donald Trump would cut tax revenue dramatically, while simultaneously raising spending on programs such as veterans\u2019 health care. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ballparks the total cost of his proposals at $11.7 trillion to $15.1 trillion over the next decade, again depending on what underlying assumptions you make. Likewise, Ted Cruz\u2019s various proposals \u2014 which include tax cuts, a repeal of Obamacare and a bigger military \u2014 would add between $2.7 trillion and $21.3 trillion to the federal debt. John Kasich, who somehow fancies himself the lone fiscal grown-up in the race, remains the only candidate who has released so few details that none of the major budgetary watchdog organizations has even attempted to score his policies. Given that his tax plan looks a lot like Jeb Bush\u2019s, however, we can assume he\u2019d add trillions in red ink, too.\n\nWell, it seems to me there is a difference between being fiscally conservative and a fiscal conservative. The first sounds like you want to balance the budget, which may be done from a right, center, or left perspective. The second gets into views about the proper tax burden and the size and scope of government.\n\nNow Rampell is using a Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis of Clinton\u2019s policy proposals, which also notes that \u201cSecretary Clinton would still allow debt to grow significantly as a share of the economy, from about 74 percent of GDP at the end of last year \u2013 already the highest in U.S. history other than around World War II \u2013 to 86 percent of GDP by 2026.\u201d Is that fiscally conservative? Perhaps only on a relative basis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clinton is, argues, Catherine Rampell in the Washington Post -- or at least she is one compared to the remaining GOPers in the presidential race:", "og": {"site_name": "AEI", "description": "Clinton is, argues, Catherine Rampell in the Washington Post -- or at least she is one compared to the remaining GOPers in the presidential race:", "title": "Is Hillary Clinton a fiscal conservative? - AEI", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/RTX2COX5_hillaryclinton-e1462310469650.jpg", "url": "https://www.aei.org/publication/is-hillary-clinton-a-fiscal-conservative/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "She is, argues, Catherine Rampell in the Washington Post -- or at least she is one compared to the remaining GOPers in the presidential race:Here\u2019s the bottom line for the nation\u2019s bottom li", "title": "Is Hillary Clinton a fiscal conservative?", "image": "https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/RTX2COX5_hillaryclinton-e1462310469650.jpg", "creator": "@AEI", "site": "@AEI", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=953539392", "article": {"section": "Economics", "tag": "2017 budget,conservatism,gdp,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Well, it seems to me there is a difference between being fiscally conservative and a fiscal conservative.\nBut her offsets, which come mostly from tax hikes, would save an estimated $1.9 trillion over that same period (or closer to $1.6 trillion if you don\u2019t count those as-yet-unspecified business tax proposals).\nThe net fiscal impact of her plans, then, is pretty close to zero.\n\u2026 Donald Trump would cut tax revenue dramatically, while simultaneously raising spending on programs such as veterans\u2019 health care.\nThe first sounds like you want to balance the budget, which may be done from a right, center, or left perspective."}
