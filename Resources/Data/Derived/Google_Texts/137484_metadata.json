It condenses water molecules pumped from a fire hydrant and blows white, fluffy flakes from two snow guns.\n\n\u201cYou just turn on the machines, and they make all the snow,\u201d said Curtis Osborne, who has worked the machines or groomed snow every year the rail yard has opened. Warm winters kept the yard closed in 2010 and 2012, he said.\n\nSkyler Ruggles, on-site manager at the rail yard, said snowmaking works only with temperatures below 30 degrees.\n\n\u201cAnything above that and you\u2019re pretty much pumping mist out of the guns,\u201d Ruggles said. \u201cAnything below that and you\u2019re pumping snow.\u201d\n\nWinter Park retrieves its snow guns once the slope is manufactured, Ruggles said, meaning continued warm temperatures in Denver could put an end to the rail yard in three or four weeks.\n\nIn the rail yard\u2019s first four years, the closest water source was a fire hydrant on the other side of a parking lot and residential block \u2014 in Dianne Dreith\u2019s front yard.\n\nA hydrant was installed at the site of the rail yard when the park underwent renovations in 2011. Before that, Dreith watched from her living room window each year as volunteers attached a long hose to the yellow hydrant and ran it back toward the park along the perimeter of her property.\n\nWater leaked, she said, and froze inches thick in the driveways and yards of people directly downhill on Quivas Street.\n\n\u201cThe kids were having fun, so I didn\u2019t want to complain,\u201d Dreith said.\n\nThe retiree has lived next to Ruby Hill Park for 35 years and said she gets a kick out of seeing kids learn to ski and snowboard across the street from her house.\n\nSherry Freedman and Mary Zavada were two of the first parents this year to utilize free ski and snowboard rentals that Christy Sports has provided on weekends at the rail yard for the past five years.\n\nMatt Becker, who manages the rental booth, said he rented 30 skis and boards in the three hours after the booth opened at 11 a.m. Saturday.\n\nFreedman said it was the only affordable option for son Zak, 9, and daughter Avery, 8, to try snow sports.\n\nRuby Hill lit a fire under Avery, an ambitious first-time skier.\n\n\u201cI want bigger hills,\u201d she said.\n\nRob Roscini, a volunteer snow groomer at the park and an art teacher in Denver, said the free slope removes any price barrier from skiing and snowboarding.\n\n\u201cI work in a school where the kids would probably never go to the hills unless it was on a school trip,\u201d Roscini said. \u201cBut they\u2019re out here doing it.\u201d\n\nAlison Noon: 303-954-1223, anoon@denverpost.com or twitter.com/alisonnoon", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ruby Hill Rail Yard opens in Denver on warm winter day", "title": "Ruby Hill Rail Yard opens in Denver on warm winter day", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/18/ruby-hill-rail-yard-opens-in-denver-on-warm-winter-day/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140118__00002201_H16745095p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140118__00002201_H16745095p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-18T18:08:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T07:21:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Winter Park donates and teaches rail yard volunteers how to operate the slope\u2019s snowmaking equipment.\nDenver was 55 degrees and dry, but skiers and snowboarders shredded down snow on an urban hillside Saturday at the opening day of Ruby Hill Rail Yard.\nSkyler Ruggles, on-site manager at the rail yard, said snowmaking works only with temperatures below 30 degrees.\nA hydrant was installed at the site of the rail yard when the park underwent renovations in 2011.\n\u201cYou just turn on the machines, and they make all the snow,\u201d said Curtis Osborne, who has worked the machines or groomed snow every year the rail yard has opened."}
