Tavenner is a well known face of Obamacare and an ally to Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Secretary of Health and Human services.\n\n\u201cIt is with sadness and mixed emotions that I write to tell you that February will be my last month serving as the administrator for CMS,\u201d Tavenner wrote in an email to staff.\n\nTavenner\u2019s 5-year tenure at CMS has been troubled. She recently appeared before the House Oversight Committee to answer questions about Obamacare failures, including an overstatement of the number of enrolees that had the administration celebrating their success.\n\nTavenner told committee members that enrollees were \u201cinadvertently\u201d double-counted, an explanation that was greeted with skepticism by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., whose staff identified the error. Tavenner was grilled alongside former administration adviser Jonathan Gruber, who admitted that Obamacare was passed because of misinformation presented to a \u201cstupid America.\u201d\n\n\u201cTavenner had to go,\u201d Issa wrote Friday in a statement. \u201cShe presided over HHS as it deceptively padded the Obamacare enrollment numbers. It was a deplorable example of an agency trying to scam the American people. They weren\u2019t successful this time because of Congressional oversight. We deserve better.\u201d\n\nAryana Khalid, Tavenner\u2019s chief of staff, also announced Friday that she would be leaving the agency.\n\nThese two departures come about a month after that of CMS\u2019s deputy administrator, Cindy Mann.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cTavenner had to go,\u201d wrote Darrell Issa in a statement.
