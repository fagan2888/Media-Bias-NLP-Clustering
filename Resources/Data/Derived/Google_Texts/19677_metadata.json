But having technology available isn\u2019t enough for students without Wi-Fi access at home.\n\nOn Tuesday Facebook announced a pilot program to help students get free W-Fi at home to aid in their school work. The social network is partnering with PANGAEA Internet, Rutherford County and the Town of Forest City, North Carolina to offer Wi-Fi to 75-100 students\u2019 houses.\n\nThe pilot program follows a 2011 initiative where the county wanted to help provide laptops to all middle and high school students. Unfortunately, many of the students didn\u2019t have Wi-Fi access at home.\n\nDr. Janet Mason, Rutherford County Schools\u2019 superintendent, gave a statement about the importance of giving students \u201cequal access to digital information.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you can utilize technology to enhance educational opportunities for our county\u2019s young people, everybody wins,\u201d she said.\n\nForest City was chosen for this Facebook program because it is home to one of the company\u2019s data centers.\n\nFacebook\u2019s site data center manager, Keven McCammon, posted that the program is still in the process of being developed. It hasn\u2019t been said whether or not the program will eventually expand to other cities.\n\nThis program could definitely fulfill a need that many Americans, especially lower income families, are facing.\n\nA 2013 research project by Pew Research Center showed that 15% of Americans did not have a broadband connection at home. About one-third of people making less than $20,000 a year were not online at all.\n\nThirty-five percent of low-income families ended up relying on the library to use the internet. For young students who can\u2019t drive, getting to the library to work on assignments can be difficult if their parents are unable to take them.\n\nAnother Pew Research article giving expert opinions on today\u2019s technology needs echoed the need for Wi-Fi access for everyone available at a low cost across the country.\n\nGet Free Updates!
