Kerry said Sunday the decision by 47 Senate Republicans to interject themselves into nuclear negotiations with Iran was \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201ccalculated to interfere\u201d with his efforts to limit the Islamic republic\u2019s ability to build an atomic bomb.\n\nClearly upset by the GOP\u2019s move, Mr. Kerry said he deserves to head to Switzerland for talks without being pre-judged by lawmakers who think the administration is marching toward a dangerous and misguided deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like giving people a grade on a test before the test is even written, let alone given,\u201d he told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nForty-seven Senate Republicans last week signed the letter written by freshman Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, aimed at derailing a potential nuclear deal with Iran. The letter warned Iranian leaders that any permanent deal must have congressional approval, rather than just Mr. Obama\u2019s support.\n\nMr. Kerry said that is incorrect, \u201cbecause they cannot change an executive agreement.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Cotton strenuously objected to the secretary\u2019s assertion that he does not need Congress\u2019 imprimatur to make the deal binding and long-lasting.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the way our constitutional system works, and it\u2019s certainly not the way we should be negotiating with Iran,\u201d Mr. Cotton told CBS, adding that he has \u201cno regrets at all\u201d over the letter.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, also said the letter was not a mistake, even though his caucus has come under criticism for going around the administration.\n\nSome GOP members have expressed regret for how the letter was drafted and signed in haste.\n\nMr. Kerry said he won\u2019t apologize for their actions when he comes to the negotiating table with Iran and foreign allies.\n\n\u201cNot on your life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize for the unconstitutional un-thought-out action by somebody who\u2019s been in the United States Senate for 60-something days.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Secretary of State John F.
