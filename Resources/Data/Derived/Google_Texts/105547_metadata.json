John Kasich, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., businessman Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (L-R) line up on the stage at the beginning of a Republican presidential primary debate hosted by ABC News at the St. Anselm College Saturday, Feb. 6, 2016, in Manchester, N.H. (AP Photo/David Goldman)\n\nABC News aired the eighth GOP presidential debate on Feb. 6, a prime-time event starring the seven top-tier candidates, based on an average of recent polls.\n\nNot every candidate uttered statements that are easily fact checked, but the following is a list of 15 suspicious or interesting claims.\n\n- - -\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only one up here, when the War in Iraq, I was the one who said, don\u2019t go, don\u2019t do it, you\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East. So I\u2019m not the one with the trigger.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump\n\nTrump continues to say he opposed the Iraq War ahead of the invasion in 2003. But the evidence is slim he warned against it prior to the invasion on March 20, 2003.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Fact Checker\u2019s extensive review of news coverage prior to the invasion surfaced just two references of Trump and his views. First was a two-sentence reference in a March 25, 2003, article in The Washington Post\u2019s coverage of the Oscars after-party:\n\nDonald Trump, with Amazonian beauty Melania Knauss at his side, pronounces on the war and the stock market: \u201cIf they keep fighting it the way they did today, they\u2019re going to have a real problem.\u201d\n\nThen, Trump said on Fox News during the weekend after the invasion: \u201cI think the market\u2019s going to go up like a rocket!\u201d\n\nTrump clearly was outspoken about his opposition starting in 2004, the year he reportedly considered a presidential bid. (Instead, he launched his popular TV series, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d) The most direct criticism of the Iraq War by Trump was in an August 2004 cover story of Esquire magazine:\n\n\u201cMy life is seeing everything in terms of \u201cHow would I handle that?\u201d Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we\u2019re in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the county? C\u2019mon. Two minutes after we leave, there\u2019s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he\u2019ll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn\u2019t have.\n\n- - -\n\n\u201cIn eight years, Bill Clinton deported 12 million people. In eight years, George W. Bush deported 10 million people.\u201d \u2014 Ted Cruz\n\nCruz is using slippery phrasing to come up with really big numbers under the rubric of \u201cdeportation.\u201d Under Department of Homeland Security definitions, there is a simple form of voluntary deportation known as \u201creturn\u201d - a \u201cconfirmed movement of an inadmissible or deportable alien out of the United States not based on an order of removal.\u201d\n\nThere is also a more formal type of deportation, known as \u201cremoval\u201d - \u201cthe compulsory and confirmed movement of an inadmissible or deportable alien out of the United States based on an order of removal. An alien who is removed has administrative or criminal consequences placed on subsequent reentry.\u201d That\u2019s a more serious form of deportation - trying to reenter the United States again is deemed a felony \u2014 and that\u2019s generally the number used in media reports.\n\nUnder Obama, the formal type of deportation has soared even as \u201ctotal deportations\u201d have declined. The shift stems from a combination of new laws, administration policies and changes in immigration patterns. Skeptics of immigration have accused the administration of cooking the numbers to make its deportation policies look better, but Cruz himself is mixing apples and oranges.\n\n- - -\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re seeing the launch, and we\u2019re seeing the launch from a nuclear North Korea is the direct result of the failures of the first Clinton administration. The Clinton administration led the world in relaxing sanctions against North Korea. Billions of dollars flowed into North Korea in exchange for promises not to build nuclear weapons. They took those billions and built nuclear weapons.\u201d \u2014 Ted Cruz\n\nTed Cruz significantly overstates the monetary benefits of the Clinton deal to North Korea.\n\nClinton\u2019s deal was called the Agreed Framework. Essentially, an international consortium was going to replace the North\u2019s plutonium reactor with two light-water reactors; in the meantime, the United States would supply the North with 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil every year to make up for the theoretical loss of the reactor while the new ones were built. (North Korea\u2019s program was clearly created to churn out nuclear weapons; the reactor at Yongbyon was not connected to the power grid and appeared only designed to produce plutonium.) There were also vague references to improving relations and commerce.\n\nThe consortium was called the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO). KEDO\u2019s final annual report, issued in 2006, shows that 30 or so countries funding the project spent about $2.5 billion before it was shut down after the Bush administration accused North Korea of cheating on the Agreed Framework. (Most of the funds, about $2 billion, were contributed by South Korea and Japan alone.)\n\nBut this money did not go to North Korea. According to Joel S. Wit, who was in charge of implementing the Agreed Framework during the Clinton administration, it went to the companies that were building the reactors in South Korea, Japan and the European Union.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2003, the United States did spend about $500 million supplying the fuel oil that was required under the deal. (Another $100 million in fuel oil was supplied between 2007 and 2009, during Bush\u2019s ill-fated deal.) But North Korea did not get those funds either; it just got the oil.\n\nHowever, some experts note that North Korea did benefit broadly from South Korea pursuing joint projects with North Korea, such as the Kaesong Industrial Complex and tourism at Mt. Kumgang. The Congressional Research Service in 2011 estimated that Kaesong, which opened during the Bush administration, provided about $20 million in wage revenue a year to North Korea. Hyundai Asan also paid North Korea $12 million for a 50-year lease on the entire Kaesong site. CRS cited a 2004 estimate that North Korea could \u201creceive $9.55 billion in economic gains over the course of nine years if the KIC were to be developed fully and operated successfully,\u201d mainly from sales and corporate taxes. Kaesong, however, has been closed periodically because of tensions between the two countries.\n\n- - -\n\n\u201cThey [China] have total, absolute control, practically, of North Korea.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump\n\nNot by a long shot. China has leverage over its client state, given that much of Pyongyang\u2019s international trade is with Beijing, but how much leverage is subject to debate. Moreover, China is often reluctant to use that leverage, because officials view North Korea as a useful buffer state with South Korea. A collapse of North Korea \u2014 and reunification on the Korean Peninsula \u2014 is not currently viewed in China\u2019s interests.\n\nEvery American administration has dreamed that China will push North Korea to halt its nuclear ambitions. But China always disappoints.\n\nThe limits of China\u2019s leverage are best illustrated by the fact that North Korea has repeatedly tested a nuclear device despite Beijing\u2019s vehement objections. And the unwillingness of China to use even its limited leverage was demonstrated by a New York Times article that appeared the morning of the debate - detailing how China sidestepped United Nations sanctions prohibiting luxury goods to North Korea in order to build a ski resort for North Korea\u2019s leaders.\n\n- - -\n\n\u201cLet me tell you the facts of what occurred for those who are interested in knowing. On Monday night, about 6:30 p.m., CNN reported that Ben was not going from Iowa to New Hampshire or South Carolina. Rather, he was, quote, \u2018Taking a break from campaigning.\u2019 They reported that on television, CNN\u2019s political anchors, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer, said it was highly unusual and highly significant. My political team saw CNN\u2019s report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers, it was being covered on live television.\u201d \u2014 Ted Cruz\n\nIn explaining how his campaign team falsely told Iowa caucus goers that Ben Carson had was dropping out of the race, Cruz falsely blamed CNN\u2019s reporting.\n\nThe night of the Iowa caucus, CNN reporter Chris Moody tweeted at 7:41 p.m. EST that Carson had planned to catch a flight before caucus results were in. Moody added that Carson was \u201cjust making a brief stop at home in FL tonight and campaign says he\u2019ll be back on the campaign trail by Wednesday.\u201d\n\nThen, during the network\u2019s live coverage, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash called Carson\u2019s decision \u201cvery unusual,\u201d according to CNN\u2019s media reporter Dylan Byers. But Tapper and Bash \u2014 whom Cruz named during Saturday\u2019s debate -- didn\u2019t say Carson was dropping out, Byers wrote.\n\nCruz backer Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, then retweeted Moody along with a message: \u201cCarson looks like he is out. Iowans need to know before they vote. Most will go to Cruz, I hope.\u201d Then the campaign sent a message to Iowa supporters suggesting Carson was dropping out.\n\nThe day after the Iowa caucus, Cruz apologized to Carson and said his campaign staff were citing a CNN report. CNN said in response that it \u201chad not characterized Carson\u2019s actions that way.\u201d\n\nAfter Cruz repeated this claim during the debate, CNN said in a statement: \u201cWhat Senator Cruz said tonight in the debate is categorically false. CNN never corrected its reporting because CNN never had anything to correct. The Cruz campaign\u2019s actions the night of the Iowa caucuses had nothing to do with CNN\u2019s reporting. The fact that Senator Cruz continues to knowingly mislead the voters about this is astonishing.\u201d\n\n- - -\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be releasing these killers who are rejoining the battlefield against the United States.\u201d \u2014 Marco Rubio\n\nRubio sure likes this talking point about recidivist terrorists, but he overstates the facts.\n\nRubio refers to ex-Guantanamo Bay detainees released under President Obama. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence releases semiannual reports of the rate of recidivism among released Guantanamo detainees.\n\nThere are two categories in the report: ex-detainees who are \u201cconfirmed of re-engaging\u201d and those \u201csuspected of re-engaging.\u201d \u201cConfirmed\u201d is self-explanatory; \u201csuspected\u201d is defined as \u201cplausible but unverified or single-source reporting indicating a specific former GTMO detainee is directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities. For the purposes of this definition, engagement in anti-US statements or propaganda does not qualify as terrorist or insurgent activity.\u201d\n\nThe latest report on detainees transferred as of July 15, 2015, shows 117 of 653 (17.9 percent) were confirmed as reengaging and 79 of 653 (12.1 percent) were suspected of reengaging.\n\nThe report also divides the numbers between the George W. Bush and Obama administrations. The breakdown shows most of the former detainees were released under the Bush administration. Further, virtually all (94 percent) of the ex-detainees confirmed or suspected of reengaging were released under the Bush administration.\n\n- - -\n\n\u201cThe insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump\n\nTrump must not be reading the financial section of newspapers these days. For many insurance companies, the Affordable Care Act has been a money-loser.\n\nFor instance, UnitedHealthcare Group, one of the biggest insurance companies, announced in January that it had lost $720 million in the new exchanges in 201r, after enrolling 500,000 people. UnitedHealthcare had aimed to be a major player in the Obamacare marketplace but it announced it might pull out completely in 2017 after a review in the coming months. The company has already halted advertising for new plans.\n\n- - -\n\n\u201cShe [Hillary Clinton] put classified information on her computer because she thinks she\u2019s above the law.\u201d \u2014 Marco Rubio\n\nRubio\u2019s phrasing suggests that Clinton purposely put classified information on her emails. There has been no evidence to show that is the case.\n\nClinton did set up a private email server rather than rely on the State Department\u2019s own unclassified system, and in doing so she skirted State Department practices. (Not until later was a law passed that would have prohibited such a setup.) In reviewing her emails for public release, the State Department and other intelligence agencies have determined that some emails are too sensitive to be released, with at least 22 actually reaching the level of \u201ctop secret.\u201d\n\nBut this is an after-the-fact conclusion. As we have written, the Clinton controversy has exposed serious shortcomings in how the State Department handles sensitive communications. In the view of intelligence officials, State Department officials have been sending highly sensitive information on the unclassified system \u2014 with the expectation that if a FOIA request is made, department officials could then redact the emails and prevent any classified information from becoming public.\n\nRecently it was revealed that State Department Inspector General concluded that classified information also had been transmitted over the personal email account of Colin L. Powell and also the accounts of aides to Condoleezza Rice.\n\nThe State Department has a separate system for handling classified information, and thus far no one has accused Clinton of taking information from that system and using it in her private email system.\n\n- - -\n\n\u201cAs you know, in the first Persian Gulf War, it was 1,100 air attacks a day. Obama is launching between 15 and 30.\u201d \u2014 Ted Cruz\n\n\u201cWe actually have a case where we don\u2019t want to bomb the oil.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump\n\nThe Defense Department says that as of Feb. 3, the United States has conducted 7,753 air strikes since the campaign began on Aug. 8, 2014. All told, the U.S. and its allies have conducted 10,113 strikes-an average of under 20 a day, at a cost of about $11 million a day.\n\nBut DOD also says that 1,170 \u201coil infrastructure\u201d targets that have been damaged or destroyed.\n\n- - -\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re the highest-taxed country in the world.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump\n\nAs a self-proclaimed billionaire, Trump probably personally faces high tax rates. But the statistics don\u2019t lie \u2014 the United States isn\u2019t anywhere near the top among industrialized nations.\n\nIn 2014, according to comparative tables of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product-the broadest measure of the economy-was 26 percent for the United States.\n\nOut of 34 countries, that put the United States in the bottom third-and well below the OECD average of 34.4 percent.\n\nAt the top of the list was Denmark, often cited by Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders as a model. Denmark topped the list with revenue at 50.9 percent of GDP.\n\n- - -\n\n\u201cUnder Chris Christie\u2019s governorship of New Jersey, they\u2019ve been downgraded nine times in their credit rating.\u201d \u2014 Marco Rubio\n\nWe\u2019d like to note a point of clarification: New Jersey\u2019s bond credit was lowered three times by three separate ratings agencies, for nine collective downgrades.\n\nSince Christie took office, New Jersey\u2019s bond rating was downgraded three times from each of the three major ratings agencies: Standard and Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s and Fitch.\n\n- - -\n\n\u201cYou know, we wouldn\u2019t be a free country if it wasn\u2019t for them, and we have 22 veterans per day committing suicide.\u201d \u2014 Ben Carson\n\nSuicide is a serious concern among veterans, and Americans at large. In fact, suicides among veterans happen at a higher rate than Americans in general. But this widely cited statistic is a rough and outdated estimate based on partial data.\n\nThe figure comes from the VA\u2019s 2012 Suicide Data Report, for which researchers analyzed death certificates of veterans from 21 states, from 1999 to 2011. They took the percentage of veteran deaths identified as suicides, out of all suicides from those states during that period. Then they applied that percentage to the number of suicides in the United States in a given year. That comes out to 22 suicides a day.\n\nBut the sample size was fewer than half the states, and did not include some states with the largest veteran populations (such as Arizona, California, Texas and North Carolina). Researchers who wrote this report provided a major caveat about their findings, saying the public should interpret their findings \u201cwith caution.\u201d The data were collected from a sample of states, and it\u2019s difficult to rely on information reported in death certificates, the researchers wrote.\n\nThe researchers have not yet updated the report, and said they hope to do so early this year. There is a broader effort to accurately quantify the suicide problem among veterans, through a joint project of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Defense Department.\n\n- - -\n\nExchange at the debate:\n\nJeb Bush: \u201cBut what Donald Trump did was use eminent domain to try to take the property of an elderly woman on the strip in Atlantic City. That is not public purpose, that is downright wrong. And here\u2019s the problem with that. The problem was, it was to tear down the house.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump: \u201cJeb wants to be a tough guy tonight. I didn\u2019t take the property.\u201d\n\nBush: \u201cAnd the net result was \u2014 you tried.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cI didn\u2019t take the property.\u201d\n\nBush: \u201cAnd you lost in the court.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cThe woman ultimately didn\u2019t want to do that. I walked away.\u201d\n\nBush: \u201cThat is not true. And the simple fact is to turn this into a limousine parking lot for his casinos is a not public use.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the short version: Bush nailed it.\n\nEminent domain refers to the government\u2019s right to acquire private property for public use.\n\nIn 1994, Trump and the New Jersey Casino Reinvestment Development Authority unsuccessfully tried to seize the home of Vera Coking, an elderly widow in her 70s who had lived in the home for 37 years. The house was located near the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. Trump and the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority wanted to take properties to build a new parking lot and public park at the plaza.\n\nCoking reportedly refused an offer of at least $251,000 from the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, according to FactCheck.org. A years-long court battle ensued.\n\nEventually, in 1998, the state Superior Court ruled in favor of Coking, saying there was no guarantee \u201cthat the company would not later use the land simply to expand the business.\u201d The judge ruled that \u201cTrump, not the public, stood to benefit from the proposed seizures and that the deal was \u2018analogous to giving Trump a blank check with respect to future development on the property for casino-hotel purposes,\u2019\u201d the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote in 1998.\n\nThe Inquirer called the ruling \u201cthe first serious setback to the use of eminent-domain proceedings for casino projects in Atlantic City,\u201d and it was hailed by the Institute for Justice (co-counsel for Coking) as a landmark victory in a \u201cclassic David versus Goliath battle.\u201d\n\n- - -\n\nExchange at the ABC debate:\n\nModerator David Muir: Senator Cruz, you have said, \u2018Torture is wrong, unambiguously, period. Civilized nations do not engage in torture.\u2019 Some of the other candidates say they don\u2019t think waterboarding is torture. Mr. Trump has said, I would bring it back. Senator Cruz, is waterboarding torture?\n\nTed Cruz: \u201cWell, under the definition of torture, no, it\u2019s not. Under the law, torture is excruciating pain that is equivalent to losing organs and systems, so under the definition of torture, it is not. It is enhanced interrogation, it is vigorous interrogation, but it does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture.\u201d\n\nThis is a very complicated topic, but we\u2019ll unravel some of it here.\n\nUnder the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture, the definition of torture is \u201cany act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person.\u201d\n\nAccording to the United States code, torture is defined as \u201can act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control.\u201d\n\nAccording to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture: \u201cTorture is not an act in itself, or specific type of acts, but it is the legal qualification of an event or behaviour, based on the comprehensive assessment of this event or behaviour. Therefore, the difference between these different qualifications, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment or ill-treatment depends on the specific circumstances of each case and is not always obvious.\u201d\n\n\u201cWaterboarding\u201d describes the interrogation technique of pouring water into their nose and mouth while the subject is on their back, simulating the sensations of drowning. The subject also may be immersed in water. Such techniques show water or any other liquids \u201ccan be used in order to impose physical and mental suffering to prisoners,\u201d according to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture.\n\nThere has long been a controversy over whether waterboarding meets the definition of torture. In 2002 and 2003, the Justice Department provided guidance that deemed the practice legal. But the practice was prohibited after that.\n\nFrom a 2008 Washington Post article:\n\n\u201cIn 2006, [then-CIA Director Michael V.] Hayden said, he officially prohibited CIA operatives from using waterboarding after a Supreme Court decision forcing the administration to respect a Geneva Conventions article barring \u201coutrages upon personal dignity\u201d and \u201chumiliating and degrading treatment\u201d of U.S. detainees. He said he doubts the practice would be considered legal now.\n\n\u201c[Then-White House spokesman Tony] Fratto said the tactic could not be used again unless the president obtained new advice about its legality, personally approved it and notified Congress. \u201cI\u2019m not aware that anyone has plans to use it in this program,\u201d Fratto said.\n\n\u201cHe said that although lawyers had determined that waterboarding was legal when it was used in 2002 and 2003, new laws passed since then would have to be considered. \u201cWe have made clear that the law has changed. That has given greater clarity to these questions,\u201d he said. But he declined to rule it out, saying, \u201cWe are not going to speculate on the future.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama has rejected the technique, and called it torture. In 2014, the International Committee of the Red Cross declared for the first time that waterboarding is torture.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Elections, Elections news, New Haven Elections news, CT Elections news, US Elections news, world Elections news.", "title": "Fact checking the 8th GOP presidential debate", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/government-and-politics/20160207/fact-checking-the-8th-gop-presidential-debate", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20160207/NEWS/160209630/AR/0/AR-160209630.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "999px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Fact checking the 8th GOP presidential debate"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "ABC News aired the eighth GOP presidential debate on Feb. 6, a prime-time event starring the seven top-tier candidates, based on an average of recent polls.", "title": "Fact checking the 8th GOP presidential debate", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/government-and-politics/20160207/fact-checking-the-8th-gop-presidential-debate", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20160207/NEWS/160209630/AR/0/AR-160209630.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "Elections, Elections news, New Haven Elections news, CT Elections news, US Elections news, world Elections news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "ABC News aired the eighth GOP presidential debate on Feb. 6, a prime-time event starring the seven top-tier candidates, based on an average of recent polls."}, "article_summary": "However, some experts note that North Korea did benefit broadly from South Korea pursuing joint projects with North Korea, such as the Kaesong Industrial Complex and tourism at Mt.\nThe limits of China\u2019s leverage are best illustrated by the fact that North Korea has repeatedly tested a nuclear device despite Beijing\u2019s vehement objections.\nBillions of dollars flowed into North Korea in exchange for promises not to build nuclear weapons.\nBetween 1995 and 2003, the United States did spend about $500 million supplying the fuel oil that was required under the deal.\nHyundai Asan also paid North Korea $12 million for a 50-year lease on the entire Kaesong site."}
