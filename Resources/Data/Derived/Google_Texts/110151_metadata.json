The emails state that the message is a \u201cnotice to appear.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, the emails contain a color logo that has a similar font to the real E-ZPass logo. The emails may also contain spelling or grammar errors.\n\nThe message directs the recipient to clink a link and then provide personal and financial information.\n\n\u201cEveryone must be on guard for these fraudsters attempting to con you out of your hard-earned funds and account information,\u201d cautioned AAA Mid-Atlantic spokesman John Townsend. \u201cBe skeptical of all email that directs the user to a website in which credit card or personal information is entered.\u201d\n\nSimply clicking the link in the bogus email can infect a computer or mobile device with malware.\n\nAnyone who receives such an email should immediately notify the Federal Trade Commission, AAA says.\n\nIn Maryland, notices at toll lanes warn drivers if their account balances are low, according to AAA.\n\nHowever in Virginia, there is no such warning along the 495 and 95 Express Lanes. Drivers have faced thousands of dollars in fines and fees for uncollected tolls along the privately-operated lanes. Drivers have successfully taken the toll-lane operator Transurban to court to fight the claims, as reported by WTOP Ticketbuster.\n\nTo check on account balances, Maryland pass-holders can call 1-800-321-6824 or log into their accounts through the Maryland Transportation Authority\u2019s E-ZPass page at EZPassMD.com.\n\nVirginia pass-holders can call 1-877-762-7824 to check account balances, update credit card information or make a payment. Drivers can find more information on the Virginia Department of Transportation\u2019s E-ZPass page EZPassVA.com.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission offers these tips to avoid falling victim to any phishing scam:\n\nNever click on links in emails from unfamiliar senders.\n\nDon\u2019t send personal or financial information in an email.\n\nCheck to see if an organization\u2019s site is secure before typing personal information. The URL will include the letters \u201chttps.\u201d\n\nAnyone who receives an email from E-ZPass should call their state\u2019s customer service center to verify whether their account needs replenished.\n\nUse security software to protect computer files and keep the software up to date.\n\nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook.\n\n\u00a9 2015 WTOP.
