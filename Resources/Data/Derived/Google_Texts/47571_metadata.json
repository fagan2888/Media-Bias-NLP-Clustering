For hospitals, though, it would be a godsend.\n\nBaylor University Medical Center lost $172.8 million on uncompensated care last year.\n\nTexas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas reported uncompensated care of $86.5 million. Methodist Dallas Medical Center reported $154.7 million.\n\nAnd Parkland Health and Hospital System reported $1.488 billion of uncompensated care.\n\nThe figures are from www.txpricepoint.org and the American Hospital Directory. They represent what hospitals report as losses based on what they\u2019d normally charge patients. Patients insured by Medicare or Medicaid and with private insurance companies don\u2019t pay anywhere near those top prices. Even the uninsured are offered discounts.\n\nBut once you strip away the difference between top and discount prices, Parkland still had losses last year of $359 million from treating uninsured patients and bad debt.\n\nThe Texas Hospital Association is trying to remedy that, at least in part. It wants to coax Governor-elect Greg Abbott and the Legislature to use federal funds available through the Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid with a private insurance model.\n\nThis \u201cTexas Way\u201d approach, as the hospital association describes it (texasway.org), would seek out the uninsured not currently eligible for Medicaid but who can\u2019t afford the insurance policies offered under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s healthcare.gov site. That\u2019s about 1.05 million Texans, the association estimates.\n\nThe Texas Way would likely involve a high-deductible health plan coupled with health savings accounts, said THA vice president Lance Lunsford, but the exact structure is purposely vague.\n\n\u201cWe want the Legislature to make those decisions or leave that to staff,\u201d Lunsford said.\n\nOther paths\n\nThe association has its eye on Medicaid expansion plans in other Republican-governed states.\n\nThe \u201cHealthy Indiana Plan\u201d is a particular focus of the Texas Hospital Association. Under this approach, Medicaid recipients have to put some of their earnings into a health savings account each month to be eligible.\n\nGov. Mike Pence is still negotiating with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell to gain federal approval. If they can reach agreement, the plan would extend coverage opportunities to hundreds of thousands of Indianans with incomes between 100 percent and 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the Affordable Care Act, the extension would be paid for with federal funds.\n\nFederal poverty level includes individuals making $11,670 or less or a family of four making $23,850.\n\nTexas hospitals say their state should take the same path. Those federal funds would be coming back to hospitals that have already forfeited large sums under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s cuts in Medicare compensation, Lunsford said.\n\nBroken system\n\nThe cost of covering the uninsured now falls on insured Texans, as hospitals and physicians shift the burden to cover costs. As a result, an average family insurance policy costs $1,800 a year more in the state.\n\nGov. Rick Perry and others have said Texas is not interested in pouring more money into a broken system. One way health care providers agree that Medicaid is broken is in the meager amount this state-federal partnership program pays for care.\n\nHospitals say they lose money on every Medicaid patient they treat. The American Hospital Association calculates Medicaid paid only 93 cents of every dollar spent on Medicaid patient care in 2012.\n\nIt\u2019s worse in Texas, but that\u2019s no reason to do nothing, Lunsford said.\n\n\u201cUntil we get that addressed, we at least have to take advantage of the situation by getting these people covered one way or another,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the validity in saying, \u2018I\u2019ll take zero over 50 percent.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollow Jim Landers on Twitter at @landersjim.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Proposal would ease Republican opposition to the Affordable Care Act, which would extend Medicaid to more needy Texans.", "og": {"description": "Proposal would ease Republican opposition to the Affordable Care Act, which would extend Medicaid to more needy Texans.", "title": "Hospitals seek a Texas Way to expand Medicaid", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20141117-hospitals-seek-a-texas-way-to-expand-medicaid.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-11-18T03:30:56Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-11-18T03:27:03Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Hospitals seek a Texas Way to expand Medicaid\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20141117-hospitals-seek-a-texas-way-to-expand-medicaid.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2047326\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-18T03:27:03Z\", \"section\": \"Jim Landers\", \"author\": \"Jim Landers\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-11-18T03:27:03Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd217\"", "article_summary": "The American Hospital Association calculates Medicaid paid only 93 cents of every dollar spent on Medicaid patient care in 2012.\nOne way health care providers agree that Medicaid is broken is in the meager amount this state-federal partnership program pays for care.\nThe Texas Hospital Association is trying to remedy that, at least in part.\nThe \u201cHealthy Indiana Plan\u201d is a particular focus of the Texas Hospital Association.\nTexas hospitals say their state should take the same path."}
