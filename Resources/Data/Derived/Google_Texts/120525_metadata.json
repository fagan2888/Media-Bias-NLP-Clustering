She returned to the Juarez hospital emergency room three weeks ago for a symptom related to her esophagitis, where she was quickly seen, treated and charged $20 for the visit.\n\n\u201cHere (in El Paso) as soon as you walk in, they put an IV in you and they leave you in a bed and the nurses get to you first and then the doctors for a short while,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cThen, the doctor tells you what you have and then he gives you medication through the IV and then you get out.\u201d\n\nShe is now taking medications omerprazol and cisaprida, used for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), checks on a monthly basis with her Juarez doctor and meets with a nutritionist to treat her condition. Omerprazol is a commonly prescribed proton pump inhibitor, but cisapride has been withdrawn from the market in many countries due to side effects which may cause irregular heartbeats and death.\n\nFor years, Dominguez, a U.S. citizen, said she avoided the U.S. medical care system and relied on home remedies and over the counter medicine to avoid going to clinics.\n\n\u201cBefore I began to get treated, I would get sick about once or twice a week. My stomach was already very weak from years of dealing with my untreated esophagitis, so my stomach would feel irritated. I would \u2018fix\u2019 the problem by waiting it out and tried easing the pain with ibuprofen and Pepcid, but it was just a temporary fix,\u201d Dominguez said.\n\nLike many other border residents on the U.S. side, she generally depended for health care services for years in Ciudad Juarez, until the explosion of drug cartel violence some eight years ago made her too afraid to make the border crossing.\n\nDr. Eva Moya, who works at the Department of Social Work in the College of Health Sciences at The University of Texas at El Paso, said there were many people who stopped crossing due to the violence.\n\n\u201cThere was absolutely a drop in people going to Juarez for health services,\u201d Moya said. \u201cThere was fear of being a victim of violence, but in recent times, more people are beginning to feel confident and therefore, they\u2019re beginning to go back.\u201d\n\nThis transborder health care phenomenon occurs along the entire U.S.-Mexico border. According to a research done by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), \u201cMexican immigrants were 15 percent of California\u2019s adult population, but were 80 percent of adults who obtained medical care and 51 percent with any health-related service.\u201d\n\nThe table below was done by HHS in 2001 and includes data for Californians who traveled to Mexico for medical care, prescription drug purchase or dental care in one year.\n\nDr. Jose Mendoza, Managing Director for Centro Medico de Especialidades, a surgeon and gastroenterology specialist, estimates that he operates on 300 U.S. citizens a year.\n\n\u201cMany come and get treated and operated over here. For example, a cyst operation can cost up to $25,000 in the U.S. and over here it\u2019s about $5,000. Heart surgery is about $200,000 in the U.S. and here, it\u2019s about $30,000 to $40,000, but with good and high level care,\u201d Mendoza said.\n\n\u201cYou even get mariachis,\u201d he joked.\n\nAlthough the Affordable Care Act gives \u201cmore Americans access to affordable, quality health insurance,\u201d according to the ObamaCare website, the U.S.-Mexico border has thousands of U.S. medical consumers who rely on Mexico for health care, from broken arms to a bad cough, to any type of surgery.\n\nSilvia Horta, a U.S. citizen, works as a nurse at Regent Care Center, connected to the Del Sol Hospital. Horta says she knows the American hospital system well, but still chooses to receive the care and services offered in Mexico.\n\n\u201cEveryone in my family has the Affordable Care Act, but it only covers six visits per year and does not include emergencies to the hospital,\u201d Horta said. \u201cIt also doesn\u2019t include dental or optical insurance, so when we go to Juarez, we get check-ups, pharmaceuticals and we go to the dentist.\u201d\n\nHorta says she goes to Juarez every two weeks and usually buys Tempra, an over the counter medicine that in the U.S. would be Ibuprofen. She also has monthly visits for her and her family with a doctor in Juarez who has been treating them for three years.\n\n\u201cMy three daughters got their braces in Juarez,\u201d Horta said. \u201cIt\u2019s great. Not only is it cheaper to go to Juarez, but we also believe it better covers our needs.\u201d\n\nMost U.S. patients going to Mexico are economically driven, but it is important to consider that this tradition has allowed for Mexican doctors to build strong and stable relationships with American patients.\n\n\u201cPeople travel to buy a service and people buy services where the service meets your needs,\u201d Moya said. \u201cSo, people value the service and care that they\u2019re getting because they feel it\u2019s quality, the cost is less, and they feel good about it, otherwise they would not return.\u201d\n\nMendoza estimates that U.S. patients occupy about 25 percent of the beds in his hospital. He said he believes that Mexico has better care because their doctors have more affinity for the patients.\n\n\u201cU.S. patients who come here often complain about U.S. doctors because they only spend about two minutes with them. Here, our treatment is more personal. The first consultation I have with a patient takes me about 25 minutes because I try to get to know them, make sure we are face to face and then I check them completely. The entire consultation is with me,\u201d Mendoza said.\n\nMexico provides a low-cost and convenient health care alternative for many people along the U.S.-Mexico border and that has proven to be an important asset to the U.S.-Mexico border economy, heightening the reputation of Mexican health practices.\n\n\u201cHere in the U.S., I think it\u2019s a lot more of a business than it is over there,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cMexican practices aren\u2019t lesser than American practices. A lot of people have that misconception and most of the times it\u2019s even better to get treated over there.\u201d\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Borderzine", "description": "A few months before Nadiezdha Dominguez was diagnosed with esophagitis, a medical condition that causes irritation or inflammation of the esophagus, she experienced first hand the stark difference in emergency room care provided in El Paso as opposed to Ciudad Juarez.
