It requires the employer to submit a form authorizing a third-party administrator to pay for the required coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about access; it\u2019s about our beliefs and the sanctity of life,\u201d Sue Thompson, Geneva College\u2019s benefits and compensation specialist, says in a video produced by the Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom.\n\nGeneva College has no problem with 16 of the 20 approved contraceptives. But the college contends that the Obamacare provision burdens its constitutional right to free exercise of religion because it still forces school administrators to \u201ctrigger\u201d provision of what they believe are abortion-inducing drugs and devices.\n\nElizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, says that regardless of one\u2019s position on contraception or abortion, Geneva\u2019s religious liberty must be protected.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to share Geneva College\u2019s opposition to abortion to recognize that the government should not be able to force Americans to give up their deeply held beliefs simply because they step outside the four walls of a church to educate the next generation,\u201d Slattery told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear the case, Geneva College v. Burwell, in March along with six other challenges to Obamacare\u2019s so-called contraceptive mandate.\n\nOthers call it an anti-conscience mandate because it will override or impose financial penalties on employers if they do not violate deep religious beliefs.\n\nFounded by the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America in 1848, Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pa., carries on a tradition of Christian education through core Bible classes. It opposes abortion and abortion-inducing methods of birth control.\n\nThompson, the school\u2019s benefits specialist, says in the video:\n\nWhen it comes to contraceptives, there are 20 that the Affordable Care Act mandates. Of those, we provide 16. There are only four that we are not willing to provide, and those are the abortifacient drugs that would end a child\u2019s life in the womb.\n\nGeneva argues that the administration\u2019s requirement is a violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which protects a person\u2019s exercise of religion. Under it, the government is allowed to impose a burden on that right only:\n\n\u2026 if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person: (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s alternate compliance mechanism involves far more than Geneva College sending notification of its religious objection [to providing certain contraceptive drugs and devices],\u201d Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents the college, wrote in a case summary.\n\n\u201cThe alternative mechanism legally and practically serves to bring about the provision of those drugs and devices, since the government forces the religious institution to contract for the services in their health plans.\u201d\n\nThe 3rd Circuit Court disagreed in a Feb. 11 ruling, writing:\n\nThe self-certification form does not trigger or facilitate the provision of contraceptive coverage, because coverage is mandated to be otherwise provided by federal law. Federal law, rather than any involvement by the appellees in filling out or submitting the self-certification form, creates the obligation of the insurance issuers and third-party administrators to provide coverage for contraceptive services.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in June.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIt\u2019s not about access, it\u2019s about our beliefs and the sanctity of life,\u201d the Christian college's benefits specialist says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s not about access, it\u2019s about our beliefs and the sanctity of life,\u201d the Christian college's benefits specialist says.", "title": "Christian College Stands Ground on Obamacare Mandate", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160119_GenevaCollege_Mork.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-29T16:42:30+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PDnvFv"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s not about access, it\u2019s about our beliefs and the sanctity of life,\u201d the Christian college's benefits specialist says.", "title": "Christian College Stands Ground on Obamacare Mandate", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160119_GenevaCollege_Mork.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "obamacare,religious liberty", "published_time": "2016-01-29T14:50:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-29T16:42:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Geneva College, First Amendment Defense Act, Supreme Court, Obamacare mandate, religious liberty, Religious Freedom Restoration Act,  birth control, abortion, health care"}, "article_summary": "Founded by the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America in 1848, Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pa., carries on a tradition of Christian education through core Bible classes.\nGeneva College has no problem with 16 of the 20 approved contraceptives.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear the case, Geneva College v.
