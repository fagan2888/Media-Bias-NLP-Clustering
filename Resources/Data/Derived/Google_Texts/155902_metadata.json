An Australian woman with a huge admiration for cartoon character Jessica Rabbit has fulfilled her childhood fantasy by undergoing extreme plastic surgery. Penny Brown, 25, a fetish model, has boosted her size H breasts to size O, has gone from a 38- to a 23-inch waist, and from wearing a tiny steel-boned corset 23 hours a day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been obsessed with Jessica Rabbit from a really early age,\u201d Brown told Metro. \u201cI think she is incredibly sexy and there\u2019s a real power and strength to her character. I\u2019ve always wanted to copy that \u2014 at five I was already thinking about breast implants.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s quest to match the exaggerated hourglass figure of the red-headed cartoon character started when the military wife first put on a corset in February 2012. The fetish model wanted to send her husband, Cooper, 28, who was deployed overseas with the U.S. Air Force, some sizzling poses with the lingerie on. After all was said and done, Brown took a liking to the feeling of the corset, comparing it to a \u201cpermanent hug.\u201d\n\nCooper shows full support for his wife\u2019s obsession and raves about her extraordinary proportions. \u201cPenny is as close to Jessica Rabbit as any mere mortal can get,\u201d he said, the Daily Mail reported. \u201cHer shape is exciting and interesting. I don't like the ordinary or the generic.\u201d\n\nBrown is anything but ordinary or generic, as her two breast augmentations and corset training have made her into a corset-cult celebrity. The human Jessica Rabbit admits wearing a corset for long periods of time is anything but easy, especially during the first four months. \u201cI stuck to little meals, and also things that incorporate liquid into the food \u2014 like smoothies,\" she said, The Huffington Post UK reported. \u201cOne thing that was difficult was not being able to eat my favorite spicy foods \u2014 because they would wreak havoc on my stomach when it was restricted in the corset.\u201d\n\nThe corset diet, or simply corset training, can potentially wreak havoc on Brown\u2019s health. This controversial technique has possible side effects such as changing a person\u2019s bone structure via rib cage compression. A book Le Corset, written by Dr. Ludovis O' Followell in the early 1900s, showed corsets were impacting women\u2019s health during the Victorian Era. The corsets, similar to those today, had so much boning and cinching, which left women with symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath, while crushing their inner organs. This lack of oxygenation may contribute to metabolic syndrome and lead to weight gain.\n\nDespite health warnings, Brown will continue to undergo plastic surgery, planning a third augmentation to boost her cup size again. \u201cI've always been obsessed with big boobs,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe bigger they are the better and I don't think I'll ever be big enough.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "jessica rabbit, cartoon character, penny brown, plastic surgery, breast augmentation, tiny corset, 23 hours a day, o cup, 23-inch waist", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Australian woman has undergone two breast augmentations and wears a steel-boned corset 23 hours a day to look like the curvy cartoon character, Jessica Rabbit.", "title": "Woman (Thinks She) Transforms Into Jessica Rabbit By Wearing Corset 23 Hours A Day [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/meet-human-jessica-rabbit-woman-o-cup-breasts-and-23-inch-waist-wears-corset-23-hours-day-288162", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/13/woman-undergoes-plastic-surgeries-and-wears-tiny-corsets-be-jessica-rabbit.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Australian woman has undergone two breast augmentations and wears a steel-boned corset 23 hours a day to look like the curvy cartoon character, Jessica Rabbit.", "title": "Woman (Thinks She) Transforms Into Jessica Rabbit By Wearing Corset 23 Hours A Day [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/meet-human-jessica-rabbit-woman-o-cup-breasts-and-23-inch-waist-wears-corset-23-hours-day-288162", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/13/woman-undergoes-plastic-surgeries-and-wears-tiny-corsets-be-jessica-rabbit.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/13/woman-undergoes-plastic-surgeries-and-wears-tiny-corsets-be-jessica-rabbit.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-13T15:32:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-13T15:32:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Australian woman has undergone two breast augmentations and wears a steel-boned corset 23 hours a day to look like the curvy cartoon character, Jessica Rabbit."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd73a6\"", "article_summary": "An Australian woman with a huge admiration for cartoon character Jessica Rabbit has fulfilled her childhood fantasy by undergoing extreme plastic surgery.\n\u201cPenny is as close to Jessica Rabbit as any mere mortal can get,\u201d he said, the Daily Mail reported.\nThe human Jessica Rabbit admits wearing a corset for long periods of time is anything but easy, especially during the first four months.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been obsessed with Jessica Rabbit from a really early age,\u201d Brown told Metro.\nDespite health warnings, Brown will continue to undergo plastic surgery, planning a third augmentation to boost her cup size again."}
