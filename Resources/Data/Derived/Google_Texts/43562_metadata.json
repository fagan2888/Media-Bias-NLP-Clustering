If that\u2019s your dream, you may want to consider the pros and cons entrepreneurs sometimes encounter.\n\nEl Paso Inc. spent time with a couple that operates a bed and breakfast in southern New Mexico, and an El Paso woman who runs a fashion business out of her home. Very different businesses, but many of the same upsides and downsides.\n\nGeorge Bollinger and Marlene Eichner have owned Casa de Sue\u00f1os Country Inn, a bed and breakfast in La Union, New Mexico, for 12 years.\n\nThey learned that B&Bs with less than eight rooms for rent are considered a lifestyle business, which means the owners will need a second source of income. The place they wanted had four.\n\n\u201cThe theme was Western when we bought it,\u201d Eichner said. \u201cWe changed the name, concept and d\u00e9cor to give it a Southwestern feel.\u201d\n\nTo meet their overhead, both worked at other jobs for a time. In five years they brought the occupancy rate up from 9 percent to 50 percent.\n\nWhen the financial crisis of 2008 hit and the situation in Ju\u00e1rez was dicey, their occupancy rate dropped off.\n\n\u201cSole owners have increased income potential,\u201d Bollinger said, \u201cbut they also deal with the economy\u2019s downturns.\u201d\n\nSince then, their occupancy rate has come back up and is growing, he said.\n\nOn the positive side, they enjoy tax benefits like deductible expenses enjoyed by other businesses. The flip side: They have to buy their own health insurance, he said.\n\nEichner feels that finding the right match is the key to making a home-based business work.\n\n\u201cLifestyle is probably the biggest consideration,\u201d she said, \u201cso interning in the business is a good way to see if you like it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to learn as much as you can about the factors that can affect success. \u201cIn our business, it\u2019s important to know the Internet, marketing, safety and zoning issues, health codes and food handling, accounting, building repair and maintenance, design and energy issues.\u201d\n\nA positive for Eichner? The B&B schedule fits her biological clock. Always an early riser, she\u2019s up and most productive at 3 a.m., when she gets many chores done.\n\n\u201cGetting up early means I go to bed early, usually between 8:30 and 9 at night, so we arrange for late arrivals to check themselves in. We\u2019ve found that this both meets their needs and assures their comfort.\u201d\n\nStaying social\n\nAnother aspect of lifestyle choice is the couple\u2019s social needs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more outgoing. George\u2019s specialty is figuring out how to pay for the improvements we want to make. He keeps the books.\u201d\n\nBoth anticipated meeting interesting people from all over the world.\n\n\u201cBut we didn\u2019t anticipate that repeat visits would lead to solid friendships,\u201d and that\u2019s an aspect she considers a definite plus. \u201cWe receive invitations to stay with many of our guests.\u201d\n\nThe couple agrees that while their biggest concern is meeting their guests\u2019 needs, they don\u2019t want to have to give up their own.\n\n\u201cWe have had some high-need visitors. One man asked me to go buy him some lunch when his car didn\u2019t start.\u201d\n\nLarge living and dining areas and a patio big enough for private parties usually offer enough space for guests, without intrusion into the couple\u2019s private half of the dwelling.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to entertain our friends without our guests even being aware,\u201d Eichner said.\n\nFor the last few years, Bollinger has been dealing with lung cancer. With him able to take on fewer tasks, they are trying a new approach.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve joined a website called www.airbnb.com,\u201d Eichner said. \u201cAnyone with rooms to rent can list their space. It\u2019s free to join, and the site makes money by charging a percentage of the room cost.\u201d\n\nSince guests pay in advance and the site handles the money, it\u2019s less work for them. That allows them to spend their time in other ways.\n\nFashion from home\n\nGlenna Jo Price loves working from home. A fashion consultant for CAbi \u2013 Carol Anderson by Invitation \u2013 she sells stylish clothing that are new, affordable and ageless.\n\n\u201cI got interested in the line when I noticed the cute clothes my son\u2019s future mother-in-law always wore. She invited me to a show in Austin and I signed up.\u201d\n\nPrice began by asking friends to be hostesses, and the business spread by word-of-mouth. But she also sells directly from her home.\n\n\u201cI work two five-month seasons a year \u2013 spring-summer and fall-winter \u2013 and send announcements and reminders by email.\n\n\u201cI have about 20 shows a season. While one color is featured each season, people can match this season\u2019s color with designs from earlier shows.\u201d\n\nClothing items range in size from 0 to 16, and XS to XL.\n\nAlthough the two businesses are different, Price lists many of the same pros and cons cited by Eichner and Bollinger at the B&B.\n\n\u201cI have flexibility,\u201d Price said.\n\n\u201cI can choose when to work, and since I like to paint, I can also choose when to isolate myself. I love being at home and scheduling my own time.\u201d\n\nBut it did take her two years to learn how to set limits.\n\n\u201cWhen a client called me at midnight, I realized I didn\u2019t always have to answer the phone!\u201d\n\nPrice enjoys the socializing when she makes presentations at friends\u2019 houses. And there\u2019s a plus when she hosts a show at home, where her paintings are on display. \u201cCustomers see them, and I\u2019ve sold many that way.\u201d\n\nShe earns enough between the dual sales to support herself comfortably.\n\nAnother positive: the tax write-off for maintaining an office at home.\n\n\u201cTwo racks of clothing usually sit in the dining room, but I can either move them to the garage or entertain friends in a separate area.\u201d\n\nAs with Eichner and Bollinger, there is no guaranteed paycheck.\n\n\u201cI send the cash and checks to the company, and they keep a percentage, paying me twice a month,\u201d Price said. With the Affordable Care Act, she is now able to afford health insurance.\n\nFor Eichner and Bollinger at the B&B, as well as for Price\u2019s home fashions, the pros outweigh the cons. Their home-based businesses fit their lifestyles and talents, provide a mix of social interaction and privacy, and offer the opportunity for high earnings with full knowledge that there will also be costs.\n\nAll of that, they say, makes life more challenging and interesting.\n\nCasa de Sue\u00f1os\n\nLa Union, New Mexico\n\nwww.casaofdreams.com\n\ninfo@casaofdreams.com\n\nCAbi\n\nCarol Anderson by Invitation\n\nEmail: glennajo@mac.com", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "El Paso Inc.", "description": "Want to work at home?
