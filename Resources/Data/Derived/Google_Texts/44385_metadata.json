The planes bear the logo of the popular 1980s carrier of the same name and feature a green livery.\n\nThe 1980s iteration of PEOPLExpress, also known as People Express Airlines, operated between 1981 and 1987. Continental Airlines, now United Airlines, absorbed PEOPLExpress in 1987; the current iteration of PEOPLExpress is not a corporate successor.\n\n\u201cProviding excellent customer service and more options to travelers is a top priority,\u201d Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport General Manager Miguel Southwell said in a news release. \u201cWe are pleased to welcome back PEOPLExpress to Atlanta and to provide yet another destination served by the world\u2019s busiest and most efficient airport.\u201d\n\nPEOPLExpress flew its first flights to and from Atlanta on Friday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The airline, which for now is operated by Vision Airlines, plans to add service to New Orleans and Tampa, Fla., according to its website.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Todd DeFeo", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "The airline, which for now is operated by Vision Airlines, plans to add service to New Orleans and Tampa, Fla., according to its website.", "title": "Budget carrier PEOPLExpress \u2018returns\u2019 to the skies", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/travel/travel-us/budget-carrier-peoplexpress-returns-to-the-skies-23103/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-03-at-4.01.03-PM.jpg", "height": 427}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The airline, which for now is operated by Vision Airlines, plans to add service to New Orleans and Tampa, Fla., according to its website.", "title": "Budget carrier PEOPLExpress 'returns' to the skies", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-03-at-4.01.03-PM-435x375.jpg", "creator": "@commdiginews", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "airlines,peoplesexpress,aviation industry,todd defeo", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-03T20:52:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-21T18:35:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Airlines, Aviation Industry, PeoplesExpress, Todd DeFeo"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81d9\"", "article_summary": "ATLANTA, Aug. 3, 2014 \u2014 No frills airline PEOPLExpress has \u201creturned\u201d to the skies.\nContinental Airlines, now United Airlines, absorbed PEOPLExpress in 1987; the current iteration of PEOPLExpress is not a corporate successor.\nThe 1980s iteration of PEOPLExpress, also known as People Express Airlines, operated between 1981 and 1987.\n\u201cPeople have been very receptive and supportive of our service,\u201d Jeff Erickson, a long-time airline executive leading the PEOPLExpress start-up, said in a news release.\nThe airline, which for now is operated by Vision Airlines, plans to add service to New Orleans and Tampa, Fla., according to its website."}
