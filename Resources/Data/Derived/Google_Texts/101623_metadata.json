Aid workers described the situation as catastrophic.\n\nThe count of confirmed deaths was at eight with 30 people injured. But those numbers were almost certain to rise as rescuers reached the low-lying archipelago\u2019s outlying islands.\n\nAid workers were particularly worried about the southern island of Tanna. An official with the Australian Red Cross told Reuters an aircraft had managed to land there and aid workers confirmed there was \u201cwidespread destruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cVirtually every building that is not concrete has been flattened,\u201d said the official, adding two deaths had been confirmed on the island which has a population of about 29,000 and is about 125 miles south of the capital, Port Vila.\n\nWitnesses in Port Vila described sea surges of up to 26 feet and widespread flooding as the category 5 cyclone hit. Residents said the storm sounded like a freight train. Port Vila was strewn with debris and looked as if a bomb had gone off.\n\nPresident Baldwin Lonsdale, who happened to be at a disaster risk conference in Japan, likened the storm to a monster.\n\n\u201cMost of the houses in Vila \u2026 have been damaged and destroyed. People are finding shelter where they can live for the night,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nHe said the impact would be \u201cthe very, very, very worst\u201d in isolated outer islands but held out hope the number of casualties would be \u201cminor.\u201d\n\nHe said offers of aid had been very generous and said: \u201cWe are not begging, but we are asking for assistance.\u201d\n\nVanuatu\u2019s climate change minister, James Bule, said people were used to storms, though not usually such strong ones, and he also hoped loss of life might be limited.\n\n\u201cWe have people aware of what to do,\u201d Bule said.\n\nFormerly known as the New Hebrides, Vanuatu is a sprawling cluster of 83 islands and 260,000 people, 1,250 miles northeast of the Australian city of Brisbane.\n\nIt is among the world\u2019s poorest countries and highly prone to disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis and storms.\n\nAid officials said the storm was comparable in strength to Typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Philippines in 2013 and killed more than 6,000 people, and looked set to be one of the worst natural disasters the Pacific region has experienced.\n\nKris Paraskevas, a consultant in Port Vila, said: \u201cThe villages are no good. Many houses were just poles and tin or thatch. There\u2019s nothing left, people are just sitting in rubble.\u201d\n\nAid flights, including a New Zealand military Hercules aircraft carrying eight tonnes of supplies and an initial team, landed on Sunday as Port Vila\u2019s airport partially reopened.\n\nAustralia sent two military aircraft including one with medical experts, search and rescue teams and emergency supplies, while a U.N. team was also preparing to go in with members drawn from as far away as Europe. France sent a team from nearby New Caledonia and said it was considering sending more aircraft and a frigate in coordination with Australia and New Zealand.\n\nOxfam\u2019s country manager Colin Collett van Rooyen said Vanuatu\u2019s outlying islands were particularly vulnerable: \u201cWe are talking about islands that are remote and really small, with none of what we would call modern infrastructure.\u201d He said he anticipated that the death toll would climb higher.\n\nAustralia promised A$5 million in aid, New Zealand NZ$2.5 million while Britain, which jointly ruled Vanuatu with France until independence in 1980, has offered up to $2.95 million in assistance. The World Bank said it was exploring a swift insurance payout to the government.\n\n\u201cWe will also be deploying humanitarian supplies to provide support for up to 5,000 people in the form of water, sanitation and shelter,\u201d Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\nAurelia Balpe, regional head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said Vanuatu\u2019s medical system was poorly equipped to handle such a disaster.\n\n\u201cThe country mostly relies on first aid posts and the supplies in the clinics are probably just antibiotics and pain relief.\u201d\n\nPam weakened on Sunday as it moved to the southeast, and New Zealand\u2019s northern regions were starting to feel its effects. Authorities there were warning the public to prepare for damaging winds, heavy rain and big seas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SYDNEY \u2014 The first aid teams to reach Vanuatu reported widespread devastation on Sunday as authorities declared a state of emergency after a \u201cmonster\u201d cyclone tore through the Pacific island nation.
