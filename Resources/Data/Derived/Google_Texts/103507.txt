Aberdeen, SD

Camping at the Brown County fairgrounds during fair week will cost more this summer.



The rates for some spots will increase by as much as $50. The fairgrounds have nearly 450 camping spaces, not including what officials consider "primitive" and tent-only spaces.



County Commissioner Tom Fischbach says the camping spaces are routinely filled during the week of the fair.



The most expensive spaces, which include water, sewer and electric hook-ups, will cost $200, up from $150. The cheapest spaces that only allow for tent accommodations will cost $50, up from $30.



County commission vice chairwoman Rachel Kippley says the rate increases stem from a "supply and demand" decision. She says the waiting list for camping spots during the fair has up to 300 people.
