Ingredients: [Per 24 Chicken Wings]

1.25 oz. Joe’s Yard Bird Seasoning

½ lbs. Golden Brown Sugar

10 oz. Beef Stock

10 oz. Joe’s BBQ Sauce

4 oz. Tiger Sauce

2 oz Honey

2 oz White Vinegar

Directions:

Fire up your Grill/Smoker with Charcoal

Make sure to build the fire next to one side of the grill, or in the firebox so that you cook with indirect heat

Sprinkle Joe’s Hog Rub and Yard Bird Seasoning liberally on both sides of wings

Once charcoal is ready to cook on, add a few mesquite wood chunks to the fire

Place chicken wings onto grill/smoker that is at a temperature around 275 F (If you have built your fire in the grill/smoker, then group the chicken wings away from the coal bed and near the smoke stack.)

Every 20 minutes, turn chicken. See cooking times below. Add charcoal and wood as needed to maintain cooking temperature.

Mix the liquid ingredients in a mixing bowl then split into 2 disposable full steamer pans and preheat on grill

After wings have been on smoker for 30 minutes remove and place in boiling hot Candy Sauce, cover with foil and continue to boil thighs for 20 minutes.

Remove wings from hot candy sauce and firm up on hot grill to caramelize, basting with hot candy sauce as you caramelize
