Furthermore, no one asked or knew of its connection with MNSure, the state insurance gateway to the ACA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It would have to be a guess,\u201d said one patient.\n\n\u201cI need more information,\u201d says a mother escorting her young daughter home from a checkup, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard about it before.\u201d\n\nOne man quipped, \u201cI could make a guess.\u201d\n\nThis is significant since Hennepin County Medical Center takes care of the lion share of the county\u2019s indigent, homeless, poverty level and low income residents.\n\n\u201cAnyone, can go to MNSure and use an application to shop for insurance and certain folks will qualify for financial help,\u201d says John Reich with MNSure, who has been spending the run up to open enrollment, trying to get the word out especially to low income residents.\n\n\u201cIf you are eligible for a tax credit what essentially will happen is you will understand what that credit is for you and then that will be applied to a premium. In some instances there will be no premium, the credit will pay for the entire cost, in some instances folks will have to pay the balance,\u201d Reich said.\n\nBack at Hennepin County Medical Center, patients are very interested in signing up, but had some questions.\n\n\u201cAs far as pre-existing care, I\u2019m diabetic and have high blood pressure, will I be covered? Will we ever be shut off of it?,\u201d John, a patient waiting for the bus, said.\n\n\u201cAfter Jan. 1,\u201d Reich said, \u201ceveryone is guaranteed issuance of a health policy. Nobody can be denied any more for a pre-existing condition.\u201d\n\nSo, even if you are on a plan right now, and MNSure can find you a cheaper one, you can make the switch knowing you\u2019ll have guaranteed coverage.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why those with families or pre-existing condition want affordable insurance, but what if one is in a low risk health care group, like that age of young person between high school or college and a family? Why should you be forced to buy insurance? Well, it will be the law for starters.\n\nStarting Jan. 1, 2014, every legal resident of the United States, not to mention Minnesota, must have a health insurance policy.\n\n\u201cI guess the thing I am wondering is, I am a young guy, healthy and I haven\u2019t been to the doctors in years, why should I be forced to buy insurance,\u201d asked a U of M student?\n\nReich says the answer could come in an instant!\n\n\u201cEveryone is just one accident away from needing health insurance. A broken arm could cost as much as $2,500 in the emergency room. It only makes sense to get some insurance on the front end so if you do have an accident or an injury at the ER, you\u2019re covered,\u201d Reich said.\n\nThat one accident can easily exceed even the penalties you pay for not having insurance, if you\u2019re thinking of just trying to slip by that way.\n\n\u201cI have not even heard too much about the fines, I heard they were not going to start right away so they don\u2019t concern me,\u201d the student said.\n\nNot so says Reich, although far less in cost than an actual policy, the penalties begin right away.\n\n\u201cThe first year penalties start at 95 dollars and one percent of your income, whichever is greater. In 2015 it will be 325 dollars or two percent of your income, whichever is greater, and in 2016 it will 695 dollars or two and a half percent of income, whichever greater,\u201d Reich said.\n\nHe says paying a fine may be a headache you may want to avoid.\n\n\u201cWhile some folks think they\u2019re modest at the outset, the penalties do get higher as you go up,\u201d Reich said.\n\nA recent Kaiser survey appears to dispel the notion that those young members of the \u201cinvincible\u201d generation don\u2019t want health coverage, he said the figures point to a growing number of young people do want health insurance, they just cannot afford it. With MNSure and the ACA, Reich says they can.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MNSure opens enrollment October first with plenty of questions, including the most obvious: What's it all about?", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2013/09/26/mnsure-basic-questions-answered/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsminnesota.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mnsure-security-2.png?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsminnesota.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mnsure-security-2.png?w=1500", "height": 844}, "type": "article", "description": "MNSure opens enrollment October first with plenty of questions, including the most obvious: What's it all about?", "title": "MNsure: Basic Questions Answered"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsminnesota.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mnsure-security-2.png?w=1500", "description": "MNSure opens enrollment October first with plenty of questions, including the most obvious: What's it all about?", "site": "/wcco", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "MNsure: Basic Questions Answered"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic, and the Best of Minnesota, and the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "WCCO | CBS Minnesota", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/CBSMinnesota", "author": "http://facebook.com/CBSMinnesota"}, "keywords": "aca information, affordable care act, health, local, news, syndicated local, watch + listen, answers, basic questions, downtown minneapolis, health care, hennepin county medical center, minnesota, mnsure", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/306ed083e68aa1a8027608b8156838d2?s=16", "news_keywords": "answers, basic questions, downtown minneapolis, health care, hennepin county medical center, minnesota, mnsure"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4310\"", "article_summary": "MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) \u2014 MNSure opens enrollment October first with plenty of questions, including the most obvious: What\u2019s it all about?\nStarting Jan. 1, 2014, every legal resident of the United States, not to mention Minnesota, must have a health insurance policy.\n\u201cEveryone is just one accident away from needing health insurance.\n\u201cThe first year penalties start at 95 dollars and one percent of your income, whichever is greater.\nIn 2015 it will be 325 dollars or two percent of your income, whichever is greater, and in 2016 it will 695 dollars or two and a half percent of income, whichever greater,\u201d Reich said."}
