Biotechnology stocks hit a steep slide Thursday with all major exchange-traded funds in the sector down more than 5% and a number of individual equities down 10% or more amid broader market declines.

The bellwether iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF /quotes/zigman/85342/delayed /quotes/nls/ibb IBB was off nearly 6% in early afternoon trades while the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF fell more than 6%.

The drop was puzzling to ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum.

“I frankly just don’t know why biotech is off so much today,” he said in a note to clients.

Some of the most volatile stocks in the sector of late were getting hammered, with double-digit losses. Intercept Pharmaceuticals /quotes/zigman/12230574/delayed /quotes/nls/icpt ICPT tumbled more than 11% to $265.12. Pharmacyclics Inc. /quotes/zigman/53242/delayed /quotes/nls/pcyc PCYC also dropped 11%, going to $91.70.

And big-name players weren’t immune to the selloff either. Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. /quotes/zigman/59581/delayed /quotes/nls/alxn ALXN dropped more than 8% to $142.59, while Gilead Sciences Inc. /quotes/zigman/72849/delayed /quotes/nls/gild GILD lost nearly 8% to $65.15.
