A Panama City woman will be getting more than $25,000 from Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity.

Hannity is paying the money to Earline Davis because he believes he’s responsible for Davis getting fired.

Until this week, Davis was a customer service reprehensive at the new General Dynamics call center in Lynn Haven.

Davis says she was fired after answering a phone call from Hannity.

"I was in shock. I really have never been fired. I was just moping around the house just like, ‘Oh what did I do?’” Davis said.

The general Dynamics call center is handling questions from people trying to register of the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.

Hannity called the hotline number during his radio show. And Davis picked up.

"He asked me why people not able to get into the system and I read him a script because there's a script for everything,” Davis said.

During the on-air live radio show Hannity said, “I've been having trouble getting on the website."

Davis responded, “Right now from what I've heard our system is down for the next 42 hours. No one is able to get in, but if they call us we can help them fill out an application as long as they went online to create an account first."

She answered all Hannity’s questions and then hung up.

The next day she says General Dynamics Human Resource Officials called her into their office and fired her for taking the phone call.

Davis said the company treated her like a criminal.

"They wouldn't even let me go to my locker and clean it out. One lady that was sitting next to me, she cleaned it out,” Davis said.

Davis admits her week of training wasn’t enough.

"Some of the trainers didn't know what was going on. We had to go amongst ourselves to ask questions and you know help each other out,” she said.

When Davis gets the check, she says she’ll use the money to buy health insurance for her children.
