Tallahassee, FL---The trip is on for the Florida State Seminoles Early Friday afternoon the FSU football team loading up the buses andheading over to the airport. From there it was a charter 747 jet that took them out to California.

The Seminoles will continue to work out there in advance of their College Football Playoff semifinal against Oregon. The team needing 9 buses to carry everyone who's making the trip as part of the team. The 747 took off just after two eastern and was due to arrive in Los Angeles some four hours later.

The Seminoles will spend the next five days fine-tuning the game plan for the Ducks, and in particular, how to defend Heisman winner Marcus Mariota, Oregon's dual threat quarterback. A big part of that preparation, FSU redshirt freshman qb John Franklin, a six foot, 180 pounder who's working as the scout team q-b against the Seminole defense. He did the same job last year in advance of the Auburn game, trying to imitate Nick Marshall.

"John's doing a heckuva job." FSU head coach Jimbo Fisher said after the team's final workout earlier this week. "You can't simulate Mariota. But at least from an athletic standpoint, and a guy who can really run and get a sense of, how fast. But he's bigger stronger, but at least, that's the best we can do. That's about as good as anybody can simulate him."

And certainly an even better Florida State defense last year struggled with Marshall and that Auburn spread attack. So defensive coordinator Charles Kelly and his assistants have much work still ahead. FSU still an 9 point underdog. That game Thursday in Pasadena a 4 o'clock central time start for those planning the game watching parties!
