Oh, I signed it airily enough, but you\u2019d be surprised, as the years go by, how often the urge to foment starts to rise in one\u2019s gullet. Fortunately, at least as far as constitutional government goes, the president of the United States is doing a grand job of overthrowing it all by himself.\n\nOn Thursday, he passed a new law at a press conference. George III never did that. But, having ordered America\u2019s insurance companies to comply with Obamacare, the president announced that he is now ordering them not to comply with Obamacare. The legislative branch (as it\u2019s still quaintly known) passed a law purporting to grandfather your existing health plan. The regulatory bureaucracy then interpreted the law so as to un-grandfather your health plan. So His Most Excellent Majesty has commanded that your health plan be de-un-grandfathered. That seems likely to work. The insurance industry had three years to prepare for the introduction of Obamacare. Now the King has given them six weeks to de-introduce Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI wonder if he has the legal authority to do this,\u201d mused former Vermont governor Howard Dean. But he\u2019s obviously some kind of right-wing wacko. Later that day, anxious to help him out, Congress offered to \u201cpass\u201d a \u201claw\u201d allowing people to keep their health plans. The same president who had unilaterally commanded that people be allowed to keep their health plans indignantly threatened to veto any such law to that effect: It only counts if he does it \u2014 geddit? As his court eunuchs at the Associated Press obligingly put it: \u201cObama Will Allow Old Plans.\u201d It\u2019s Barry\u2019s world; we just live in it.\n\nThe reason for the benign Sovereign\u2019s exercise of the Royal Prerogative is that millions of his subjects \u2014 or \u201cfolks,\u201d as he prefers to call us, no fewer than 27 times during his press conference \u2014 have had their lives upended by Obamacare. Your traditional hard-core statist, surveying the mountain of human wreckage he has wrought, usually says, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.\u201d But Obama is the first to order that his omelet be unscrambled and the eggs put back in their original shells. Is this even doable? No. That\u2019s the point. When it doesn\u2019t work, he\u2019ll be able to give another press conference blaming the insurance companies, or the state commissioners, or George W. Bush . . .\n\nThe most telling line, the one that encapsulates the gulf between the boundless fantasies of the faculty-lounge utopian and the messiness of reality, was this: \u201cWhat we\u2019re also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy.\u201d Gee, thanks for sharing, genius. Maybe you should have thought of that before you governmentalized one-sixth of the economy. By \u201cwe,\u201d the president means \u201cI.\u201d Out here in the ruder provinces of his decrepit realm, we \u201cfolks\u201d are well aware of how complicated insurance is. What isn\u2019t complicated in the Sultanate of Sclerosis? But, as with so many other things, Obama always gives the vague impression that routine features of humdrum human existence are entirely alien to him. Marie Antoinette, informed that the peasantry could no longer afford bread, is alleged to have responded, \u201cLet them eat cake.\u201d There is no evidence these words ever passed her lips, but certainly no one ever accused her of saying, \u201cIf you like your cake, you can keep your cake,\u201d and then having to walk it back with \u201cWhat we\u2019re also discovering is that cake is complicated to buy.\u201d That contribution to the annals of monarchical unworldliness had to await the reign of Queen Barry Antoinette, whose powdered wig seems to have slipped over his eyes.\n\nStill, as historian Michael Beschloss pronounced the day after his election, he\u2019s \u201cprobably the smartest guy ever to become president.\u201d Naturally, Obama shares this assessment. As he assured us five years ago, \u201cI know more about policies on any particular issue than my policy directors.\u201d Well, apart from his signature health-care policy. That\u2019s a mystery to him. \u201cI was not informed directly that the website would not be working,\u201d he told us. The buck stops with something called \u201cthe executive branch,\u201d which is apparently nothing to do with him. As evidence that he was entirely out of the loop, he offered this:\n\nHad I been I informed, I wouldn\u2019t be going out saying, \u201cBoy, this is going to be great.\u201d You know, I\u2019m accused of a lot of things, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m stupid enough to go around saying, \u201cThis is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity,\u201d a week before the website opens, if I thought that it wasn\u2019t going to work.\n\nOoooo-kay. So, if I follow correctly, the smartest president ever is not smart enough to ensure that his website works; he\u2019s not smart enough to inquire of others as to whether his website works; he\u2019s not smart enough to check that his website works before he goes out and tells people what a great website experience they\u2019re in for. But he is smart enough to know that he\u2019s not stupid enough to go around bragging about how well it works if he\u2019d already been informed that it doesn\u2019t work. So he\u2019s smart enough to know that if he\u2019d known what he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d know enough not to let it be known that he knew nothing. The country\u2019s in the very best of hands.\n\nMichael Beschloss is right: This is what it means to be smart in a neo-monarchical America. Obama spake, and it shall be so. And, if it turns out not to be so, why pick on him? He talks a good Royal Proclamation; why get hung up on details?\n\nUntil October 1, Obama had never done anything \u2014 not run a gas station, or a doughnut stand \u2014 other than let himself be wafted onward and upward to the next do-nothing gig. Even in his first term, he didn\u2019t really do: Starting with the 2009 trillion-dollar stimulus, he ran a money-no-object government that was all money and no objects; he spent and spent, and left no trace. Some things he massively expanded (food stamps, Social Security disability) and other things he massively diminished (effective foreign policy), but all were, so to speak, preexisting conditions. Obamacare is the first thing Obama has actually done, and, if you\u2019re the person it\u2019s being done to, it\u2019s not pretty.\n\nThe president promised to \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d America. Certainly, other men have succeeded in transforming settled, free societies: Pierre Trudeau did in Canada four decades ago, and so, in post-war Britain, did the less charismatic Clement Attlee. And, if you subscribe to their particular philosophy, their transformations were effected very efficiently. But Obama is an incompetent, so \u201cfundamentally transformed\u201d is a euphemism for \u201cwrecked beyond repair.\u201d As a socialist, he makes a good socialite.\n\nBut on he staggers, with a wave of his scepter, delaying this, staying that, exempting the other, according to his regal whim and internal polling. The omniscient beneficent Sovereign will now graciously \u201callow\u201d us \u201cfolks\u201d to keep all those junk plans from bad-apple insurers. Yet even the wisest King cannot reign forever, and what will happen decades down the road were someone less benign \u2014 perhaps even (shudder) a Republican \u2014 to ascend the throne and wield these mighty powers?\n\nHey, relax: If you like your constitution, you can keep your constitution.

By \u201cwe,\u201d the president means \u201cI.\u201d Out here in the ruder provinces of his decrepit realm, we \u201cfolks\u201d are well aware of how complicated insurance is. What isn\u2019t complicated in the Sultanate of Sclerosis? But, as with so many other things, Obama always gives the vague impression that routine features of humdrum human existence are entirely alien to him. Marie Antoinette, informed that the peasantry could no longer afford bread, is alleged to have responded, \u201cLet them eat cake.\u201d There is no evidence these words ever passed her lips, but certainly no one ever accused her of saying, \u201cIf you like your cake, you can keep your cake,\u201d and then having to walk it back with \u201cWhat we\u2019re also discovering is that cake is complicated to buy.\u201d That contribution to the annals of monarchical unworldliness had to await the reign of Queen Barry Antoinette, whose powdered wig seems to have slipped over his eyes.\n\nStill, as historian Michael Beschloss pronounced the day after his election, he\u2019s \u201cprobably the smartest guy ever to become president.\u201d Naturally, Obama shares this assessment. As he assured us five years ago, \u201cI know more about policies on any particular issue than my policy directors.\u201d Well, apart from his signature health-care policy. That\u2019s a mystery to him. \u201cI was not informed directly that the website would not be working,\u201d he told us. The buck stops with something called \u201cthe executive branch,\u201d which is apparently nothing to do with him. As evidence that he was entirely out of the loop, he offered this:\n\n\nHad I been I informed, I wouldn\u2019t be going out saying, \u201cBoy, this is going to be great.\u201d You know, I\u2019m accused of a lot of things, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m stupid enough to go around saying, \u201cThis is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity,\u201d a week before the website opens, if I thought that it wasn\u2019t going to work.\u00a0\n\n\nOoooo-kay. So, if I follow correctly, the smartest president ever is not smart enough to ensure that his website works; he\u2019s not smart enough to inquire of others as to whether his website works; he\u2019s not smart enough to check that his website works before he goes out and tells people what a great website experience they\u2019re in for. But he is smart enough to know that he\u2019s not stupid enough to go around bragging about how well it works if he\u2019d already been informed that it doesn\u2019t work. So he\u2019s smart enough to know that if he\u2019d known what he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d know enough not to let it be known that he knew nothing. The country\u2019s in the very best of hands.\n\nMichael Beschloss is right: This is what it means to be smart in a neo-monarchical America. Obama spake, and it shall be so. And, if it turns out not to be so, why pick on him? He talks a good Royal Proclamation; why get hung up on details?\n\nUntil October 1, Obama had never done anything \u2014 not run a gas station, or a doughnut stand \u2014 other than let himself be wafted onward and upward to the next do-nothing gig. Even in his first term, he didn\u2019t really do: Starting with the 2009 trillion-dollar stimulus, he ran a money-no-object government that was all money and no objects; he spent and spent, and left no trace. Some things he massively expanded (food stamps, Social Security disability) and other things he massively diminished (effective foreign policy), but all were, so to speak, preexisting conditions. Obamacare is the first thing Obama has actually done, and, if you\u2019re the person it\u2019s being done to, it\u2019s not pretty.\n\nThe president promised to \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d America. Certainly, other men have succeeded in transforming settled, free societies: Pierre Trudeau did in Canada four decades ago, and so, in post-war Britain, did the less charismatic Clement Attlee. And, if you subscribe to their particular philosophy, their transformations were effected very efficiently. But Obama is an incompetent, so \u201cfundamentally transformed\u201d is a euphemism for \u201cwrecked beyond repair.\u201d As a socialist, he makes a good socialite.\n\nBut on he staggers, with a wave of his scepter, delaying this, staying that, exempting the other, according to his regal whim and internal polling. The omniscient beneficent Sovereign will now graciously \u201callow\u201d us \u201cfolks\u201d to keep all those junk plans from bad-apple insurers. Yet even the wisest King cannot reign forever, and what will happen decades down the road were someone less benign \u2014 perhaps even (shudder) a Republican \u2014 to ascend the throne and wield these mighty powers?\n\nHey, relax: If you like your constitution, you can keep your constitution. Period. And your existing amendments. Well, most of them \u2014 except for the junk ones\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u00a0Mark Steyn, a\u00a0National Review\u00a0columnist, is the author of\u00a0After America: Get Ready for Armageddon. \u00a9 2013 Mark Steyn", "card": "summary", "title": "Thus Spake Obama, by Mark Steyn, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Fri, 2013-11-15 15:30", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Thus Spake Obama", "sailthru.tags": "Thus Spake Obama, Mark Steyn, National Review", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "keywords": "Mark Steyn", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Mark Steyn, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95ea\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Mark Steyn, a National Review columnist, is the author of After America: Get Ready for Armageddon.\nSo he\u2019s smart enough to know that if he\u2019d known what he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d know enough not to let it be known that he knew nothing.\nBut, having ordered America\u2019s insurance companies to comply with Obamacare, the president announced that he is now ordering them not to comply with Obamacare.\nThe legislative branch (as it\u2019s still quaintly known) passed a law purporting to grandfather your existing health plan.\nLater that day, anxious to help him out, Congress offered to \u201cpass\u201d a \u201claw\u201d allowing people to keep their health plans."}
