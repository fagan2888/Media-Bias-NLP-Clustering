Offering industry-leading analytics to help each consumer choose the right plan, BeneFinder.com is a powerful solution for Virginia residents seeking insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. A BeneFinder customer recently used this exciting new technology platform to become the first Virginia resident to successfully purchase a broker-supported Coventry Health insurance plan in the Commonwealth.\n\nBeneFinder allows consumers to choose from a wealth of plans offered in Virginia \u2014 both those offered within the Federal Exchange marketplace, and those offered privately through the carriers. Further, it helps clients navigate the wide array of options by providing them with proprietary analytical advice, asking only a few simple questions before showing each consumer the best plans for his or her unique needs. BeneFinder\u2019s broker-based model also provides ongoing client support beyond the purchase to help clients navigate the policies when they begin using services. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act has extended insurance to a huge new audience, but there\u2019s very little out there to help these potential clients understand what they need,\u201d says David Blanchard, the company\u2019s founder. \u201cBeneFinder shows them all of the available options, not just those on Healthcare.gov, and then helps them understand what\u2019s best for them, based on their expected Out-Of-Pocket cost and usage patterns. It\u2019s a true market experience only if you can see all your options, and BeneFinder is the only platform that does exactly that.\u201d\n\nBeneFinder, in conjunction with Richmond development partner Evenspring, expects to expand its coverage base to the Mid-Atlantic region soon, and is working hard with carriers to list all the plans available through the Federal and State Exchanges as well as those available in the open market. Its simple interface and online enrollment process dramatically simplify the process of obtaining coverage under the ACA.\n\nAbout BeneFinder\n\nBeneFinder was born out of the desire to help individuals and families find a better match for their health insurance.
