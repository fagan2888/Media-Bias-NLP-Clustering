The moon\u2019s peak will occur at 8:11 a.m. Denver time.\n\nThere won\u2019t be another Christmas full moon until 2034.\n\nBy Saturday morning another 1 to 2 inches of snow is expected to fall in the metro area.\n\nThe onslaught of snow in the mountains will continue through Friday.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, mountain towns received another pounding, with 18 inches falling at Loveland Pass and 27 inches falling in parts of Jackson County, Rydell said.\n\n\u201cIt will be a good Christmas present for skiers,\u201d she said.\n\nTemperatures in Denver are expected to hit 31 degrees on Christmas and 19 on Saturday. Low temperatures will drop to 4 degrees by Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Weather forecasters see good chance of light snow in Denver for Christmas", "title": "Weather forecasters see good chance of light snow in Denver for Christmas", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/24/weather-forecasters-see-good-chance-of-light-snow-in-denver-for-christmas/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224__cd25CHRISTMAS_HHR_6462p1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224__cd25CHRISTMAS_HHR_6462p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-24T08:12:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T19:39:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Although technically there is a 40 percent chance of snow falling on Christmas, it\u2019s likely snow will fall across the Front Range, with heavier amounts of snow falling in the northern part of the state.\nOver the last 24 hours, mountain towns received another pounding, with 18 inches falling at Loveland Pass and 27 inches falling in parts of Jackson County, Rydell said.\nSnow won\u2019t begin to fall until Christmas afternoon or evening, Rydell said.\nAs much as a half-inch of snow is expected to fall in the Denver metro area Friday, making it a white Christmas if the weather follows predictions.\nBy Saturday morning another 1 to 2 inches of snow is expected to fall in the metro area."}
