Idstrom alleges Alliance Radiology terminated him without cause in February 2012 and, because of the exclusive contracts it negotiated with area hospitals, prevented him from obtaining employment since then.\n\nIdstrom says the group was formed more than 15 years ago through the combination of four previously separate practice groups. He contends they combined in order to leverage their size to extract higher reimbursement rates from hospitals and insurance companies.\n\nAlthough they now operate under the umbrella of Alliance, Idstrom says the groups still operate independently, with each assuming its own financial risks and booking its own profits. Each also has its own assigned turf to avoid the need to bid against one another, according to Idstrom.\n\nIdstrom is suing under Kansas\u2019 antitrust statute, the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act, which prohibits trusts or agreements \u201cby two or more persons\u201d to prevent competition. He claims that Alliance and members of its board engaged in a \u201ccontinuing conspiracy\u201d to violate antitrust laws.\n\nIn response, Alliance says in court documents that its four divisions have limited autonomy and no legal existence apart from Alliance. Because Alliance is a single corporation, it says, it can\u2019t be a combination of \u201ctwo or more persons,\u201d as defined by the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act.\n\n\u201cIt is a fundamental principal (sic) of Kansas conspiracy law that a corporation cannot conspire with itself,\u201d Alliance states in a trial brief.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission, which enforces federal antitrust laws, has rarely challenged physician combinations in recent years. The agency has moved to quash mergers that it deems likely to lead to higher prices or reduced quality, but it has generally allowed efforts to coordinate care \u2013 something encouraged by the Affordable Care Act \u2013 to proceed as long as a combination doesn\u2019t result in the accumulation of market power.\n\n\u201cThe real question for antitrust purposes is that you may not combine strictly for the purposes of upping your collective bargaining power against insurers or against other former of payers,\u201d says Ann Marie Marciarille, a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City who specializes in health law antitrust issues.\n\n\u201cBut you may combine if you can show that there are sufficient efficiencies that overwhelm any anticompetitive effect, and those efficiencies are typically things like the benefits to consumers of both clinical and financial integration.\u201d\n\nMarciarille, who is not involved in the Idstrom case, said examples abound of providers getting together to combine, \u201cbut in reality only combined for financial purposes to increase their leverage. And often an accompaniment of that would be something like exclusive contracting.\u201d\n\nIdstrom joined Alliance in 2005 and became a shareholder and head of its Midwest Division in 2007. At the time, Midwest\u2019s main contract was with Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital on the Country Club Plaza.\n\nThat contract was due to expire on April 30, 2007. In negotiations to renew the contract, Saint Luke\u2019s sought to carve out an exception to Alliance\u2019s exclusivity provision and allow radiologists not affiliated with Alliance to perform neuroradiology procedures, according to court documents.\n\nThe contract with Alliance was not renewed, and Idstrom says Alliance subsequently blocked him from working at the Kansas City Cancer Center, part of U.S. Oncology, because of \u201cturf\u201d conflicts with another Alliance division, as well as at Centerpoint Medical Center.\n\nAlliance counters that U.S. Oncology made the decision to work exclusively with the members of one of Alliance\u2019s divisions. And it says that Centerpoint likewise decided it wanted to work with a single radiology group and ultimately awarded the contract to one of Alliance\u2019s competitors.\n\nAlliance says it terminated Idstrom because members of his division \u201clost faith in him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis productivity had steadily declined, he became unreliable, and his negative attitude was detrimental to the division,\u201d Alliance states in its trial brief.\n\nIdstrom says he was removed because Alliance viewed him as \u201ca threat to its anticompetitive scheme.\u201d\n\nHe also claims that after he was terminated, physicians in the Midwest Division discussed ways to damage his reputation.\n\n\u201cThis type of behavior by Dr. Idstrom\u2019s former partners, combined with the exclusive contracts Alliance insists on maintaining at hospitals at which Dr. Idstrom has fostered relationships over years of first-rate work, has prevented Dr. Idstrom from obtaining full-time employment since his termination, despite substantial efforts to do so,\u201d Idstrom says in his trial brief.\n\nThe trial is expected to last two weeks. Idstrom is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nDan Margolies, editor of the Heartland Health Monitor team, is based at KCUR.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "A closely watched antitrust case pitting a prominent Kansas City area radiologist against the area\u2019s biggest radiology practice got underway Monday in", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/antitrust-trial-gets-underway-against-kc-area-s-biggest-radiology-practice", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/201512/450px_fullcolorKCUR.png", "type": "article", "description": "A closely watched antitrust case pitting a prominent Kansas City area radiologist against the area\u2019s biggest radiology practice got underway Monday in", "title": "Antitrust Trial Gets Underway Against KC Area\u2019s Biggest Radiology Practice"}, "story_id": 404444062, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@danmargolies"}, "author": "Dan Margolies", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Antitrust Trial Gets Underway Against KC Area\u2019s Biggest Radiology Practice"}, "nid": 72799, "datePublished": "2015-05-05", "keywords": "Heartland Health Monitor", "wordCount": 835, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A closely watched antitrust case pitting a prominent Kansas City area radiologist against the area\u2019s biggest radiology practice got underway Monday in Johnson County District Court.\nAlthough they now operate under the umbrella of Alliance, Idstrom says the groups still operate independently, with each assuming its own financial risks and booking its own profits.\nIdstrom is suing under Kansas\u2019 antitrust statute, the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act, which prohibits trusts or agreements \u201cby two or more persons\u201d to prevent competition.\nIdstrom says the group was formed more than 15 years ago through the combination of four previously separate practice groups.\nHe claims that Alliance and members of its board engaged in a \u201ccontinuing conspiracy\u201d to violate antitrust laws."}
