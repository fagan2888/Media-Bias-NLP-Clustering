She has also worked for the conservative Heritage Foundation, as well as National Geographic.\n\n\u201cThe White House Office of Digital Strategy contacted me to develop of health care comics. They had several personas they wanted me to develop character design for and we worked together to create the comics,\u201d Belefski told TheBlaze.\n\nShe said the characters are meant to represent someone everyone can relate to.\n\n\u201cKnow someone who makes their children\u2019s lunch? Know someone who writes to-do lists? Know someone who has posted a photo of a meal they ate? I\u2019m guilty of it! These are the \u2018every\u2019 man and woman of America,\u201d Belefski said. \u201cSince the archetypes were provided for me by the White House, I added to the character by determining how they visually look and the panel layout.\u201d\n\nThe cartoons are among the Obama administration\u2019s attempts to promote HealthCare.gov to people who don\u2019t normally follow politics. Last week, Obama did an interview with three YouTube personalities. Previously, Obama appeared on Funny or Die\u2019s mock-interview show \u201cBetween Two Ferns.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/07/10/obamas-comedy-sketch-to-promote-obamacare-has-been-nominated-for-an-emmy/\u201d target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Between Two Ferns\n\nBelow are some samples:\n\nTo see all the images, click here.\n\n(This post has been updated.)\n\n\u2014", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The White House posted seven cartoons on its website to help promote Obamacare, asking supporters to share them on social media.
