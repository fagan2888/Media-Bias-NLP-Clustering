The co-ops were intended to be consumer-operated non-profits focused on delivering healthcare to the working poor and others needing health insurance.\n\nEighteen of the 23 co-ops paid their top executives prodigious salaries ranging from $263,000 to $587,000, according to 2013 IRS tax filings.\n\nThe high take-home pay for the \u201cnonprofit\u201d executives appears to violate both federal law and Obamacare rules prohibiting \u201cexcessive executive compensation.\u201d\n\nThe co-ops were originally funded in 2011 with $2 billion under Obamacare in an experiment to provide tax-paid competition to private sector health insurance providers.\n\nMost of the Obamacare co-op executives are paid more than members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, U.S. cabinet secretaries and the governors of all 50 states.\n\nFears about excessive compensation were raised in 2011 by a key Obamacare co-op advisory board which set rules for the untested co-ops.\n\nAt a March 24, 2011, Washington, D.C. meeting, advisory board members openly agonized about the possibility of \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d by unscrupulous founders who sought to capture millions of dollars at the presumably \u201cnon-profit\u201d cooperatives. They could not agree, however, on regulatory language to prohibit it.\n\nTheDCNF probe found that their fears were justified.\n\nInfographic:\n\nThe six-figure co-op salaries are two to four times higher than the $135,000 median executive healthcare pay reported in an October 2014 nonprofit CEO compensation study published by Charity Navigator. Charity Navigator is a nonpartisan group that tracks philanthropic and charitable organizations.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the federally funded co-ops, warned them in December 2011 that federal law bars the use of tax funds \u201cto cover excessive executive compensation.\u201d\n\nAaron Albright, a CMS spokesman, told TheDCNF that \u201cthe use of federal CO-OP loan funds is prohibited from, among other restrictions, providing excessive executive compensation.\u201d\n\nAlbright did not define \u201cexcessive\u201d compensation but he suggested that CMS approved the high salaries because his centers \u201creview employment agreements for top executives of co-ops for compliance with the loan agreement.\u201d\n\nA section of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 established limits for federal contractor executive compensation at $487,000. At least five co-op executives were paid above those limits, including South Carolina, Arizona, Illinois, Massachusetts and Louisiana.\n\nThe co-ops were also required by CMS to conduct surveys to \u201creflect the market rate for a similar position in your area.\u201d Despite the government\u2019s directive, however, only half of the co-ops conducted a review, according to their IRS forms.\n\nThe high co-op salaries also appear to conflict with President Obama\u2019s personal campaign against high executive pay, which included his 2009 appointment of a \u201ccompensation czar\u201d to investigate executive salaries at private companies.\n\nTaxpayer advocates contacted by TheDCNF were outraged by the generous pay, especially in light of the perilous financial conditions that have many of the co-ops facing doubtful futures.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty shocking that they\u2019re making that much money and what\u2019s even worse is that most of these co-ops are failing,\u201d said Elizabeth Wright, health and science director for Citizens Against Government Waste, a conservative non-profit advocacy group that has exposed wasteful federal spending since 1984.\n\nWright pointed to the collapse in December 2014 of the Iowa-based Co-Opportunity Health as a prime example of Obamacare co-op mismanagement. Co-Opportunity received $177 million in federal start-up loans before state regulators took it over and declared it in \u201chazardous\u201d condition.\n\nBefore its collapse, David Lyons, Co-Opportunity\u2019s president and CEO received $261,000 in compensation. Stephen Ringlee, Co-Opportunity\u2019s CFO, received $257,000, despite having failed in several previous startups. Clifford Gold, its COO, took in $288,00.\n\nTheir pay was seven times the income for individual workers in Iowa, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\n\u201cThis is really, really shocking, especially when you see how abysmally these co-ops are performing,\u201d said Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute and a critic of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWhat they have done is the worst of both worlds. Their organizations are failing and they\u2019re paying CEO\u2019s exorbitant salaries that are completely in contrast with the concept the co-ops were supposed to stand for,\u201d Turner said.\n\nWright said it appears the co-ops have turned the familiar private-sector principle of \u201cpay-for-performance\u201d on its head in determining executive compensation: \u201cThey seem to be more careful managing their salaries than they are running the organizations they\u2019re running.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a president of a non-profit, you need to be a lot more fiscally responsible and fiscally cognizant of what you\u2019re doing, and not just seeing it as a landing pad for a high paying salary,\u201d said David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, another conservative non-profit advocacy group that analyses government spending and programs.\n\nNEXT PAGE: Burning Through Cash", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Richard Pollock", "description": "Failing Obamacare co-ops lose millions but have enough to pay extravagant salaries", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Taxpayer-funded Obamacare health insurance co-op's may be running afoul of the law by giving extravagant paychecks to their top executives, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation.", "title": "Failing Obamacare Co-Ops Offer Lavish Executive Pay \u2014 And May Violate the Law [INFOGRAPHIC]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/30/failing-obamacare-co-ops-offer-lavish-executive-pay-and-may-violate-the-law-video/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-29-at-7.19.03-PM-e1435620143442.png", "height": 516}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'This is really, really shocking'", "title": "Failing Obamacare Co-Ops Offer Lavish Executive Pay \u2014 And May Violate the Law [INFOGRAPHIC] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/30/failing-obamacare-co-ops-offer-lavish-executive-pay-and-may-violate-the-law-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-29-at-7.19.03-PM-e1435620143442.png"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-30 00:40:33", "sailthru.title": "Failing Obamacare Co-Ops Offer Lavish Executive Pay -- And May Violate the Law [INFOGRAPHIC]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "citizens-against-government-waste,obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "standout,citizens against government waste,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Taxpayer-funded Obamacare health insurance co-op's may be running afoul of the law by giving extravagant paychecks to their top executives, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-29-at-7.19.03-PM-e1435620143442.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26fb\"", "article_summary": "More than a million Americans have enrolled in the 23 non-profit Obamacare co-ops since they began in 2011.\nMost of the Obamacare co-op executives are paid more than members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, U.S. cabinet secretaries and the governors of all 50 states.\nFears about excessive compensation were raised in 2011 by a key Obamacare co-op advisory board which set rules for the untested co-ops.\nWright pointed to the collapse in December 2014 of the Iowa-based Co-Opportunity Health as a prime example of Obamacare co-op mismanagement.\nEighteen of the 23 co-ops paid their top executives prodigious salaries ranging from $263,000 to $587,000, according to 2013 IRS tax filings."}
