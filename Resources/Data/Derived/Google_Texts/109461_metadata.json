Breasts get so much attention, but yet they remain a mystery to many \u2014 including those who own them. The folks over at BuzzFeed have put common breast questions to rest by answering the most embarrassing ones you\u2019re probably too afraid to ask your doctor, in the new video \u201cAre Your Boobs Normal?\u201d Chances are they are normal.\n\n1. One of my boobs is bigger than the other. Is that normal?\n\nYes: Most women's boobs aren't identical in size. However, if finding bras is a struggle, it\u2019s best to find a bra that fits your bigger boob and find a silicone insert for the other.\n\n2. I have hair around my nipple. Is that normal?\n\nYes: It's normal to have a few hairs on the dark skin around your nipple. If they bother you, it\u2019s recommended you cut them. Avoid plucking or shaving them to prevent ingrown hairs from forming.\n\n3. Can I make my boobs bigger?\n\nNo: Doing exercises that engage your pectoral muscles can give your boobs a bit of a lift. They won\u2019t actually make the girls bigger, though.\n\n4. My nipples are leaking. Should I be worried?\n\nMaybe: If your nipples are leaking while you\u2019re pregnant or after recently giving birth, that is normal. Any other time you experience leakage you should consult your doctor to ensure you don't have a thyroid or hormone problem.\n\n5. Are my areolas too big? Too dark?\n\nNo: Aerolas, just like breast size and shape, vary. They also come in different colors.\n\n6. I have stretch marks on my boobs. Will they ever go away?\n\nYes: Stretch marks form on your boobs during development. They vary from person to person depending on your genes and your skin's stretchiness. These marks are totally normal and often fade over time.\n\n7. Is it normal if my nipples point in?\n\nMaybe: It is estimated between 10 and 20 percent of women have at least one nipple that's inverted. As long as it has always been this way and your nipples don't point out, it's just fine.\n\n8. My boobs are lumpy. Should I be worried?\n\nMaybe: Breast tissue is naturally bumpy and therefore, some women have lumpy breasts. If the lumpiness feels consistent throughout the breast and both of them feel the same, it's probably nothing to worry about. You should definitely check in with your doctor if you notice any new lumps that feel hard or different from the rest of your breast.\n\nAn ABC News poll found when it comes to breast cancer screening, confusion is rampant, as 86 percent of women say mammograms should start at age 30 or 40, and 65 percent say they should be done annually. This differs from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's recommendation to screen every two years starting at age 50. BreastCancer.org and the American Cancer Society recommends annual mammograms for al lwomen 40 and older regardless of their risk factors. Therefore, women should not forget to schedule a breast exam once a year and regularly perform breast exams at home.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "breast, sizes, stretch, marks, and, being, normal, 8, embarrassing, breast, questions, answered", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "These are the eight most commonly asked questions about boobs you\u2019re probably too afraid to ask your doctor.", "title": "8 Embarrassing Questions Every Woman Asks About Boobs \u2014 Answered [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/breast-sizes-stretch-marks-and-being-normal-8-embarrassing-breast-questions-answered-316302", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/01/05/breast-sizes-stretch-marks-and-being-normal-8-embarrassing-breast-questions-answered.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "These are the eight most commonly asked questions about boobs you\u2019re probably too afraid to ask your doctor.", "title": "8 Embarrassing Questions Every Woman Asks About Boobs \u2014 Answered [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/breast-sizes-stretch-marks-and-being-normal-8-embarrassing-breast-questions-answered-316302", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/01/05/breast-sizes-stretch-marks-and-being-normal-8-embarrassing-breast-questions-answered.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/05/breast-sizes-stretch-marks-and-being-normal-8-embarrassing-breast-questions-answered.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-01-05T14:09:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-05T14:09:01-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "These are the eight most commonly asked questions about boobs you\u2019re probably too afraid to ask your doctor."}, "article_summary": "Therefore, women should not forget to schedule a breast exam once a year and regularly perform breast exams at home.\nThe folks over at BuzzFeed have put common breast questions to rest by answering the most embarrassing ones you\u2019re probably too afraid to ask your doctor, in the new video \u201cAre Your Boobs Normal?\u201d Chances are they are normal.\nCan I make my boobs bigger?\nThese marks are totally normal and often fade over time.\nYes: Stretch marks form on your boobs during development."}
