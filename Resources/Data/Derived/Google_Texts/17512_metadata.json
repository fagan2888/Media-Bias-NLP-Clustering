But all lost valuable hours of shopping on the second Saturday before Christmas, considered among the busiest shopping days of the year. The day marks the beginning of crunch time for brick-and-mortar stores as time begins to run out for buying gifts online for holiday delivery.\n\nHoliday crowds mean police and mall management need to stay extra vigilant about threats, Allen said. Police are investigating the incident as well as a series of bomb threats on bathroom walls at local schools earlier this week, she said.\n\n\"We want to make sure that everyone is safe,\" she said.\n\nAn evacuation like those plaguing the shopping centers on Saturday can seriously disrupt business when the stores are full from open to close, said Sera Waldron, an employee at Movie Stop at the Largo Mall.\n\nShe said she was thankful that her store was far enough away from the suspicious suitcase that they did not have to close their doors, because the next two weeks are among the busiest of the year.\n\n\"It's good that we didn't get evacuated,\" she said. \"We've been packed all day. All the stores are.\"\n\nOn social media, shoppers' reactions ranged from anxiety to exasperation.\n\n\"Stay away from ALL the malls, and all my friends and family be safe!\" one resident wrote on Twitter.\n\nAnother wrote: \"People need to get a life.\"\n\n(Reporting by Karen Brooks in Austin, Texas; Editing by David Gregorio)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/12/Malls-three-US-states-evacuated-busy-holiday-shopping-day", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - Thousands of shoppers were evacuated from malls in at least three states o", "title": "Malls in three U.S. states evacuated on busy holiday shopping day"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/12/Malls-three-US-states-evacuated-busy-holiday-shopping-day", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - Thousands of shoppers were evacuated from malls in at least three states o", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But all lost valuable hours of shopping on the second Saturday before Christmas, considered among the busiest shopping days of the year.\n(Reuters) - Thousands of shoppers were evacuated from malls in at least three states on Saturday as bomb threats or scares disrupted one of the busiest days of year for holiday shopping.\nPolice are investigating the incident as well as a series of bomb threats on bathroom walls at local schools earlier this week, she said.\nThe day marks the beginning of crunch time for brick-and-mortar stores as time begins to run out for buying gifts online for holiday delivery.\nAn empty suitcase caused the evacuation of some 500 people Saturday morning at a handful of stores at the Largo Mall, an outdoor outlet mall near Tampa, Florida, authorities said."}
