Money for Education: MGN Online

A Mississippi legislator is talking a little more about upcoming budget cuts.

Representative Greg Snowden says the legislative budget proposal cuts all of the top ten budgets in the state except two. One of those will be the Mississippi Adequate Education Program. Required funding of MAEP in Initiative 42 was voted down in the last election, but Snowden says education will continue to be a priority for lawmakers.

"There are some reductions throughout the budget for other agencies simply because the revenue is down, but our top priority is always education, and that would be the last thing cut," says Snowden.

He says the proposal they have would level-fund the program.
