It\u2019s rarer still for a sitdown in the Rose Garden. And rarer still, with an interviewer who thanks the president for Obamacare.\n\nBut that\u2019s what happened when Jerry Penacoli, an actor and correspondent for the entertainment news program \u201cExtra,\u201d recounted his battle with cancer and how the Affordable Care Act \u201cpretty much saved my finances and my life\u201d in a recent interview on the White House grounds, which he called \u201cmy chance to thank the president.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObama has been on a push to promote the Affordable Care Act as the Supreme Court prepares to announce a high-stakes decision in the King v. Burwell case that could decide whether the federal exchange can allow for subsidies in states that do not have their own exchanges.\n\nOne of Obama\u2019s lines from their chat: \u201cOne of the things I try to remind people of\u2014what we do here, what the Supreme Court does, what Congress does \u2014 these aren\u2019t just abstractions,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThese are things that really matter in people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nPenacoli also lobbed softballs about life in the White House and his daughters, as well as who Obama wants to prevail in the Stanley Cup Finals between his hometown Blackhawks and the Tampa Bay Lightning. The answer was obvious. (Penacoli is apparently a Tampa Bay area native.) Obama still wouldn\u2019t pick a winner in the equally tightly contested NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors.\n\nHe also gave Obama an opportunity to address his haters. Apparently the president answers letters that call him \u201can idiot,\u201d following up on another question posed by Penacoli.\n\nObama occasionally gives interviews to local television stations to push policy initiatives, as was the case last week when he spoke with local TV anchors to push the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (It didn\u2019t turn out quite as planned, as POLITICO reported.)\n\nBut he\u2019s granted interviews to big national outlets much less frequently throughout his presidency, to the consternation of many journalists.\n\nThe president\u2019s last interview with The New York Times came with op-ed columnist Thomas Friedman in April, where Obama defended ongoing negotiations with Iran on its nuclear deal. He last spoke with CNN in late January with Fareed Zakaria in New Delhi, where the two discussed pressing global affairs ranging from Ukraine to Saudi Arabia.\n\nObama last gave an exclusive interview to Fox News on the occasion of Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014, when Fox aired the big game. (Each year since 2009, the president has done interviews with the network airing the NFL championship as part of the pregame show.)\n\nObama\u2019s also granted soft-hitting interviews of one form or another to Vox.com, Buzzfeed, Jimmy Kimmel, David Letterman, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and Zach Galifianakis.\n\nDan Pfeiffer, Obama\u2019s former senior communications adviser, explained earlier this year that the White House has \u201ctried a spaghetti strategy \u2014 throw a lot of things against the wall and see what sticks, and to be very willing to take on risk that under traditional political rules you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPfeiffer disagreed with criticism that the administration is doing all it can to avoid traditional media outlets.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not actually our strategy,\u201d he added in the interview published on Medium. \u201cThis is not an either/or strategy: it\u2019s an and/both.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama has been on a push to promote the Affordable Care Act as the Supreme Court prepares to announce a high-stakes decision in the&nbsp;King v.
