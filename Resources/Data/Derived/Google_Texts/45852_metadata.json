Favorability was at 30 percent, modestly down from 33 percent where it stood in February 2010.\n\nWhy the unfavorable trend?\n\nThere is no instance where any Tea Party principle has been shown to be off base.\n\nIf there has been a single defining theme of the Tea Party movement, it has been push back against runaway government. And public sentiment today is very much in line with this.\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll last week, 66 percent expressed dissatisfaction with the \u201csize and power of federal government.\u201d\n\nA majority of Americans today appreciate that the Tea Party was right in 2010 regarding the impending disaster of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 Obamacare.\n\nPrinciples of the movement, the very principles upon which this country was founded, liberty under God, are demonstrably true.\n\nIf we look around the world, or in our own history, we find a direct correlation between robust economic growth and limited government. It\u2019s no accident that today\u2019s sluggish economy coincides with historic bloating of the federal government.\n\nIt is also true that facts justify hoisting the banner of traditional values. Intact traditional families, and the children that grow up in them, are demonstrably healthier and wealthier.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem?\n\nOne is that upsetting the status quo means shaking up and displacing an entrenched, comfortable political establishment. For Tea Partiers, this means not just the opposition party, but also the establishment in its own party \u2013 the Republican Party.\n\nTake, for instance, the current primary challenge in Kentucky by Tea Partier Matt Bevin against Republican Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nBevin is a Tea Party candidate archetype. A young and very successful businessman, new to the political scene, a Christian man with a large family, who wants to push back against bloated government and moral relativism and restore American vitality.\n\nBut the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Riley writes that Tea Party challengers, like Bevin, are having a \u201ctough time\u201d because the incumbents they are challenging are already conservatives. \u201cMitch McConnell\u2019s problem,\u201d writes Riley, \u201c is not that he\u2019s insufficiently right-wing \u2013 it\u2019s that he\u2019s in the minority.\u201d\n\nBut Riley somehow misses the obvious. McConnell has not always been in the minority.\n\nMcConnell has been in the Senate for 30 years, and in 14 of them his party was in control. During the 8 years of the presidency of George W. Bush, Republicans controlled the Senate for 6 and McConnell held a Party leadership position. In 4 of those 8 years, Republicans held the White House and controlled both the Senate and the House.\n\nYet, during those Bush years, according to the Mercatus Center, spending increased \u201cmore than (under) any of the six presidents preceding him.\u201d The number of federal subsidy programs increased by 30 percent.\n\nThe major problems we face today - our broken entitlement programs, immigration, health care, education, a horrendous tax code - were known. Yet, all were ignored while government grew.\n\nSo when the Wall Street Journal calls performance like this conservative, no wonder the Tea Party has challenges.\n\nIn a new Pew Research Center survey only 28 percent of Republicans say their party is doing a good or excellent job of \u201cstanding up for its traditional positions\u201d compared to 49 percent of Democrats who say their party is doing an excellent or good job standing up for its positions.\n\nWe need citizen activists like Matt Bevin with the courage to fight to take back Washington from the entrenched political establishment. It\u2019s our only hope that the work will get done that is essential for saving the nation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s with mixed reviews that the Tea Party is celebrating the fifth anniversary of its emergence onto the nation\u2019s political scene..05/26/2016 19:00:45PM EST.", "author": "Star Parker", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s with mixed reviews that the Tea Party is celebrating the fifth anniversary of its emergence onto the nation\u2019s political scene.", "title": "- Why Matt Bevin is Challenging Mitch McConnell", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/starparker/2014/03/10/why-matt-bevin-is-challenging-mitch-mcconnell-n1805453", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/56/3139a475-338c-4a76-bd9d-d10f84231c9e.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "It\u2019s with mixed reviews that the Tea Party is celebrating the fifth anniversary of its emergence onto the nation\u2019s political scene.", "title": "- Why Matt Bevin is Challenging Mitch McConnell", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/starparker/2014/03/10/why-matt-bevin-is-challenging-mitch-mcconnell-n1805453", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/56/3139a475-338c-4a76-bd9d-d10f84231c9e.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Why Matt Bevin is Challenging Mitch McConnell, Star Parker, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "We need citizen activists like Matt Bevin with the courage to fight to take back Washington from the entrenched political establishment.\nTake, for instance, the current primary challenge in Kentucky by Tea Partier Matt Bevin against Republican Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell.\nIf there has been a single defining theme of the Tea Party movement, it has been push back against runaway government.\nSo when the Wall Street Journal calls performance like this conservative, no wonder the Tea Party has challenges.\nThere is no instance where any Tea Party principle has been shown to be off base."}
