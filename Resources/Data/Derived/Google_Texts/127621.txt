A new video promoting President Obama's healthcare plan is creating a lot of "buzz." Advocates of the Buzzfeed video praise it as an attempt to reach millennials, but critics say the release comes at a bad time, reports CBS News correspondent Juliana Goldman.

In "Things Everyone Does but Doesn't Talk About," the president gets in touch with his silly side, donning aviator shades and posing using a selfie stick to promote Sunday's deadline to sign up for the Affordable Care Act.

"It's more effective for them than putting up a notice on whitehouse.gov, or sending out one of 10 or 15, 20 tweets in a day saying 'Check out Healthcare.gov'," Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple said.

It's not the first time the White House has touted its health care plan under the guise of millennial-favored media. Last year, actor Zach Galifianakis invited Obama on his sketch comedy web show "Between Two Ferns."

In December, Mr. Obama repeated his pitch on "The Colbert Report."

But pundits were quick to criticize he timing of Thursday's video that followed the death of 26-year-old American Kayla Mueller, who had been held hostage by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

"You know who else sees it? The rest of the world. Alright? Do you think ISIS is quaking in their boots because knowing the president makes goofy faces in the mirror," National Review contributor Jim Geraghty said on Fox News.

Wemple said Mr. Obama could not care less about the reaction.

"He cares about the audience. He knows [about] the charges of the diminishment of the office," Wemple said. "He's trying to push this thing and Buzzfeed is an excellent partner for that."

Officials involved said Mr. Obama had a lot of fun doing this. At the end when he says "yolo, man," you can hear people laughing because that part was ad-libbed. So, yes, the president knows what "yolo" means.
