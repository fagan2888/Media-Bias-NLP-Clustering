It\u2019s known as the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS), and the April 2015 report features 11 measures of patient experience, gathered from data between July 2013 and June 2014.\n\nThings consumers are able to rate hospitals on include doctor and nurse communication, how well pain was mitigated and taken into account, and to what extent they would recommend the hospital to other patients. The hospital reviews \u2014 which were done at a total of 3,553 hospitals across the nation \u2014 are made through random surveys of patients. They aim to provide Medicare patients with more information about hospital programs.\n\nOut of the 3,553 hospitals, 251 received five stars \u2014 about seven percent, according to Kaiser Health News. Most hospitals received four stars (1,205 or 34 percent) or three stars (1,414 or 40 percent). Only about three percent of hospitals got one star, 101 total. It turns out that some of the highest rated hospitals are in Maine, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Minnesota \u2014 and the lowest rated ones were in Maryland, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Florida, California, and the District of Columbia.\n\nHowever, health care workers are concerned that the five-star rating system is too black and white, and won\u2019t offer glimpses into the nuances of hospital care, despite having good intentions.\n\n\u201cWhile star ratings could be an effective way to make quality information easier to understand, the devil is in the details,\u201d the American Hospital Association said in a statement. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk of oversimplifying the complexity of quality care or misinterpreting what is important to a particular patient, especially since patients seek care for many different reasons.\u201d\n\nIn other words, just because a hospital was given one or two stars doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll necessarily have a bad experience there. In fact, many well-esteemed hospitals like New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Northwestern Memorial Hospital were given three stars. Most hospitals given four or five stars were smaller hospitals that often focused on expensive and specialized surgeries, according to Kaiser Health News. It\u2019s often more common to have an unsavory experience at a larger, general hospital where doctors have less time and there\u2019s more sickness and chaos surrounding you.\n\n\"Rating hospitals is more complicated than judging a restaurant or hotel with star ratings,\" William Dorsey, CEO of Jackson Park Hospital in Chicago, told The Chicago Tribune.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "yelp for hospitals, medicare star ratings", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Now you can compare and contrast the nation\u2019s hospitals based on consumer ratings.", "title": "The 'Yelp For Hospitals' Lets You Rate Quality Of Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/federal-governments-yelp-hospitals-lets-you-rate-quality-care-329694", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/17/hospital-setting.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Now you can compare and contrast the nation\u2019s hospitals based on consumer ratings.", "title": "The 'Yelp For Hospitals' Lets You Rate Quality Of Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/federal-governments-yelp-hospitals-lets-you-rate-quality-care-329694", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/17/hospital-setting.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/17/hospital-setting.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-04-17T12:52:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-17T12:52:57-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Now you can compare and contrast the nation\u2019s hospitals based on consumer ratings."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe254d\"", "article_summary": "The federal government has released a new star system that allows patients to rate the quality of care in all hospitals on a one- to five-star spectrum.\nHowever, health care workers are concerned that the five-star rating system is too black and white, and won\u2019t offer glimpses into the nuances of hospital care, despite having good intentions.\nMost hospitals given four or five stars were smaller hospitals that often focused on expensive and specialized surgeries, according to Kaiser Health News.\nIn fact, many well-esteemed hospitals like New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Northwestern Memorial Hospital were given three stars.\nThe hospital reviews \u2014 which were done at a total of 3,553 hospitals across the nation \u2014 are made through random surveys of patients."}
