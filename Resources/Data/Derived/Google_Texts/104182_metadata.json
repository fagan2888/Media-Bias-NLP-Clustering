Ted Cruz (TX) and Ohio Governor John Kasich, easily carry the Magnolia State by double-digit margins. Statewide, Cruz leads Clinton 51 percent to 40 percent, and Kasich is ahead by an even larger margin, 52 percent to 37 percent.\n\nThe last time Mississippi went for a Democrat in a presidential election was 1976, when then Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter narrowly beat incumbent President Gerald Ford. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney carried the state by 12 points over President Barack Obama in the 2012 election.\n\nWhile Trump bested Cruz by 11 points in the primary last month, Clinton absolutely crushed her rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, 82 percent to 16 percent. The result was never really in doubt, given Clinton\u2019s connection to the state\u2019s African-American community.\n\nRelated: \u2018Revolts,\u2019 \u2018Riots\u2019 and \u2018Rage\u2019 on Tap if Trump or Cruz Is Denied Nomination\n\nOver 60 percent of Mississippi primary voters were African-American, exit polls show, and she won the group easily, 89 percent to 11 percent.\n\nThat trend would hold in a general election against Trump, according to the new poll. The former Secretary of State crushes Trump among black voters, 93 percent to 3 percent, and leads among women, 47 percent to 40 percent. She also holds on to 85 percent of Democrats and attracts 11 percent of GOP voters.\n\nThe poll\u2019s findings are critical for the Cruz and Kasich campaigns as they beg Republican voters to coalesce around them to deny Trump the 1,237 delegates he needs to become the GOP nominee.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Fiscal Fantasy Eliminates $20 Trillion of National Debt in 8 Years\n\nAnd if deep-red Mississippi were to become a battleground state, it\u2019s safe to say there could be a major shift in the national Electoral College map, especially given Clinton\u2019s clean sweep of the Southern primaries.\n\nOther states with large black populations that backed Clinton, like North and South Carolina, could come into play, as could reliably conservative Arkansas, a state where the Clintons enjoy deep ties.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The GOP\u2019s decades-long lock on the Deep South could be in jeopardy if Donald Trump is", "title": "Would Trump Put the Deep South in Play?
