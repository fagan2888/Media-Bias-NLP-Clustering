Law enforcement authorities on Saturday named a southeast Colorado Springs man as the suspect who allegedly hit his sleeping roommate with a hammer.

Duane Moore, 51, was arrested late Friday at his home on the 2800 block of South Circle Drive.

His roommate was being treated at Memorial Hospital earlier in the evening when a nurse, who found out the patient had been sleeping on a living-room recliner when he was hit with a hammer several times, called police about the incident, said Jacqueline Kirby, a spokeswoman for El Paso County Sheriff’s Office.

Sheriff deputies converged on the neighborhood by 11 p.m. Friday and tried to contact Moore on his mobile phone ” with negative results,” according to the law enforcement agency.

SWAT and Crisis Negotiations Unit authorities sent in a robot to make contact with Moore but the robot detected no movement. SWAT entered the house and arrested Moore without incident.

Moore, who has an outstanding parole violation warrant, was charged with attempted first-degree murder, first degree assault and felony menacing.
