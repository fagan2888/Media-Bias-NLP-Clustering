'Now it feels like a proper eating area,' says Kate. The chairs, Liberty glass table and chandelier are all vintage finds. The three limited-edition prints on the wall are by her husband James-Lee, the creative force behind cult fanzine Pavement Licker and branding agency We Are Shadows (weareshadows.com). A selection of his prints is available from Luna & Curious (lunaandcurious.com). The floor is the original concrete foundation of the building, ground down and coated in high-gloss varnish to give the effect of polished concrete\n\nKate's client list includes big names such as Kate Moss, Erin O'Connor, Daisy Lowe and Pixie Lott. She recently opened a flagship boutique at Woburn Walk in London's Bloomsbury\n\n\u2018Home for me is a creative place, it always has been. I grew up with my mum recovering chairs,rearranging the furniture, painting rooms. I\u2019d come back from school to a different house. I loved that change, the sense of evolution. I\u2019m the same now. There are some constants: my yellow chairs, the chandeliers, the chesterfield sofa.\n\n\n\n'If something is a design classic, it\u2019s like your favourite handbag \u2013 everything else can work around that. Objects help to create a narrative \u2013 there\u2019s always something to talk about if you have a flying owl or a stuffed hare in the room. Calm comes from the quiet palette of grey, white and black and acres of storage to hide the day-to-day clutter.\n\n\n\n\u2018James and I are both control freaks, so doing the house could have been tricky, but it\u2019s been a marriage of tastes \u2013 he is slightly more graphic than me, but I love our mix. We work in the same way \u2013 we aren\u2019t really spreadsheety people, we\u2019re more moodboard types. It\u2019s been fun putting it all together and it evolves all the time.\u2019 halfpennylondon.com\n\n\n\n\n\nThe family\n\nKate shares her three-bedroom, two-storey early-1800s mews house in North London with husband James-Lee Duffy, an art director and illustrator, and their cats Chicken and Punk\n\nJames-Lee's studio on the first floor is home to his extensive collection of art and culture books and his quirky collectables\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a bizarre coincidence, before Kate and James-Lee met, he had tried to buy these shop drawers from an antiques store, but Kate had already purchased them a couple of hours earlier. 'James couldn't believe it when he saw them in my house after we had got together! We'll keep them for ever - I think they'd look great in the kitchen with a huge slab of marble on top.' Rockett St George sells a range of glass cloches (rockettstgeorge.co.uk)\n\n\n\nKate and James-Lee are big art collectors. 'When we were married last year, we asked guests to 'shoot, make or draw' gifts for us - we received some amazing pieces, and a brace of pheasants from a friend who is handy with a shotgun!' Kate goes to the Affordable Art Fair each autumn to find new talent (affordableartfair.com). 'They have a great buyer who selects some fantastic graduate work,' she says. Paul's Emporium in North London (020 7607 3000), the stretch of antiques shops on Golborne Road in West London, and Sunbury Antiques Fair in Surrey (sunburyantiques.com) are Kate's other favourite haunts for tracking down vintage artworks and quirky objects\n\n'When we were married last year, we asked guests to \u201cshoot, make or draw\u201d gifts for us'\n\nKate found the leather chesterfield at Sunbury Antiques Market. The cushions are her own design and are available from the Mint List (themintlist.com)\n\n\n\n'I hang my necklaces on the taxidermy crow\u2019s head above the bed'\n\nThe original bathroom was split in two to allow for an en-suite wet room to the master bedroom. Kate commissioned the cast concrete sink and copper taps to her design and had them made by her builders, Francis Grimaldi Lowe (francisgrimaldilowe.com). \u2018They\u2019re more artisans than builders and were able to do anything we wanted,\u2019 says Kate. The matt black tiles are from Tower Ceramics (towerceramics.co.uk). The yellow Ghost mirror by Philippe Starck for Kartell is available from Made In Design (madeindesign.co.uk)\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "With,key,pieces,place,celebrity,stylist,designer,Kate,Halfpenny,uses,curios,objets,d,art,home,unique,atmosphere", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-2473110/With-key-pieces-place-celebrity-stylist-designer-Kate-Halfpenny-uses-curios-objets-d-art-home-unique-atmosphere.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Curiouser and Couriouser", "title": "Celebrity stylist Kate Halfpenny's home has a unique atmosphere", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-2473110/With-key-pieces-place-celebrity-stylist-designer-Kate-Halfpenny-uses-curios-objets-d-art-home-unique-atmosphere.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/23/article-0-18ED5CC400000578-114_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2473110, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "With,key,pieces,place,celebrity,stylist,designer,Kate,Halfpenny,uses,curios,objets,d,art,home,unique,atmosphere", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2013-10-26T23:01:00.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Clare+Nolan+for+The+Mail+on+Sunday", "section": "You mag", "modified_time": "2013-10-26T23:01:16.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "With key pieces place celebrity stylist designer Kate Halfpenny uses curios objets d art home unique atmosphere"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Curiouser and Couriouser", "title": "Celebrity stylist Kate Halfpenny's home has a unique atmosphere", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-2473110/With-key-pieces-place-celebrity-stylist-designer-Kate-Halfpenny-uses-curios-objets-d-art-home-unique-atmosphere.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/23/article-0-18ED5CC400000578-114_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "Lifestyle,Culture,You", "description": "Curiouser and Couriouser"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0172\"", "article_summary": "With the key pieces in place, celebrity stylist and designer Kate Halfpenny uses curios and objets d\u2019art to give her home a unique atmosphereKate painted the dining area of the open-plan ground floor in Farrow & Ball Pavilion Gray and kept all the other walls white.\nShe recently opened a flagship boutique at Woburn Walk in London's Bloomsbury\u2018Home for me is a creative place, it always has been.\nThe yellow Ghost mirror by Philippe Starck for Kartell is available from Made In Design (madeindesign.co.uk)\nKate commissioned the cast concrete sink and copper taps to her design and had them made by her builders, Francis Grimaldi Lowe (francisgrimaldilowe.com).\nRockett St George sells a range of glass cloches (rockettstgeorge.co.uk)Kate and James-Lee are big art collectors."}
