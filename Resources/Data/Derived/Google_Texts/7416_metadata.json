Doctors also may feel less invested in the health of patients they believe are with them only for the short term, he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenging issue to really parse out,\u201d Dr. Ladapo said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a very important one, and in general, any breaks in continuity that happen as a result of these narrowing networks or plan changes are probably not in the best interest of patients.\u201d\n\nThe annual changes in plans and prices are a result of the many unknowns in the new markets. Insurers are changing their pricing, often significantly, year to year as they struggle to figure out how healthy or sick their new customers are. In some cases, insurers tried to get a foothold in the market with unsustainable low prices that they now must raise.\n\nPhoto\n\nAn additional factor for 2016 is the closing of a dozen nonprofit cooperative insurers that had more than 500,000 customers around the country. Those consumers will have no choice but to find a new plan, as will others whose insurers are leaving the exchange markets because they were losing too much money.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Nashville, Alyssa Bernhardt learned recently that her plan from BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee would rise to $115 a month even after her federal subsidy, from $45. She logged onto HealthCare.gov last week and found a comparable plan that will cost only $40 a month. She has switched plans every year since the exchanges opened, though she has managed to stay with Blue Cross Blue Shield all along.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so confusing,\u201d said Ms. Bernhardt, 28, a graduate student and part-time consultant. \u201cIt would be a lot easier if I could just renew the same plan.\u201d\n\nLast year, many people did just that, taking no action and letting their coverage automatically renew for 2015. Still, about half of returning HealthCare.gov customers at least shopped around before settling on a health plan, and about 25 percent switched \u2014 far more than many experts predicted. Those who switched insurers but kept the same level of coverage ended up saving about $490 over the course of the year in premium costs, according to a report by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAs much as they dislike switching plans, people like Ms. Galen, who has a history of skin cancer, say it is far preferable to what they faced before the health law took effect. Then, many people with medical conditions could not get insurance or had to pay much more for it, and they clung to whatever coverage they could get because if they tried to switch to a different insurer, they would most likely be rejected.\n\nMary Stuart, 64, of Omaha, has already switched to Assurant from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Nebraska, and so far has been able to keep her doctors. Now Assurant is leaving the exchange market, and Ms. Stuart is intent on finding a new plan that will cover the ophthalmologist who treats her macular degeneration, a serious eye disease.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, oh God, here we go again,\u201d said Ms. Stuart, who does not receive a premium subsidy and pays $890 a month for her current plan.\n\nOn the other hand, she said, \u201cWith my medical issues, to get with another insurer pre-Obamacare would have been really hard. So even though I\u2019m bouncing and bouncing around, in some respects the current situation is so much better.\u201d\n\nIf Ms. Stuart has a Zen-like approach to the shop-and-switch routine, Ramon Cinco, a middle school teacher in Houston, said he is approaching it \u201cin panic mode.\u201d He is switching plans not to get a better deal, but because his current plan with Cigna, which allows his family to see any doctor without a referral, is being discontinued.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cinco, 43, switched to Cigna this year after being frustrated with his 2014 plan from Aetna, which he said had too narrow a provider network to be useful. Now, he said, he is likely to switch back to Aetna for 2016, to a plan that seems to have a narrower network of hospitals than he has access to now.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to make a switch for 2016,\u201d Mr. Cinco said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy and pleased with my plan, and this came as a big shock.\u201d\n\nAs for Ms. Galen, her insurer, LifeWise, is discontinuing her current plan and offering her a similar one with premiums that are 38 percent higher over all. She will get a bigger subsidy next year because of rising rates in her state, so her share of the premium would increase by only $27 a month. But she would also face higher out-of-pocket costs for visiting the doctor, and a higher out-of-pocket limit. And the new plan does not appear to cover her current doctors, she said.\n\nThat leaves her with more than a dozen choices from six insurers, which she has begun researching. She wants to make sure she can stick with the dermatologist she has been visiting since her skin cancer diagnosis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a constant, background nagging feeling of a chore undone,\u201d she wrote in an email last week. \u201cAnd still, it\u2019s a huge improvement over the old days! I didn\u2019t have to shop at all then; I was stuck with the same rip-off, narrow policy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151118101325, "twitter": {"description": "Prices
