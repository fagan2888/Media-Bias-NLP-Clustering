The rejoinder struck a remarkably different tone than that of some of his brother bishops.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of Louisville, Ky., president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, called the Supreme Court ruling wrong, adding that \"it is profoundly immoral and unjust for the government to declare that two people of the same sex can constitute a marriage.\"\n\nCupich immediately pointed out that the Supreme Court had redefined civil marriage, which has no bearing on the Catholic sacrament of matrimony, he said.\n\n\"The rapid social changes signaled by the Court ruling call us to mature and serene reflections as we move forward together,\" he said in the statement. \"In that process, the Catholic Church will stand ready to offer a wisdom rooted in faith and a wide range of human experience.\"\n\nHe also cautioned against discrimination, pointing to the catechism of the Catholic Church as a guide for showing respect and compassion toward the LGBT community.\n\n\"This respect must be real, not rhetorical, and ever reflective of the Church's commitment to accompanying all people,\" he said.\n\nChicago's 46th annual Pride Parade Spectators react to Chicago's 46th annual Pride Parade and the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling to uphold gay marriage on June 28, 2015.

He returns to the U.S. later this week.\n\nmbrachear@tribpub.com\n\nTwitter @TribSeeker", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Cupich: 'Respect must be real, not rhetorical'", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "As Chicago's Pride Parade came to a close Sunday afternoon, Chicago's Archbishop Blase Cupich urged Roman Catholics to \"extend support to all families, no matter their circumstances, recognizing that we are all relatives, journeying through life under the careful watch of a loving God.\"", "title": "Cupich: 'Respect must be real, not rhetorical'", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-archbishop-cupich-supreme-court-met-20150628-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55908d1d/turbine/ct-archbishop-cupich-supreme-court-met-20150628", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp05.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Archbishop Blase Cupich, Pride Parade, Supreme Court, same-sex marriage, Blase Cupich, gay marriage", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/83886794", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-06-28", "Description": "Archbishop Blase Cupich urged Catholics to \"extend support to all families, no matter their circumstances,\" after Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Archbishop Blase Cupich, Pride Parade, Supreme Court, same-sex marriage, Blase Cupich, gay marriage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d89\"", "article_summary": "\"This respect must be real, not rhetorical, and ever reflective of the Church's commitment to accompanying all people,\" he said.\nCupich immediately pointed out that the Supreme Court had redefined civil marriage, which has no bearing on the Catholic sacrament of matrimony, he said.\nCupich is one of 46 bishops in Rome this weekend to receive their palliums, symbols of their offices as bishops.\nChicago's 46th annual Pride Parade Spectators react to Chicago's 46th annual Pride Parade and the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling to uphold gay marriage on June 28, 2015.\nAs Chicago's Pride Parade came to a close Sunday afternoon, Chicago's Archbishop Blase Cupich urged Roman Catholics to \"extend support to all families, no matter their circumstances, recognizing that we are all relatives, journeying through life under the careful watch of a loving God.\""}
