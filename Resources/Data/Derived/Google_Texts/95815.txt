A Florida man has been arrested and charged with attempted murder after firing 15 rounds into a car at a Brandon, Florida Waffle House early Saturday morning.

The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office reports that Matthew Laine, age 22, left the restaurant to open fire at point-blank range injuring the two women inside of the vehicle.

Briana Reddick, age 20 and Princess Benoit, 16, were both treated for injuries at Tampa General Hospital. Reddick was hit in the arm, leg and had a bullet lodged in one of her clavicles. Benoit was hurt by the broken grass, suffering cuts as the windows were shot out by Laine.

The man fled the scene but quickly located and arrested at his home.

Based on interviews, Laine does not appear to personally know the victims and there is no evidence of any other altercation preceding the shooting, officials said. The also report that no altercation took place before the shooting that would have instigated violence.

Detectives stated that they believe the gun used was Laine’s personal weapon.
