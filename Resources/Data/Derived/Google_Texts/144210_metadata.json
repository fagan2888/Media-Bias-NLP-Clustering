John McCain in the state\u2019s Republican primary next year.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ward has been busy meeting with national conservative groups that back challengers to Republican incumbents while trying to determine if she could raise enough money to mount a credible campaign.\n\nIn a Thursday interview with The Daily Caller, Ward argued that McCain, who is 78, would be vulnerable in a Republican primary. She suggested she would contrast herself with the longtime senator over his support for comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nHere is a transcript of that conversation, lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\nShould you jump into this race, why would John McCain be vulnerable?\n\nWard: Well, I think that people in Arizona, from what I can tell going around the state here over the last several weeks, are ready for a change. But not just change for the sake of change, they want positive change. They want real representation. They want two-way conversations between them and the person representing them.\n\nSometimes, I think when people are in office for a very long time, they kind of lose touch with the people that they represent. And for me, I want a government for and by the people and the only way to get that is to be one of the people and to be with the people. I think that\u2019s what people are looking for, and I think that\u2019s what I have proven, over the time that I have been in the Arizona State Senate, that I can offer.\n\nSpecifically, on what issues do you disagree with McCain?\n\nWard: Well the biggest thing is probably border security. I think that we should secure our border. I think that we should stress legal immigration. I\u2019m not a fan of amnesty. So there\u2019s that.\n\nFour and a half, five years ago, we got, \u201cbuild the dang fence\u201d from Sen. McCain, but we still don\u2019t have a fence.\n\nSo that\u2019s one and I also think that he hasn\u2019t been out there enough against Obamacare, in my opinion. As a physician, Obamacare is the reason why I ran for office. And I want somebody in Washington seriously fighting against the federal takeover of our healthcare system. I want a free-marketed approach to healthcare. Not socialized medicine.\n\nTell me a little bit more about your background.\n\nWard: I\u2019m a family doctor, I\u2019ve been in practice in Arizona for the past 16 years right after my residency that I did in Michigan. I love it. I\u2019ve had a private practice with my mom for primary care. She\u2019s a pediatrician, I\u2019m a family\u2019s physician. We worked together for those 10 years. I sold my practice to a community health center, and I got a lot of the community health perspective and the safety net perspective.\n\nAnd then when I deferred to contemplate running for office, I transferred to working just in the emergency department in my community\u2026rural Arizona. And so I\u2019m still in the trenches now. I don\u2019t work during the session. We\u2019re a part-time legislature, but out of session I keep my medical mind sharp by working in the emergency department. And I get to see the good, the bad and the ugly of this healthcare system that is being thrust upon us. And I can tell you that there is a lot of bad and a lot of ugly. There is very little good.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "Kelli Ward, a physician and state senator in Arizona, says she might challenge Sen.
