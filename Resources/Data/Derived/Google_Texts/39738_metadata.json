It argued that health plans lacking its services did not meet legal requirements for adequate coverage and should not be sold on the state\u2019s exchange, called Washington Healthplanfinder.\n\nSince then, Children\u2019s gradually has reached agreements with the insurers that originally excluded them. They include Molina Healthcare of Washington, Coordinated Care Corporation, and Premera Blue Cross and its subsidiary LifeWise.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement ends the administrative appeal; the court case was dropped for technical reasons.\n\nThe OIC has approved 90 individual plans and 23 plans for small employers to be sold through the state\u2019s insurance exchange. Thirty of the individual plans are with BridgeSpan.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Children\u2019s is in all of the networks, but \u201cwe know we are in the plans that will cover the majority of the population that will utilize the exchange,\u201d Children\u2019s spokeswoman Stacey Dinuzzo said by email.\n\nThe question of who\u2019s included in an insurance plan\u2019s network has become a hot topic in the era of health-care reform.\n\nIn the past, insurance companies were able to control costs in part by refusing to cover sick people and through limits on which services plans would cover. The Affordable Care Act changed that by outlawing the exclusion of people based on preexisting conditions and by establishing a set of fundamental benefits that all plans must include.\n\nThat has left insurance companies with fewer economic levers to pull. So many are controlling costs by shrinking their provider networks.\n\nThis spring Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler approved rules defining what insurance companies needed to do to ensure that their provider networks were sufficiently robust. The regulations don\u2019t explicitly say which hospitals must be included, but emphasizes transparency so consumers can more easily figure out who is covered and requires insurers each month to update their lists of who is in their network.\n\nKreidler applauded Tuesday\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cIf we expect innovations in the health-care industry, then we have to be willing to let the parties involved create them and not over-regulate them,\u201d Kreidler said in an email. \u201cAnd if done right, they can help keep costs down and offer more options for consumers.\u201d\n\nThe controversial issue of who is included in a network became more sensational this May when the OIC\u2019s chief presiding officer assigned to the case, Patricia Petersen, filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that another OIC employee had tried to influence her rulings in the matter.\n\nThis summer an independent investigator concluded that Petersen had been misleading and untruthful in her characterization of incidents related to the case. Petersen and her attorney rejected the investigator\u2019s conclusions and argued she was fighting for \u201cjudicial independence.\u201d\n\nInformation from Seattle Times archives is included in this story", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "A nearly yearlong dispute in which Seattle Children\u2019s hospital sought to make sure its facilities and experts were included in Washington state health insurance plans was finally resolved Tuesday.
