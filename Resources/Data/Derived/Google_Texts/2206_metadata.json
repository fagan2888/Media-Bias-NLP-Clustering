We have become a country of honest socialists versus lying Republicans. We have had the chance to do something in Congress in the past two years, and we have done nothing.\u201d\n\nJindal said House Speaker John Boehner failed because he couldn\u2019t rally Republicans.\n\n\u201cIf Mitch McConnell (Senate majority leader) isn\u2019t willing to fight for our principles, he needs to step down too,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cWe have become the party of \u2018we can\u2019t.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe said he wants Republicans to fight to abolish the Affordable Care Act, to approve a balanced budget amendment, to cut government spending, reduce government regulations and pass sensible immigration reform. He also favors term limits for Washington politicians.\n\nOn immigration, Jindal said, \u201cWe need to secure our border once and for all. We need to end sanctuary cities and arrest mayors of cities as accessories if they do not go along with it. We need to realize that immigration without assimilation is an invasion.\u201d\n\nHe also talked about his tax reform plan that would have three tiers of tax rates \u2014 2 percent, 10 percent and 25 percent.\n\nJindal said some candidates favor a plan where some would pay no taxes. He thinks it is important for everyone to have \u201csome skin in the game.\u201d\n\nHe said the moral and cultural decay in America is a huge problem \u2014 and it begins at home.\n\n\u201cWe take steps to end bullying in our schools and then have our children come home and have fun killing people on their video games,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he referred continually to his \u201cidea of America\u201d theme.\n\n\u201cShame on the fools in Washington for allowing the America idea to slip away. Shame on the rest of us for letting them,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | MASON CITY - Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal hammered home many traditional conservative principles Sunday night and lashed out at fellow Republi", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "MASON CITY - Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal hammered home many traditional conservative principles Sunday night and lashed out at fellow Republicans for not fighting hard enough for them.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/government/jindal-boosts-america-idea-in-mason-city-stop-20151011", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20151011/ARTICLE/151019931/EP/1/1/EP-151019931.jpg", "article": {"section": "Default"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/government/jindal-boosts-america-idea-in-mason-city-stop-20151011", "description": "MASON CITY - Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal hammered home many traditional conservative principles Sunday night and lashed out at fellow Republicans for not fighting hard enough for them.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "Jindal boosts 'America idea' in Mason City stop"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2015-10-11T20:42:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_default", "pubDate": "2015-10-11T20:42:46-05:00", "title": "Jindal boosts 'America idea' in Mason City stop"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc94c5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cShame on the fools in Washington for allowing the America idea to slip away.\nOn immigration, Jindal said, \u201cWe need to secure our border once and for all.\nSpeaking to about 100 at a spaghetti dinner at a VFW hall in Mason City, the Louisiana governor said the \u201cAmerica idea\u201d \u2014 freedom and opportunity that has been a mainstay in this country for generations \u2014 is slipping away.\nBy John Skipper, Mason City Globe GazetteMASON CITY \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal hammered home many traditional conservative principles Sunday night and lashed out at fellow Republicans for not fighting hard enough for them.\nBut he referred continually to his \u201cidea of America\u201d theme."}
