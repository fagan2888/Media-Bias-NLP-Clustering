I hear Global Warming was also responsible for ObamaCare, the National Debt and Obama's poor golf game.

Obama helped cause the drought in California and now he's going to blame Global Warming and funnel more money to the Green Mafia over a drought that the Green Mafia thinks doesn't go far enough.

The House will pass legislation next week that would restore the flow of water to farms, homes and businesses in California's Central Valley, to help victims of what congressional Republicans say is a drought that is being made worse by the Obama administration.

In 2009, the Obama administration upset that agreement by requiring the diversion of water away from farmers and residents to help ensure enough water for salmon and a three-inch fish called the Delta smelt. The Obama administration justified this under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), but California Republicans say this decision led to a government-created drought for regions of California's Central Valley.

The bill would require California to restore water deliveries to the Central Valley that were made under the 1994 Bay Delta Accord, which the GOP says was a compromise between residents, farms, environmentalists, and the state and federal government.

"Environmentalists have decided that fish are more important than the unemployed," said House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). He said the bill "puts families before fish."

Earlier in the day, the Obama administration said it opposes the bill and Obama would veto it if it made it to his desk.
