All candidates in this race have been invited to interview. Some responses have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Monroe County Council member, Shelli Yoder, is running as a Democrat in the 9th Congressional District. Yoder, a former Miss Indiana, won the Democratic primary in this race in 2012, but went on to lose to Republican U.S. Rep. Todd Young. However, this race can\u2019t end up a rematch because Young has stepped away from this seat to run for the U.S. Senate.\n\nCurrent hometown: Bloomington\n\nAge: 47\n\nOccupation: Educator at the Kelly School of Business at IU Bloomington\n\nFun fact: I love outdoor camping, tent camping. My husband and I, we have three kids and ever since we had our first newborn\u2014she was just a few weeks old\u2014we started getting outside and going camping with her and now as a family it\u2019s part of who we are.\n\nWhat\u2019s one of your main goals if you\u2019re elected?\n\nFrom day one serving the 9th District, I want to create an environment of good paying jobs throughout the 9th District. Too many families continue to live paycheck-to-paycheck and too many more still looking for work. Work that is more than just making a living, but making a life. I want to work to create an environment that encourages the growth of small businesses by cutting red tape easing tax burdens on small business owners, and increasing access to capital for entrepreneurs.\n\nWhat gives you a different perspective than the other candidates?\n\nI\u2019m not a career politician, but I am finishing a four-year term with the Monroe County Council. And serving in local government, that experience has taught me what bipartisan cooperation looks like. At a local level, we don\u2019t get caught up in partisan bickering that I feel is so much a part of Washington.\n\nIn addition to that, my years of experience in budgeting and fiscal oversight as a nonprofit executive. I had to listen and follow the mission of the organization and be very cautious and care-filled in a way we spent donors\u2019 money.\n\nNow as an educator at the Kelly School of Business, having my finger on the pulse on the next generation of business leaders and entrepreneurs, and seeing the concern they have for college debt, college tuition and whether or not jobs will be available to them upon graduating, I feel those real concerns and maybe feel them even more so at a very personal level as a mom of three kids.\n\nWhere do you stand on:\n\nObamacare\n\nI think that affordable health care is a basic human right and while I support the Affordable Care Act\u2026 I want to make it better and that affordable piece, I want to continue working on to make sure that we are addressing the growth of out of pocket health care costs for families.\n\nRaising the federal minimum wage\n\nI support the Raising the Wage Act, which is a gradual increase of the minimum wage to 2020 to $12 and at that point reevaluating and seeing the impact. One of the ways that we need to get more people engaged in the economy is addressing this systemic problem that wages are not keeping up with the cost of living.\n\nResettling Syrian refugees\n\nWe have legislation that\u2019s built into how we go about the process of legally helping those around the world in need. And growing up watching my church support and sponsor a Cambodian family when I was young when they were seeking refuge, made a huge impact on me and I hope that Indiana stands firm in how we have been a place of refuge for those who need it.\n\nI know that if we stand firm with the guidelines and the policies and procedures that are already on the books, we can help Syrian refugees find a place they can call home and to bring with them a desire to reengage this economy and help our state in a way that will help them.\n\nRaising the retirement age for Social Security\n\nThere are many ways that we can address strengthening Social Security, but raising the retirement age, for me, puts that responsibility on the backs of our seniors. I feel we need to be doing more to get younger people into the economy and supporting our seniors in the years where they can retire and enjoy the years of labor\u2026.\n\nI look at my parents who are both now in their 70s and they both work. They have to work because the cost of Social Security isn\u2019t keeping up.\n\nWhether the Senate votes on President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee\n\nI am not a career politician, but I am finishing my four years serving on the Monroe County Council. If I just refused to do something for the taxpayers, what I was elected to do and why I was elected to serve, the reason why I was given this incredible responsibility\u2014I absolutely would show up to my job and do it. I think it\u2019s outrageous that there are those who refuse to do their jobs.\n\nTrans-Pacific Partnership\n\nWhile I support free trade, I also want to make sure that it\u2019s not creating an environment that is undermining hard working men and women here in the United States. My concern is that the TPP has yet to address this component.\n\nWhy should you be elected?\n\nI bring to this job a background of both private sector experience, nonprofit management, serving in a capacity at a local elected official on the Monroe County Council and a sensibility of a mom. And a real desire to serve the people of the 9th District. Having grown up in rural Indiana wanting to listen to the voices of those in the district and take their concerns to Washington in the people\u2019s house, the House of Representatives.\n\nMax Bomber is a reporter for TheStatehouseFile.com, a news website powered by Franklin College journalism students.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2"}, "article_summary": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Monroe County Council member, Shelli Yoder, is running as a Democrat in the 9th Congressional District.\nI\u2019m not a career politician, but I am finishing a four-year term with the Monroe County Council.\nFrom day one serving the 9th District, I want to create an environment of good paying jobs throughout the 9th District.\nWhether the Senate votes on President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nomineeI am not a career politician, but I am finishing my four years serving on the Monroe County Council.\nI bring to this job a background of both private sector experience, nonprofit management, serving in a capacity at a local elected official on the Monroe County Council and a sensibility of a mom."}
