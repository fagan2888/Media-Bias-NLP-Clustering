Princes can transform into beasts and princesses into mermaids with just a few strokes of a pen; the violence of blows can be illustrated with radiating bolts of jagged light, punctuated by stars or little birds flying in circles around a character\u2019s head. Computer-generated imagery attempts to make the fantastical real\u2014to bring to life the wonder or horror of Ant-Man becoming subatomic, or a raptor taking a bite out of an unsuspecting side character. Animation has no such designs on the audience\u2019s willing suspension of disbelief. If you\u2019re watching, you must buy in to the unreal: Talking fish, magical gems, dogs that can change their size and shape effortlessly. It\u2019s a medium of pure play; the point is primarily to be awesome.\n\nAnimation for adults, then, has always been a little bit of a twist on the form. Shows like \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cFamily Guy\u201d are essentially sitcoms with very different production values. A show like \u201cArcher\u201d might take advantage of animation by placing its characters in a new foreign locale every few episodes, or drawing humor out of Sterling Archer\u2019s apparent ability to get shot 15 times and still crack jokes. But it\u2019s a subtler kind of fantasy. \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and perhaps even \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d offer an animated family as a universal family, eschewing the inevitable politics of casting on-screen actors. All of these shows have their merits\u2014well, maybe not \u201cFamily Guy\u201d\u2014but their relative normalcy might be why \u201cAdventure Time,\u201d on Cartoon Network, has captured the hearts and minds of adults and kids alike. It definitively \u201carrived,\u201d five seasons in, when Emily Nussbaum covered it in the New Yorker\u2014writing that because the show is \u201cchildlike, nonlinear, poetic and just outside all the categories that the world considers serious, it\u2019s television that you can respond to fully, without needing to make a case for why.\u201d I\u2019m less onboard with her description of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d as \u201cdruglike\u201d\u2014though I get it, stoned animation is its own multilayered world, crowned by \u201cAqua Teen Hunger Force.\u201d But as she describes, animation that combines naivet\u00e9 with fantasy is its own kind of transporting wonder; maybe this is why decades later, we still can\u2019t let go of Disney films.\n\nRight now there are a lot of worthy animated shows, ostensibly for children, that enter that space of genius-level creative immersion\u2014I have been remiss on writing about \u201cSteven Universe,\u201d but, you guys, \u201cSteven Universe\u201d!\u2014but what\u2019s fascinating about Netflix\u2019s \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d is that the show is entering that space of surreality in a thoroughly and decidedly adult way. Where other shows play with magic weaponry and middle-school crushes, \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d uses alcohol, casual sex and drug addiction to build its landscape. But the result is still comparably wondrous. Netflix released the second season of the show Friday morning, and from the first several episodes released to critics, the second season is so far even better than the first.\n\nPartly, the second season feels stronger because \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d is very much an acquired taste. It took me a solid six episodes to fall under the show\u2019s spell, largely because I was continually navigating the show\u2019s split personality\u2014it\u2019s not entirely full of awe, like the children\u2019s cartoons I\u2019ve mentioned, or entirely without magic, like the adult cartoons I\u2019ve grown used to. \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d is a show about an actor named BoJack Horseman, who is a man with a horse-head, voiced by Will Arnett. He is a washed-up sitcom star from decades ago who now is a barely functional alcoholic. Throughout the first season, he formed a friendship with writer Diane Nguyen (Alison Brie), a writer whose tell-all book about him ends up becoming a bestseller. Naturally, he also develops feelings for her, but she rebuffs them, to instead date and then marry the annoyingly upbeat Mr. Peanutbutter (Paul F. Tompkins), a dog-person. BoJack\u2019s agent is a large pink humanoid cat, named Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris). She is dating a man who is actually three children standing on top of each other in a trench coat, who goes by Vincent Adultman (also Brie). She has not yet caught on.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Will Arnett, Amy Sedaris and Alison Brie return to Netflix as entertainment animals with all-too-human problems", "title": "Cartoon magic for grown-ups: \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d imbues the cynical TV industry with zoomorphic soul", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Will Arnett, Amy Sedaris and Alison Brie return to Netflix as entertainment animals with all-too-human problems", "title": "Cartoon magic for grown-ups: \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d imbues the cynical TV industry with zoomorphic soul", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/19/cartoon_magic_for_grown_ups_bojack_horseman_imbues_the_cynical_tv_industry_with_zoomorphic_soul/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/bojack_horseman3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Will Arnett, Amy Sedaris and Alison Brie return to Netflix as entertainment animals with all-too-human problems", "title": "Cartoon magic for grown-ups: \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d imbues the cynical TV industry with zoomorphic soul", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/bojack_horseman3.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, alison brie, bojack horseman, Editor's Picks, Netflix, TV, Will arnett", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20a2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d is a show about an actor named BoJack Horseman, who is a man with a horse-head, voiced by Will Arnett.\nPartly, the second season feels stronger because \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d is very much an acquired taste.\nWhere other shows play with magic weaponry and middle-school crushes, \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d uses alcohol, casual sex and drug addiction to build its landscape.\nTopics: alison brie, bojack horseman, Editor's Picks, Netflix, TV, Will arnett, Entertainment NewsAnimation is so often the province of children because it\u2019s a medium so well-suited to the fantastical, horrible and surreal.\nNetflix released the second season of the show Friday morning, and from the first several episodes released to critics, the second season is so far even better than the first."}
