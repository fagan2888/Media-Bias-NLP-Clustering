The losses widened to $318 million for the first six months of 2015.\n\nHighmark\u2019s full-year results for 2015 have not been released. The Pittsburgh-based insurer and other carriers nationally that have sustained losses in the segment say the costs of insuring people who may never have had health insurance were higher than expected.\n\nThe ACA was passed in 2010 and required everyone to have health insurance or pay a penalty. Online government marketplaces were created where individuals, families and small businesses could shop for coverage. Enrollment for 2016 through the exchanges ended Jan. 31.\n\nDespite the losses, Highmark kept selling individual plans on the government exchange, but began pulling in the reins last year by narrowing medical provider networks and making other tweaks to plan offerings for 2015. Following the lead of other carriers, the insurer also reduced or eliminated broker commissions for the exchange coverage to throttle back sales of money-losing products.\n\nHighmark isn\u2019t alone in sustaining losses.\n\nUnited HealthCare, the biggest health insurer in the country by membership, has said it was considering exiting the health-law\u2019s individual marketplace, and Blues plans in North Carolina and New Mexico are among the other plans that reported losses.\n\nJohn Krah, executive director of the Allegheny County Medical Society, criticized Highmark\u2019s latest plan, saying doctors were being punished for the insurer\u2019s pricing miscalculations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate for physicians to experience a reimbursement cut because the premiums for these products have been underpriced,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPhysicians will continue to provide the same level of care to these patients, but this is simply wrong.\u201d\n\nKris B.
