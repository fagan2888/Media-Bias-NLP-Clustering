Most of the chatter about the Obamacare exchanges has been about the federal exchanges, but they’re not the only ones having problems. We have John McClaughry– Vice President of the Ethan Allen Institute– here to talk about Vermont’s health care exchange troubles.

Vermont’s exchange system was so bad that the governor had to pull the safety valve- a section of the health care bill designed to protect the insured- to allow the currently insured Vermont residents to keep their present health insurance for three more months.

Up until a few days ago, the governor stuck to his statements that the exchanges would work. McClaughry predicts that small business will have continuing problems and that the extension will have to last for more than three months.
