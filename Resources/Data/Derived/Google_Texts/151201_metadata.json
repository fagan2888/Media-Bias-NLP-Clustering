It also voted by voice to scrap a panel set up under the health law to rein in Medicare costs.\n\nDemocrats used reconciliation to help pass Obamacare in 2010, although Mr. Obama would still maintain a veto over whatever repeal bill Congress passes this time around. Still, the GOP wants to prove it can repeal Obamacare with a Republican president in 2017 even if they cannot win a filibuster-proof majority of 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nInstructions in the GOP-authored, fiscal 2016 budget instructed the Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce and Education and the Workforce committees each to draft recommendation for reducing the deficit by at least $1 billion.\n\nBesides attacks on Obamacare, the Energy and Commerce panel will ask Congress to defund Planned Parenthood as punishment for its controversial abortion practice.\n\nThe House Budget Committee will compile the various recommendation into a unified bill for the chamber to consider in the coming weeks.\n\nMr. Ryan decided to repeal Obamacare\u2019s major insurance mandates and a yet-to-be-appointed panel, known as \u201cIPAB,\u201d that was designed to recommend ways to keep Medicare costs in check but has been derided by Republicans as an attempt to ration care.\n\nSome Democrats on the committee signaled they will vote to scrap the panel, even though they like the law overall.\n\nThe committee will also move to repeal the health law\u2019s 2.3-percent excise tax on medical device sales and the so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d that, starting in 2018, will impose a 40 percent levy on employer health plans that exceed amounts.\n\n\u201cThese five changes would hit our [budget] target,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.\n\nCommittee Democrats said if the GOP is intent on repealing Obamacare, they would assume there is a replacement waiting in the wings. However, congressional Republicans haven\u2019t voted on one.\n\nThey also demanded to know how many people would lose coverage under the GOP\u2019s plan, but could not get an exact estimate from Thomas A. Barthold, chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nSome Democrats, however, signaled they had a rough idea of the number.\n\n\u201cThe bright idea today is to pass a bill today that will result in 14 million fewer Americans having health insurance?\u201d Rep. Lloyd Doggett, Texas Democrat, said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House Ways and Means Committee moved Tuesday to chip away at Obamacare by using a fast-track budget tool to repeal the law's most unpopular taxes and provisions, including the mandate requiring Americans to hold insurance.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The House Ways and Means Committee moved Tuesday to chip away at Obamacare by using a fast-track budget tool to repeal the law\u2019s most unpopular taxes and provisions, including the mandate requiring Americans to hold insurance.", "title": "House panel votes to scrap Obamacare mandates", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/29/house-panel-votes-scrap-obamacare-mandates/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/11/e2d253f6ecc00119790f6a7067002d98.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/11/e2d253f6ecc00119790f6a7067002d98.jpg", "description": "The House Ways and Means Committee moved Tuesday to chip away at Obamacare by using a fast-track budget tool to repeal the law's most unpopular taxes and provisions, including the mandate requiring Am", "card": "summary", "title": "House panel votes to scrap Obamacare mandates"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues"}, "article_summary": "Still, the GOP wants to prove it can repeal Obamacare with a Republican president in 2017 even if they cannot win a filibuster-proof majority of 60 votes in the Senate.\nThe panel voted along party lines, 23-14, to repeal insurance mandates on individuals and large employers and levies on medical devices and generous health care plans.\nThe House Budget Committee will compile the various recommendation into a unified bill for the chamber to consider in the coming weeks.\nIt also voted by voice to scrap a panel set up under the health law to rein in Medicare costs.\nSome Democrats on the committee signaled they will vote to scrap the panel, even though they like the law overall."}
