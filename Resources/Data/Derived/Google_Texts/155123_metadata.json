French President Francois Hollande calls them Daesh. The media mostly uses ISIS, Islamic State or IS. In the wake of the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Paris and Beirut, world leaders are preparing to step up with a more unified fight against the radical Islamic group. So why the different names? Here\u2019s a guide to explain them all.\n\nISIS\n\nThe name is an acronym for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria or Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham. After expanding into Syria in 2011, the group began referring to itself as ISIS because it controlled territory in Iraq and Syria. Al-Sham refers to a specific region along the eastern Mediterranean Sea that is much larger than modern Syria. Most news organizations use the term ISIS because it\u2019s the name that most people recognize.\n\nRelated: 9 ISIS Weapons That Will Shock You\n\nISIL\n\nThis version is an acronym for Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. Some English speakers translate the Arabic al-Sham as \u201cthe Levant,\u201d a term that refers to the large area of land between the Euphrates River and the Mediterranean Sea. The Levant is a bigger swath of land than the area denoted by the term al-Sham, but they overlap with one another. In the end, both ISIL and ISIS have generally the same meaning.\n\nReporters have speculated about why the Obama administration uses ISIL, with explanations ranging from the straightforward (it\u2019s a more accurate translation and better represents the area the group aims to take over) to the distrustful (one theory holds that the administration was trying to downplay Syria).\n\nIslamic State\n\nThe group changed its name to the Islamic State, or IS, in June 2014, when it declared a caliphate in the areas that it controlled, intending the term to represent a successor state to the original seventh-century Islamic nation. The group also calls itself The Caliphate. With this claim, the group is implying it\u2019s the only state that true Muslims should adopt. The term drops all geographic modifiers that imply physical boundaries and reflects the group\u2019s ultimate goal of creating a caliphate across the region.\n\nSome argue that using the terrorists\u2019 preferred name gives them legitimacy and helps them recruit individuals worldwide. Over the summer, British Prime Minister David Cameron asked the BBC to stop referring to the group as the Islamic State. Cameron uses the name ISIL. And the Associated Press uses \u201cthe Islamic State group,\u201d or phrases like \u201cIS extremists,\u201d to make clear that it is not a recognized, functioning state.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Use of ISIL, Not ISIS, Tells a Different Story\n\nDaesh or Da\u2019ish\n\nDaesh is an acronym for the Arabic term \u201cDawlat al-Islamiyah f\u2019al-Iraq wa al-Sham,\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant.\u201d\n\nBut the word daesh in Arabic commonly means \u201ca bigot who imposes his view on others\u201d or \u201cto trample and crush.\u201d Calling the group Daesh implies that it is neither a real government nor a true representation of Islamic thought. As a result, the group hates the name to the point that it\u2019s threatened to cut out the tongues of anyone who uses it \u2014 another reason some choose to use Daesh instead of other alternatives.\n\nSince September 2014, it\u2019s been France\u2019s official policy to refer to the group as Daesh, and Arab governments have long used the term. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry typically uses Daesh as well, and Obama referred to the group as Daesh when he condemned the group after the Paris attacks. Over the summer, 120 British members of Parliament wrote a letter to the director general of the BBC asking that the organization refer to the group as Daesh. So far, the BBC has not made the change.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama calls them ISIL.
