It\u2019s time to reclaim our nation\u2019s moral compass,\u201d Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said of the legislation he introduced Friday.\n\n\u201cOur criminal justice system will ultimately determine whether Cosby serves jail time,\u201d Gosar said in prepared remarks Thursday. \u201cBut Cosby\u2019s admission to drugging women in order to satisfy his sexual desires places him outside the bounds of whom we should admire in our society.\u201d\n\nCosby, an American icon as comedian, actor, and father figure since the 1960s, has fallen from favor since 2002, when President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his cultural contributions.\n\nThe former star of TV\u2019s \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d and \u201cI Spy\u201d faces allegations of repeated sexual misconduct.\n\nTo date, more than 50 women have accused Cosby of sexual assault. In a 2005 deposition that recently came to light, the comedian admitted to acquiring Quaaludes to drug women and then compel them to have sex.\n\nCosby, 78, is currently charged with second-degree sexual assault, stemming from a relationship with a Temple University employee in 2004. If convicted of the felony, Cosby could face up to 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to what his lawyer dismissed on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d as \u201cpolitical\u201d charges.\n\nPressure mounted to strip Cosby of his Presidential Medal of Freedom since more allegations surface over the summer.\n\nBut President Obama has said he was powerless to act if he decided to do something.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no precedent for revoking a medal,\u201d Obama said in July. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that mechanism.\u201d\n\nThough Obama declined to comment on the Cosby case specifically, he strongly condemned sexual assault.\n\n\u201cIf you give a woman or a man, for that matter, without his or her knowledge a drug, and then have sex with that person without consent, that\u2019s rape,\u201d he said.\n\nEstablished in 1963, the Presidential Medal of Freedom is the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor.\n\nBy allowing Cosby to keep the medal, Gosar said, \u201cAmerica is sending the wrong message to future generations.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama would consider the legislation but declined to comment further.\n\nGosar has worked to build support for his bill since last summer, when he learned the president said he was powerless to revoke the medal.\n\n\u201cTo continue to honor [Cosby] would be an affront to women nationwide, particularly those who were victims of his heinous acts,\u201d Gosar said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Cosby faces numerous allegations of sexual assault.
