But its score of 24 out of 100 says otherwise. As with most brands, this may not be intentional [but] rather it stems from a lack of awareness and understanding of this color in the diversity rainbow.\n\nFaith Driven Consumer also released its first annual rating of Super Bowl advertisers this week. This year, the cost for one second of Super Bowl advertising is $160,000.\n\nThe group\u2019s top five Super Bowl advertisers for the Denver Broncos-Carolina Panthers clash are Acura, Honda, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Marmot. The bottom five are Snickers, Coca-Cola, Colgate, T-Mobile, and Axe.\n\nAccording to the research firm American Insights, 86 percent of faith-driven consumers are more likely to do business with a brand that welcomes their Christian values.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with the NFL, and all professional sports organizations\u2014educating them on and encouraging them to specifically include faith-driven consumers,\u201d Stone said.\n\nThe NFL can improve its score on his index and its \u201cstanding with the faith community,\u201d he said.\n\nThe index rates 400 major brands, Stone\u2019s group says, and it \u201cmeasures a company\u2019s commitment and actions in order to create parity, at minimum, between faith-driven consumers and other groups that are embraced in the rainbow of employment, philanthropy, and marketing diversity.\u201d\n\nIndex scores are based on four categories: public commitment to faith-driven consumers, faith-compatible corporate actions, \u201cequal application of equal protections,\u201d and corporate competency in the market segment made up of faith-driven consumers.\n\nThe highest score for Super Bowl 50 advertisers was 46 (scored by both Acura and Honda), while the lowest was 11 (Axe). Here is how the index rated all the brands:\n\nAcura: 46\n\nHonda: 46\n\nPepsi: 38\n\nMountain Dew: 38\n\nMarmot: 38\n\nHeinz: 37\n\nMini USA: 36\n\nAvocados from Mexico: 35\n\nButterfinger: 32\n\nAmazon: 32\n\nHyundai: 30\n\nKia: 30\n\nAudi: 29\n\nBuick: 29\n\nTaco Bell: 29\n\nDoritos: 27\n\nSunTrust: 25\n\nToyota: 25\n\nSkittles: 24\n\nSnickers: 24\n\nCoca-Cola: 23\n\nColgate: 22\n\nT-Mobile: 19\n\nAxe: 11\n\nFaith Driven Consumer says it is affecting the marketplace and represents 41 million Americans who spend $2 trillion annually.\n\nAmericans will spend $15 billion during the week leading up to Super Bowl 50, according to the group, which created an online game to guide consumers to shop for their Super Bowl parties with \u201cfaith compatibility\u201d in mind.\n\nStone said:\n\nMillions of Americans will buy food, beverages, decorations, TVs and electronics, and other items for family Super Bowl parties. We\u2019re encouraging our community to actively do business with the brands that score highest in welcoming them.\n\nSome of the \u201cbest places to shop and work for faith equality and inclusion,\u201d Faith Driven Consumer says, include Chick-fil-A, Hobby Lobby, Wal-Mart, and Thrivent Financial.\n\nChick-fil-A scored the highest on the index, with a 63.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Faith, Broncos, Panthers, Super Bowl 50, Consumers, Faith Driven Consumer, Faith Equality Index , advertisers, brand names", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "On the cusp of\u00a0Super Bowl 50, one consumer index says the National Football League falls short in welcoming Americans who\u00a0make their\u00a0choices \u201cthrough the lens of...
