In a time that we, like all newspapers, are functioning with reduced resources, it helps affirm that the effort can make a difference.\n\nBonnie Hobbs won for ongoing coverage of a family\u2019s efforts to provide the best life for a son they call \u201cnot special needs, but a special person,\u201d and a second award for coverage of issues related to affordable housing and homelessness.\n\nJudges call Michael Pope\u2019s business reporting \u201cfirst-rate, data-driven reporting and analysis on important issues.\u201d Stories on driving habits, cesarean deliveries and the Affordable Care Act are called \u201cwell-researched, clearly written and engaging. The use of real-live people high up in stories to illustrate makes for very compelling material.\u201d\n\nVernon Miles won for breaking news coverage of Arlington\u2019s first same sex marriage, being \u201con the scene of a local event that has local, statewide and national significance. \u2026 The story is multi-sourced; has a strong lead that gives readers a sense of the scene; places the event in historic context; and captures the celebratory feel of the event.\u201d\n\nOn Pope government reporting: \u201cRather than regurgitating official statements, the reporter tells people's stories to illuminate the consequences of government decisions. This represents a model for all government reporting.\u201d\n\nOn Marilyn Campbell\u2019s reporting for Wellbeing: \u201cThese articles amount to personal guidance in the best sense of the term.\u201d\n\nEven in recreation and entertainment, our mission is to provide our readers with the information they need to have fun, and our annual update to the \u201cInsiders Guide to the Parks,\u201d brainchild of Jean Card, is designed to do that.\n\nWhat are we missing?

Fine work.\n\nMichael Lee Pope, The McLean Connection \u2014 Health, Science and Environmental Writing, First Place. Alone on the Road; Despite Advances, Many Virginians Remain Uninsured; C-Section Boom in Northern Virginia. Judge\u2019s comments: Michael Lee Pope's stories on driving habits, cesarean deliveries and the Affordable Care Act are well-researched, clearly written and engaging. His use of real-live people high up in his stories to illustrate his findings makes for very compelling material. He seems quite capable of turning some of these topics into a book. If he does, I'll read it.\n\nJon Roetman, The Vienna/Oakton Connection \u2014 Sports Writing Portfolio, First Place. Madison\u2019s Koshuta Scores 39 Against \u2018Idol\u2019 Floyd; Oakton Girls\u2019 XC Repeats as State Champs; Madison Volleyball Drops Heartbreaker in State Final. Judge\u2019s comments: Strong and clear writing and excellent storytelling helps game stories feel more like features. Excellent work.\n\nVictoria Ross, Oak Hill/Herndon Connection \u2014 Government Writing, First Place. Let Sun Shine on Virginia\u2019s Financial Disclosure Laws, Mr. Horejsi Goes to Richmond; Bulova: \u2018This Will Be a Challenging Budget.\u2019 Judge\u2019s comments: An engaging look at a lobbyist who fights for the little guy; an entertaining story on a political candidate, helping readers put the upcoming election into context; one of the better budgeting stories I've seen lately that helps readers understand how the county's budgeting process is going to cost them more money. The supporting sidebars help bring the message home.\n\nJeanne Theismann, Alexandria Gazette Packet \u2014 Personal Service Writing, Obituaries, First Place. \u2018I Wanted A Better Life:\u2019 Civil Rights pioneer Nelson Greene dies at 100; The Bean Counter: Hard Times\u2019 s Jim Parker dies at 69; F. William \u201cBill\u201d Bauers: WWII pilot was honored by French government. Judge\u2019s comments: These stories provide a glimpse inside the lives of people who have played significant roles in their communities. The writing is engaging and well-researched. And the stories serve as an example to others of how to live a life of purpose.\n\nJeanne Theismann, Alexandria Gazette Packet \u2014 Column Writing, Entertainment, First Place. \u2018Curtain Up!\u2019 \u201cGypsy,\u201d Signature Theatre; \u2018Ella\u2019 Has Scatitude,Metro Stage; It\u2019s All Relative \u201cThree Sistahs\u201d returns to MetroStage. Judge\u2019s comments: Ms. Theismann's entertainment columns demonstrate a breadth of knowledge that gives her opinions a ring of authority and authenticity. Though I live nowhere near her area, I found it easy to be influenced by her writing and to wish that I had the opportunity to attend some of the events she talked about. All three examples are nicely written.\n\nJean Card, Jeanne Theismann, Steve Hibbard, Louise Krafft and Kara Coleman, First Place. Alexandria Gazette Packet \u2014 Lifestyle or Entertainment Pages.\n\nJoan Brady, Great Falls Connection \u2014 Column Writing, Second Place. No, I\u2019m Not a Parent; I Just Act Like One; Small Acts of Kindness; Nurturing Happy Memories. Judge\u2019s comments: Brady draws on her wealth of experience with the foster parent system to write empathetically but authoritatively on family ties. And she does so with humanity and insight. Her writing combines depth and subtlety with eloquence of expression. In some senses, her subject matter is narrow. But viewed through a different filter, it is universal. She writes engagingly on a consistent basis.\n\nVeronica Bruno, Mount Vernon Gazette \u2014 Feature Story Writing, Second Place. Santa Remembers His Daughter; Judge\u2019s comments: Great twist, interesting couple combined with new situation. Not sentimental. Very original.\n\nJean Card, Alexandria Gazette Packet \u2014 Page Design, Second Place. Judge\u2019s comments: Good photos, nice layout, lots of information and easy to consume.\n\nVernon Miles, Arlington Connection \u2014 Breaking News Writing, Second Place. Historic Moment: Celebrating Same Sex Marriage. Judge\u2019s comments: This contains the essential elements of breaking news coverage. The reporter/photographer was on scene of a local event that has local, statewide and national significance. The reporter also was working in an environment of competing media, making this story more difficult to cover. The story is multi-sourced; has a strong lead that gives readers a sense of the scene; places the event in historic context; and captures the celebratory feel of the event. The only thing missing were comments from those who oppose same sex marriage.\n\nJeanne Theismann, Alexandria Gazette Packet \u2014 Headline Writing, Second Place. License to Chill (Storm closes schools, city government.)\n\nMarilyn Campbell, Chantilly Connection \u2014 Health, Science and Environmental Writing, Third Place. Spiritual Wellness in the New Year; Consistent Bedtimes Aid Children; How To Age in Place Safely; Judge\u2019s comments: These articles amount to personal guidance in the best sense of the term. They should serve as very helpful resources for readers of a variety of ages. In concise manner, they effectively made the concepts clear and applicable to the reader. The aging in place article was particularly relevant and insightful, the childhood sleep story was unlike anything I'd ever read (and I have two kids) and really summed up how a specific approach to children\u2019s health makes sense. The spiritual health article was unusual, refreshing to see, and I love the variety of sources and comments.\n\nBonnie Hobbs, The Fairfax Connection \u2014 Personal Service Writing, Third Place. Affordable Housing Lack Can Lead to Hunger; \u2018Help Us, Will You Please?\u2019 City of Fairfax to Tackle Affordable Housing; Council \u2018Honored to Support this Project;\u2019 \u2018Dream Come True\u2019 for Lamb Center. Judge\u2019s comments: Solid writing and good follow-through on the housing issues. The writer did a good job of including income and free lunch data without breaking the flow of the story.\n\nMary Kimm, The McLean Connection \u2014 Editorial Writing, Third Place. Trending in the Right Direction; Virginia Proves Elections Matter; More Affordable Housing Needed; Tragic Consequences; Deadly Medicaid Debacle. Judge\u2019s comments: This submission consists of five well-articulated and well-grounded pieces tackling access to affordable housing and health care, a pair of closely related state and national issues with important local ramifications. The work combines passion with a persuasive factual underpinning.\n\nMichael Lee Pope, Alexandria Gazette Packet \u2014 Public Safety Writing, Third Place. Happyland on Edge; Manhunt Ends in Tragedy; The Safeway Four.\n\nMichael Lee Pope, Mount Vernon Gazette \u2014 Government Writing, Third Place. Checking Out Library Funding; Ways To Battle Area Homelessness; Safety at a Crossroads in Poor Communities Judge\u2019s comments: Government reporting is not known for its heart, but there is a lot of heart in these stories. Rather than regurgitating official statements, the reporter tells people's stories to illuminate the consequences of government decisions. This represents a model for all government reporting.\n\nSteven Mauren, Mary Kimm, Steve Artley, Geovani Flores and Laurence Foong, Alexandria Gazette Packet \u2014 Editorial Pages, Third Place.\n\nJean Card, Renee Ruggles and Laurence Foong, Mount Vernon Gazette \u2014 Informational Graphics, Third Place. Parks, an Insider\u2019s Guide; Judge\u2019s comments: I liked the maps. They were easy to read, I quickly located where each park was and was able to learn more about it, not only through the text, but through the accompanying photos. The colors were also used well. As a whole the package was informative and easily digestible.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2015/apr/23/editorial-connection-papers-win-awards/", "type": "article", "title": "Editorial: Connection Papers Win Awards"}, "description": "On Saturday, April 18, a group of journalists from the Connection Newspapers traveled to Roanoke for the annual Virginia Press Association event to collect awards for business reporting, government writing, writing about health, science and the environment, feature writing, sports writing, column writing, obituaries, cartoons, entertainment pages and writing, public safety writing, editorial pages and writing, page design, informational graphics and more.", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "article_summary": "Visit www.connectionnewspapers.com and click on \u201ccontact us,\u201d or email editors@connectionnewspapers.comWinnersTruncated list, for a complete list, see www.connectionnewspapers.comSteven G.
