The president added his signature to the legislation on March 23, 2010.\n\nThe law requires the government to provide tax breaks for employer-sponsored plans, but the newspaper reports the IRS is struggling to issue regulations for employers to follow this equal coverage provision. This will be the 11th tweak or delay to the law since open enrollment period kicked off on Oct. 1, 2013.\n\nIRS spokesperson Michelle Eldridge refutes the delay, saying the agency is not required to enforce the rule it until it writes the regulations for employers to follow.\n\n\u201cThe IRS has not announced any new or additional information on this issue. The New York Times story refers to IRS Notice 2011-1, which was released to the press on December 22, 2010. That Notice stated that the sanctions under Public Health Service Act Section 2716 will not apply until after generally applicable guidance is issued, because the statute requires regulatory detail in order to operate properly. Work on that guidance continues, taking into consideration comments received from the public. Any suggestion that there is a new delay is misleading,\u201d she wrote in a statement to FOXBusiness.com\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate provision, which was delayed till 2015, every business with at least 50 or more full-time workers must offer their employees benefits or face a penalty of $2,000 per worker per year for failing to comply.\n\nKeith McMurdy, benefits attorney at Fox Rothschild, says in the past, it was easy to have higher- paid workers participate in these plan. Non-discrimination rules will apply to all plans once the IRS writes its regulations.Most insurers require at least 75% participation amongst employers in order to underwrite and McMurdy fears it may be harder to get lower-paid employees in the mix.\n\n\u201cThese non-discrimination rules now apply to all plans, and [the Department of Health and Human Services] realized that on Jan. 1, there was a hole regarding these plans,\u201d McMurdy says. \u201cIn order to pass \u2018discrimination tests\u2019 you now need all low-compensation employees to participate, and if they opt out because they can get coverage on the exchange for free, I might not be able to offer coverage at all.\u201d\n\nDevon Herrick, senior analyst at the National Center for Policy Analysis, says in the past, federal law was designed to stop corporations from gaming the system by designing plans that only highly-compensated workers would buy.\n\n\u201cThis [IRS] regulation created a slight cross-subsidy which made coverage more affordable for lower-paid workers,\u201d he says. \u201cThis new delay is a little worrisome for the ACA. There are already perverse incentives that encourage firms to design health plans that the lower-paid workers don\u2019t necessarily want to pay for.\u201d\n\nHerrick spells out the following example\u2014assuming a firm\u2019s health plans for individual workers cost $3,000 for a high-deductible plan, $7,000 for a comprehensive Cadillac plan.\n\n\u201cA $30,000 worker would probably find the high-deductible plan not worth the money, while finding comprehensive plans unaffordable,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the other hand, highly-compensated employees may find the comprehensive plans a great deal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-07 08:19:46 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The equal coverage provision of the Affordable Care Act has not yet kicked in, and experts
