Proposition 1 would allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women\u2019s bathrooms, showers, and locker rooms. It\u2019s better to prevent this danger by closing women\u2019s restrooms to men rather than waiting for a crime to happen. Join me to stop the violation of privacy and discrimination against women.\u201d\n\nBerkman feels that the policy discriminates against people, like himself, who believe that people of the opposite sex should not have to share the same bathroom, TheBlaze reports.\n\n\u201cAs I understand it, there is an ordinance in Houston that would allow pretty much open bathrooms,\u201d Berkman told the St. Louis Post Dispatch. \u201cI certainly would never want to discriminate against anybody or make anybody feel uncomfortable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re preventing somebody from voting or depriving of a basic right that we in America consider your basic freedoms,\u201d Berkman continued. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about just, hey, if you\u2019re a guy go to the bathroom in the guy\u2019s bathroom and if you\u2019re a girl go to the girl\u2019s bathroom.\u201d\n\nHouston Mayor Annise Parker chose Twitter as a means to state her feelings towards Berkman\u2019s comments.\n\nLance Berkman played in St. Louis. Guess his girls didn\u2019t go to his games! SL has a non-discrimination ordinance.-A http://t.co/gzEbKIYOd9 \u2014 Annise Parker (@AnniseParker) October 5, 2015\n\n\u201cThe issue of the most recent ad,\u201d Parker stated Wednesday at a weekly press conference, \u201c[is that t]he gentleman in question has actually lived and/or played ball in two cities that have the same policy. It didn\u2019t seem to bother him then.\u201d\n\nWhen Lance Berkman went from NYC to STL to play ball did he do it to escape NYCs scary nondiscrimination law?-A \u2014 Annise Parker (@AnniseParker) October 5, 2015\n\n\u201cShe is using her high office to intimidate people that would stand against an ordinance that she supports,\u201d Campaign for Houston spokesperson Jared Woodfill, who helped recruit Berkman for the ad, told KHOU-TV.\n\nParker tweeted about Lance Berkman in total three times, calling him a \u201chypocrite.\u201d\n\nThen Lance Berkman went to Dallas. Oops. Dallas amended its Charter to clarify gender identity protections. Can you spell hypocrite?-A \u2014 Annise Parker (@AnniseParker) October 5, 2015\n\n\u201cAny time you have an issue of inclusion and fairness and tolerance that is put on the ballot and voted down, it sends a bad signal,\u201d Parker stated at the press conference. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the image of Houston around the world as a tolerant, welcoming place if this goes down.\u201d\n\nIn an answer to questions from reporters, Parker said that other cities have similar equal rights ordinances as the one proposed for Houston.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m passionate about this issue,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m also frustrated because 200 other American cities, 17 states have some version of this that includes sexual orientation and/or gender identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t break any new ground,\u201d Parker stated. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here that hasn\u2019t passed in other cities, and it may have been contentious in those other cities but the fact that there\u2019s so much misinformation, and not just misinformation, just out-and-out ludicrous lies is very frustrating.\u201d\n\nHouston residents will vote Nov. 3 on the ordinance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ordinance would allow people of any gender in bathrooms.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The ordinance would allow people of any gender in bathrooms.", "title": "Houston Mayor, Baseball Star Spar Over Ordinance About Bathrooms, Gender", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151007_HoustonOrdinance_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-09T22:36:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1L9FIcv"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The ordinance would allow people of any gender in bathrooms.", "title": "Houston Mayor, Baseball Star Spar Over Ordinance About Bathrooms, Gender", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151007_HoustonOrdinance_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "individual freedom", "published_time": "2015-10-09T13:45:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T22:36:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Houston, Equal Rights Ordinance, Lance Berkman, Mayor Annise Parker"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7c5\"", "article_summary": "Parker tweeted about Lance Berkman in total three times, calling him a \u201chypocrite.\u201dThen Lance Berkman went to Dallas.\nProposition 1 would allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women\u2019s bathrooms, showers, and locker rooms.\nFormer Astros baseball player Lance Berkman and the mayor of Houston are in a tussle over an ordinance that would allow people of any gender in bathrooms, as part of a non-discriminatory policy.\n\u201cAs I understand it, there is an ordinance in Houston that would allow pretty much open bathrooms,\u201d Berkman told the St. Louis Post Dispatch.\nIn an advertisement for Campaign for Houston (a group that stands for \u201cno men in women\u2019s bathrooms\u201d), Berkman encourages Houstonians to vote \u201cno\u201d when the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, Proposition 1, goes to vote in the next city elections."}
