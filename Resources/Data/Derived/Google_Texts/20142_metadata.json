He appears there along with other Regence healthcare leaders such as Jared Short and Don Antonucci http://www.cambiahealth.com/about/leadership.html.\n\nAt Regence, Hensley led strategy and execution for the Washington plan consistent with company's direction, and was responsible for directing and guiding statewide operations and market performance while representing and promoting Regence in business and civic arenas throughout the state.\n\nIt's unknown whether Hensley has any information about this investigation because he could not be reached for comment by The Lund Repor .\n\nThe investigation into Regence was triggered more than two years ago after Mike Kreidler issued a press release saying \u201cThe Regence Group needs to get its act together. We\u2019ve seen an ongoing pattern of errors and problems with Regence and its subsidiaries. Many of these problems directly harm consumers and healthcare providers.\u201d Since then, Regence\u2019s holding company has changed its name to Cambia Health Solutions.\n\nIn September 2011, Kreidler called together the insurance commissioners from Oregon, Utah and Idaho in Sale to discuss the problems he\u2019d seen in Washington with Mark Ganz, then the president and CEO of The Regence Group (now Cambia Health Solutions).\n\n\u201cThe status quo clearly isn\u2019t acceptable,\u201d Kreidler said. \u201cMost of these things seem to be systemic problems, rather than isolated incidents.\u201d\n\nThe problems identified by Kreidler at that time were:\n\nRegence\u2019s \u201cSurePay\u201d computer system malfunctioned on Aug. 5, 2011, resulting in more than 6,000 incorrect transactions.\n\nMedical claims from tens of thousands of retirees have gone unpaid for months.\n\nIn more than 200 cases, the company apparently withdrew money from the bank accounts of people who are not even Regence members. Some of the withdrawals totaled thousands of dollars. In the process, some Regence members\u2019 names and identification numbers were accidentally disclosed to strangers.\n\nRegence\u2019s systems and processes result in after-the-fact denial of claims for many pre-authorized medical services.\n\nThere is a pattern of claims being delayed because documentation has been misplaced by Regence, only to later be found.\n\nRegence\u2019s underwriting department provided a phone number for consumer questions. When consumers called that number, they would receive a message saying that contact was available only on Thursdays. On Thursdays, there was no answer.\n\nAlthough these are the major issues of the investigation Roesler mentioned that other issues might have turned up since then such as anomalies that have since been fixed. \u201cWhereas,\u201d he said, \u201cwe might find other things that are new to us that merit a closer look. Those sorts of changes in our focus happen all the time as the data and information rolls in.\u201d\n\nRegence and its subsidiaries also faced other state enforcement actions in 201 including:\n\nIn August, Kreidler fined Regence BlueShield $100,000 for wrongly denying contraceptive claims from 984 women over a period of eight years. The company also paid the claims, which totaled $148,740.\n\nIn September 2010, Kreidler ordered Regence BlueShield, Asuris Northwest Health and Regence BlueCross BlueShield of Oregon to stop wrongly turning down insurance applications for children.\n\nAlso in 2010, Regence BlueShield, Asuris Northwest health and Regence BlueCross BlueShield of Oregon were fined $125,000 for violations, including failing to provide mandated coverage for prostate cancer screenings.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nHere are a few other articles published in The Lund Report about Regence.\n\nhttp://www.thelundreport.org/resource/regence_bluecross_blueshield_pulls_out_of_oregon%E2%80%99s_insurance_exchange\n\nhttp://www.thelundreport.org/resource/regence_posts_strongest_profits_of_oregon%E2%80%99s_top_insurers\n\nhttp://www.thelundreport.org/resource/regence_posts_strongest_profits_of_oregon%E2%80%99s_top_insurers\n\nhttp://www.thelundreport.org/search/node/regence?page=3\n\nhttp://www.thelundreport.org/resource/legislation_attempts_to_corral_regence_bluecross_blueshield\n\nDiane Lund-Muzikant can be reached at diane@thelundreport.org.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9d1\"", "article_summary": "Also in 2010, Regence BlueShield, Asuris Northwest health and Regence BlueCross BlueShield of Oregon were fined $125,000 for violations, including failing to provide mandated coverage for prostate cancer screenings.\nIn September 2010, Kreidler ordered Regence BlueShield, Asuris Northwest Health and Regence BlueCross BlueShield of Oregon to stop wrongly turning down insurance applications for children.\nNevertheless, Hensley name and photograph still graces the pages of the website for Cambia Health Solutions, the holding company for the Regence health plans.\nThe investigation into Regence was triggered more than two years ago after Mike Kreidler issued a press release saying \u201cThe Regence Group needs to get its act together.\nThere is a pattern of claims being delayed because documentation has been misplaced by Regence, only to later be found."}
