Columnist and author of “Never Trust a Liberal Over 3-Especially a Republican,” Ann Coulter argued that the delays of policies like the Obamacare business mandate, executive amnesty, and the results of the investigation into Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl until after the election shows that Democrats think the American people are “fools” on Saturday’s “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on the Fox News Channel.

“For some reason it [delaying unpopular policies until after the election] seems to be working. As the Obamacare waiver seems to be working. I was having dinner with a bunch of conservatives last night, they’re aware of Obamacare, but they have jobs, they’re not like me, self-employed. So even they don’t understand what is coming with Obamacare” she said.

Coulter added that the decision to delay the results of an investigation into whether Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl deserted his platoon was “like everything else. Surprise! After the election, suddenly you won’t have insurance, and it’s going to hit right about the same time all the border surge kids bringing in the Enterovirus will be paralyzing or killing your kids.” And “why aren’t we getting it? What is taking so long? Isn’t this disturbing to people, that all of these things won’t happen until after the election? Another thing we aren’t going to find out, an investigation we won’t get until after the election, is the results of the Ferguson grand jury. I mean, are the American people fools. Certainly the democrats think they are, and if they don’t pay attention and vote Republican, then maybe they are.”

Coulter concluded by pointing to the success of Republicans who have made immigration an issue like Scott Brown in New Hampshire and Tom Cotton in Arkansas compared to the struggles of Thom Tillis in North Carolina.
