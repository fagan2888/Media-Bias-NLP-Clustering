But when it comes to breakthroughs that could cure \u2014 not just treat \u2014 the most expensive diseases, government is unique,\u201d he wrote Wednesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGingrich added that the massive increase in government spending on healthcare \u201cshould trouble every fiscal conservative\u201d but argued that breakthroughs for diseases like Alzheimer's or diabetes could drastically reduce future costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible and shortsighted, not prudent, to let financing for basic research dwindle,\u201d the longtime champion of the NIH wrote.\n\nGingrich\u2019s op-ed comes as House and Senate Republicans are meeting to complete a joint budget proposal for the first time since 2006. The final deal, which will likely be reached next week, is not expected to include any increases to the NIH's current budget of about $30 billion.\n\nPresident Obama's budget proposal, which NIH officials have praised, would boost the center's funding by about $1 billion, ending sequestration cuts.\n\nIn his op-ed, Gingrich compared the budget-slashing climate under his tenure to that of the current Congress but argued the GOP should still fight for NIH funding.\n\nGingrich, who served as Speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999, helped protect the government\u2019s scientific research budget at a time when his party was committed to balancing the budget.\n\nAfter meeting with biomedical executives and Nobel laureates, Gingrich helped lead a bipartisan effort to double the center\u2019s funding over five years \u2014 making it one of the only areas where spending would increase.\n\nStill, he added that an increase in the NIH\u2019s budget should be tied to internal reforms, such as making the agency \u201cless bureaucratic.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy funding basic medical research, Congress can transform our fiscal health, and our personal health, too,\u201d he wrote.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The former Speaker is urging Congress to double the funding for medical research.", "description": "The former Speaker is urging Congress to double the funding for medical research.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The former Speaker is urging Congress to double the funding for medical research.", "title": "Gingrich to GOP: 'Irresponsible' not to increase NIH funding", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/239672-gingrich-tells-congress-to-double-nih-funding", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/2014-03-08-gn-gingrich-newt-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/239672-gingrich-tells-congress-to-double-nih-funding", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-22T09:55-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Bill Clinton,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-22T09:55:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/239672-gingrich-tells-congress-to-double-nih-funding", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The former Speaker is urging Congress to double the funding for medical research.", "card": "summary", "title": "Gingrich to GOP: 'Irresponsible' not to increase NIH funding"}, "dcterms.title": "Gingrich to GOP: 'Irresponsible' not to increase NIH funding"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d29\"", "article_summary": "In his op-ed, Gingrich compared the budget-slashing climate under his tenure to that of the current Congress but argued the GOP should still fight for NIH funding.\n\u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible and shortsighted, not prudent, to let financing for basic research dwindle,\u201d the longtime champion of the NIH wrote.\nPresident Obama's budget proposal, which NIH officials have praised, would boost the center's funding by about $1 billion, ending sequestration cuts.\nGingrich, who served as Speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999, helped protect the government\u2019s scientific research budget at a time when his party was committed to balancing the budget.\nAfter meeting with biomedical executives and Nobel laureates, Gingrich helped lead a bipartisan effort to double the center\u2019s funding over five years \u2014 making it one of the only areas where spending would increase."}
