Good natured ribbing and a live auction format that encouraged crowd participation provided a lot of laughter and entertainment for guests.\n\nThe ceremony opened with award presentations by chamber president, Krystal Crockett. Voted on by members of the Bixby Metro Chamber of Commerce, golden statues were awarded to winners across several categories ranging from business to education.\n\nThere were several winners from previous years, such as Doc's Country Mart for Favorite Business, but many new ones were recognized, too, such as J. David Jewelry for Best New Business.\n\nCommerce aside, individuals were also recognized for their outstanding contributions through education, local government and volunteering. It was a big night for Dr. Steve Greene, who was named Volunteer of the Year and received the top honor of the night, the Chairman's Award.\n\nAnother notable winner was Ron Bussert of OSU Tulsa who was named Citizen of the Year.\n\nThe gala also marked the beginning of his tenure as Chairman of the Board for the chamber.\n\n\"I'm honored to be selected for this role for 2015 and humbled to follow so many of you here tonight who have led the chamber so effectively in years past,\" Bussert said.\n\n\"Growth for the Bixby metro area is a certainty, so it seems incumbent upon us to help shape the progress and quality of life we will see in the years ahead. As business partners, the chamber wants to hear from you and be helpful to you in the months ahead.\"\n\nIn addition to recognizing leaders in the community, the event serves as the organization's top fundraiser of the year.\n\nLavish trips, packages to state university sporting events, and a ride on a fighter jet were some of the big ticket items offered at the live auction.\n\nSpecial guest auctioneer Graham Crow promoted crowd participation throughout the raffle and live auction portion of the evening.\n\nHe took an unconventional approach to auctioning off gift cards from local businesses by opening bidding to which ever attendees grabbed his attention first.\n\nImpromptu breakdancing and throwing dinner napkins were a few of the methods used to garner Crow's attention much to the crowd's amusement.\n\nThe night was deemed a success with attendance at an all-time high and over $15,000 raised from the live auction alone.\n\n2015 Chamber Awards Winners:", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "Good natured ribbing and a live auction format that encouraged crowd participation provided a lot of laughter and entertainment for guests.", "title": "Best in Bixby honored at chamber awards", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/communities/bixby/best-in-bixby-honored-at-chamber-awards/article_b04cd1ca-6220-50f5-ad08-b7d5e12e7150.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/49/94920c2e-e47d-5b14-bf82-34773053a6d3/54ceb9590229a.preview-100.jpg?resize=267%2C200", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Good natured ribbing and a live auction format that encouraged crowd participation provided a lot of laughter and entertainment for guests.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "human interest,president,ron bussert,tulsa,chairman,convention center,renaissance hotel,graham crow,krystal crockett,bixby metro chamber of commerce,j. david jewelry,steve greene,chairman of the board for the chamber,fundraiser,auctioneer,usd,broadband,city councilman,victoria oltmann lifetime service,steve todoroff,connie coleman progressive,year - ron bussert,steve greene citizen,steve greene steve hobbs,kevin dean landon greene,tim jenney ron bussert steve,steve cunningham kevin dean landon,ron bussert steve cunningham kevin,ashley massey blake moffatt beverly,antivirus software,bixby,news,stephanieandre", "news_keywords": "human interest,president,ron bussert,tulsa,chairman,convention center,renaissance hotel,graham crow,krystal crockett,bixby metro chamber of commerce,j. david jewelry,steve greene,chairman of the board for the chamber,fundraiser,auctioneer,usd,broadband,city councilman,victoria oltmann lifetime service,steve todoroff,connie coleman progressive,year - ron bussert,steve greene citizen,steve greene steve hobbs,kevin dean landon greene,tim jenney ron bussert steve,steve cunningham kevin dean landon,ron bussert steve cunningham kevin,ashley massey blake moffatt beverly,antivirus software,bixby,news,stephanieandre"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2fde\"", "article_summary": "BIXBY \u2014 Local businesses and individuals were recognized for their contributions to the Bixby community at the Chamber Awards Annual Gala on Friday night.\n2015 Chamber Awards Winners:\nVoted on by members of the Bixby Metro Chamber of Commerce, golden statues were awarded to winners across several categories ranging from business to education.\nRemember me on this computer Login Screen Name or Email Now I remember!\nAs business partners, the chamber wants to hear from you and be helpful to you in the months ahead.\""}
