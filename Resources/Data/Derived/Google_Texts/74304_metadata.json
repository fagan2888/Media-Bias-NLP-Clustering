So, yea, do you give him credit for figuring out a way to get more credit than he deserves? Sure, if that's credit.\"\n\nDe Blasio worked in the administration of David Dinkins, who was defeated by Giuliani in his re-election campaign in 1993.\n\n\"We've proven not only was my model more electorally popular than [Giuliani's]\u2014by a lot\u2014but that you can manage this place much more efficiently if you're not in fact creating division through the process,\" said de Blasio.\n\nHe also criticized Michael Bloomberg, who served for three terms as both a Republican and an independent, for favoring the rich at the expense of the poor.\n\n\"For God's sake, when there was a critical op-ed in the New York Times about Goldman Sachs, he went to Goldman and gave a pep talk to the employees!\" de Blasio said. \"When a struggling school was having troubles in East New York, he didn't go there and give a pep talk.\"\n\nA spokesman for Bloomberg declined to comment and a representative for Giuliani did not immediately return a call.\n\nDe Blasio also said President Obama has not done enough on the mayor's signature issue of income inequality, though he applauded the president's signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe mayor also suggested that his accomplishments are better understood outside the city he leads.\n\n\"A lot of people outside New York City understand what happened in the first year of New York City better than people in New York City,\" he said during one interview at Gracie Mansion, according to the article. \"But I'm convinced something very special happened here.\"\n\nThe article was published as the mayor's team rolled out plans for a press conference to unveil a new \"progressive agenda\" next week in Washington, D.C. and an upcoming trip to California. (The details of the latter trip are not yet available.)\n\nRead the Rolling Stone story here: http://rol.st/1c4Dcct\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Politico PRO", "description": "<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio offered harsh assessments of his two immediate predecessors in a <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/mayor-bill-de-blasios-crusade-20150506?page=3\">lengthy <em>Rolling Stone </em>profile</a>&nbsp;published online on Wednesday.</p>", "title": "In Rolling Stone, De Blasio criticizes Giuliani, Bloomberg", "url": "http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2015/05/in-rolling-stone-de-blasio-criticizes-giuliani-bloomberg-021926", "image": "http://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/a-former%20mayors_0.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio offered harsh assessments of his two immediate predecessors in a <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/mayor-bill-de-blasios-crusade-20150506?page=3\">lengthy <em>Rolling Stone </em>profile</a>&nbsp;published online on Wednesday.</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| AP Photo/Mark Lennihan/Pool, File In Rolling Stone, De Blasio criticizes Giuliani, BloombergMayor Bill de Blasio offered harsh assessments of his two immediate predecessors in a lengthy Rolling Stone profile published online on Wednesday.\n\"A lot of people outside New York City understand what happened in the first year of New York City better than people in New York City,\" he said during one interview at Gracie Mansion, according to the article.\nFormer New York Mayors Rudy Giuliani, left, Michael Bloomberg, center, and Mayor Bill de Blasio, behind.\nRead the Rolling Stone story here: http://rol.st/1c4DcctAuthors:\nDe Blasio worked in the administration of David Dinkins, who was defeated by Giuliani in his re-election campaign in 1993."}
