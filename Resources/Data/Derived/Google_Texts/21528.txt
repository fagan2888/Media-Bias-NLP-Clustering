Texas Sen. Ted Cruz evoked Scripture Monday when he told Newsmax TV why he is the most conservative Republican running for president."You know, Scripture tells us you shall know them by their fruits," Cruz said Monday on "The Hard Line." "It's easy to talk a good game, but the question is have you walked the walk?"Watch Newsmax TV onandGet Newsmax TV on your cable system â€” Click Here Now Cruz pointed to his record of leading the fight against Obamacare in 2013."You look at the other very fine men and women on that Republican debate stage; none of them were anywhere to be found," he said.The same was true in 2014, Cruz said, "when millions of Americans rose up against President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty" and when every current candidate called for defunding of Planned Parenthood."Once again, I was proud to lead that fight, and once again every single man and woman on that debate stage were nowhere to be found," he said. "It was like they were in witness protection."Conservatives are backing him in Iowa, where he leads most polls, New Hampshire, where he is polling in second place, and nationally, because they are tired of empty promises, Cruz told host Ed Berliner."I'm reminded of a former boss who used to say, 'If I'm ever accused of being a Christian I'd like for there to be enough evidence to convict me,'" Cruz said. "That's powerfully true, but it's equally true of being a conservative. You say you're going to take on Washington? Show me where you've ever done so before. Where you've ever stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party."
