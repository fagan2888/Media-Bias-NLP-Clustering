United Airlineswill fly this winter from Denver to Mammoth Lakes, Calif., home of the nation’s third-most visited ski resort.

The two-hour Saturday-only will start Dec. 20 and run through Jan. 3 before resuming Feb. 14 through March 28. A round-trip ticket will cost between $528 and $630, according to United’s website.

The new route aims to draw skiers from the Front Range and East Coast alike, said John Urdi, executive director of Mountain Lakes Tourism. It’s a “bucket-list resort,” he said, but one that’s been hard to reach.

It’s also a fairly conservative expansion for the tourism agency and Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort, which are subsidizing the flight route, Urdi said.

The 70-passenger, weekly flight is a “toe in the water” after a ski season marked by late — and relatively light — snowfall, Urdi said. The town’s hotel tax fell by nearly a quarter last season, and the season’s snowfall dropped about 23 percent, to 238 inches.

The tourism agency will spend up to $1.5 million this year to subsidize flights on United and Alaska Airlines, and the resort will pay any costs above that. United said it doesn’t discuss its financial arrangements with resorts.

The flight adds to United’s seasonal Mammoth Lakes service, which also includes flights from San Francisco. Alaska Airlines will fly there this year from San Diego, Las Vegas and Los Angeles.
