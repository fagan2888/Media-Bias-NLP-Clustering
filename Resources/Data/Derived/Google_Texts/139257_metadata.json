UnitedHealth invested $65 million to get Harken Health and its enhanced primary care model up and running. The model is expected to reduce overall costs.\n\nThe company is focused on the individual insurance market, both in the private sector and the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nCurrently, Harken Health has four health centers in Cook County, IL, and six in Atlanta. It plans to open six more in the Chicago area and two more in Atlanta. The health centers offer an array of lifestyle and wellness programs in addition to primary care.\n\nHarken Health CEO Tom Vanderheyden said in a statement that more expansion news is coming, but declined to provide further details. He previously has made clear that UnitedHealth\u2019s decision to pull out of the Georgia exchange won\u2019t impact Harken Health.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nStar Tribune: UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Harken Health adding clinics in Chicago, Atlanta", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/ab/1e/ab1ef3d0654fb915b5dcc4885f35d7d3.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer", "news_keywords": "Payer", "category": "News Post", "title": "Harken Health digs in, adds health centers in Atlanta, Chicago", "pub_date": "may 18, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-18T23:13:54", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Wednesday, May 18, 2016, 11:13 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-05-06T23:13:54", "teaser": "<p>UnitedHealth invested $65 million to get Harken Health and its enhanced primary care model up and running.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-05-18", "sailthru.description": "UnitedHealth invested $65 million to get Harken Health and its enhanced primary care model up and running.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "UnitedHealth invested $65 million to get Harken Health and its enhanced primary care model up and running.", "title": "Harken Health digs in, adds health centers in Atlanta, Chicago", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/harken-health-digs-in-adds-health-centers-in-atlanta-chicago/419388/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Fotolia_56603761_Subscription_Monthly_M_NsjzHrs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/ee/66/ee66d10acb71c75d110109080746211e.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Dive Brief:United HealthGroup subsidiary Harken Health plans to open eight new health centers in Atlanta and Chicago by 2017, the Star Tribune reported.\nCurrently, Harken Health has four health centers in Cook County, IL, and six in Atlanta.\nRecommended ReadingStar Tribune: UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Harken Health adding clinics in Chicago, Atlanta\nHe previously has made clear that UnitedHealth\u2019s decision to pull out of the Georgia exchange won\u2019t impact Harken Health.\nHarken Health CEO Tom Vanderheyden said in a statement that more expansion news is coming, but declined to provide further details."}
