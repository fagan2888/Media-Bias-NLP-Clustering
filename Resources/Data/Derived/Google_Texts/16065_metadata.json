About a quarter of the public (28 percent) say they are most bothered by the feeling that corporations do not pay their fair share, and 25 percent say the same about wealthy people. Fewer (19 percent) point to the complexity of the tax system, while much smaller percentages cite the amount they pay in taxes (7 percent) and the feeling that the poor don\u2019t pay their fair share (4 percent).\n\nAbout half (53 percent) say they pay about the right amount of taxes, considering what they get from the federal government; fewer (40 percent) feel like they pay more than their fair share of taxes. Just 4 percent say they pay less than their fair share of taxes. These views have changed little since 2011.\n\nThe survey found that one factor has changed over the past few years: the widening partisan gap in the public\u2019s attitudes about the federal tax system. Today, survey respondents who are Republicans are 20 percent more likely than those who are Democrats to say they are paying more than their fair share of taxes (50 percent versus 30 percent). In the 2011 survey, nearly identical percentages from the two camps \u2013 37 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of Democrats \u2013 said they were paying more than their fair share.\n\nWhile there is substantial support for Congress completely overhauling the federal tax system, Americans remain divided over the overall fairness of the current tax system, according to the Pew Research Center. Only 4 percent say it is \u201cvery fair,\u201d while nearly half (46 percent) view it as \u201cmoderately fair.\u201d A nearly equal amount of people say the tax system is \u201cnot too fair,\u201d or \u201cnot fair at all.\u201d These views have also changed little since 2011.\n\nTax Code Complexity is a Hot-Button Issue\n\nThe American public isn\u2019t the only group bothered by the complexity of the federal tax code this tax season.\n\nIn March, the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) submitted suggestions to the Senate Finance Committee Working Group on Individual Income Tax that would simplify some areas of the tax code that individual taxpayers find the most difficult to understand. The AICPA also recommended provisions to combat identity theft and tax fraud.\n\nThe AICPA\u2019s suggestions concentrated on five key areas:\n\nIdentity theft and tax fraud.\n\nSimplified income tax rate structure.\n\nEducation incentives.\n\nRelief for missed elections (Section 9100 relief).\n\n\"Kiddie tax\" rules.\n\n\u201cWe understand the challenges that Congress faces as it tackles the complex issues inherent in drafting tax legislation and note that both taxpayers and tax practitioners are interested in, and need, tax simplification,\u201d Troy Lewis, CPA, CGMA, chairman of the AICPA Tax Executive Committee, wrote in a letter to lawmakers. \u201cCompliance burdens for individual taxpayers are too heavy, both in terms of time required and out-of-pocket cost.\u201d\n\nIn his practice, Howard M. Rosen, CPA, JD, AEP, worldwide chairman of BKR International, a global public accounting association, and principal of St. Louis-based CPA firm Conner Ash PC, said he regularly hears two tax system complaints from clients.\n\nFirst, Rosen explained, people do not understand the net investment income tax on portfolio income. They want to know why some rent may be subject to the tax and why other rent is not. They also want to know why the income from one partnership is exempt from the net investment income tax but not the income from a similar partnership.\n\nUnder Obamacare, a 3.8 percent Medicare surtax applies to the lesser of a taxpayer's net investment income or the excess above the modified adjusted gross income thresholds of $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers.\n\nTraditional portfolio income, such as interest, dividends, annuity income, royalties, and certain types of rental activities, are subject to the tax.\n\n\u201cThis tax, meant in part to pay for Obamacare, has people confused and upset that they must pay an additional tax on their investment income,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cWe spend a considerable amount of time explaining this to our clients, as well as ways to mitigate the tax cost.\u201d\n\nRosen also regularly answers concerns from clients about the overall complexity of their returns, especially those who invest in publicly traded partnerships.\n\n\u201cFrom a tax-reporting perspective, these investments are not understood by those who sell them or by those who buy them,\u201d Rosen said.\n\nMaureen Schwartz, executive director of BKR International, said while complaints about who is \u201cpaying their fair share\u201d are simply a natural response to paying taxes, what is \u201cmost important\u201d for firms and CPAs to remember during tax time is how much their clients look to them for trustworthy guidance.\n\n\u201cFirms and CPAs need to explain the system to clients so they feel confident about doing things correctly \u2013 especially as they operate in or interact with other countries,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cTaxpayers rely on their CPAs for sound advice and for keeping it simple even when it isn\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Deanna White"}, "dcterms.title": "Survey: Americans Believe Tax System is in Need of an Overhaul", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Individuals"}}, "og": {"site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "Survey: Americans Believe Tax System is in Need of an Overhaul", "url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/individuals/survey-americans-believe-tax-system-is-in-need-of-an-overhaul", "image": "http://www.accountingweb.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_medium/public/default-16x9.jpg?itok=FWa8WdE3", "updated_time": "2015-04-06T10:05:25+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/individuals/survey-americans-believe-tax-system-is-in-need-of-an-overhaul", "card": "summary", "title": "Survey: Americans Believe Tax System is in Need of an Overhaul"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/individuals/survey-americans-believe-tax-system-is-in-need-of-an-overhaul", "dcterms.creator": "Deanna White", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-06T10:05+00:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Article\"},{\"key\":\"subtopic\",\"value\":\"Individuals\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":[\"Individuals\",\"Tax\"]},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_19490\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-06T12:05:25+01:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-30T18:23:30+01:00"}, "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "Individuals", "sft-date": "Apr 6th 2015", "sft-type": "Article", "sft-topic": "Tax", "recs": {"category": "Article", "articleid": "node-19490", "publishtime": "2015-04-06T12:05:25:000Z"}, "sft-author": "Deanna White", "sft-title": "Survey: Americans Believe Tax System is in Need..."}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca2de\"", "article_summary": "While there is substantial support for Congress completely overhauling the federal tax system, Americans remain divided over the overall fairness of the current tax system, according to the Pew Research Center.\nIt probably comes as no surprise that the majority of Americans are somewhat miffed at the nation\u2019s tax system, but it\u2019s the manner in which the tax system frustrates them that may surprise you.\nFirst, Rosen explained, people do not understand the net investment income tax on portfolio income.\nThe survey found that one factor has changed over the past few years: the widening partisan gap in the public\u2019s attitudes about the federal tax system.\nTrending {{item['sft-title']}}When asked what bothers them most, those who cited multiple frustrations with the tax system agreed that \u201ca similar hierarchy of concerns is evident,\u201d according to the Pew Research Center."}
