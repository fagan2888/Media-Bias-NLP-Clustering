After reading through the magazine, I found nothing included about American Indians, or Native nations. According to the editors at Time magazine, the U.S. Supreme Court has not made even one decision having to do with Indians or our original nations which \u201cChanged America.\u201d The Time magazine editors thereby treated our nations as nothing.\n\nPerhaps Time\u2019s editors would have felt compelled to include at least one decision about Native nations if the focus of their special edition had been \u201cSupreme Court Decisions Foundational To America.\u201d After all, the 1823 Supreme Court ruling Johnson & Graham\u2019s Lessee v. M\u2019Intosh defines Indian land title from the perspective of the United States, and it serves to this day as the cornerstone of the property law system of the United States. What is more foundational to the economic system of the United States than ownership of property \u2013 especially real property?\n\nUpon reflection, every square inch of soil claimed by the United States is part of the traditional territory of some original nation of the continent. Yet Time\u2019s editors apparently ignore the connection between our original nations and the history of the United States, which is traced even to the Declaration of Independence and its expression of \u201cLife, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\u201d That phrase ought to read, \u201cLife, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness Through the Domination of Indian Land,\u201d for the latter theme runs throughout the history of the United States and its Supreme Court decisions in relation to our Native nations.\n\nThe edition of Time magazine dedicated to the U.S. Supreme Court does mention the 1954 ruling Brown versus Board of Education, which overturned Plessy v. Ferguson, and thereby called for the end of the Jim Crow era of segregation in the United States. 1954 was the same year that the U.S. Justice Department delivered a legal brief to the Supreme Court in the case Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States. In the brief, the Justice Department argued that the Tee-Hit-Ton Indians in Alaska did not deserve monetary compensation for a federal taking of their lands and their timber. Why? Simple. The \u201cChristian nations of Europe discovered the lands of heathens and infidels.\u201d In his 1955 Supreme Court majority opinion, Justice Stanley Reed upheld the US Justice Department\u2019s religious argument in the Tee-Hit-Ton case.\n\nThe rationale behind the ideas and arguments used by the United States against the Tee-Hit-Ton Indians in the Tee-Hit-Ton ruling was well expressed by Dr. Luis Rivera Pag\u00e1n, in his book A Violent Evangelism (1992). He quotes the philosopher Immanuel Kant as saying that, \u201cWhen America was discovered. . . it was considered to be without owners since its inhabitants were considered as nothing.\u201d (p. 11). Rivera-Pag\u00e1n specified the religious view behind such thinking: \u201cThey were considered to be \u2018as nothing\u2019 for they were not Christians.\u201d (original emphasis) (Ibid.).\n\nWhat this means in simple terms is that our ancestors were not considered to be fully human because they weren\u2019t Christian at the time that the Christians from Europe first invasively arrived. Rivera-Pag\u00e1n then puts a finer point on the matter: \u201cThe discussion became theoretically\u2026complex\u201d in the mid-fifteenth century, \u201cbut the result was the same: namely, the supremacy of the rights of the Christians over that of the indigenous \u2018infidels\u2019\u201d (p. 11). The U.S. Supreme Court first made the aforementioned Christian religious argument against our original nations in 1823, in Johnson & Graham\u2019s Lessee v. M\u2019Intosh.\n\nOne hundred and sixty four years later, in Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe the U.S. Supreme Court covertly used that same religious argument to deal with the question of whether an Indian nation has the authority to prosecute a non-Indian for a crime committed on an Indian reservation. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the decision for the majority, using a sentence from the Johnson ruling as the context for the Court\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe majority in Oliphant decided that no Indian nation or \u201ctribe\u201d may prosecute a non-Indian for a crime committed on an Indian reservation. In reaching that conclusion, Rehnquist used Chief Justice John Marshall\u2019s sentence from the Johnson ruling which said that the Indians\u2019, \u201crights to complete sovereignty, as independent nations, were necessarily diminished by the original fundamental principle that discovery gave title to those who made it [the \u2018discovery\u2019].\u201d\n\nChief Justice Rehnquist changed Marshall\u2019s word \u201cwere\u201d to \u201c[are],\u201d and wrote \u201cTheir rights to complete sovereignty, as independent [are] necessarily diminished.\u201d Rehnquist deleted the rest of Marshall\u2019s sentence, which mentioned \u201cthe original fundamental principle that discovery gave title to those who made it.\u201d By doing so, Rehnquist was able to covertly use the Johnson ruling\u2019s theme of \u201cdiscovery\u201d by \u201cChristian people,\u201d while leaving Marshall\u2019s original religious rationale unspecified and out of focus.\n\nAlthough the connection is not well understood, the Johnson ruling\u2019s theme of Christian \u201cdiscovery\u201d serves as the context and underlying argument for the Oliphant decision that Indian nations do not have the governmental prerogatives necessary to prosecute a non-Indian alleged to have committed a crime on an Indian reservation. Why? The argument found in the text of Johnson ruling is that Indian nations lack such sovereign prerogatives because \u201cChristian people\u201d (Marshall\u2019s original emphasis) \u201cdiscovered\u201d lands \u201cinhabited by natives, who were heathens.\u201d It is on the basis of that religious argument that the United States claims that the Suquamish nation, or any other Indian nation for that matter, does not have the governmental prerogatives necessary to prosecute a non-Indian for a crime allegedly committed on an Indian reservation.\n\nToday, the U.S. Supreme Court has before it the issue of whether an Indian nation may prosecute a non-Indian for a crime committed on an Indian reservation in a case involving the \u201cDollar General\u201d store chain. The case alleges that a Dollar General non-Native store manager sexually assaulted a Choctaw teenager. The act is alleged to have taken place on the premises of the Dollar General store located on the Indian reservation of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw. The issue now before the U.S. Supreme Court is whether the court system of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw has the jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court ends up using Oliphant to decide that the Mississippi Band of Choctaw does not have jurisdiction to hear the Dollar General case, it will have thereby based its decision on the dehumanizing claim of a \u201cChristian discovery\u201d of \u201cheathen\u201d lands. And it will have been able to do so by simply using the word \u201cOliphant,\u201d without ever once mentioning the word \u201cChristian.\u201d\n\nBy using Oliphant as controlling precedent, the Court will have made the covert argument, traced to Christian \u201cdiscovery\u201d in the Johnson ruling, that the Mississippi Band of Choctaw (and by implication, no Native nation) possesses no right \u201cto complete sovereignty as an independent nation\u201d because a Christian discovery of heathen lands occurred in the past. The U.S. Supreme Court will have thereby decided that the Mississippi Band of Choctaw does not have the right to hear the sexual assault case against a teenage Choctaw citizen by the non-Indian Dollar General store manager, because the Choctaw government lacks \u201ccomplete sovereignty, as an independent nation\u201d as a result of the right of \u201cChristian discovery\u201d and \u201cultimate dominion\u201d (domination).\n\nThe extension of the legacy of judicial racism continues in the federal law of the United States to this very day. Perhaps that is the explanation for Time not citing a single case involving Native peoples in its review. It would have been quite an uncomfortable conclusion for it to have to admit that the law of the United States, in relationship to Native peoples and nations, continues to be religiously bigoted and racist to its very deepest roots.\n\nSteven Newcomb (Shawnee, Lenape) is co-founder and co-director of the Indigenous Law Institute, and author of Pagans in the Promised Land: Decoding the Doctrine of Christian Discovery (Fulcrum, 2008).
