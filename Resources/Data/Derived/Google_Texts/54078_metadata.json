Friends of ours, allies of ours \u2014 Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it.\n\nAnd Obama is not the only one who suggested taking a gun-free approach to American life. The anti-Second Amendment message was also pushed by Slate, Vox, and Dan Savage.\n\nFor example, on October 1 Slate ran a story reminding readers that Australia enacted their gun ban in response to an attack on April 28, 1996, wherein a gunman \u201copened fire on tourists in a seaside resort in Port Arthur, Tasmania.\u201d Thirty-five were killed and 23 others wounded in the attack. Twelve days later Australia\u2019s government banned guns, period.\n\nOn October 2 Vox explained that Australia \u201cconfiscated 650,000 guns\u201d via a \u201cmandatory gun buyback\u201d program which forced gun owners to hand their firearms over for destruction. Vox claims the result was that \u201cmurders and suicides plummeted\u2019 and suggested such a path might be an option for America following \u201cthe murder of at least 10 people at Umpqua Community College.\u201d\n\nVox did not mention that \u201cfirearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide\u201d began plummeting in America in the mid-1990s as well. But in America, the decrease in violent crime did not correlate with a gun ban but with a rapid expansion in the number of guns privately owned. The Congressional Research Service reported that the number of privately owned firearms in America went from 192 million in 1994 to 310 million privately owned firearms in 2009. Subsequently, the \u201cfirearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide\u201d rate fell from 6.6 per 100,000 in 1993 to 3.6 per 100,000 in 2000 and finally to 3.2 per 100,000 in 2011.\n\nBut none of this made any difference to Dan Savage, who responded to the attack on Umpqua Community College by calling for the Second Amendment\u2019s repeal. Savage tweeted, \u201cF**k the NRA, f**k the gun nuts, f**k the Second Amendment \u2014 better yet, repeal the Second Amendment.\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
