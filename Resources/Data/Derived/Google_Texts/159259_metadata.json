I mean, everything I say he agrees with me, no matter what I say,\u201d Trump began. \u201cBut with the ethanol, really, he\u2019s got to come a long way.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf Ted Cruz is against ethanol, how does he win in Iowa? Because that\u2019s very anti-Iowa.\u201d\n\nTrump also appeared to take a veiled shot at Cruz\u2019s family background, suggesting Cruz might have trouble appealing to the state\u2019s evangelical voters. \u201cI do like Ted Cruz, but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba,\u201d he said of the country where Cruz\u2019s father, an evangelical preacher, was born.\n\n***\n\nThough Cruz and Trump have not attacked each other, it\u2019s obvious that they have criticisms in the drawer and prepared for use. This summer, Trump raised questions about Cruz\u2019s Canadian birth and whether he was constitutionally eligible to be president. I asked him about this last week. Would he bring that up again? \u201cI\u2019ll only bring it up if he\u2019s a final two,\u201d said Trump\u2026\n\nWere Cruz an ideologue compelled to speak out against wrongs of the kind he has identified in the Senate, he would have spoken out already quite a lot about Trump. But Cruz knows the difference between a losing fight where he gains greater glory among the voters he wants, like the Affordable Care Act shutdown fight, and a fight that might threaten his relationship with those very voters.\n\nDuring the Affordable Care Act debate, when Cruz\u2019s opponents called for tactical restraint, he framed their position as an ideological weakness. He faces no real risk of one of his opponents making a similar argument against him now. Because making the equivalent argument about Trump that Cruz made about the ACA would mean arguing that tolerating Trump is a betrayal of deeply held conservative beliefs. No candidate is remotely ready to go that far yet.\n\nCruz is demonstrating a skill a president must have: avoiding a confrontation for a larger goal.\n\n***\n\nJohn Podesta says nominee will be Cruz b/c last person Hillary wants to face is Trump! Use your head folks! 46-41! pic.twitter.com/K2XzwZygYk \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2015\n\n***\n\nUnlike many of the Republican Party\u2019s leaders and presidential candidates, Rep. Reid Ribble (R-Wis.) is willing to both bash Donald Trump and rule out supporting him if he becomes the party\u2019s nominee.\n\n\u201cMy first oath is to the Constitution of the United States. Donald Trump has taken positions contrary to that document, so I could not support him and uphold my oath,\u201d Ribble told \u201cSo That Happened,\u201d the HuffPost Politics podcast\u2026\n\nMaybe it\u2019s easier for Ribble because he\u2019s had a running start. In September, he called Trump \u201ca 3-year-old.\u201d The idea for a Muslim travel ban is Trump\u2019s worst tantrum yet.\n\n\u201cWords like that violate the moral conscience of a nation,\u201d Ribble said. \u201cThe idea that we would create a religious litmus test in this country is astoundingly offensive to me.\u201d\n\n***\n\nJoe Lhota, the 2013 GOP mayoral candidate, is calling on the Manhattan Republican Party to kick him out, relying on an obscure election law that allows a local chair to cast out a voter \u201cnot in sympathy with the principles of such party.\u201d Republican consultant E. O\u2019Brien Murray is considering filing a complaint with the party.\n\nThe local party chairwoman, Adele Malpass, said Thursday that she disapproves of Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim proposal but isn\u2019t in favor of banishing him from the GOP\u2026\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Trump predicted victory despite his distance from the party infrastructure in his home state. \u201cI\u2019ve never had that much of a relationship one way or the other\u2026but they haven\u2019t been very effective in New York,\u201d he said. \u201cI will do very well. April is a long time away.\u201d\n\nAsked about the proposal to eject him from the party, Mr. Trump said, \u201cGoodbye\u201d and hung up the phone. His campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, followed up, saying: \u201cThe notion of kicking the presidential front-runner out of the party is so absurd to me, I can\u2019t even comprehend it.\u201d\n\n***\n\nHeritage Foundation president Jim DeMint told CNN that Donald Trump\u2019s plan to keep Muslims out of the U.S. is not the right way to lower the risk of terrorism from the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cAmericans don\u2019t ban an entire religion because the lack of leadership of one president,\u201d DeMint told \u201c@This Hour\u201d Wednesday. \u201cIt really does come down to a lack of leadership. People are fearful and frustrated. The president has been unwilling to identify the problem and to present a plan.\u201d\n\nHowever, when pressed once by co-host Kate Bolduan on Trump specifically, DeMint said the the proposal is \u201ccertainly not\u201d the right course of action before setting his sights on Obama.\n\n\u201cCertainly not. It\u2019s not, and that\u2019s not who we are as Americans,\u201d DeMint said. \u201cBut I understand people\u2019s frustration when they\u2019re not getting a solution and some plan that they can feel some comfort in.\u201d\n\n***\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said his presidential opponent Donald Trump is leading in the polls because nearly half of Republican primary voters hate Obama and think he is a Kenyan-born Muslim.\n\n\u201cWell there\u2019s about 40% of the Republican primary voter who believes that Obama was born in Kenya and is a Muslim,\u201d Graham said on Boston Herald Radio on Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s just a dislike for President Obama that is visceral. It\u2019s almost irrational.\u201d\n\n***\n\nGOP leaders seem to be doing the only thing they can\u2014watch the process play out and hope for good outcomes. Sooner or later, they hope, the field will winnow and it will be Mr. Trump with his 35% versus one, two or three non-Trumps who\u2019ll fight over the 65%. Party leaders\u2019 position is delicate. They are certain they cannot win the presidency with Mr. Trump as the candidate. And they know they can\u2019t win the presidency if embittered Trump supporters stay home or bolt. They can\u2019t win with him and can\u2019t win without his people.\n\nMeanwhile Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, like Mr. Trump himself, appear to care nothing for the GOP. They believe America is in danger and this is no time for party loyalty. In any case they haven\u2019t felt that loyalty for years because the party has disappointed them for years. Mr. Trump is both the expression and a deepening cause of the party\u2019s fissuring.\n\nThe biggest reason has been the distance\u2014the chasm\u2014between the party elite at the top, who are more or less for illegal immigration, and the bulk of the party on the ground, who are opposed. In this case there is a chasm between elites concerned that they personally will look bigoted if they take action and voters concerned about who comes into America in the age of ISIS. It is a split, a distance; it is primarily the fault of the top, not the bottom; and Mr. Trump, who through his popularity could choose to be a bridge across the distance is instead functioning as a deepener of it.\n\n***\n\nMany a beach house has been bought by Republican consultants who have never had a major candidate win. The consultants get commissions for their mail, their advertising, their marked up phone surveys, etc. With the threat of Donald Trump rising, these consultants are risking their reputations, careers, and livelihoods as the men and women who could not stop Donald Trump. Picking apart the carcass of the Bush campaign to make their beach house payment will not go over well if they do not stop Trump.\n\nSecond, Republican donors are finally being forced to choose between the lesser of two evils that they always try to force on conservatives or be exposed as rank opportunists. In both 2008 and 2012, the base of Republican voters were told they must kneel before McCain or Romney and suck it up. Both times, the donor class candidate lost. Now the donor class candidates are losing to Trump and the alternative to Trump, Ted Cruz, is a man the donors loath. So either they will force themselves to unite with someone they do not care for or expose themselves as the ones who really do take their football home when they do not get their way.\n\nThird, Republican politicians are finally being held accountable. Trump would not exist as a candidate but for feckless Republican leadership in the face of an aggressive agenda from President Obama\u2026\n\nRepublicans will owe Donald Trump thanks. He has finally forced the GOP to come to terms with its identity and its accumulated, unseparated chaff.\n\n***\n\nArizona Sen. Jeff Flake shocked MSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd Thursday evening with his candid response that Republican lawmakers won\u2019t publicly admit they oppose Donald Trump as the GOP presidential nominee because they fear the front-runner would launch a third-party run.\n\n\u201cThose who don\u2019t want a Republican in the White House want Republicans to say this because the most likely scenario if there\u2019s not a Republican in the White House will be because Donald Trump runs as a third-party candidate and if Republicans say now we will not support the ultimate nominee, that gives Donald Trump license to run as a third-party candidate,\u201d Flake said on \u201cMeet the Press Daily.\u201d\n\n***\n\nIf he [runs as an independent], he\u2019ll most likely pull enough votes away from Republicans to ensure a Democratic victory.\n\nThat prospect may have the Republican National Committee and Republican strategists biting their nails down to the quick, but as a conservative who would very much like to see a Republican win the White House again in the future, I\u2019m increasingly thinking this is the best thing for the party, even if it means a certain victory for Democrats.\n\nTo be clear, Hillary Clinton is an equally terrifying prospect. But if Trump wins the nomination and runs as a Republican, we\u2019ll have Democrats like Clinton in the White House for the next 50 years\u2026\n\nDemocrats are convincingly using Trump to paint the entire Republican Party as racist, xenophobic and misogynistic. The damage Trump has already done to the Republican brand is immeasurable. A Republican nomination would be disastrous for years to come\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s another good reason to hope Trump runs as an independent. It would finally give our Republican candidates a chance to be heard. Whether it\u2019s Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina or Chris Christie, the other contenders have some smart, practical and, most importantly, conservative ideas to solve the country\u2019s biggest problems. Wouldn\u2019t you like to hear some of them?\n\n***\n\nThe speed with which prominent Republican officials and conservative spokesmen condemned Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States revealed the true stakes in the 2016 election. The future of the GOP as we know it is in question\u2014not the party\u2019s political future but its ideological one. Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy is already intensifying party divisions. Nominating him would alter the character of the Republican Party in a fundamental way\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s possible we are at the beginning of another political recalibration based on national identity. Already center-right parties in Japan and Russia and Israel have lurched in a nationalist direction. And where nationalists do not enjoy outright control, as in Hungary and Poland, they split the center-right coalition, as in France, the U.K., and Germany\u2026\n\nTrump\u2019s nationalism has far more in common with the conservatism of Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s National Front, than with the conservatism of Ronald Reagan. Support for a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d is par for the course among European nationalists\u2014by calling for it here all Trump has done is confirm how closely American politics resembles European politics. Reagan was an immigration advocate who signed the 1986 amnesty law.\n\nIndeed, Republican nominees since Ronald Reagan have been internationalist in outlook. They have been pro-free trade and pro-immigration, have supported American leadership in global institutions, and have argued for market solutions and traditional values. A Republican Party under Donald Trump would broadly reject this attitude. It would emphasize protection in all its forms\u2014immigration restriction, trade duties, a fortress America approach to international relations, and activist government to address health care and veterans\u2019 care. Paeans to freedom and opportunity and equality and small government would give way to admonishments to strive, to fight, to win, to profit.\n\n***\n\nRepublican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is sending a warning to GOP leaders about his dominance in the polls: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get used to it.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace, the billionaire said Republicans are \u201ckidding themselves\u201d if they think he won\u2019t secure the GOP nomination.\n\n\u201cI say, folks, you know, I\u2019m sorry I did this to you, but you\u2019ve got to get used to it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those little problems in life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to win. \u2026 You know, I\u2019m not one of these other guys that goes down. I don\u2019t go down. I go up.\u201d\n\n***\n\n***\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Divisions.", "title": "Quotes of the day", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/12/12/quotes-of-the-day-2276/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-13T01:31:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-12T22:03:59+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016, attack, Donald Trump, ethanol, GOP, Iowa, republican, Ted Cruz,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "With the threat of Donald Trump rising, these consultants are risking their reputations, careers, and livelihoods as the men and women who could not stop Donald Trump.\nApril is a long time away.\u201dAsked about the proposal to eject him from the party, Mr. Trump said, \u201cGoodbye\u201d and hung up the phone.\nA Republican Party under Donald Trump would broadly reject this attitude.\nMr. Trump is both the expression and a deepening cause of the party\u2019s fissuring.\nMeanwhile Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, like Mr. Trump himself, appear to care nothing for the GOP."}
