Because Moda dropped from Alaska\u2019s market, Premera, which covers 10,000 people in the state, has a new deadline to renew premium rate estimates to include the rates Moda charged its 14,000 customers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve requested from the (Division of Insurance) Moda\u2019s numbers so we can kind of sharpen our pencils,\u201d said Coon. \u201cWe have until July.\u201d\n\nTwo bills in the Legislature that attempt to address the problem, Senate Bill 206 and House Bill 374, stalled in the House Rules and Senate Finance committees, but officials say one will certainly pass.\n\nIn order to pass, though, nearly $60 million will have to be included in the operating budget for a statewide reinsurance plan.\n\nLori Wing-Heier, Director of the Division of Insurance, said she believes Gov. Bill Walker will call a special session in which legislators will pass one of the insurance bills. In order to pay for a reinsurance plan \u2014 which would spread sky-high individual insurance premium costs among all Alaska\u2019s insured to lessen the financial burden for Premera \u2014 the House bill proposes to use money destined for the General Fund, potentially up to $55 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll come in the special session,\u201d said Wing-Heier. \u201cThat\u2019s the thought right now. It\u2019s not dead. We\u2019re still getting calls from both sides saying that it\u2019s still being discussed. I fully expect this bill will pass in special session.\u201d\n\nThe Legislature will reach is maximum session limit of 120 days on May 17. The session can be extended 10 days with a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate, but any time after that will have to be in a special session.\n\nThe bills\n\nThe proposed legislation attempts to solve an insurance industry crisis that has caused insurers to bleed money and eventually move out of state.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, insurers cannot deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions.\n\nIn Alaska, people with pre-existing conditions were previously insured in a special high-risk pool, operated by the Alaska Comprehensive Health Insurance Association, or ACHIA.\n\nThese high-risk pool plans were high-cost as well, and many people with pre-existing conditions left ACHIA for the lower rates in the federal marketplace after the change in 2014. The small Alaska individual insurance market providers then ate the new costs from the high-cost patients no longer confined to the high-risk pool.\n\nSB 206 and HB 374 would make changes to the Alaska Insurance Code to allow for a reinsurance program for the Alaska high-risk insured.\n\nA reinsurance program, essentially, is the insurance version of a subsidy, spreading the costs of the high-risk insurance pool among the rest of the state\u2019s insured instead of only in the individual insurance pool. ACHIA would administer this program.\n\nMost of the medical and insurance industry agreed that reinsurance is the only way to keep premiums from spiking another 30 percent or more in 2017 \u2014 though it would only cut the inevitable rise by 15 percent to 18 percent.\n\nOrganizations including Moda Health, the Alaska Association of Health Underwriters, the Alaska Primary Care Association, and the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association all wrote letters of support.\n\nOpposition, however, mounted against the bill in April due to how the state would fund the reinsurance.\n\nBoth bills originally suggested an \u201cassessment\u201d \u2014 a fee levied against all Alaska insurance plans. Estimates said the reinsurance plan would require $55 million of extra funds, which pencils out to a $20 assessment for each of Alaska\u2019s 236,779 \u201ccovered lives.\u201d\n\nThis assessment would stack up against stop-loss insurance providers, who underwrite insurance plans for organized labor. Labor unions and the Kenai Borough School District opposed the bills and the $20 assessment per month on each of their policies, said Wing-Heier.\n\nDuring an April 16 House Labor and Commerce hearing, Rep. Kurt Olson, R-Soldotna, introduced an amendment that would allow the Legislature to appropriate funds from the state\u2019s current insurance premium tax to pay for reinsurance, rather than a new assessment.\n\nWing-Heier said the idea has been roundly supported by virtually all groups, as it would evenly distribute costs and would leave the Division of Insurance fiscally unscathed; its $7 million operating cost runs on insurance licensing fees.\n\nThe state levies a 2.7 percent tax on every insurance premium in the state. The tax brings in roughly $60 million a year, Wing-Heier said, and is goes into the General Fund.\n\nThe bill was last referred to the House Rules Committee, but chances are slim that the Legislature will pass them before the end of the session. Legislative bandwidth is overwhelmed by the $4.1 billion dollar budget deficit, oil and gas industry tax credits and tapping Permanent Fund earnings to fill the gap.\n\nPremera to stay\n\nThe individual insurance market, which insures those Alaskans not covered by either employee or government insurance, has reached a crisis point in the Last Frontier. The Affordable Care Act has created a nationwide situation where individual insurance premiums spike as insurers lose money, leaving several states with a precariously low number of insurance. Earlier this year UnitedHealth, the nation\u2019s largest insurer, announced it was exiting the federal marketplaces in 2017 after absorbing hundreds of millions in losses in the last several years.\n\nAlaska\u2019s small population exacerbates the problem. Only one individual insurer, Premera Blue Cross, remains in the state after three others dropped out.\n\nSimply put, high insurance rates still don\u2019t recover the costs insurers undertake from being forced to enroll high-risk customers.\n\nRates rose approximately 37 percent and 39 percent in 2015 and 2016, but Premera still loses money. The company has lost roughly $13 million since 2014.\n\nPremera\u2019s average premium is $713 per person per month. Statewide, the average $700 per person per month is the highest in the nation, which averages $468 per person per month.\n\nOther states have larger populations to spread the higher cost, but Alaska\u2019s 736,000 residents is too small a pool to absorb them.\n\n\u201cIn a very small sized market like Alaska, there are not enough healthy individual purchasers to offset the costs of enrollees with very high medical needs,\u201d wrote Jerry Reinwald, a lobbyist for Premera, in a letter to the Legislature.\n\nOn May 1, Moda Health announced that it is leaving the Alaska individual market and its 14,000 customers. Moda officials said the company could no longer operate in Alaska without a substantial increase in insurance premiums, which had already increased by 29 and 37 percent in 2015 and 2016, respectively.\n\nBoth Alaska and Oregon had already suspended Moda Health from operation in February 2016 over its financial situation, though the states lifted the order weeks later after approving Moda\u2019s plan to raise sufficient capital to continue service.\n\nDJ Summers can be reached at daniel.summers@alaskajournal.com.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Addressing Alaska\u2019s broken individual health insurance market will likely have to take place in special session of the Legislature, and in the meantime the state\u2019s last provider has been given extra time to calculate its rate increase for 2017.", "description": "Addressing Alaska\u2019s broken individual health insurance market will likely have to take place in special session of the Legislature, and in the meantime the state\u2019s last provider has been given extra time to calculate its rate increase for 2017.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rights": "Copyright 2015 The Alaska Journal of Commerce, Morris Publishing Group", "og": {"site_name": "The Alaska Journal of Commerce", "description": "Addressing Alaska\u2019s broken individual health insurance market will likely have to take place in special session of the Legislature, and in the meantime the state\u2019s last provider has been given extra time to calculate its rate increase for 2017.", "title": "Premera gets more time to file rates as fix awaits special session", "url": "http://www.alaskajournal.com/2016-05-11/premera-gets-more-time-file-rates-fix-awaits-special-session", "image": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1459069218/AJOClogo_twitter_400x400.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-11T16:42:57-08:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@AlaskaJournal", "id": 341639834}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dcterms.modified": "2016-05-11T16:42-08:00", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.alaskajournal.com/2016-05-11/premera-gets-more-time-file-rates-fix-awaits-special-session", "dcterms.title": "Premera gets more time to file rates as fix awaits special session", "dcterms.creator": "Andrew Jensen", "MobileOptimized": "width", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-11T16:42:57-08:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T16:42:57-08:00"}, "dcterms.date": "2016-05-11T16:42-08:00", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Alaska Journal, Anchorage, Alaska News, Alaska Weather"}, "article_summary": "The small Alaska individual insurance market providers then ate the new costs from the high-cost patients no longer confined to the high-risk pool.\nPremera to stayThe individual insurance market, which insures those Alaskans not covered by either employee or government insurance, has reached a crisis point in the Last Frontier.\nOn May 1, Moda Health announced that it is leaving the Alaska individual market and its 14,000 customers.\nIn Alaska, people with pre-existing conditions were previously insured in a special high-risk pool, operated by the Alaska Comprehensive Health Insurance Association, or ACHIA.\n\u201cPremera is committed to the Alaska market and will continue to offer individual coverage to Alaskans through the federal marketplace,\u201d said Premera spokesperson Melanie Coon in a statement."}
