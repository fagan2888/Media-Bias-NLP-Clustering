Up to now, the National Incident Based Reporting System has not broken out such crimes, making it difficult to track trends. Alison Knezevich of the Baltimore Sun writes (hat tip: Breitbart ):\n\nThe FBI\u2019s reporting of crime statistics is often criticized from both the left and the right for what they leave out. I wonder if there will be controversy over this latest change.\n\nNote that neglect, a crime of omission, not commission, is not included. Deliberate violence against helpless animals is clearly the product of a sick mind, so being able to track trends in these statistics is a valuable indicator of social and mental pathology. It will take several years before trends can be reliably spotted, but I am not optimistic about things getting better. But then, I am a conservative, and we tend toward pessimism on social change.\n\nIncidents will be divided into four categories: neglect; intentional abuse and torture; organized abuse such as dog fighting and cock fighting; and animal sexual abuse.\n\nRandour and others say tracking animal cruelty cases is especially important because research has shown that violence against animals can be an early indicator that a person will be violent toward humans, and that animal abuse often occurs alongside other crimes such as domestic violence.
