The headline was \u201cFCC makes Internet history: PROVIDERS DEEMED PUBLIC UTILITIES / New regulations aim to keep Web fair and open.\u201d\n\nThe same thing happened on the cover of the Post\u2019s Express tabloid, where liberal HBO host John Oliver was honored. \u201cNet hero: The FCC\u2019s ruling to protect Internet speeds might have gone the other way if comic John Oliver hadn\u2019t helped spark mass outrage.\u201d\n\nInside, the headline was \u201cLet\u2019s give credit where credit is due: To Oliver.\u201d The unbylined tribute began:\n\nPrior to June 1, few people knew much about \u201cnet neutrality.\u201d Just a mention of the term caused eyes to glass over and attention to be diverted to cute puppy videos. Then came John Oliver. The HBO comedian this summer bravely devoted half of his 30-minute satirical news show, Last Week Tonight, to the subject. He explained what net neutrality was (protections for open-access internet) and eviscerated cable companies for wanting to dismantle it....\n\nHis joke was \u201cIf you want to do something evil, put it inside something boring.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the segment, Oliver had succeeded in rallying support for the cause. His rant and subsequent call to action \u2013 he encouraged all Internet commenters and trolls to flood the Federal Communications Commission website with comments in support of net neutrality \u2013 made an impact. Millions sent in comments.\n\nAs if Obama\u2019s FCC wasn\u2019t rigging it? The Express account concluded:\n\n\u201cOliver and the president,\u201d said an industry official earlier this month, \u201cwere probably the two most prominent [turning points].\u201d\n\nThe actual Washington Post story by Cecilia Kang and Brian Fung also offered credit to Oliver:\n\nThrough the debate, the wonky issue of net neutrality went mainstream, prompting 4 million people to file comments to the FCC, which caused its Web site to temporarily shut down. Late-night comedian John Oliver drew millions of Web users to his satirical breakdown of Wheeler\u2019s earlier, weaker approach. A handful of protesters even sat in the driveway of Wheeler\u2019s home to block him from getting to work and to pressure him to pass tougher rules.\n\nThe Kang-Fung piece offered just a few paragraphs of disagreement to ooze into the \"Obama's FCC makes history\" narrative:\n\nVerizon, for one, criticized the new regulations as \u201cantiquated\u201d and, to make its point, issued a statement on its company blog in the form of Morse code. \u201cFCC\u2019s \u2018Throwback Thursday\u2019 Move Imposes 1930s Rules on the Internet,\u201d the headline read. \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the FCC to encumber broadband Internet services with badly antiquated regulations is a radical step that presages a time of uncertainty for consumers, innovators, and investors,\u201d according to a -company-provided translation of the Morse code.\n\nA conservative counterpoint can by found in \"Welcome to the Obamanet\" on The Wall Street Journal editorial page on Friday.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "The front page of Friday\u2019s Washington Post wasn\u2019t at all objective about the FCC\u2019s imposition of a \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regime.
