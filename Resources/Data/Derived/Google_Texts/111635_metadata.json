The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service probably will place it on the list in April.\n\nThe logging industry is worried.\n\n\u201cThe economic loss to the entire state of Michigan would be devastating, if timber harvesting were to be restricted to the winter months in their habitat area,\u201d said Brenda Owen, executive director of the Michigan Association of Timbermen. \u201cThis is not a viable solution to the bat\u2019s decline, and it\u2019s never a solution that the Timbermen would stand by and let happen.\u201d\n\nBut the wind industry is not, even though wind turbines kill an estimated 600,000 or more bats a year, a University of Colorado study shows. That includes an unknown number of endangered northern long-eared bats.\n\n\u201cBats are killed in large numbers, and long-eared bats are not exempt from that,\u201d said Kristi Rosenquist, an activist who led a successful effort to stop a Minnesota wind farm. \u201cThere\u2019s more bats in farm fields than the wind industry thinks. And in the rare projects that have had post-construction studies, the number of dead bats has been way higher than predicted ahead of time.\u201d\n\nA deadly fungus also threatens the northern long-eared bat with \u201cwhite nose syndrome,\u201d killing off 99 percent of the species in some Eastern states. Since 2006, the incurable disease has wiped out an estimated 5.5 million of the cave-hibernating creatures.\n\nBut federal authorities appear to be taking a kinder, gentler approach with the wind industry, which runs counter to Fish and Wildlife\u2019s perceived hard-nosed role when it comes to threatened species.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with the American Wind Energy Association right now on a fairly large, multi-state conservation plan for wind energy for Indiana bats, which is an endangered species, and northern long-eared bats may be considered as part of that,\u201d said Georgia Parham, a USFWS public affairs specialist. \u201cThat is something that we have available under the Endangered Species Act to deal with instances, where a listed species might be killed or harmed, during an otherwise legal activity.\u201d\n\nUnder the plan, the agency issues an \u201cincidental take permit\u201d as part of a mitigation strategy that allows recipients to legally kill endangered bats without prosecution. Seven wind farms have posted federally approved Habitat Conservation Plans for the endangered Indiana bat that effectively protect investors for up to 50 years on one project.\n\nRead the entire story on Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nothing strikes fear into developers and property owners more than a new critter on the federal list of endangered species.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Nothing strikes fear into developers and property owners more than a new critter on the federal list of endangered species.", "title": "Wind Farms Getting a Pass on Killing Endangered Bats?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/5106436584_d4043c325e_o.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tkkG19"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Nothing strikes fear into developers and property owners more than a new critter on the federal list of endangered species.", "title": "Wind Farms Getting a Pass on Killing Endangered Bats?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/5106436584_d4043c325e_o.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "wind", "published_time": "2014-10-02T12:01:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "endangered species, bats, wind farms, green energy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe14d7\"", "article_summary": "That includes an unknown number of endangered northern long-eared bats.\nNothing strikes fear into developers and property owners more than a new critter on the federal list of endangered species.\n\u201cBats are killed in large numbers, and long-eared bats are not exempt from that,\u201d said Kristi Rosenquist, an activist who led a successful effort to stop a Minnesota wind farm.\nCase in point: The northern long-eared bat, found in 39 states.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more bats in farm fields than the wind industry thinks."}
