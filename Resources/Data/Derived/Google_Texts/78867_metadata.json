After this season Derek Jeter will be immortalized in Yankee Stadium's Monument Park, joining those former New York greats.\n\nDerek Jeter announced on his Facebook page today that he is retiring after the 2014 season, and he did it in inimitable Yankees style: \u201cI\u2019ve experienced so many defining moments in my career: winning the World Series as a rookie shortstop, being named the Yankees captain, closing the old and opening the new Yankee Stadium. Through it all, I\u2019ve never stopped chasing the next one. I want to finally stop the chase and take in the world.\u201d\n\nWags might point out that Jeter has already taken in plenty, what with his $253 million in career salary and a roster of celebrity girlfriends long enough to fill out a batting lineup. There\u2019s no question, though, that Jeter has little left to chase on the baseball diamond and whatever career milestones he hasn\u2019t yet achieved, like becoming the all-time hits king, are probably not within his reach.\n\nHe is quite simply one of the greatest shortstops ever to play the game. It is rare these days that athletes in any sport play their entire career for one team. Jeter has been the Yankees starting shortstop \u2014and the face of the franchise \u2014 since his rookie year in 1996. As he prepares for his final season, he has won five World Series titles, produced a career batting average of .312 and ranks tenth all-time with 3,316 hits.\n\nBest of all for fans of the game, in the age of steroids, Jeter never got caught up in the scandals. He managed to avoided negative press throughout his entire career. Sure, he made the pages of the tabloids, but it was usually for his play on the field or his bachelor lifestyle off it, not for performance-enhancing drugs. As celebrity athletes go, Jeter has one of the most recognizable faces in the world. But, unlike with other athletes, the fame never destroyed him.\n\nThe moments where his star shined brightest will never be forgotten by any fan who watched him play. He\u2019ll always be Mr. November. He\u2019ll always be the gutsy player emerging from the stands with his face bloodied after making a great catch against the rival Red Sox. He\u2019ll always be the shortstop who \u2013 somehow, someway \u2013 ranged toward first base to make \u201cthe flip play\u201d in game 3 of the 2001 ALDS.\n\nSix years from now, he will be in Cooperstown. But this season he will be in Bronx and we will watch every at bat.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle, Jeter.", "title": "Derek Jeter: Known Legend in His Time", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/12/Derek-Jeter-Known-Legend-His-Time", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02132014_Derek_Jeter.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/12/Derek-Jeter-Known-Legend-His-Time", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02132014_Derek_Jeter.png", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle, Jeter.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "After this season Derek Jeter will be immortalized in Yankee Stadium's Monument Park, joining those former New York greats.\nJeter has been the Yankees starting shortstop \u2014and the face of the franchise \u2014 since his rookie year in 1996.\nAs celebrity athletes go, Jeter has one of the most recognizable faces in the world.\nBest of all for fans of the game, in the age of steroids, Jeter never got caught up in the scandals.\nIt is rare these days that athletes in any sport play their entire career for one team."}
