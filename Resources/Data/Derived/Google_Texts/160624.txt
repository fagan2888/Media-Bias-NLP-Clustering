(THE HILL) – President Obama on Saturday touted the successes of his signature healthcare law, just days before the deadline for enrolling in 2016 ObamaCare coverage ends on Jan. 31.

“This is healthcare in America today,” he said in his weekly address.

“[It is] affordable, portable security for you and your loved ones. It’s making a difference for millions of Americans every day [and] it is only going to get better.”

Obama boasted that ObamaCare is expanding healthcare options for everyday Americans.

“As the Affordable Care Act has taken effect, nearly 18 million Americans have gained coverage,” he said.
