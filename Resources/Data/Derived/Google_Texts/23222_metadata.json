Economists have long argued about the cause of the trend, and new research sheds light on one of the driving factors: high health care costs.\n\nThe health care analytics group Human Capital Management Services finds in a new report that growing health care costs are leaving less room in employers\u2019 budgets for employee paychecks. HCMS studied health care, compensation and paid time off data for nearly four million Americans who receive benefits at more than 300 companies.\n\nRelated: Get Ready for Huge Obamacare Premium Hikes in 2017\n\n\u201cHealth care costs are siphoning money out of employee\u2019s wages,\u201d says HCMS\u2019 CEO Hank Gardner. \u201cAnd people on the lower end of the totem pole suffer the most.\u201d\n\nThe study found that for a majority of private employers, health care costs jumped more than 10 percent in 2014, while employee pay rose a mere 4.1 percent.\n\nLow-income workers were hit the hardest. Wages inched up a mere 0.5 percent for employees making less than $30,000. Employees making more than $80,000 saw their wages rise by 4.2 percent.\n\nLower-wage workers suffer the most because employers are willing to pay more for higher levels of human capital, according to Gardner. \u201cLower wage earners have their wages constrained even more because whatever resources the employer had are being given to high paid workers.\u201d\n\nIn addition, many employers view low wage employees as expendable. As a result, \u201chigher wage workers have more leverage in terms of generating higher compensation than lower wage workers,\u201d Gardner says.\n\nWaste in the health care system plays a role, too. Wasteful health care spending identified includes overtreatment by medical providers and overconsumption by patients; excessive use of opioids is also a contributing factor, according to HCMS. Gardner calculates that wasteful spending accounts for 30 percent of national health care spending.\n\nWhile health care costs have been going up for the past two decades, they\u2019ve been accelerating with the implementation of Obamacare. Gardner blames the inefficiencies of government, such as the infamous website malfunction, for contributing to wasteful health care spending.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Your Health Insurance Premiums Are Going Up Again\n\nBig insurance companies are also a problem, Gardner says, because \u201cwhen you try to talk to them about improving performance, it\u2019s like trying to change the direction of the Titanic.\u201d\n\nWhatever the cause, it\u2019s important to workers and employers alike to get a handle on wasteful health care spending. \u201cYou need to reduce health care waste and convert that waste reduction into wage increases,\u201d Gardner says.\n\nSome sectors of the economy are feeling the pinch more than others. Currently non-profits are being hit the hardest because they usually lack the ability to increase revenue and their workers are already paid at relatively low levels, Gardner says. But these issues are spreading rapidly to many other sectors. \u201cThe cost increase is threatening business in a major way,\u201d Gardner says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge crisis.\u201d\n\nIgnoring the crisis will backfire, Gardner says. When you don\u2019t pay employees well, you end up with unhappy workers -- and unhappy workers use more benefits, further driving up costs and pinching potential wage increases. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it. As health care costs go up, wages will be even more anemic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Despite recent employment growth and a low jobless rate, many American workers have ex", "title": "Why You\u2019re Not Getting a Raise Anytime Soon", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/05/10/Why-You-re-Not-Getting-Raise-Anytime-Soon", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ozatp-us-nigeria-crime-money_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/05/10/Why-You-re-Not-Getting-Raise-Anytime-Soon", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ozatp-us-nigeria-crime-money_1.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@milliedent"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Despite recent employment growth and a low jobless rate, many American workers have ex", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "As a result, \u201chigher wage workers have more leverage in terms of generating higher compensation than lower wage workers,\u201d Gardner says.\nWhile health care costs have been going up for the past two decades, they\u2019ve been accelerating with the implementation of Obamacare.\nEconomists have long argued about the cause of the trend, and new research sheds light on one of the driving factors: high health care costs.\nThe health care analytics group Human Capital Management Services finds in a new report that growing health care costs are leaving less room in employers\u2019 budgets for employee paychecks.\nHCMS studied health care, compensation and paid time off data for nearly four million Americans who receive benefits at more than 300 companies."}
