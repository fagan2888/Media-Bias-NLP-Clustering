As the debate over gender roles and upbringing methods rages on, the traditional role of a father has undergone a sea change over the last few years. Earlier, all fathers would more or less fit into a certain template but today\u2019s dads are more heterogenous than ever before. Here are just some of the problems modern Indian fathers face.\n\n1. Allow Children To Spend Money Or Make Them Save\n\n\u00a9 Images Bazaar\n\nChildren today are accustomed to easy money. They demand it as if it were their birthright to ask for whatever pocket money catches their fancy. When both parents work to save money, they sometimes become too indulgent with their child\u2019s wants as a way to assuage their guilt of not being with their children. Fathers who work for long hours and are always at work even at home suffer from this symptom the most. They cannot willingly stop their children from not giving whatever they demand. However, indulging in all their fantasies runs the risk of spoiling them rotten to the extent that they may not value money or learn any new skills ever.\n\n2. Pull Them Out Of Bad Company Or Let Them Realise By Themselves\n\n\u00a9 Images Bazaar\n\nThe effect of mass media and Internet is so widespread that children today are much smarter and much more informed about the world than their fathers were at their age. But with technological advances also comes the inevitable pull of vices and sometimes bad company. Most fathers can predict when their children are behaving abnormally. They can either take corrective measures right away or blame it on their children\u2019s hormones and wait for the storm to subside. Doing the former runs the risk of them alienating their own children and deliberately pushing them away from you, even if it is done for their own good. Waiting too long for children to realise their mistake can also backfire in unexpected ways.\n\n3. To Let Them Choose Their Career Or Not\n\n\u00a9 Images Bazaar\n\nThe limited number of job options and the preference for engineering and medical degrees meant that parents would do their best to coax their children to either get into these two fields or get a job in a public sector company. With the advent of technology and new courses catering to myriad fields, the job opportunities today are practically limitless. Whether or not new fathers see their children having a stable future in them though is a million-dollar question. Allowing them to choose a career of their choice is a double-edged sword for new fathers, especially if the child falters in his/ her chosen vocation later on and has no way of going back to a safer alternative.\n\n4. To Let Them Choose Their Life Partner Or Not\n\n\u00a9 Images Bazaar\n\nComing from a country where arranged marriage is still more or less the norm in some major castes, allowing your children to choose their own partner is something that most parents dread doing. From wondering about their ward\u2019s future to thinking about what other family members will make of the whole deal, it is not easy to let go of the strict cultural mores embedded into Indian households and allow your own children to form a family of their own. The onus of taking a final call on this rests with the father whose family name is at stake when it comes to marriage.\n\n5. Teach Them Respect Or Earn It From Them\n\n\u00a9 Images Bazaar\n\nEarlier, fathers would discipline their children with whatever measure they thought was correct. This included physical assault at times too. Thankfully, that trend is now going down, at least in the metros. In many households now, in fact, it is new mothers who have taken on the role of a disciplinarian. The problem now facing fathers is how much to befriend their children and how much to stick to their strict daddy roles. In short, finding the line between teaching them to respect you by default to making your children earn your respect has become very thin indeed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This article talks about some dilemmas faced by modern Indian fathers while raising their children.", "author": "Priyanko Sarkar", "og": {"site_name": "www.mensxp.com", "description": "Being a father in today\u2019s age is a lot tougher than people think it is.
