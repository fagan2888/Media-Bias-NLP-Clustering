Ted Cruz and a handful of House conservatives want to make sure Congress doesn\u2019t vote on any bill that keeps Planned Parenthood funded, even if it means a government shutdown.\n\nBut Cruz is having trouble getting his Senate colleagues on board, according to Politico. Conservative allies who backed his similar fight to defund Obamacare in 2013 haven\u2019t joined him, and Cruz has marginalized himself after accusing Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of lying.\n\nSenate Republicans say it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be able to defund Planned Parenthood after a failed attempt before recess. McConnell said the votes aren\u2019t there to override President Obama\u2019s promised veto.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to use a failed tactic for political purposes knowing that it\u2019s not going to succeed,\u201d Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind, told Politico. \u201cIt will certainly get Sen. Cruz a lot of attention, which is obviously something that anybody running for president would want to get.\u201d\n\nNew Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, running for re-election in 2016, told Politico it\u2019s \u201cobvious\u201d Cruz is doing this for attention and she thinks the strategy is destined to fail.\n\nBut Cruz will keep pushing along. It\u2019s another chance for him battle Republican leadership and endear himself to a Republican electorate that\u2019s pushed Washington outsiders to the top of primary polls.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has embraced the radical position \u2026 to try to shut down the entire federal government if this one private organization does not get taxpayer money,\u201d Cruz told Politico. \u201cIt is only in the twisted, inverted logic of the Washington Beltway that anyone other than Barack Obama would bear responsibility for that shutdown.\u201d\n\nEven if the ploy fails, Cruz and his House allies can take solace in influencing something else: \u201cThe Tortilla Coast Caucus\u201d is officially a thing.\n\nIt\u2019s not an official caucus, but it\u2019s the name given to Cruz and House conservatives who plotted the Obamacare shutdown in the basement of Tortilla Coast, a Capitol Hill Tex-Mex joint. The group huddles there often, and the nickname has caught on.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wOS90ZWQtY3J1ei1zdHJ1Z2dsZXMtdG8tZmluZC1zZW5hdGUtc3VwcG9ydC1mb3ItcGxhbm5lZC1wYXJlbnRob29kLXNodXRkb3duLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Sylvan Lane", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WASHINGTON--Sen.
