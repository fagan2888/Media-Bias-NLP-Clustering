He will become executive vice president of corporate strategy and planning, a new role on the senior leadership team.\n\nKurt DelBene is returning to Microsoft less than two years after the longtime executive left the Redmond company.\n\nMicrosoft announced on Monday that DelBene has been named executive vice president of corporate strategy and planning, a new role on the company\u2019s 16-person senior leadership team. He will report to Chief Executive Satya Nadella.\n\nIn his new role, DelBene will advise Nadella on internal strategy, the company says, with a focus on coordinating planning and implementation of the company\u2019s goals across Microsoft\u2019s wide range of business units.\n\nMark Penn, the Microsoft executive who 13 months ago was named \u201cchief strategy officer\u201d as part of Nadella\u2019s first executive shakeup, loses that title with DelBene\u2019s arrival. Penn is now listed as Microsoft\u2019s \u201cchief insight officer\u201d on the company\u2019s online roster of top executives.\n\nDelBene retired from Microsoft in 2013 as part of the sweeping reorganization instituted under then-CEO Steve Ballmer. He had spent more than two decades at Microsoft, ultimately leading the company\u2019s Office division when the retooling of Microsoft\u2019s structure moved that team under the leadership of Qi Lu.\n\nHe was later tapped by President Obama to lead the effort to fix the Affordable Care Act\u2019s HealthCare.gov website after its troubled launch. DelBene returned to the Northwest last year, taking a role advising and investing in technology startups at Seattle venture capital firm Madrona Venture Group. Companies he advised include Bellevue project-management software builder Smartsheet and ExtraHop Networks, a Seattle firm that tracks network data performance for businesses.\n\nDelBene\u2019s new role is designed to work in concert with two other executives on the company\u2019s senior leadership team who are charged with overseeing strategy, rather than engineering groups or specific functions like marketing. Amy Hood, chief financial officer, will continue to oversee budgets and mergers and acquisitions. Peggy Johnson, the former Qualcomm executive hired in August as business development chief, leads external sales deals and partnerships.\n\n\u201cMy hunch is that, with [DelBene] having operated large portions of the Microsoft business over the years, he will be instrumental in setting strategy\u201d and piloting a few initiatives that cut across Microsoft business units, said Matt McIlwain, a managing director with Madrona. Nadella \u201cwanted to have someone on his leadership team who could help him think strategically and has a deep familiarity within Microsoft of how to get things done.\u201d\n\nJeff Teper, a former Office executive appointed last year to lead a corporate strategy team under Hood, will now report to DelBene.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to rejoin Microsoft,\u201d DelBene said in a statement. \u201cMy time in Washington and in working with startups has brought a fresh appreciation for the challenges our industry faces, and the ways Microsoft has the talent and ambition to tackle these challenges in creative ways.\u201d\n\nDelBene will join Microsoft next week.\n\nHe is married to U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, whose district includes Microsoft\u2019s Redmond campus and the homes of much of the company\u2019s local workforce.\n\nPenn, a former chief executive of public relations giant Burson-Marsteller, has been credited as a force behind both Microsoft\u2019s aborted \u201cscroogled\u201d campaign targeting Google\u2019s privacy practices and, later, its more uplifting \u201cEmpowering\u201d ad campaign. Microsoft officials have said the former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton has focused recently on analytics and competitive research rather than corporate strategy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kurt DelBene is returning to Microsoft less than two years after the longtime executive left the  company.
