The finding adds to the debate about whether the nature of the speaker impacts how we process what they say.\n\nFor decades, psychologists have debated whether our brains objectively process grammar and syntax. One side argues that words we hear get filtered; the details that are irrelevant to the actual meaning of the word get extracted, leaving just the essence of the word for our brains to store. The other side of this debate takes the view that our brains retain information about both the words and the speaker who uttered them.\n\n\u201cOur study shows that all that other information does influence not just word recognition processing, but higher-level processes associated with grammar,\u201d commented lead author of the study, Michael Vitevitch, in a press release.\n\nIn the University of Kansas study, participants were tested on how rapidly and precisely they could distinguish between masculine and feminine words in a list of Spanish words. The grammatical gender of Spanish words are usually defined as masculine when they end in \u201co\u201d and feminine when they end in \u201ca\u201d. Researchers found that when a participant heard a word that was uttered by someone whose sex was opposite to the gender of the word \u2014 a \u201cmismatch\u201d \u2014 their ability to grammatically identify the word was slower than when they responded to a \"match.\"\n\n\u201cThis result \u2026 raises questions regarding the widespread assumption about the cognitive independence and automatic nature of grammatical processes,\u201d the authors concluded in their study. \u201c[A]coustic information associated with the sex of a speaker interacts with the processing of the linguistic information associated with grammatical gender, suggesting that grammatical processing may not be as cognitively distinct from outside sources of information as previously held.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the wider implications of his study regarding the long running debate about whether memory is more abstract or contextual, Vitevitch noted that \u201cwe didn\u2019t evolve to be efficient. We evolved to get the job done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need both systems.\u201d\n\nVitevitch's finding means that when we listen to somebody speak, the information that we glean from the \u201cspeech signal\u201d is not purely linguistic. In addition to our brains deciphering the grammatical nuts and bolts of words \u2014 their phonology, semantics, and syntax \u2014 our memories are also registering their \u201cparalinguistic\u201d aspects, i.e. details about the person delivering the words; their regional and economic background, emotional state, age, and gender.\n\nThe study authors pointed out the theoretical importance of the study in terms of understanding cognition, whereby \u201clower level\u201d acoustic information that corresponds to the identity of the speaker influences the processing of \u201chigher-level\u201d information that is related to linguistics \u2014 in this case the grammatical gender of words.\n\nSource: Vitevitch M, Sereno J, Jongman A, et al.
