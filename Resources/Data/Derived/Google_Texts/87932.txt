Normally you see high school auxiliary members performing with the marching band at halftime of football games, but Saturday they had the stage to themselves.

Nine schools from the district competed at Bay High School Saturday at the Florida Bandmaster's Association Music Performance Assessment. Dance teams, majorettes and color guard members performed individually and in team competitions.

"We don't know these kids. We only get to see them perform once a year in their halftime shows. To really come back and get to talk to them about their year what things they did with their band program. To get some ideas from what they accomplished, share ideas and everything like that," said Allie Quimuyog, a student at Bay High School.

Winners from Saturday's competition will advance to state competition later this semester.
