GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- Spectrum Health is not used to being the smallest operator in the local hospital market.

A $4.5 billion company and the largest employer in Kent County, it has long been the health care giant on the block. But with a large national chain's plan to buy 80 percent of Metro Health, the neighborhood could be changing.

If the deal goes through, Spectrum would be the only general acute care hospital system in Grand Rapids without the backing of a national organization - unless, of course, Spectrum merged with a larger company.

"I don't see that happening," said Richard Breon, Spectrum's chief executive officer. "We have not discussed, at any time, coming together with a larger system or being acquired.

"In health care, you never say 'never.' But certainly we have never discussed that at all."

In a recent interview, Breon discussed Spectrum's plans to remain independent, its 18-year history since the merger that formed the company, and his reaction to the plans for Metro Health.

Community Health System, one of the largest for-profit hospital systems in the country, is seeking to buy an 80 percent interest in Metro, a 208-bed hospital and the smallest of Grand Rapids' three general hospitals.

The sale must be approved by the Michigan Office of the Attorney General and the Michigan Department of Community Health's certificate of need commission. But if it is approved, it will make Metro part of an $18.6 billion company that runs 205 hospitals in 29 states.

"I'm sure they did their analysis and did what they thought was best for them," Breon said. "I'm not concerned one bit."

The other major hospital in town, Mercy Health Saint Mary's, already is part of Trinity Health, a $13.6 billion nonprofit company based in Novi. It is one of the largest Catholic hospital chains in the U.S. and operates 86 hospitals in 21 states.

Will half of U.S. hospital systems disappear?

Hospital mergers and acquisitions are a national trend, as health systems face financial pressures, the shift to value-based care and the need for investments in new technology. That pace is about to accelerate, according to a report by the consultants at Deloitte Center for Health Solutions.

In 10 years, there will be half as many hospital systems in the U.S. as there are today, the analysts predict in the October 2014 report. The 1,833 health systems nationwide will likely shrink to 926, the report says.

"Some people say we are in an era of unprecedented change with the Affordable Care Act and massive consolidations," Breon said. "But consolidations have occurred in cycles - almost every decade."

Still, he agreed that more mergers are likely to happen. And he said Spectrum has fielded inquiries from organizations in other states.

"We do all the time," he said, mentioning systems in Chicago, Wisconsin, Ohio and Indiana. But those discussion don't necessarily involve potential mergers, he added. They are more likely to involve joint efforts, such as a common purchasing group, to improve quality or efficiency or to save money

As other health systems consider starting a health plan, Spectrum has been asked whether its insurer, Priority Health, would expand out of state.

"We haven't done that yet," he said.

Breon predicted Spectrum's size would preclude the need to merge with a larger entity.

"Right now, we are large enough to weather whatever regulatory reimbursement storms might be coming," he said. "We are a $4.5 billion company.

And there is a strong interest in maintaining local control.

"Our board is local," he added. "All our decisions are made here. We have a culture of Grand Rapids and West Michigan inculcated into our organization. I think we have people here who have a tremendous amount of buy-in into what it is we are trying to do."

Workforce triples in 18 years

Spectrum was created in 1997, by the merger of Blodgett and Butterworth hospitals, in the midst of an earlier wave of hospital consolidations in the U.S. The company began with 7,500 employees.

Eighteen years later, it employs nearly 22,300. Through mergers with smaller hospitals throughout West Michigan, the system has grown to encompass 11 hospitals. And with that growth has come an expansion in services, including the first heart and lung transplants in West Michigan and pediatric specialties at Helen DeVos Children's Hospital, the 14-story building that towers over Michigan Street NE.

"We never could have had the health care armamentarium here that we have now if it weren't for what occurred back then," Breon said. "You wouldn't have enough volume to support transplants and to support the kinds of specialties we've brought into this community.

"When we create a new clinical service, we have to make sure we have the population to support it."

Spectrum service area covers 13 counties with a population of 1.5 million. The children's hospital reaches farther - covering 37 counties with 3.5 million people.

Pennock Hospital affiliation discussed

More mergers with hospitals in the region are likely - just as more consolidation is bound to happen nationally, he said. Spectrum is discussing an affiliation agreement with Pennock Hospital in Hastings.

"The pie is shrinking right now. There are going to be fewer inpatient admissions," he said. "If you are an organization that is mid-size or small, you are going to say, 'How do I play in that field?'"

Breon also predicted more growth for Priority Health and Spectrum Health Medical Group, which includes 1,200 employed physicians and advanced practice providers, as well as more joint efforts to improve quality and reduce costs.

"I think the thing we have going for us is the relationship between our health plan, our medical group, our physician and the hospitals," he said. "If we get those working closer together, it's going to be much better. We are going to put a lot of focus on that."
