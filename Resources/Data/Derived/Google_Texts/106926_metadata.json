He was diagnosed with the disease more than a year ago but refused treatment. And he kept smoking.\n\nThe people of his era, his generation, are all gone. It was time for him to go too, he\u2019d say with a smile.\n\nMy initial reaction was to write a story for Tuesday\u2019s newspaper, but, in their culture, people aren\u2019t supposed to look at or see photos of the recently dead for four days. I spoke with a few editors and we decided to wait until the four days passed before publishing.\n\nGeorge, many people called him \u201cOld Man\u201d George Billie, was known as a family man (dozens of grandchildren survive), a tribe historian and as an interpretive guide at the Ah-Tah-Thi-Ki Seminole Indian Museum.\n\nHe was instrumental in The News-Press\u2019 Voices of the Everglades project and introduced The News-Press to a world media outlets have rarely documented.\n\nGeorge was a connection to the old world, a direct link to the early 1900s and the horrors left in the wake of the Seminole Wars. His grandmother survived those wars, when armed infantry used dogs and horses to chase what was left of these people into the dark cypress swamps.\n\nRELATED: Seminoles Retrace Polly Parker\u2019s Escape, Fight to Preserve History\n\nPerhaps 100 Seminole and Miccosukee were alive at the time, just enough people to restart a life in the Everglades. The terms are somewhat interchangeable and confusing, but Seminole and Miccosukee are both indigenous words. Seminole means natural, or something that is in balance or its rightful place. Example: a bison is Seminole (they were here pre-European) and cows and hogs aren\u2019t since they were introduced to this continent by more recent human visitors.\n\nSeminole was chosen in the 1950s by the first group of Natives to organize as a tribe and make agreements with the federal government. Most of the folks who didn\u2019t join the Seminole reservation petitioned the federal government to recognize a second tribe in Florida.\n\nBy the 1970s, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida formed. There is still a third faction, a group of 100 or so who shun reservation life and gambling dividends in favor of their ancient traditions and religion.\n\nIn recent decades the Seminole have generally lived north of Interstate 75 and near Lake Okeechobee, while the Miccosukee mostly stayed closer to Tamiami Trail just outside Miami.\n\nGeorge grew up in villages between Immokalee and Miami (generally considered Miccosukee territory) and seemed torn between the two groups.\n\nWhile reporting for Voices of the Everglades, I\u2019d see him at both Seminole and Miccosukee events. Most of his clothes were made by Miccosukee women, he told me.\n\nSo why did he live on the Seminole reservation?\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t exactly say.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, while sitting on the banks of the Miami River, I asked George if he felt split between the two groups, if he missed living along the Tamiami Trail and with the people there. \u201cDid the formation of the two tribes force you to chose between the two?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe looked straight ahead while a tear rolled down his right cheek. I took that as a \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nAbout a year ago, one of his daughters called and said he was sick. She was trying to fulfill all his last wishes, and he asked her to contact \u201cthe reporter.\u201d\n\nI went to see George the next day.\n\nWe watched old movies\u2014he was an extra in several films, including Gary Cooper\u2019s 1951 hit \u201cDistant Drums.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhite man kill me three times,\u201d George said while we sat in his living room just off George Billie Road\u2014named after the man himself.\n\n\u201cThere they go,\u201d he\u2019d say, pointing to himself on the screen each time he was shot.\n\n\u201cThey should have never killed you once,\u201d I said.\n\nIn reality, George had just one life to live. My only regret is I didn\u2019t become a part of it sooner.\n\nThis piece originally appeared at News-Press.com on November 13, 2015. It has been republished with permission.
