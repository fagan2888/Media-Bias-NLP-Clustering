Recruit Class #170 began training in May.\n\nNext the new faces will be paired with veteran officers for 16 weeks of field training.\n\nAnother 29 recruits are expected to graduate from the next class early next year. Not only is the city giving all officers a 5% pay increase across the board, it is providing funding for 150 new officers in 2015.\n\nThe graduates will help ease the department's attrition numbers. But statistics show more officers are leaving than joining the ranks. By one estimate, the department could dip below 1,000 officers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEW ORLEANS (WGNO)\u00a0 As of Friday morning, New Orleans has 26 new officers on the NOPD.\u00a0 Recruit Class #170 began training in May.
