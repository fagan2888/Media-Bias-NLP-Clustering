Lamar Alexander Changes the Senate Rules, Gun Control and Amnesty are Inevitable\n\nThe Senate is like a chess game. If you can see three \u2014 or five \u2014 moves ahead, you will probably win.\n\nBut when it reaches the point where you are one move away from being checkmated, it\u2019s hopeless. No amount of expertise can save you from disaster.\n\nAnd in the case of amnesty \u2014 and gun control \u2014 \u201cdisaster\u201d probably means the loss of constitutional rights and political power to liberals for a generation.\n\nLamar Alexander, working with four first-time senators, is hatching a plan to change the Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster of the motion to proceed and streamline the invocation of cloture.\n\nThis, after the \u201cnuclear option\u201d devised by Alexander\u2019s \u201cadvisor,\u201d Mary Gold, has already gone a long way to destroying the Senate as an institution.\n\nThe importance of being able to filibuster the \u201cmotion to proceed\u201d to a bill is that it gives you an opportunity to stop the bill before it reaches the \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal\u201d stage.\n\nRemember Obamacare\u2019s Cornhusker Kickback? The Louisiana Purchase? That\u2019s what the Senate will look like all the time if Alexander is successful.\n\nAlexander believes that he has come up with a clever gimmick, and that gimmick is that his proposals would take effect only after the 2017 elections.\n\nSo, for conservatives, here are the options: If the Democrats do well in 2016, then Sen. Chuck Schumer and President Hillary Clinton will get their \u201cwish list\u201d of legislation. At the very least, that will include gun bans, \u201ccard check\u201d elections for union bosses, amnesty, and an untold number of job-killing environmental regulations.\n\nThing Paul Ryan will save you? Even if he does, House Democrats will pursue their 2013 amnesty strategy and pick off blue state House Republicans one-by-one.\n\nThe only reason that strategy hasn\u2019t passed amnesty already is that I worked with former Congressman Steve Stockman and others to insure that the 2013 Senate-initiated amnesty bill was blue-slipped as an unconstitutional Senate-initiated revenue measure. Nancy Pelosi couldn\u2019t \u201cpick-off\u201d RINOs because the House never got the papers on the bill from the Senate.\n\nAnd the reason that Majority Leader Harry Reid didn\u2019t re-pass the bill on a House vehicle is that multiple possible filibusters made the process too cumbersome. These are, incidentally, the multiple filibusters that Alexander proposes to abolish.\n\nBut make no mistake about it: If the Senate rules are changed and Democrats win in 2016, the fight against amnesty is lost. Similarly, the fight against gun control and \u201ccard check\u201d legislation will also be lost.\n\nBut that\u2019s just one of two bad scenarios.\n\nWhat if Mitch McConnell retains control of the Senate and a squishy Republican wins the White House? Given the dozen bad bills that McConnell has slammed through so far this year, over conservative objections, does anyone believe that a Senate under the iron fist of Mitch McConnell would produce a better result?\n\nIn either scenario, amnesty passes. Gun control passes. Card check passes.\n\nAlexander wants to \u201cget things done.\u201d But is anything either Schumer or McConnell would do something that conservatives would applaud?\n\nObamacare can be repealed thought reconciliation, if you have an honest Congressional Budget Office (CBO). If can be effectively repealed by reconciliation, even if we continue with our current corrupt CBO (Remember CBO\u2019s projection of 20 million Americans on the exchanges by 2016?).\n\nDitto, defunding Planed Parenthood \u2014 and virtually everything else on the GOP\u2019s agenda.\n\nBut what about Alexander\u2019s argument that \u201cThere is too much dead time on the Senate floor?\u201d\n\nI remember when the Senate was first televised. Part of the argument for letting cameras into the chamber was that the Senate wouldn\u2019t be allowed to go into interminable quorum calls when the public was watching.\n\nHow\u2019d that turn out?\n\nIf camera didn\u2019t bring efficiency to the Senate, crippling the filibuster won\u2019t achieve that either.\n\nThe only way to eliminate quorum calls is for the leadership to control the schedule with an iron first. And that\u2019s medicine which is much worse than the disease.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the question of whether Schumer and/or McConnell would invoke the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to wipe out the tattered remains of the Senate\u2019s rules. My guess is that a lot of \u201cold bulls\u201d in either party aren\u2019t willing to take that step. And besides, what\u2019s the logic of blowing your own brains out because of fear someone else might do it for you?\n\nSo, conservatives, now id the time to decide whether we are going to win or lose on the major issues of our time. Historically, the filibuster(s) have been the most effective tool for stopping liberal proposals. If we relinquish it (them) because of a short-sighted proposal which looks only to the impact of the next few months, everything we believe in and fought for will soon be gone.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "If Sen.
