Brad Blue.\n\nRisick and her family had to run through that water to get out.\n\n\"It was a flood,\" she said. \"My shoes are wet. The baby's shoes are wet. We're all wet.\"\n\nCarlos Olmos, another hotel guest, said getting out was hectic.\n\n\"Everybody was panicking, wanting to get out, you know,\" he said. \"They noticed something was not right.\"\n\nValue Place guests got out with what they could grab and they hope the rest did not suffer too much damage.\n\n\"I took what I could get now out of the room and I still have a lot of other belongings,\" Risick said. \"All of the kids' Christmas toys, our Christmas stuff is all in the room right now.\"\n\nLt. Blue blamed recent cold weather for the water main burst. He said the frozen pipe had begun to thaw Wednesday and that caused it to break.\n\nThe fire department and Value Place are still working to determine how much it will cost to repair the damage. Value Place was also working to find guests other places to stay.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Crews were called to the Value Place Hotel near Kellogg and Ridge around 3 p.m. Wednesday.", "language": "english", "author": "Phil White", "og": {"description": "Crews were called to the Value Place Hotel near Kellogg and Ridge around 3 p.m. Wednesday.", "title": "UPDATE: Water main, sprinkler system bursts, forcing evacuation at W.
