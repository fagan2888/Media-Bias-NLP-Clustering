Brink Junior High in Moore was on a soft lockdown Monday due to a security situation on campus.

A school official told News 9 they are taking security precautions, but says “everything is fine” at the school. The school is located at 11420 S. Western Ave., just north of SW 119th St.

A counselor checked their voicemail messages and listened to a "suspicious in nature" message left Sunday morning, Moore Public Schools safety and security director Dustin Horstkoetter said.

There was no discernible threat in the message but the administration decided to place the school on lockdown as a precautionary measure.

Oklahoma City police and other law enforcement agencies assisted in evaluating the content of the message and determined it contained no actionable threat, Horstkoetter said.
