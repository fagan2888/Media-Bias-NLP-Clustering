The former director of the Kentucky Council of Churches has filed to run for Congress against Republican Andy Barr in Kentucky's 6th Congressional District.

Nancy Jo Kemper filed her paperwork with the Secretary of State's office on Thursday. The 73-year-old United Church of Christ minister will run as a Democrat and said she has been working with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Kemper criticized Barr for voting to repeal the federal Affordable Care Act and for voting against increases in the federal minimum wage. She said Democratic nominee for governor Jack Conway won the district by 2,500 votes, giving her confidence she can compete against Barr.

Barr is in his second term in Congress. He ousted Democratic incumbent Ben Chandler in 2012.
