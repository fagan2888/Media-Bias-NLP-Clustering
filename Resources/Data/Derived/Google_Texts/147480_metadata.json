Barrette is a 56-year-old Floridian who found she wouldn't be able to keep her health insurance after Obamacare. From the the transcript:\n\nLast month, [Barrette] received a letter from Blue Cross/Blue Shield informing her as of January 2014, she would lose her current plan. Barrette pays $54 a month. The new plan she\u2019s being offered would run $591 a month, ten times more than what she currently pays. \u201cWhat I have right now is what I\u2019m happy with, and I just want to know why I can\u2019t keep what I have. Why do I have to be forced into something else?\u201d\n\nBarrette's wrenching story quickly made Fox News, and then ricocheted through the rest of the media. Then the Washington Post's Erik Wemple called Barrette and got the details on her health-care plan.\n\nHer current health insurance plan, she says, doesn\u2019t cover \u201cextended hospital stays; it\u2019s not designed for that,\u201d says Barrette. Well, does it cover any hospitalization? \u201cOutpatient only,\u201d responds Barrette. Nor does it cover ambulance service and some prenatal care. On the other hand, says Barrette, it does cover \u201cmost of my generic drugs that I need\u201d and there\u2019s a $50 co-pay for doctors\u2019 appointments..A middling hospital stay could well have bankrupted Barrette under her current insurance.\n\nThen the New Republic's Jonathan Cohn called Barrette and walked through the subsidies she'd qualify for and the precise plans she might be able to get. Her response? \"I would jump at it,\" she told Cohn. \"With my age, things can happen. I don\u2019t want to have bills that could make me bankrupt. I don\u2019t want to lose my house.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" she said abut Obamacare, \"it\u2019s a blessing in disguise.\"\n\nIn the space of about a week, in other words, Barrette went from Obamacare victim to Obamacare beneficiary.\n\nCall this the fog of health reform: We're in a period right now where the information coming out about the insurance people will get under Obamacare is often incomplete, wrong, or misleading. This is true for a few reasons:\n\n1) People are getting cancellation notices from insurers, many of which include misleading quotes for how much replacement insurance will cost. (Read Dylan Scott's excellent investigation on this.) As Brian Beutler writes, \"the media has fallen into a lazy habit of taking insurance companies at their word.\"\n\n2) HealthCare.gov still isn't working that well, so people can't see their options under the new law.\n\n3) The problems with the law's digital architecture have biased the media towards believing bad news about other parts of Obamacare.\n\nReaders know that I think the problems with HealthCare.gov are real, and even severe. But I'm much more skeptical of the stories about people seeing their health insurance change. As Barrette's story shows, many of those cases will end with people in better, cheaper, more protective plans. That won't be true in every case, of course. But ending the days when healthy people got cheap plans because sick people couldn't buy any insurance at all is necessary, even if it's painful.\n\nOne year from now, the insurance market is likely to have settled, with a lot more people getting health insurance. That's not to say everyone will be better off. But it is to say a lot of people will be better off. The fact that we're not hearing from any of them yet is understandable given the problems with HealthCare.gov, but it's a problem for people trying to extrapolate from the coverage right now to the future of the law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We're in a period right now where the information coming out about the insurance people will get under Obamacare is often incomplete, wrong, or misleading.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "We're in a period right now where the information coming out about the insurance people will get under Obamacare is often incomplete, wrong, or misleading.", "title": "The fog of health reform: Why there\u2019s so much bad information about Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/11/05/the-fog-of-health-reform-why-theres-so-much-bad-information-about-obamacare/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/10/wonk1025-800x533.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/11/05/the-fog-of-health-reform-why-theres-so-much-bad-information-about-obamacare/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obamacare, health reform,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health reform,"}, "article_summary": "One year from now, the insurance market is likely to have settled, with a lot more people getting health insurance.\nBarrette is a 56-year-old Floridian who found she wouldn't be able to keep her health insurance after Obamacare.\nHer current health insurance plan, she says, doesn\u2019t cover \u201cextended hospital stays; it\u2019s not designed for that,\u201d says Barrette.\nBut I'm much more skeptical of the stories about people seeing their health insurance change.\nIn the space of about a week, in other words, Barrette went from Obamacare victim to Obamacare beneficiary."}
