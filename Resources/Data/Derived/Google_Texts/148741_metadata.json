And I mean, you know, you are in a position to say, what do we do about it whether it\u2019s government, whether it\u2019s community, whether it\u2019s family, how do we stop the violence?\n\nKARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: Well, I wish I had an easy answer for that. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any easy answer. We saw an act of evil, racist, bigoted evil. And to me, the amazing thing about this is it was met with grief and love.\n\nAnd think about how far we\u2019ve come. 1963, the whole weight of the government throughout the South was to impede finding and holding and bringing to justice the men who perpetrated the bombing and here we saw an entire state, an entire community, an entire nation come together grieving as one, united in the belief that this was an evil act.\n\nSo, we have come a long way. Now, maybe there\u2019s some magic law that will keep us from having more of these. I mean, basically, the only way to guarantee that we would dramatically reduce acts of violence involving guns is to basically remove guns from society, and until somebody gets enough oomph to repeal the Second Amendment, that\u2019s not going to happen. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an answer.\n\nI think there were so many warning since here. A friend who knew of what was in Dylann Roof\u2019s heart, parents who didn\u2019t pay attention, a community that had given up on him, and a loner who had fallen into the clutches of racist organizations and had come to believe in their ideology and put things up on the Internet that we didn\u2019t give any credence to whatsoever.\n\nAnd so, there were a lot of warning signs here and I wish that some of those people had spoken up and said, here\u2019s somebody who is in trouble and a danger to himself and others.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Until somebody gets enough oomph to repeal the Second Amendment,\" he says on Fox, violence will continue", "title": "Karl Rove\u2019s Second Amendment shocker: \u201cThe only way to guarantee that we would dramatically reduce acts of violence involving guns is to basically remove guns from society\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Until somebody gets enough oomph to repeal the Second Amendment,\" he says on Fox, violence will continue", "title": "Karl Rove\u2019s Second Amendment shocker: \u201cThe only way to guarantee that we would dramatically reduce acts of violence involving guns is to basically remove guns from society\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/21/karl_roves_second_amendment_shocker_the_only_way_to_guarantee_that_we_would_dramatically_reduce_acts_of_violence_involving_guns_is_to_basically_remove_guns_from_society/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/karl_rove3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Until somebody gets enough oomph to repeal the Second Amendment,\" he says on Fox, violence will continue", "title": "Karl Rove\u2019s Second Amendment shocker: \u201cThe only way to guarantee that we would dramatically reduce acts of violence involving guns is to basically remove guns from society\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/karl_rove3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Salon Staff", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Charleston, Editor's Picks, Fox News, Gun Control, Karl Rove, Second Amendment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any easy answer.\nI mean, basically, the only way to guarantee that we would dramatically reduce acts of violence involving guns is to basically remove guns from society, and until somebody gets enough oomph to repeal the Second Amendment, that\u2019s not going to happen.\nAsked by host Chris Wallace how we stop gun violence, Rove said there\u2019s no \u201cmagic law\u201d and that the only way to reduce gun violence, would be to take guns out of society, which means a political movement with enough \u201coomph\u201d to nullify the Second Amendment.\nKARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: Well, I wish I had an easy answer for that.\nKarl Rove didn\u2019t exactly call for the repeal of the Second Amendment on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d But what he did say was shocking in its directness and its implications."}
