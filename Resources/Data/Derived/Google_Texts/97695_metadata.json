Al Franken (D-Minn.) responded on Sunday to a Washington Post op-ed in which Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) wrote that net neutrality is \"Obamacare for the Internet.\"\n\nFranken said Cruz \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand\u201d what net neutrality is.\n\n\u201cHe has it completely wrong and he just doesn't understand what this issue is,\u201d Franken told Candy Crowley on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nFranken is a longtime proponent of net neutrality, or the idea that all traffic on the Internet should be treated equally. The Federal Communications Commission is in the process of revising rules around the concept, and major Internet providers have pushed for Internet \"fast lanes\" that let them charge websites extra for faster loading times. On Monday, President Barack Obama called on the FCC to \u201cimplement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality.\u201d\n\nWriting in the Washington Post on Thursday, Cruz called net neutrality policy \u201cObamacare for the Internet,\u201d arguing that \u201cit would put the government in charge of determining Internet pricing, terms of service and what types of products and services can be delivered.\u201d\n\nBut as Franken explained, net neutrality isn\u2019t a new government program, like the health care exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act. On the contrary, \u201cwe have had net neutrality the entire history of the Internet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen [Cruz] says this is the Obamacare, Obamacare was a government program that fixed something, that changed things,\u201d Franken said. \u201cThis is about reclassifying something so it stays the same. This would keep things exactly the same that they've been.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: Nov. 17, 1:20 p.m. -- On Monday, Amanda Carpenter, Cruz's communications director, sent this statement to HuffPost:\n\nIn his remarks in Austin on Friday, Senator Cruz criticized net neutrality for the precise reason it would keep the Internet 'the same' as Senator Franken said. Allowing the government to regulate the Internet as a public utility would freeze innovation and prevent progress. It's radical and extreme to put the future of the Internet in the hands of a 5-member FCC panel influenced by lobbyists and politicians and unaccountable to regular, working Americans.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated the name of CNN's show. It is \"State of the Union.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Ted Cruz Ted Cruz\n\n1 of 19 Share this slide:\n\nAlamy", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Sen.
