John Kasich\u2019s plans to pay for a statewide income tax cut by hiking energy taxes, Opportunity Ohio president Matt Mayer explained in a Monday release.\n\nMayer\u2019s analysis of records filed with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources revealed yearly statewide oil production tens of millions of barrels short of the Republican governor\u2019s projections.\n\nOhio Oil Production: Gov. Kasich\u2019s Estimates vs. Actual Results\n\nYear Kasich-Estimated Producing Wells Actual Producing Wells Kasich-Estimated Production (Barrels) Actual Production (Barrels) 2012 172 76 (44%) 7,662,600 635,874 (8.3%) 2013 731 341 (47%) 35,584,650 3,678,734 (10.3%) 2014 (Q3 Annualized) 1,656 595 (36%) 84,281,850 12,054,664 (14.3%)\n\nOhio is one of several states where drilling for oil and natural gas has increased recently due to breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking.\u201d Since 2012, Kasich has been demanding Republicans in the Ohio General Assembly increase the severance taxes energy companies \u2014 and often, landowners \u2014 must pay when oil and gas are extracted from Ohioans\u2019 property.\n\nIn his report, Mayer explained that low oil prices and production guarantee a severance tax hike would not be the revenue source Kasich has been counting on. And even without Kasich\u2019s tax hike, low prices and production are already driving energy companies from Ohio.\n\n\u201cIt is critical to put Ohio\u2019s energy production in perspective,\u201d Mayer wrote after citing recent layoffs in the industry.\n\n\u201cAccording to Baker Hughes Rig Count, there are currently 46 drilling rigs in Ohio, as there are 839 in Texas, 209 in Oklahoma, 169 in North Dakota, 109 in Louisiana, and 53 in Pennsylvania,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Utica Shale oil production numbers compared to the Permian, Eagle Ford and Bakken formations are insignificant,\u201d he continued. Much of eastern Ohio sits atop the Utica Shale formation.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, the Utica formation is producing less than 33,000 barrels of oil per day compared to more than 1.2 million in the Bakken formation, 1.6 million in the Eagle Ford formation, and nearly 2.0 million in the Permian formation,\u201d Mayer wrote.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows Governor Kasich is depserate to find sources from higher taxes to fund continued personal income tax reductions, but hiking taxes on Ohio\u2019s energy industry at such a precarious time will inhibit future investment and production in Ohio,\u201d Mayer wrote, noting that taxes on oil accounted for nearly 96 percent of Kasich\u2019s projected severance tax hike revenue.\n\n\u201cWith the price of oil declining, the marginal attractiveness Ohio held for energy companies is also declining. There is a reason BP, Shell, Devon, Anadarko \u2014 all top energy companies \u2014 and several smaller independent oil companies have left Ohio,\u201d Mayer wrote.\n\nAlthough Ohio levies a variety of other taxes on oil and gas drillers operating in the state, Kasich has argued the current severance tax is ridiculously low. The governor insists the tax could be increased dramatically without driving any energy companies away.\n\nThe Kasich administration did not respond to a request for comment on Opportunity Ohio\u2019s report and the governor\u2019s severance tax plans.\n\nIn an email exchange with Ohio Watchdog, Mayer said no one from the governor\u2019s office has expressed an interest in his findings. Mayer indicated he expects to discuss the issue with lawmakers as the governor continues pushing for a severance tax hike.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio's oil production since 2012 has been far short of state officials' projections, according to a new report from free market think tank Opportunity Ohio.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio's oil production since 2012 has been far short of state officials' projections, according to a new report from free market think tank Opportunity Ohio.", "title": "Ohio oil production sputters, falls far short of estimates - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/SilentOilWell-ShutterStock.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-16T09:41:17+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/193043/ohio-oil-production/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio's oil production since 2012 has been far short of state officials' projections, according to a new report from free market think tank Opportunity Ohio.", "title": "Ohio oil production sputters, falls far short of estimates - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/SilentOilWell-ShutterStock.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Energy and Environment", "published_time": "2015-01-16T04:00:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-16T09:41:17+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "Kasich, John Kasich, Opportunity Ohio, Matt Mayer, oil, severance taxes, fracking, fracking taxes"}, "article_summary": "By Jason Hart | Ohio WatchdogOhio\u2019s oil production since 2012 has been far short of state officials\u2019 projections, free-market think tank Opportunity Ohio says in new report.\nOhio Oil Production: Gov.\nThere is a reason BP, Shell, Devon, Anadarko \u2014 all top energy companies \u2014 and several smaller independent oil companies have left Ohio,\u201d Mayer wrote.\nMayer\u2019s analysis of records filed with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources revealed yearly statewide oil production tens of millions of barrels short of the Republican governor\u2019s projections.\nAnd even without Kasich\u2019s tax hike, low prices and production are already driving energy companies from Ohio."}
