There\u2019s no \u2014 ambivalence here, we\u2019re very clear. We believe that that decision is best left not to government, but between a woman and her doctor. So there isn\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you a specific date and time past which we on all \u2014 in all cases are certain that that choice shouldn\u2019t be made. Because that decision is very unique and individual to the woman, and should be in consultation with her conscience, and her God, and her doctor, that is a decision left to her. Now, there are \u2014 there\u2019s an overlay of restrictions that the Supreme Court has imposed through Roe versus Wade and subsequent decisions, and states have gone and implemented their own laws to put those restrictions in place. That\u2019s how the law \u2014 now, I don\u2019t agree with all of those restrictions, but the law should be followed, and that\u2019s our view.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) ducked a question on when she believes life begins", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) ducked a question on when she believes life begins", "title": "Wasserman Schultz Dodges on When Life Begins - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/DWS-Abortion-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/04/14/wasserman-schultz-dodges-on-when-life-begins/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) ducked a question on when she believes life begins", "title": "Wasserman Schultz Dodges on When Life Begins - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/DWS-Abortion-Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Abortion, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Planned Parenthood v.
