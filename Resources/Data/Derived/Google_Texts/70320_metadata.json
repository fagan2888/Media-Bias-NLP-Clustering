The U.S. and other countries have been pushing for a more representative government that can reach out to Sunnis, who felt marginalized by former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Sunni discontent is widely seen as having fueled the Islamic State extremist group\u2019s dramatic advances in Iraq since June.\n\nOn Saturday, lawmakers approved Mohammed Salem al-Ghabban, a Shiite lawmaker with al-Abadi\u2019s State of Law political bloc, as Iraq\u2019s new minister of interior. Khaled al-Obeidi, a Sunni lawmaker from the besieged city of Mosul, was selected for the post of defense minister. Hoshyar Zebari, a Kurdish politician and Iraq\u2019s long-serving foreign minister, was named minister of finance, having previously been voted in as deputy prime minister.\n\nLawmakers approved most of al-Abadi\u2019s Cabinet on Sept. 8 and officially voted him in as prime minister, bringing a formal end to al-Maliki\u2019s eight-year rule, but al-Abadi requested a delay in naming defense and interior ministers because lawmakers had not agreed on his proposed candidates.\n\nOn Sept. 16, al-Abadi put forward Sunni lawmaker Jaber al-Jabberi as his candidate for defense minister and Shiite lawmaker Riyad Ghareeb as his pick for interior minister, but both were rejected by parliament.\n\nAl-Maliki held both the defense and interior minister posts himself after his re-election in 2010 because lawmakers could not reach an agreement on them. That fueled concerns that he was monopolizing power.\n\nOther posts named Saturday included the role of minister of tourism, given to Shiite lawmaker Adel Fahd al-Shirshab, and the head of the women\u2019s ministry was named as Kurdish lawmaker Bayan Nouri.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iraqi lawmakers approved Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's nominees for the remaining posts in his government Saturday, including the critical posts of defense and interior ministers amid the fight against the extremist Islamic State group.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Iraqi lawmakers approved Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi\u2019s nominees for the remaining posts in his government Saturday, including the critical posts of defense and interior ministers amid the fight against the extremist Islamic State group.", "title": "Iraq lawmakers approve interior, defense ministers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/18/iraq-lawmakers-approve-interior-defense-ministers/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/17/517e30c79fcaf6245f0f6a7067006a0d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/17/517e30c79fcaf6245f0f6a7067006a0d.jpg", "description": "Iraqi lawmakers approved Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's nominees for the remaining posts in his government Saturday, including the critical posts of defense and interior ministers amid the fight aga", "card": "summary", "title": "Iraq lawmakers approve interior, defense ministers"}, "Author": "Qassim Abdul-Zahra", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Haider Al Abadi, Nouri Al Maliki, Iraq"}, "article_summary": "Al-Maliki held both the defense and interior minister posts himself after his re-election in 2010 because lawmakers could not reach an agreement on them.\nKhaled al-Obeidi, a Sunni lawmaker from the besieged city of Mosul, was selected for the post of defense minister.\nHoshyar Zebari, a Kurdish politician and Iraq\u2019s long-serving foreign minister, was named minister of finance, having previously been voted in as deputy prime minister.\nOn Sept. 16, al-Abadi put forward Sunni lawmaker Jaber al-Jabberi as his candidate for defense minister and Shiite lawmaker Riyad Ghareeb as his pick for interior minister, but both were rejected by parliament.\nOn Saturday, lawmakers approved Mohammed Salem al-Ghabban, a Shiite lawmaker with al-Abadi\u2019s State of Law political bloc, as Iraq\u2019s new minister of interior."}
