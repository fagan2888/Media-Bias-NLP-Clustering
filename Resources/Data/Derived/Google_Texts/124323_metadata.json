But when 37 states opted out of the exchanges, Obama decided on his own that all citizens would be eligible for subsidies through the federal exchange. It is this unilateral decision that the current case, King v. Burwell, seeks to overturn.\n\nRepublicans in both the House and the Senate have already offered basic ideas on how to replace subsidies if they are lost by a Supreme Court decision that invalidates Obama\u2019s subsidies.\n\nHouse members have proposed tax credits to help citizens in non-exchange states to pay for their health care insurance policies forced upon them by Obamacare. The exact amount of that tax credit has not been decided.\n\nThe House is also proposing to allow states to fully opt out of the Obamacare mandates.\n\nFor its part, the Senate has proposed a temporary program of financial assistance for lower income insurance buyers so that they can keep their insurance while Congress works out a solution to the issue.\n\nDemocrats, though, claim that neither house will be able to muster the votes to put dents in Obamacare no matter what the Court decides.\n\nRegardless, both houses of Congress are in a waiting game until the Supreme Court releases its ruling in June.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia Urges GOP to Move Fast to Eliminate Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia Urges GOP to Move Fast to Eliminate Obamacare", "title": "Supreme Court Justice Scalia Urges GOP to Move Fast to Eliminate Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/scalia-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/06/supreme-court-justice-antonin-scalia-urges-gop-to-move-fast-to-eliminate-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia Urges GOP to Move Fast to Eliminate Obamacare", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/scalia-AP.jpg", "title": "Supreme Court Justice Scalia Urges GOP to Move Fast to Eliminate Obamacare", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Antonin Scalia, health care, Obama, obamacare, Supreme Court,Big Government, Obamacare,Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Supreme Court", "published_time": "2015-03-06T04:59:30-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6a7\"", "article_summary": "Regardless, both houses of Congress are in a waiting game until the Supreme Court releases its ruling in June.\n37 states ended up opting out of the state-based Obamacare exchanges.\nRepublicans in both the House and the Senate have already offered basic ideas on how to replace subsidies if they are lost by a Supreme Court decision that invalidates Obama\u2019s subsidies.\nLawmakers wrote Obamacare expecting that every state would set up the exchanges, but a later Supreme Court decision determined that the federal government could not force the states to create an exchange if they didn\u2019t want to.\nDemocrats, though, claim that neither house will be able to muster the votes to put dents in Obamacare no matter what the Court decides."}
