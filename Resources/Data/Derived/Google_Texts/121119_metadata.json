It\u2019s hard raising a child who doesn\u2019t have a leg, arm, or hand, and there will certainly be difficult times where the child is self-conscious about their differences. Thankfully, 3D printing has advanced exponentially in the past couple of years, and many kids who are missing these body parts are among the first to receive 3D-printed prosthetics. One such kid is 3-year-old Rayden Kahae, who lives in Maui.\n\nRayden was born with amniotic band syndrome, a rare congenital abnormality that causes strands of the amniotic membrane in the mother\u2019s womb to wrap around parts of the fetus. In young Rayden\u2019s case, it inhibited growth of his right hand from the wrist. \u201cHe would never want to show it to people,\u201d Rayden\u2019s mom, Rayven Kahae, told the NY Daily News. However, he recently received a 3D-printed prosthetic hand from the 3D printing nonprofit group E-Nable, which made it to resemble the superhero Iron Man. The best part: It only cost $50 to build, and the family got it for free. \u201cNow, he shows it to everybody,\u201d Kahae said. \u201cHe\u2019s so proud. He can catch a ball.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most heartwarming thing Rayden did, however, upon first receiving the prosthetic, was grab his own hand. \u201cAs soon as he put it on and was able to close the hand, his face just lit up,\u201d his grandmother Rulan Waikiki told Hawaiian news station KHON2. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if the video, you can hear it on there, but he does say, \u2018I can hold my own hand.\u2019\u201d As Rayden ages, the hand will be remade to fit his wrist, which controls the hand \u2014 the fingers close when his wrist moves down, and open when his wrist moves up.\n\nYou can see Rayden and his new hand in action below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "rayden, kahae, hawaiian, boy, born, without, hand, gets, 3d, printed, prosthetic, and, calls", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Nonprofit 3D printing group E-Nable custom designed a prosthetic hand for a 3-year-old boy born without a hand.
