And yet CCOs deviate from the traditional accountable care model. Unlike most ACOs, CCOs were created by state regulation, are geographically defined, and are accountable for the Medicaid population, a group of individuals at high risk for psychosocial challenges that impact health outcomes.\n\nCan CCOs offer a means of transforming the delivery system, eliminating disparities, and improving the overall health of the Medicaid population? Or will Oregon\u2019s CCO legislation turn out to be simply a cost-containment strategy for business as usual?\n\nIn 2014, we wrote a Health Affairs Blog post covering results from key informant interviews with leaders at two of Oregon\u2019s CCOs: Health Share of Oregon in Portland and PacificSource Community Solutions in Central Oregon. By January 2015, we had conducted 55 additional interviews.\n\nThe following blog post provides an overview of the results of those interviews. Building upon the findings detailed in our original post, we now focus on revealing how CCO challenges, achievements, and strategy have shifted during the first two years. Observations on the trajectory of these organizations as they continue to work toward meeting reform goals could help inform decision-makers in other states and systems to build regional accountable care models.\n\nUse Both Extrinsic And Intrinsic Motivation\n\nOur first round of interviews revealed that health care leaders chose to participate in CCOs based on extrinsic motivators (such as market forces or legislative forces) and also based on intrinsic motivators, such as the desire to build a better system to care for vulnerable populations.\n\nOur second round of interviews found that extrinsic motivation had shifted. Early in CCO implementation, the state legislature was able to exercise significant power to set the rules. CCOs had to abide by those rules or else lose out on the opportunity to cover or care for the Medicaid population.\n\nBy our second round of interviews, the landscape had changed. CCOs recognized that the state had a vested interest in their success.\n\nFor instance, when asked if there would be consequences for non-compliance with the guidelines regulating community health improvement plans, one CCO employee replied: \u201cI think there would probably be some hand wringing and maybe some wrist slapping, but [the state is] on the hook for making sure that we are successful.\u201d\n\nSince Oregon is being closely monitored by federal regulators, CCO leaders feel more like partners in health care transformation.\n\nCCOs also experienced some financial success in the first two years. Both CCOs in our study received a sizable quality incentive payout, and neither CCO reported budgetary concerns. Several respondents at Health Share of Oregon described being pleased when enrollment related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion was much higher than expected.\n\nIntrinsic motivators are still driving collaboration; one CCO leader remarked, \u201cI\u2019m not na\u00efve, I know that there\u2019s a competitive side to all of it, but there\u2019s a lot of collegiality and a lot of interest in working with the others to figure out how to do things better.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about implementation successes, several respondents said that continued collaboration was a significant victory. As one CCO board member put it, \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re all still together, and they\u2019re still talking, and they\u2019re still figuring this out, and they\u2019re still committed to it, is really pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nThere are three takeaways here. First, when it comes to accountable care, legislative and market forces are still the most powerful drivers of collaboration among traditional competitors. Second, tensions between those traditional adversaries can be smoothed out over time if all partners, including the state, are invested in the success of the model. And third, the shift from extrinsic (they\u2019re requiring us to do it) to intrinsic (we believe we should do it) motivation is facilitated by an organization\u2019s ability to maintain good financial health.\n\n1. Build Relationships Through Quick Wins\n\nIn CCO infancy, the formerly competitive but now collaborating partners were uneasy and alliances were tenuous. Leaders reported the necessity of the \u201cquick win\u201d \u2014 a successful project often funded through grants. Grant funding for CCOs came in many forms over the past two years, and it was used for innovative experiments or pilots to explore how care for the Medicaid population might be better delivered.\n\nDuring our first site visit, many respondents pointed to these \u201ctransformation projects\u201d\u2014which included interventions aimed at high-utilizers, innovative new sites for care delivery, and resources for data-sharing\u2014as the pride of their cross-sector collaboration.\n\nIn our second round of interviews, we observed that the transformation projects are still a point of pride for CCOs, yet respondents were moving away from relying on them as a platform for collaboration and instead were thinking strategically about their impact. Several interviewees described a push for data that would drive decisions about whether or not to continue funding such initiatives.\n\nOne CCO employee said, \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting problem that we\u2019ve had with the strategic initiatives, those first ones we did. It\u2019s really hard to measure cost savings \u2014 like really hard. And so to show that your program works, you\u2019re like, Yeah, it may work, but it may not. We don\u2019t exactly have the data to say for sure.\u201d Another respondent said simply, \u201cI think the verdict is still out on a lot of this work.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, respondents describe shifting from the panic of the early days\u2014where much of their time was spent responding to state rules and assembling transformation projects as quickly as possible\u2014to a new phase that allows for more focus or deliberation.\n\nFor example, a CCO employee at Health Share told us that the organization\u2019s focus is moving past \u201chonoring the contract with the state.\u201d Now, she said, \u201cit\u2019s great that we\u2019re doing a lot of innovation at the local level, and yet I think there are still some bigger [things we could do] if we\u2019re really going to transform the system. We need to find the balance between lots of little innovative things that are potentially spreadable to a small population, versus really thinking about what\u2019s going to move the dial in a really big and comprehensive way.\u201d\n\nCCO partners are better able to participate in conversations around budgeting that had previously been the source of significant tension. For instance, at both CCOs it has been easier to talk about sharing risk than it has been to talk about shifting revenue streams. Nevertheless, one CCO leader observed that accountable care could shift dollars from physical health to behavioral health.\n\n\u201cThese become discussions about doing something different with the global budget,\u201d she said. \u201cDo we really need to invest differently in some services, [knowing that we won\u2019t achieve cost savings] for five years? Are we really, really willing to have those kinds of discussions? And those are tough conversations to have.\u201d\n\nWhile our first round of interviews pointed to grant-funded pilot projects as quick wins that built trust among new partners, this second round of interviews indicates that those quick wins don\u2019t make up the comprehensive structure of transformation. However, these innovative pilots allowed CCOs to test new care delivery strategies while building relationships that could withstand systemic change.\n\n2. Build A Realistic Timeline\n\nThe first round of interviews highlighted the aggressive timeline for CCO implementation; organizations had only months to build infrastructure before patients were enrolled. The frantic pace served as both a facilitator of success and as a notable challenge. While the timeline forced decisions that might otherwise have been argued in a boardroom indefinitely, CCO leaders expressed a desire for ample time to weigh options and design a thoughtful strategy.\n\nThe \u201cready, fire, aim\u201d timeline had implications that were apparent during our second site visits. First, when stakeholders were asked to detail accomplishments and successes, most said that the creation of the CCO\u2014building the organizational infrastructure\u2014had been the biggest success to date. That these organizations were successfully operational was apparent; round two interviewees spoke less about how to create a CCO and more about what kind of CCO they wanted to be.\n\nNevertheless, the frantic pace had lingering challenges. Many CCO leaders mentioned staff burnout and turnover as a result of the pace of change. Further, many early decisions were based on assumptions that never came to fruition; for example, one CCO leader described having to abandon plans to leverage data to reduce utilization because they had never been able to successfully build the integrated data-sharing system as they had hoped.\n\nLastly, there is evidence that the pace drove a myopic focus on state requirements. One stakeholder mentioned that CCO leaders were caught off guard when Medicaid expansion hit and they were suddenly faced with provider shortages, even though \u201ceveryone knew the ACA was coming.\u201d\n\nOne year later, it is still unclear whether the timeline will drive or undermine the success of Oregon\u2019s accountable care model.\n\n3. Incentives Drive Strategy\n\nThe first phase of our case study underscored the heavy influence that incentives had on CCO strategic planning and efforts. Despite the struggles of building new organizations, both Health Share and Pacific Source were able to meet quality standards and receive their incentive dollars in Year One.\n\nStakeholders were happy to have earned the extra capital, yet expressed concerns that the current incentive system was too \u201cprescriptive\u201d and limited their ability to think more progressively about how to meet the Triple Aim. One CCO employee said that the quality incentive metrics were at odds with the state\u2019s stated intention that CCOs reduce health disparities:\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re being paid for population outcomes, eliminating health disparities is not our business. We have to have policy-level incentives and requirements for CCOs to eliminate health disparities\u2026.And it\u2019s really difficult for us to feel very empowered to do this [equity] work when there are no financial penalties or rewards on a policy level and it\u2019s not our job.\u201d\n\nAfter observing CCOs form workgroups around certain incentive metrics and allocate funding for pilots that target those metrics, it\u2019s clear that the most effective way to get CCOs to perform a certain way is to operationalize measures and offer incentives for meeting benchmarks.\n\nThe global budget is providing needed flexibility when it comes to aligning payment streams for integrating care and implementing alternate payment methodologies \u2014 like capitated payments for hospitals at Pacific Source. But Medicaid dollars in Oregon are still, for the most part, supporting the identical care delivery models that were funded through fee-for-service.\n\nAs one CCO employee put it, \u201cIn terms of strategies none of those dollars\u2014outside of the administrative carve-off that we take to support my salary and the budget for our community advisory panel\u2014support specific strategies. We don\u2019t carve off a certain amount of money for prevention. And in some ways, achieving consensus on specific prevention strategies and carving off money off the top isn\u2019t an appropriate thing to do for this collaborative at the moment. And whether that\u2019s a good strategy or not is to be seen.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that incentives drive CCO organization, staffing, and financial models. We can therefore predict that if the metrics demand more transformative actions and the incentives are in place to reward those activities, system-level transformation will happen more quickly and more effectively.\n\nFurther Questions\n\nTwo years into Oregon\u2019s Coordinated Care Experiment, CCOs have stabilized despite ongoing and new challenges. Oregon has succeeded in shifting risk for Medicaid costs to these regional collaboratives, and many CCO leaders are enjoying the work. Nevertheless, key questions remain:\n\nWill CCO quality incentive metrics incentivize the care delivery transformation necessary to improve community health and reduce health disparities? Will CCOs use the global budget to fund new strategies and activities, or will Medicaid dollars go towards supporting the existing model of care? Will Oregon regret not giving CCOs time to develop long-term integration strategies?\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to watch the evolution of these new health care organizations.\n\nAuthor\u2019s Note\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Bruce Bayley, Lucy Savitz, and Jill Rissi for their contributions to this post.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/07/15/year-two-capturing-the-evolution-of-oregons-ccos/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blog_Horowitz.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Year Two: Capturing The Evolution Of Oregon\u2019s CCOs"}, "description": "Year Two: Capturing The Evolution Of Oregon\u2019s CCOs | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe015a\"", "article_summary": "Are we really, really willing to have those kinds of discussions?\nWe\u2019ll continue to watch the evolution of these new health care organizations.\nFurther QuestionsTwo years into Oregon\u2019s Coordinated Care Experiment, CCOs have stabilized despite ongoing and new challenges.\nMany CCO leaders mentioned staff burnout and turnover as a result of the pace of change.\nOregon has succeeded in shifting risk for Medicaid costs to these regional collaboratives, and many CCO leaders are enjoying the work."}
