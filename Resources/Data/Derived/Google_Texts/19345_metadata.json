In other words, fixing the broken U.S. healthcare system means assigning Hispanic doctors to Hispanic patients, African American doctors to African American patients, Creole doctors to Creole patients, and so on.\n\nTo accomplish this, the CAP report explains, Obamacare pours taxpayer dollars into affirmative-action candidates whose judgment will lead them to make life-or-death decisions. Ultimately, these taxpayer-funded grants would provide scholarships and loan forgiveness for minorities so they could provide healthcare services exclusively to their own race or ethnicity.\n\nObamacare, the report reads, \u201cprovides scholarships and loan repayment support for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds serving in the health professions, and it grants funding for the Health Careers Opportunities Program, which supports schools that recruit and train individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to work in the health professions. The bill also establishes a grant program at HRSA to promote health care professionals\u2019 cultural and linguistic competence.\u201d\n\nA 2010 report [pdf] from Families USA\u2019s Minority Health Initiatives offers similar language. The report applauds the Affordable Care Act for providing health care materials that are \u201cculturally and linguistically appropriate.\u201d Families USA adds, \u201cThe legislation also provides grants for training health care providers in culturally appropriate care and services.\u201d\n\nGrants are indeed handed out on a racial or ethnic basis. For example, Subtitle D, Sec. 756 of the Affordable Care Act lists eligibility requirements for mental health grants that demand universities and colleges recruit and \u201cunderstand the concerns\u201d of minority students, that programs offered to those students must emphasize \u201ccultural or linguistic competency\u201d \u2014 and the institutions must provide the HHS Secretary racial data on its student body, under threat of not only losing its grants, but being forced to repay them to the government.\n\nObamacare also re-authorizes The Office of Minority Health, whose secretary will hand out grants, government contracts and other taxpayer-funded favors to \u201celiminate racial and ethnic disparities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Katie McHugh", "description": "Democrats revive one of their favorite policies: Jim Crow laws!", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor under Obamacare -- if you both belong to the same race.
