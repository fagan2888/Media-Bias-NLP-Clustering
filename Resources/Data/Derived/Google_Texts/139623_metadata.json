Photo: Cassandra Giraldo for The Wall Street Journal\n\nComedian Colin Quinn wants to talk about race.\n\nAnd in his new show at the Cherry Lane Theatre, he tackles the sensitive subject in a way that only a blunt-talking native New Yorker and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum can\u2014without setting off a Donald Trump -style firestorm.\n\n\u201cColin Quinn The New York Story\u201d is a snappy, 75-minute monologue about race and ethnicity in the five boroughs. Neither polarizing nor politically correct, the show is rooted in his experiences growing up around different ethnic groups and appreciating those differences.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t like the move towards a lack of ethnic identification. I feel it\u2019s false. You want to celebrate all these cultures by homogenizing them?\u2019 \u2014Comedian Colin Quinn\n\nAs an Irish kid in Brooklyn\u2019s Park Slope during the 1970s, he said, he ran around in a \u201cpolyglot\u201d neighborhood, where each block had a different character shaped by blacks, Puerto Ricans and Italians.\n\n\u201cIt was everything overlapping,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only was each block different; each bar, each store was different.\u201d\n\nOver breakfast in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Quinn, 56 years old, explained his problem with the prevailing view of race: Our culture at once embraces diversity, he said, but also imposes a counter-intuitive attempt to neutralize difference, which leads to a fear of talking about it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the move towards a lack of ethnic identification. I feel it\u2019s false,\u201d he said in the same quick, clipped style he uses onstage. \u201cIt seems like a contradiction. You want to celebrate all these cultures by homogenizing them?\u201d\n\nHe said he suspects that frustration is what has led to Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity, even after the presidential hopeful\u2019s infamous comments about Mexican immigrants.\n\n\u201cPeople are sick of overly careful language from every politician,\u201d Mr. Quinn said. \u201cSo even if someone is stark raving mad, you\u2019re hearing the real him.\u201d\n\nOn a stage set that evokes a brownstone\u2019s stoop, Mr. Quinn\u2019s anti-homogenization effort runs through colorful anecdotes gleaned from his lifetime as a city dweller. The show is a rapid-fire version of his memoir, \u201cThe Coloring Book: A Comedian Solves Race Relations in America,\u201d in which he has more room to tell longer tales, rich with detailed foibles.\n\nUnder his satirical gaze, no group is left out. And Hispanic, Asian, Jewish or Irish groups aren\u2019t the only ones. White people come in for it, too: \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day when the ethnic group running New York was the nerds,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe thug thing is gone, and inner-city kids are wearing Buddy Holly glasses.\u201d\n\nHis book took a few years to write, he said, but the process sped up when he began using the material as stand-up.\n\n\u201cI like to be in front of the crowd and have them go \u2018Yay!\u2019 or even \u2018Boo!\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sensory deprivation writing a book.\u201d\n\nMr. Quinn, who began doing stand-up in the 1980s before moving to writing and performing on TV, said he tried out some passages in Long Island, Brooklyn and Long Island City clubs, where the crowds might still be living in and among strong ethnic groups. Many Manhattan audiences, he finds, don\u2019t quite live in the thick of ethnicity anymore.\n\nThe shift into a theater, he said, allows him to perform for audiences sitting rather politely in the dark, listening intently. By contrast, the stand-up crowd is \u201csavage,\u201d he said: \u201cPeople are drinking. They like a lot more sex humor. Those late shows, it\u2019s like lion taming.\u201d\n\nHe chose the 179-seat Cherry Lane Theatre, home of his 2013 show about American history, \u201cColin Quinn Unconstitutional,\u201d because its leafy West Village setting always meets with positive reaction.\n\n\u201cPeople say \u2018I love that theater!\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI want to say\u2026\u2018You love that block, too.\u2019 It has some energy or something.\u201d\n\nCherry Lane\u2019s founding artistic director Angelina Fiordellisi said the theater\u2019s location at 38 Commerce St. has a long, ethnic history itself, having hosted Jewish, Spanish and Italian families over time, including back when the area was still farmland.\n\nMr. Quinn\u2019s show suits the theater, she said, not just comedy clubs, because it is more than jokes: \u201cThe laughter comes from the stories and characters he creates.\u201d\n\nPreviews, which began July 9, sold out quickly, according to one of the show\u2019s producers, Brian Stern, who said the run through Aug. 16 is about 70% sold.\n\nWhen asked about the prospect of extending or transferring the show, even to Broadway, Mr. Stern said: \u201cThere is some exciting talk.\u201d\n\nENLARGE \u2018The laughter comes from the stories and characters he creates,\u2019 Cherry Lane\u2019s founding artistic director Angelina Fiordellisi said about Mr. Quinn\u2019s show. Photo: Cassandra Giraldo for The Wall S for The Wall Street Journal\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be Mr. Quinn\u2019s first trip to Broadway handling a serious, cultural subject with a satiric edge. In \u201cLong Story Short\u201d (2010), he addressed the history of the world, and with \u201cAn Irish Wake\u201d (1998), he painted a verbal portrait of his Irish neighborhood. The full titles of both shows include his name.\n\n\u201cLong Story Short,\u201d which also became an HBO special, was directed by Jerry Seinfeld, as is \u201cNew York Story.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the opposite of me,\u201d said Mr. Quinn of Mr. Seinfeld. \u201cHe\u2019s meticulous.\u201d\n\nBut with his show and his book, Mr. Quinn can be fairly described as meticulous in making his point\u2014while nimbly avoiding controversy and keeping up a positive outlook. As he writes in his conclusion, \u201cHere\u2019s what the political correctness doesn\u2019t see: the absurdity and beauty of New York City in all its crazy glory.\u201d\n\nWrite to Pia Catton at
