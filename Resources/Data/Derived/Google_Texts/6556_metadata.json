Williams\u2019 suicide that occurred this past Monday has been shrouded in speculation as people close to him and members of the general public try to understand what brought him to the ultimate decision to take his own life.\n\nAccording to The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research, started by fellow actor Michael J. Fox, mood disorders such as anxiety and depression are clinical symptoms of people suffering from Parkinson\u2019s, similar to tremors, loss of movement, and trouble speaking. Experts agree that just over half of Parkinson\u2019s patients suffer from clinical depression at some point in their disease, most notably when they are initially diagnosed. Evidence suggests the disease may cause chemical changes in the brain that often result in depression.\n\nSchneider\u2019s statement:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "robin, williams, suicide, parkinson's", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A statement released by Robin Williams' wife reveals the actor had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease just before his suicide.", "title": "Parkinson's May Have Played A Role In Robin Williams' Suicide", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/robin-williams-was-suffering-parkinsons-could-have-played-role-his-suicide-298158", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/robin-williams_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A statement released by Robin Williams' wife reveals the actor had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease just before his suicide.", "title": "Parkinson's May Have Played A Role In Robin Williams' Suicide", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/robin-williams-was-suffering-parkinsons-could-have-played-role-his-suicide-298158", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/robin-williams_1.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/robin-williams_1.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-14T14:57:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-14T14:59:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A statement released by Robin Williams' wife reveals the actor had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease just before his suicide."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8131\"", "article_summary": "Less than a week after the untimely death of beloved comedy icon Robin Williams, a statement released by Williams\u2019 wife, Susan Schneider, has revealed the actor was suffering from the early stages of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nAccording to The Michael J.\nFox, mood disorders such as anxiety and depression are clinical symptoms of people suffering from Parkinson\u2019s, similar to tremors, loss of movement, and trouble speaking.\nFox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research, started by fellow actor Michael J.\nExperts agree that just over half of Parkinson\u2019s patients suffer from clinical depression at some point in their disease, most notably when they are initially diagnosed."}
