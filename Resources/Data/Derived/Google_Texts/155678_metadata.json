When presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wants to get her facts about campaign finance straight, at least she knows where to come.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world,\u201d Clinton said during Saturday\u2019s Democratic debate. \u201cYou can go to OpenSecrets.org and check that. I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.\u201d\n\nWell, alright, Madam Secretary \u2014 we\u2019ll go to OpenSecrets and check that. Spoiler: Clinton is technically right, but there are some important caveats. Like super PACs. But we\u2019ll get to that.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at her campaign contributions. For what Clinton is trying to show, she\u2019ll want a numerator that includes how much she has received from the securities and investment industry plus the commercial banking industry \u2014 combined, that\u2019s what most people think of as \u201cWall Street,\u201d and in her case, it comes to just about $2.5 million. Her denominator should be her total amount of individual contributions from people who gave more than $200 plus her PAC receipts, which adds up to $63.4 million.\n\nWhat she should not do \u2014 but apparently did \u2014 is simply divide her contributions from the securities and investment industry by her campaign\u2019s total haul. For one thing, the total includes many contributions from donors of $200 or less \u2014 what are known as \u201cunitemized\u201d donors in the language of campaign finance because campaigns don\u2019t have to list their names, employers or anything else about them. That\u2019s $13 million in Clinton\u2019s case that could have come from any number of investment bankers or college professors, or farmers, mechanics and professional clowns, for that matter \u2014 we can\u2019t code what we don\u2019t know. In addition, the total raised can include loans, self-financing, party transfers and/or investment income. None of those are significant in Clinton\u2019s case, but they are for some other candidates.\n\nClinton appears to have used our data to arrive at the following (bad) equation: $2 million in itemized Wall Street contributions to her campaign, divided by $77.5 million in total receipts, equals less than three percent.\n\nCorrect equation? Let\u2019s try $2.5 million (securities and investment plus commercial banking) divided by $63.4 million (large individual donors plus PACs), which comes to 3.9 percent.\n\nSuper PACs blow up the math\n\nNow let\u2019s blow up those numbers, because Clinton\u2019s math is based on her campaign\u2019s receipts and don\u2019t include contributions to the super PAC supporting her (and nobody else but her).\n\nThe vast majority of candidates from both parties vying for the presidency are shored up in part by at least one super PAC, which can accept unlimited funds. Now, it\u2019s true that such groups can\u2019t legally coordinate expenditures with campaigns. Clinton can\u2019t direct how the main super PAC backing her, Priorities USA Action, uses the millions in donations it collects. In other words, it\u2019s not really her money to spend.\n\nBut Clinton\u2019s statement ignores how dominant super PACs have become in the campaign finance picture. And donors in the securities and investment and commercial banking industries have given the super PACs backing Clinton more than $3.5 million out of the $20.3 million they\u2019ve raised overall from individuals, unions and other entities \u2014 a healthy 17.2 percent. Virtually all of that $3.5 million came from the securities and investment industry rather than commercial banks, putting Wall Street at second place on Clinton\u2019s list of top industry donors to her super PACs.\n\nBottom line: Taking into account donations to both outside groups and the Clinton campaign itself, Wall Street has provided about 7.2 percent of the funds backing Clinton \u2014 more than double what she said on Saturday.\n\nThe competition\n\nStill, Wall Street is considerably more important to some of Clinton\u2019s rivals in terms of fundraising. The securities and investment industry places among the top three industry donors for three presidential candidates in terms of contributions to their campaigns alone. Jeb Bush has raised $1.9 million from the industry, Marco Rubio raised just over $514,000 and Fiorina raised just under $145,000.\n\nRight to Rise USA, the Jeb Bush-backing super PAC, raised $26.8 million from the securities and investment industry \u2014 about 26 percent of the group\u2019s\u2019 total. Super PACs backing other candidates don\u2019t come close to that total figure.\n\nBush\u2019s total of $33 million from Wall Street is 26 percent of his super PAC plus large individual and PAC donations to his campaign \u2014 compared to 7.2 percent for Clinton.\n\nSuper PACs \u2014 all of them \u2014 have raised more than $71 million from Wall Street donors, with almost $70 million of that coming from securities and investment, this cycle. That\u2019s nearly 23 percent of all super PAC contributions.\n\nOn Clinton\u2019s side of the aisle, Bernie Sanders disavows super PACs and has received $47,187 from the securities and investment industry.\n\nAs for Clinton\u2019s statement that she has more donations from students and teachers than from Wall Street, that came from Clinton\u2019s internal campaign data \u2014 again, information on small donors isn\u2019t made public so we don\u2019t know how many there are. The education industry \u2014 mostly university faculty and administrators \u2014 does have an affinity for Clinton, as we\u2019ve written previoiusly; it has given nearly $2 million to support her White House bid, almost all of which went to her campaign committee.\n\nWe generally don\u2019t lump students into the education industry, since education is not their source of income; in fact, they are usually dependents, in which case we include them in the industry in which his or her parent works. However, we went back and looked at how much of Clinton\u2019s total came from those who self-identified as \u201cstudents\u201d: $747,493. Those who said they were \u201cteachers\u201d have provided $518,495.\n\nSo, in short: Hillary Clinton, thank you for using OpenSecrets. Next time, just call us, maybe.\n\nUpdate, Dec. 21: In a statement to OpenSecrets Blog, Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin provided a list of contribution totals from donors with education occupations. \u201cWhen you look at the entirety of the donations to our campaign, an internal analysis shows that the comparison is about 3 percent or $2.3 million from people in finance and investment versus just over $3 million from students and teachers,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "OpenSecrets Blog", "description": "This post has been updated to include a statement from the Clinton campaign.\r\n\r\nNot\u00a0that you saw it or anything, but OpenSecrets.org got a pretty big shout-out over the weekend.
