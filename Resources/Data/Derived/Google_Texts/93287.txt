There are plenty of people who just wish all of those videos of Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber mouthing off about “the stupidity of the American voter” would just go away, and then there are some people who aren’t content just wishing: they’re literally making those videos go away, it seems.

American Commitment president Phil Kerpen has been amassing a collection of Gruber videos, but some have been taken down quite recently. Here’s one from the University of Rhode Island that’s coming up empty tonight.

What a coincidence that this KEEPS happening, huh? https://t.co/Uaiw5ojLPn pic.twitter.com/vyVxAPTWPB — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) November 18, 2014

@chrisrlloyd The exploiting one is from this speech. So I'm sure somebody has a full download. — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) November 18, 2014
