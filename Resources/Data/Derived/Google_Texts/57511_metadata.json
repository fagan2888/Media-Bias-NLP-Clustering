(Frank Pronesti, The Morning Call)\n\n\"I think Washington has taken too much away from the middle class,\" he continued. \"They take away your choice in everything from education to health care. They say that everybody has to have this health care.\"\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nStrouse called the Affordable Care Act a \"good first step.\" Some 7,400 residents of the 8th District have received health coverage because of the Obamacare, Strouse argued, citing a July 2014 report by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n\nFitzpatrick isn't buying that. \"I would say an equal number have lost their health care under the Affordable Care Act,\" the congressman insisted.\n\nNational Security and privacy\n\nFitzpatrick said he's voted against re-authorizing the Patriot Act because he's \"not convinced that enough is being done to protect our privacy.\" Numerous times he voted against extending provisions of counter-terrorism and surveillance programs born out of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n\"Some of these agencies are infringing on the privacy rights of American citizens,\" he said.\n\nStrouse said he worked with many intelligence officers at the CIA.\n\n\"I didn't meet a single one who joined because they wanted to spy on Americans,\" he said. The overreaction of Congress was the real fear at CIA, Strouse said. \"Because if we get attacked again, our legislators will overreact and take away our civil liberties,\" Strouse added.\n\nPolitics and political parties\n\nAsked about gerrymandering, Fitzpatrick and Strouse each pledged support for a non-partisan commission to redraw the political boundaries in Pennsylvania. Strouse said he believes voters registered as independent should be allowed to vote in primary elections.\n\nFitzpatrick talked about term limits and an end to government pension plans. The congressman also said he'd been consulted before the last congressional redistricting.\n\n\"When our district was being redrawn, I was being told by folks in Harrisburg, 'You know, if we take off the lower half of Bucks County and make it part of Philadelphia that would make it an easier seat for you to win,' \" Fitzpatrick said. \"My answer was no, absolutely no.\"\n\nMarijuana\n\nStrouse said he'd vote to legalize pot.\n\n\"I think the bigger problem we have now in this country is a criminal justice problem, and we're throwing way too many men, typically young poor men, into prison, for non-violent crimes, and that's where they learn to become violent criminals,\" Strouse said.\n\nFitzpatrick called legalizing pot \"an awful idea.\"\n\n\"It's a gateway drug to so many other drugs,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"It's going to increase use. It's going to increase the need for treatment facilities. We already have a drug problem in this country. This is only going to make it worse.\"\n\nGay marriage\n\nSame-sex unions are an issue for states to decide, Fitzpatrick said.\n\nFor Strouse, gay marriage is a no-brainer. \"We need to move forward in history,\" he said. \"Let them get married.\"\n\nEbola\n\nFitzpatrick said he wants a travel ban on West African nations where the Ebola virus is active. \"This is a virus that needs to be contained and destroyed where it is,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"To permit unrestricted travel \u2026 is dangerous.\"\n\nStrouse accused Fitzpatrick of playing politics with the disease. \"A travel ban is sticking our heads in the sand,\" he said. \"We need calm rational leadership on Ebola. If you're worried about getting sick this winter, get your flu shot.\"\n\nMoney and supporters\n\nFitzpatrick raised $2.89 million in the run up to the election, campaign finance records show. Nearly half of that money came from political action committees.\n\nAn analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics showed top campaign contributions to Fitzpatrick from Comcast Corp. ($18,500), the Newtown engineering firm Teletronics Technology ($14,500), McCaffery Auto Group ($12,600) and numerous law firms.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, Fitzpatrick had $2.2 million cash on hand, according the Federal Election Commission.\n\nStrouse's war chest pales in comparison. He reported $1.3 million in campaign donations, with about 15 percent coming from PACs.\n\nTop contributors to Strouse's campaign include representatives from the investment brokers Turner Investments ($11,550), Energy Capital Partners ($10,400) and Jane Street Capital ($9,300).\n\nNearly all of that money is gone, however. As of Sept. 30, the Democrat reported just $174,000 in the bank.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Fitzpatrick, Strouse spar on abortion, Ebola, other issues", "Description": "PA 8th District congressional debate pits Republican incumbent Mike Fitzpatrick against Democratic challenger Kevin Strouse", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Call", "author": "The Morning Call", "og": {"site_name": "themorningcall.com", "description": "Viewpoints on abortion, the Ebola virus , marijuana and health care \u2014 and nearly $2 million in campaign cash \u2014 now divide Bucks County Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick and Kevin Strouse, his Democratic challenger for the 8th Congressional District seat.", "title": "Fitzpatrick, Strouse spar on abortion, Ebola, other issues", "url": "http://www.mcall.com/news/local/mc-8th-congressional-debate-20141026-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-544e3804/turbine/mc-8th-congressional-debate-20141026", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp05.14", "twitter": {"site": "@mcall", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=501096172, app-argument=http://www.mcall.com/deeplinkid/81790483", "fb": {"admins": 1762506491, "page_id": 73291032902, "app_id": 377275452340817}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-10-26", "y_key": "7164478e9f100cbd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce080\"", "article_summary": "8th Congressional District Debate Contributed Photo, THE MORNING CALL U.S. Rep.
