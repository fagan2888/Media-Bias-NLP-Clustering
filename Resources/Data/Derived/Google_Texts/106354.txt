Bank scammers are making the rounds in Southwest Florida, this time through email.

Englewood resident David Best spotted the scam right away, but hopes others don't fall for it.

Six days a week, Best's work routine as a painter is the same.

"This is my job, this is my livelihood. It's the only thing I do, only thing I do pay my bills and put food on the table," he said.

And it's the only thing that keeps money flowing into his bank account, especially this time of year.

He wasn't in the best mood Sunday morning when he checked his email and found he was the target of an online banking scam, scammers posing at SunTrust Bank employees. They ask for account info in hopes of getting your money.

"I work hard for every penny I get and for something like that, it'd really out a damper on life," Best said.

He said he was wary of something like this.

"I was also watching the news and y'all were also talking about the Suncoast Credit Union and a lot of scams going on with them," he explained.

His neighbors were just as disappointed.

"Especially this time of year when everyone is trying to have an enjoyable Christmas season. It's kinda sad that there's still people out there that'll try and take something from you," Bob Cannon said.

Best said this scammer posing as SunTrust Bank wasn't hard to spot.

"I saw the erroneous email address and then I saw that misspelled word," and it was an immediate red flag.

"Just one of those words you can just look at and if it's spelled wrong, it's wrong," he said.
