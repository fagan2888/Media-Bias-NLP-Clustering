In a rare appearance at the Defense Department, the president said the U.S.\u2013led military coalition is hitting ISIS \"harder than ever\" and moving forward with its strategy with \"a great sense of urgency.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Offering U.S. Apache Attack Helicopters to Iraq Is a Big Deal\n\n\"As we squeeze its heart we\u2019ll make it harder for ISIL to sell its propaganda to the world,\" he said following a meeting at the Pentagon with his national security council, using an alternative name for the terror group.\n\n\"ISIL leaders cannot hide and our message to them is 'you are next,'\u201d Obama later added.\n\nWhile Obama\u2019s remarks were stronger, they contained no new initiatives or steps to defeat ISIS, serving more as an update of the policies he already has in place.\n\nAs a result, Obama is almost certain to unleash a new torrent of criticism from Republican lawmakers and presidential hopefuls and make fellow Democrats nervous that he\u2019s not doing enough to eliminate the jihadist group. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) released a statement even before Obama took the podium titled, \u201cThe President Goes to the Pentagon. Will Anything Change?\" More of those types of questions are bound to follow.\n\nRelated: ISIS, ISIL, Daesh, Islamic State \u2014 Why the Terror Group Has So Many Names\n\nThe president touted the nearly 9,000 airstrikes the Western coalition has carried out against ISIS forces and said that U.S.-led forces dropped more ordnance on the group last month than any other time since the campaign began last year.\n\n\"In fact, since the summer, ISIL has not had a successful major offensive operation on the ground in Iraq or Syria,\u201d he said, noting extremists have lost 40 percent of the territory they once controlled in Iraq.\n\nBut the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, have brought national security concerns to the top of Americans\u2019 minds, forcing Obama to try to convince the public once again that he has the right plan for destroying Islamic extremists. Americans now name terrorism as the most important problem facing the country, according to a new poll. Sixteen percent put terrorism on the top of their list in a Gallup poll released Monday, compared to 13 percent who said government and 9 percent who said the economy were major problems.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that progress needs to happen faster,\u201d Obama said Monday.\n\nRelated: Trump Rises on a Perfect Storm of Public Fear\n\nTo that end, he announced that Defense Secretary Ash Carter would leave immediately for the Middle East to try to wring more military contributions from partners in the region. The tour coincides with a trip Secretary of State John Kerry will make to Moscow to discuss the security situation in Syria.\n\nIf Obama\u2019s latest attempt to allay the country\u2019s fears about terrorism doesn\u2019t work better than his last speech \u2014 if he\u2019s unable to mitigate the doubts surrounding his strategy \u2014 he could also boost the number of special forces operators deployed to the region or take a sharper tone with coalition allies. Or he could face more pressure to do something drastic, such as deploying ground troops to Iraq, a move he has ruled out in the past.\n\nEach option carries an inherent risk for the country and the troops involved, but if the polls keep indicating that anxiety levels about terrorism remain as high as it has the past few weeks, Obama faces another risk himself: being viewed as an ineffectual lame duck and becoming a brick around the neck of Democrats in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As national security fears roil the United States, President Obama once again tried to convince the American public that he has the right plan for destroying Islamic extremists.", "title": "Obama\u2019s New Speech on Destroying ISIS Is Long on Promises, Short on Strategy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/14/Obama-s-New-Speech-Destroying-ISIS-Long-Promises-Short-Strategy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12142015_Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/14/Obama-s-New-Speech-Destroying-ISIS-Long-Promises-Short-Strategy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12142015_Obama.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "As national security fears roil the United States, President Obama once again tried to convince the American public that he has the right plan for destroying Islamic extremists.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "President Obama spoke more forcefully about ISIS Monday than he did in his primetime address from the Oval Office last week.\n\"ISIL leaders cannot hide and our message to them is 'you are next,'\u201d Obama later added.\nWhile Obama\u2019s remarks were stronger, they contained no new initiatives or steps to defeat ISIS, serving more as an update of the policies he already has in place.\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) released a statement even before Obama took the podium titled, \u201cThe President Goes to the Pentagon.\nThe tour coincides with a trip Secretary of State John Kerry will make to Moscow to discuss the security situation in Syria."}
