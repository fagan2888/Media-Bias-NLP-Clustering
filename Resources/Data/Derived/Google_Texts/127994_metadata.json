In implementing programs in non-permissive environments, of course the government has taken steps to be discreet.\"\n\nThe revelation is likely to keep House and Senate committees busy with hearings on such government activities as it continues to investigate the National Security Agency's data and record collection and spying activities.\n\nLawmakers will also likely want to know how the Cuban Twitter effort may or may not have played into the arrest of Alan Gross, a USAID contractor arrested in 2010 in Cuba for \"actions against the integrity of the state\" and who was sentenced to 15 years in a Cuba prison. The news accounts claim the Twitter operation was launched just a few months after Gross' arrest.\n\nThe Twitter debacle is just the latest misstep for the USAID agency. One recent black mark for the organization was a GAO report citing the group had misspent $74 million.\n\nOne news report reveals that prior to the Twitter effort the U.S. has supported a radio-TV service to drive pro-democracy messages at Cuban dissidents. While Cuba's Twitter has been silenced, that effort is reportedly still active.\n\n\u00a9 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.
