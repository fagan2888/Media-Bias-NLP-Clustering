Borzi, assistant secretary of labor for the Department of Labor, said the Department of Health and Human Service's rule that was proposed in September is a \u201ctrap for the unwary\u201d because employers sponsoring self-funded plans may be operating under a false assumption that it won't apply to them .\n\nUnder the proposed rule, individuals can't be denied health care or health coverage based on their sex, including their gender identity. The rule would apply to insurance exchanges, any health program that the HHS itself administers and any health program or activity that receives funding from the HHS. The proposed rule would extend the protections of Section 1557, a civil rights provision of the Affordable Care Act, to women as well as people with disabilities, and others, HHS said.\n\nSusan M. Nash, a partner in McDermott Will and Emery LLP's Chicago office, told Bloomberg BNA March 2 that Borzi's interpretation is correct, but isn't readily visible in the rule.\n\n\u201cIf you look carefully at the rule, she is right. The way it\u2019s drafted, it does indicate that even if a plan was being self-insured and being administered by a third-party administrator that was receiving federal financial assistance, that particular plan would be subject to the rule. It\u2019s buried in a footnote in the middle of the proposed rules,\u201d Nash said.\n\nBecause most employer-sponsored plans are administered by TPAs and many of those TPAs are also insurance companies that receive federal funds, it's likely that many more plans will be subject to this rule than were initially thought to be, Nash said.\n\nGreta E. Cowart, a shareholder with Winstead PC in Dallas, agreed that self-funded plans should pay attention to Borzi's comments, telling Bloomberg BNA on March 2, \u201cI would take it as a practical tip from Phyllis, but I would bet it\u2019s an informed tip.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government has indicated that they believe the proposed rules reach further than maybe what many practitioners had thought,\u201d Cowart said.\n\nEmployer Groups Concerned\n\nWhile it's understandable that employers looked at the proposed rule, Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities (RIN 0945\u2013AA02), and thought it didn't apply to them, they need to look closer, Gretchen K. Young, senior vice president of health policy at the ERISA Industry Committee, told Bloomberg BNA on March 3.\n\n\u201cIf you read the rule closely, you discover that they didn\u2019t say that employer group health plans are affected, in fact they imply very strongly that this rule doesn\u2019t reach those, but what they do reach is the TPA,\u201d she said.\n\nThe rules say that if a TPA receives federal money, including subsidies obtained by insurers operating on the federal health insurance marketplace, then the TPA has to comply with the rules, Young said. The way HHS structured the rules, TPAs have to apply the rules to anyone they administer benefits for, she said.\n\n\u201cFor instance if my large employer has a TPA, and just about all self-funded plans do, then that TPA gets federal money if it\u2019s on the exchanges. Then all of my people are brought under this rule,\u201d Young said. She added that it doesn't make sense to apply the rule to plans that TPAs administer benefits for because those self-funded plans don't receive federal funds.\n\nThe rule is \u201cdeceptive\u201d and appears to be a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d of how health plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act work, Young said.\n\nERIC submitted comments on the rule back in November, along with the American Benefits Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nWhile there isn't a specific timeline for the release of the final rule, Young and Cowart said with the Obama administration wrapping up, it's a good bet the final rules will be out this year.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kristen Ricaurte Knebel in Washington at kknebel@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jo-el J.
