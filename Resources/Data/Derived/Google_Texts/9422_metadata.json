Daily Breeze News\n\nVeronica Valdez is suing Torrance Memorial Hospital in southern California after anesthesiologist Dr. Patrick Yang decorated her face with a mustache and teardrops while she was unconscious and allowed a nursing attendant to snap a photo. The hospital is now at the center of a growing debate about patients\u2019 rights and the use of mobile devices in the operating room.\n\n\u201cI felt violated. I was in shock,\u201d Valdez said in court documents.\n\nAccording to the Daily Breeze, 36-year-old Valdez worked at the hospital for 13 years before going in for a minor surgery on her finger in Oct. 2011. Yang admittedly cut out and colored the stickers, and then placed them on Valdez\u2019s face. Yang was suspended for two weeks for his actions. The nursing attendant who snapped the photo, Patricia Gomez, was also suspended for a brief period. Both kept their jobs and remain in good standing at the hospital.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a joke in the operating room. For them to play a joke is cruel in my opinion,\u201d attorney Andrew Ryan said. \u201cI have not seen anything like this. It\u2019s an incredible breach of privacy, of HIPAA, of common decency, of the Hippocratic Oath.\u201d\n\nTorrance Memorial intends to fight the suit and even requested a dismissal. Since the incident, the hospital conducted behavioral training for the operating room staff and \u201cstrengthened its policy on patient privacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the allegations stated in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint are factually inaccurate, grossly exaggerated or fabricated,\u201d the hospital said in a statement. \u201cThe patient and her attorney reported the incident to multiple authorities who conducted investigations. No criminal charges were filed or citations given.\"\n\n\"In addition, the medical center reported the situation to the Joint Commission and the American Nurses Credentialing Center, both of which investigated and closed the incident with no findings,\" the hospital concluded.\n\nValdez\u2019s suit is scheduled for trial in January.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "veronica valdez, torrance memorial hospital, mustache", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Veronica Valdez said she \"felt violated\" after a photo surfaced of her face decorated with a paper mustache while she was unconscious in the operating room.", "title": "Patient Sues Hospital For Decorating Her Face With Mustache During Surgery", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/patient-veronica-valdez-sues-torrance-memorial-hospital-decorating-her-face-mustache-during-surgery", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/veronica-valdez.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Veronica Valdez said she \"felt violated\" after a photo surfaced of her face decorated with a paper mustache while she was unconscious in the operating room.", "title": "Patient Sues Hospital For Decorating Her Face With Mustache During Surgery", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/patient-veronica-valdez-sues-torrance-memorial-hospital-decorating-her-face-mustache-during-surgery", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/veronica-valdez.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/veronica-valdez.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-10T11:19:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-10T11:19:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Veronica Valdez said she \"felt violated\" after a photo surfaced of her face decorated with a paper mustache while she was unconscious in the operating room."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b66\"", "article_summary": "Veronica Valdez said she \"felt violated\" after a photo surfaced of her face decorated with a paper mustache while she was unconscious in the operating room.\nThe hospital is now at the center of a growing debate about patients\u2019 rights and the use of mobile devices in the operating room.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a joke in the operating room.\nDaily Breeze NewsVeronica Valdez is suing Torrance Memorial Hospital in southern California after anesthesiologist Dr. Patrick Yang decorated her face with a mustache and teardrops while she was unconscious and allowed a nursing attendant to snap a photo.\nAccording to the Daily Breeze, 36-year-old Valdez worked at the hospital for 13 years before going in for a minor surgery on her finger in Oct. 2011."}
