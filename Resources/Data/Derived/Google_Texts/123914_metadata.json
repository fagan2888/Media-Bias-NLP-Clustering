Malone of of SS. Columba-Brigid Church said he spent \u201ca good deal of time Monday afternoon fielding phone calls from around the world, from callers protesting the contents of the sign,\u201d a spokesman for the diocese told the Buffalo News.\n\nAfter becoming aware of the sign, the bishop said he took \u201cimmediate action to have it removed\u201d from the church lawn.\n\nThe priest who put it there, however, said he wasn\u2019t trying to cause a stir.\n\n\u201cThe pastor of SS Columba\u2013Brigid Church told me that the \u20182 Dads\u2019 were meant to refer to a child who has both a father and stepfather,\u201d Bishop Malone said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThere are several children in his parish who have both a father and stepfather. However, given the potential for the meaning of this message to be misunderstood and even perceived in a heretical way, it was immediately removed,\u201d the bishop added.\n\nThe pastor, 73-year-old Rev. Roy Herberger, said the sign was not intended to endorse gay marriage or same-sex parenting, but was just one of nearly a dozen slogans he stumbled upon while scouring the web.\n\n\u201cI just Googled \u2018funny church signs,\u2019\u201d he told the Buffalo News.\n\n\u201cI only had one purpose,\u201d Rev. Herberger explained to Yahoo Parenting. \u201cAfter 48 years in the church, I see so many kids with stepparents, or even in single-family homes or being raised by grandparents, who feel that they\u2019re not as good as other kids who have a nuclear mother-and-father family. I\u2019ve seen what that does sometimes when they\u2019re comparing themselves to that nuclear family and I wanted to say, \u2018Hang in there. You\u2019re good. Things will work out for you.\u2019 I wanted to provide support and understanding for kids in that situation.\u201d\n\nThe sign has since been changed to read \u201cWalmart Isn\u2019t the Only Saving Place,\u201d but not before first drawing fire from Catholics who called the original message blasphemous and an insult to the religion.\n\n\u201cWith respect, it seems hard to imagine anyone in our time not being aware of what the \u20182 dads\u2019 term can imply, especially since the pro-homosexual book \u2018Heather Has 2 Mommies\u2019 has been around since 1989,\u201d wrote John Vennari, an editor for Catholic Family News who alerted the diocese to the sign\u2019s original message earlier this week.\n\n\u201cObviously, I\u2019ll be much more careful\u201d about selecting future signage, Rev. Herberger told a local radio station.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A sign was taken down from outside of a church in western New York this week after its message, \"Jesus had 2 dads and he turned out just fine,\" prompted the Catholic Diocese of Buffalo to receive angry phone calls from across the globe.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A sign was taken down from outside of a church in western New York this week after its message, \u201cJesus had 2 dads and he turned out just fine,\u201d prompted the Catholic Diocese of Buffalo to receive angry phone calls from across the globe.", "title": "\u2018Jesus had 2 dads\u2019 church sign causes international stir among Catholics", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/13/jesus-had-2-dads-church-sign-causes-international-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/23/6f58b696d301db2a820f6a7067002434.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/23/6f58b696d301db2a820f6a7067002434.jpg", "description": "A sign was taken down from outside of a church in western New York this week after its message, \"Jesus had 2 dads and he turned out just fine,\" prompted the Catholic Diocese of Buffalo to receive angr", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Jesus had 2 dads\u2019 church sign causes international stir a"}, "Author": "Andrew Blake", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe pastor of SS Columba\u2013Brigid Church told me that the \u20182 Dads\u2019 were meant to refer to a child who has both a father and stepfather,\u201d Bishop Malone said in a statement.\nAfter becoming aware of the sign, the bishop said he took \u201cimmediate action to have it removed\u201d from the church lawn.\nHerberger told a local radio station.\nColumba-Brigid Church said he spent \u201ca good deal of time Monday afternoon fielding phone calls from around the world, from callers protesting the contents of the sign,\u201d a spokesman for the diocese told the Buffalo News.\nA sign was taken down from outside of a church in western New York this week after its message \u2014 \u201cJesus had 2 dads and he turned out just fine\u201d \u2014 prompted worldwide backlash against the Catholic Diocese of Buffalo."}
