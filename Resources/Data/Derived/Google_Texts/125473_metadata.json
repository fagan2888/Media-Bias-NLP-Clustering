Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has long prided himself as being the left\u2019s gadfly.\n\n\u201cWhen you become chairman, you can\u2019t just say, \u2018This is the way I want it.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\n\nSanders, who\u2019s officially a political independent but votes with Democrats in the Senate, has spent far more of his career agitating from the sidelines than sitting at the negotiating table: lobbying for universal single-payer health care, blasting both parties for allowing billionaires to fund elections, and attacking President Obama for compromising on taxes with Republicans.\n\nA co-founder of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, he prides himself on never forsaking his values and always speaking his mind\u2014once for more than eight hours in a single stretch on the Senate floor.\n\nBut Sanders \u2013 who is almost universally known as \u201cBernie\u201d \u2013 has found himself on the inside more often these days.\n\nThe bipartisan compromise that Sanders forged with Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, came together with unusual speed, passing the Senate Wednesday after sailing through the House a day earlier. The scandal over wait times for veterans at VA medical facilities made made action a political imperative for Congress. But Sanders says he\u2019s known he had to shift gears and become more open to compromise ever since he became chairman of the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee in 2013.\n\n\u201cWhen you become chairman, you can\u2019t just say, \u2018This is the way I want it,\u2019\u201d Sanders told msnbc.\n\nIt was Sanders\u2019 first time working together with McCain, in a role that he\u2019s rarely played before in his 23 years in Congress. As it turns out, he liked it.\n\n\u201cWhat I like about [McCain] is that he\u2019s a no bullshit guy. He\u2019s straightforward and he wanted to do something,\u201d says Sanders. \u201cI like that style of sitting down and saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to have to give, you\u2019re going to have to give.\u2019\u201d\n\nSanders hasn\u2019t always been as willing to make such concessions, says Alex Nicholson, legislative director for the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, an advocacy group.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also, I think, had to push him to go outside his comfort zone in working with the minority. That\u2019s definitely been a challenge,\u201d Nicholson said. (Sanders says he \u201cdoesn\u2019t recall talking about the negotiations with IAVA, which played no role in the agreement between Sens. Sanders and McCain,\u201d according to his spokesman Michael Briggs.)\n\nThough his group endorsed the bill at the time, Nicholson also faults the Vermont Senator for not doing more to work with Republicans on the earlier VA reform overhaul, which failed to pass in February after only two Republicans supported it.\n\nSanders says he\u2019s still deeply disappointed that his original veterans\u2019 reform overhaul failed to gain traction in the Senate. But he did make genuine concessions to Republicans in the compromise that passed Wednesday, including provisions he had criticized earlier that would allow veterans who lived more than 40 miles from VA facilities to seek private, non-VA alternatives.\n\nIt\u2019s been a shift in tone as much as action for Sanders, the 72-year-old former Burlington mayor who became a member of the House in 1991 and the Senate in 2007. And for most of his political career, he\u2019s been better known for exhorting Congress to act than taking action.\n\n\u201cHe may have mellowed a bit as he\u2019s gotten older.\u201d ermont political scientist Eric Davis\n\nRising to protest President Obama\u2019s tax compromise with Republicans in late 2010, Sanders launched into an epic speech on the Senate floor that took off on social media as the \u201cfilibernie.\u201d It wasn\u2019t so much a set of remarks as a great lamentation against what he described as \u201ca war being waged by some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country against the working families of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can I get by on one house?\u201d Sanders continued sarcastically. \u201cI need five houses, ten houses! I need three jet planes to take me all over the world! Sorry, American people. We\u2019ve got the money, we\u2019ve got the power, we\u2019ve got the lobbyists here and on Wall Street. Tough luck. That\u2019s the world, get used to it. Rich get richer. Middle-class shrinks.\u201d\n\nCompromise is easier, of course, when it comes to issues like veterans\u2019 affairs, which have a long history of non-ideological bipartisanship. But in more recent years, Sanders has extracted a few genuine progressive victories, going beyond the purely symbolic amendments and dead-end bills that he\u2019s accumulated over his career.\n\n\u201cPassing legislation has become more important for him,\u201d says Vermont political scientist Eric Davis. \u201cHe may have mellowed a bit as he\u2019s gotten older.\u201d\n\nDuring the fight over Obamacare, Sanders worked to include provisions to enable his home state to adopt single-payer health care, which it has now begun implementing under Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin.\n\n\u201cSenator Sanders was instrumental in ensuring the waiver provision that was finalized in the [Affordable Care Act],\u201d says Robin Lunge, the state\u2019s director of health care. \u201cWithout that provision, it quite likely would have been pretty difficult for Vermont to do that,\u201d she adds.\n\nIn fact, the issue is at the heart of Sanders\u2019s vision of socialism. \u201cWhat it means is that we have a lot to learn from democratic socialist governments that have existed in countries like Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, where all people have health care as a right,\u201d he told Fox News.\n\nSanders was also an early, vocal opponent to Chained Consumer Price Index (CPI), which would reduce Social Security benefits by tying them to a different index of inflation. The White House had originally embraced the provision when both parties were bent on achieving a deficit reduction \u201cgrand bargain.\u201d Calling such reforms \u201cmorally grotesque,\u201d Sanders led protests against entitlement cuts, giving one speech while a security officer shooed activists off the steps behind him.\n\nSanders lobbied inside Capitol Hill as well, banding together with like-minded liberals like Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Sherrod Brown of Ohio to oppose the entitlement cuts.\n\n\u201cHe has led the opposition to the use of so-called chained CPI as part of any budget deal from the beginning and has kept up the drum beat since then,\u201d says Jim Manley, a former spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nThen in February, President Obama took chained CPI out of his proposed budget. It was already clear at that point that a sweeping deficit-reduction deal on taxes and entitlements was kaput\u2014making Obama\u2019s concession a moot point\u2014 but Sanders and his cohort declared victory anyway.\n\n\u201cWe put together a strong coalition,\u201d Sanders says. Now the debate within the Democratic Party \u201cis not about cutting Social Security, but about expanding Social Security,\u201d he adds.\n\nSanders certainly has more company these days. In a more polarized Senate, he\u2019s now joined by unapologetic liberals like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who in many ways has eclipsed Sanders as the left\u2019s progressive hero when Democrats turned her own populist crusade into reality. Thomas Piketty\u2019s tome on inequality is now an Amazon bestseller. And with Congress gridlocked, the Democratic Party has felt freer to embrace the ideals of economic populism more fully \u2013 precisely because Congress isn\u2019t anywhere close to making most of it a legislative reality.\n\nBut Sanders says his views were never on the fringe. \u201cVirtually all ideas I bring forth\u2014the ideas may not be supported today in Congress, but they are supported by the American people,\u201d he says.\n\nHis righteous convictions have also led him to contemplate a run in for president in 2016. \u201cThe working class and middle class need candidates to work for them. Within that context, I am giving consideration to running,\u201d he says. Unlike Warren, he\u2019s vocal about his desire to run\u2014and about Hillary Clinton\u2019s shortcomings.\n\nThe more pressing question is whether Sanders can continue to be an effective policymaker without a crisis forcing Congress to act \u2013 or whether there will be just more replays of February\u2019s failed overhaul. \u201cWe have other stuff to get to,\u201d explains Nicholson from the veterans\u2019 advocacy group. \u201cOur big issue is suicide prevention.\u201d\n\nSanders insists that he\u2019s game for future compromises.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what the American people want\u2014they want people of good faith to come together, and McCain was operating in good faith,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope this becomes an example.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Bernie Sanders has long prided himself on being a liberal gadfly and outsider.
