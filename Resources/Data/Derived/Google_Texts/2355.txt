'Love & Hip Hop: NY' Star Tahiry Jose I Got $31k In Medical Bills Now Pay For My Epidural!

"Love & Hip Hop: NY" star Tahiry Jose says the brutal attack by a man backstage at a 2014 NYC fashion show left her $31k in the hole from medical bills and she's suing to get it back.

Tahiry just filed new legal docs in her suit against Carlos Fiasco, the man who copped a plea deal and got off with no jail time, and the fashion show and theater where the assault took place.

In the docs, she lists off her injuries from the assault -- cervical sprain, several disc injuries, wrist derangement, concussion and post-traumatic headaches. She says the pain got so bad she needed an epidural.

Tahiry says she had to drop $8k just for a neurologist and $5.5k for rehab. She's suing for her total medical bill -- the $31k -- plus damages for suffering and loss of enjoyment of life.
