Paul LePage\n\nPORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Chris Christie\u2019s out to prove he\u2019s the bluntest and most straightforward candidate running for president. So it was only natural that the first major endorsement of his bid for the Republican nomination came from the only governor with a brasher and more plainspoken reputation: Maine\u2019s Paul LePage.\n\nAt a last-minute event organized by Christie\u2019s camp during a weeklong swing through of New Hampshire, LePage became the nation\u2019s first sitting Republican governor to endorse a candidate for president. For Christie, who crossed the state border to get LePage\u2019s imprimatur, it was a slight diversion from his laser focus on the Granite State. But it was a chance to reinforce Christie\u2019s overarching message: that he\u2019s a truth-teller in a field of smooth talkers.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cLots of people may try to play the game of deciding to watch for awhile and see which way things go. That\u2019s not Paul,\u201d Christie said, as rain pelted an outdoor patio at Becky\u2019s Diner here. \u201cWhen I called him this weekend and told him that I was going to get into the race this week. He said, \u2018all right, well, I\u2019m with you, so let\u2019s go.\u2019 That\u2019s a good friend and that\u2019s a strong leader.\u201d\n\nThe endorsement was Christie\u2019s first political return on the connections he made while running the Republican Governors Association last year. Christie repeatedly traveled to Maine to help LePage win a three-way reelection battle \u2014 at a time when LePage was similarly considered an underdog.\n\n\u201cWhen all of your and your colleagues around the country had me as a dead-walking governor, Chris Christie had faith. He believed in us, came up, supported me whole-heartedly, never batted an eye,\u201d LePage said.\n\nReferring to another successful long-shot Republican gubernatorial candidate whom Christie backed in 2014, LePage added: \u201cHe is the first person in America to recognize that Larry Hogan in Maryland was the real deal.\u201d\n\nThe LePage endorsement comes from a polarizing politician who, like Christie, has battled with his state Legislature and is mired in his own political controversy. While Christie is still attempting to shake off the yoke of the Bridgegate scandal in New Jersey, LePage was accused last week by state House Speaker Mark Eves of threatening to withhold state funds from a charter school unless the school reconsidered its decision to hire Eves as its president.\n\nAsked about the conflict, Christie tried to fit it into the theme of his campaign. \u201cI support the governor\u2019s stand that he\u2019s taken on this. Controversies come and go. Leadership is what stands strong and firm,\u201d he said.\n\nLePage refused to criticize Christie for accepting Obamacare\u2019s huge Medicaid expansion, a program LePage has derided as \u201cwelfare expansion\u201d and that he repeatedly vetoed when the Maine Legislature sent it to his desk. Asked about their differences, LePage said it was simply a matter of states with different health care systems making independent decisions that were right for them.\n\nThe pair, alongside their wives, described a deep friendship built in the 2014 trenches and based on an admiration for each other\u2019s plainspoken nature.\n\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019m overly blunt. I don\u2019t like to mince words. I like to get things done,\u201d LePage said. Then the punchline: \u201cThat\u2019s the only difference between Chris Christie and I \u2014 he\u2019s a little shy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "LePage is the nation\u2019s first sitting Republican governor to endorse a candidate for president.", "title": "Chris Christie wins an endorsement: Maine Gov.
