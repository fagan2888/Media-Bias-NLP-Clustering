Back then UNH, in a desperate move to attract fans, offered students a t-shirt, dinner at a restaurant in downtown Durham and one ticket for about $10. Sales were brisk. Problem was, very few students attended the games...Instead, students would pay their money, collect their t-shirt, eat and then go somewhere other than Lundholm Gym, figuring the shirt and the food was worth the 10 bucks.That pretty much sums up the relationship between UNH men\u2019s basketball and its lukewarm fan base for much of the program\u2019s existence. The Wildcats have rarely won, so the fans have rarely cared...\u201cYou look at all the sports here at UNH and there\u2019s been a lot of success,\u201d UNH coach Bill Herrion said. \u201cThe anchor holding things back was us (men\u2019s basketball). If you pick up a media guide and go through the history there just has not been a lot of success here, for whatever reason.\u201d..The Wildcats finished below the .500-mark in each of Herrion\u2019s first nine seasons as the program\u2019s head coach. This season, Herrion\u2019s 10th, produced a new breed of \u2019Cat, however. The kind that has rarely been seen in Durham...A buzz was created when UNH won its last seven home games, including an America East quarterfinal matchup with Hartford.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how quickly it kind of caught fire,\u201d Herrion said. \u201cThe excitement was off the charts (for the tournament game against Hartford). I remember when I was (the head coach) at Drexel, we played a big game here in \u201995 and the place was packed to the rafters. When I took over, I remember thinking if we could ever get it to that level we\u2019d really have something.\u201d..UNH (19-12) is guaranteed of posting its first winning season since 1994-95, and the Wildcats were rewarded with an invitation to the CollegeInsiders.com Postseason Tournament. UNH will face the New Jersey Institute of Technology tonight in Newark, N.J. You may recall that NJIT (18-11) made headlines by beating Michigan, 72-70, on the road earlier this season...A victory against NJIT would give this UNH team the school record for victories in a season.\u201cThey haven\u2019t been to a postseason tournament (outside the conference) in the history of the school \u2014 and they\u2019ve been playing here 112 years,\u201d Herrion said. \u201cTo be the first team to represent UNH in postseason play is pretty special.\u201d..Perhaps the best news for UNH and its expanding support group is this: The Wildcats have a chance to be even better next season. Eleven of the 13 players on this year\u2019s roster are eligible to return, and that includes the team\u2019s top three scorers...One of those eligible returnees is forward Tanner Leissner, who is averaging 12.8 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. Leissner became the first UNH player to be named Rookie of the Year since former Alvirne High School standout Pat Manor in 1989-90, when America East was known as the North Atlantic Conference...\u201cHopefully we can carry this over to next year, because we do have a lot of young guys coming back and we have a chance to be very good next year,\u201d Herrion said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve created some interest in this program. The last week or two I\u2019ve gotten more emails, more phone calls and more texts than I have gotten in my previous 9\u00bd years here combined...\u201cThere was some doubt: Could we do it here? This year has kind of proven that yes, we can get it done here. I don\u2019t think this year is a one-year flash in the pan like, \u2018Oh, they struck gold.\u2019 I think we have enough good young players returning the next two, three years \u2014 we\u2019re going to be even better. It\u2019s already helped recruiting. The exposure, going to a postseason tournament \u2014 that helps recruiting.\u201d..Herrion, who has New England roots, certainly didn\u2019t think it would take this long to create interest in the program when, after a month on the job, he left his assistant coaching position at the University of Arkansas to take over in Durham. You can credit UNH coach Sean McDonnell \u2014 whose son Tommy is one of the two seniors on this year\u2019s team \u2014 for bringing Herrion and UNH athletic director Marty Scarano together...Herrion and McDonnell met when both were assistant coaches at Boston University, and when the UNH job opened up it was McDonnell who called Herrion and asked him if he would speak with Scarano.What was Scarano\u2019s pitch?..\u201cHis pitch was: \u201cWe want New Hampshire basketball to be relevant,\u201d Herrion said. \u201cWe want to be good. We want to win.\u201dA return to New England plus the lure of being a Division I head coach again led Herrion to accept Scarano\u2019s offer. Truth be told, Herrion\u2019s decision may have had something to do with his wife\u2019s desire to avoid Arkansas as well...So, how did UNH finally turn the corner? Part of the explanation is Herrion\u2019s decision to switch to a more fan-friendly offense (UNH led the league in average points per game this season). Faced with the reality that UNH was having a hard time winning recruiting battles for players from New England, Herrion also decided to mine for talent in Texas. Leissner is one of six players on this year\u2019s roster from the Lone Star State...\u201cIt\u2019s such a big state, and the kids will leave,\u201d Herrion explained. \u201cWe sold the opportunity to play right away, help us turn this around and help us win.\u201cWhen you win and you\u2019re good, they\u2019ll come.\u201dYes they will. So you can expect larger crowds at Lundholm Gymnasium next season. When you go, just know that dinner won\u2019t be included in the price of admission...rbrown@unionleader.com..", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Wildcats finished below the .500-mark in each of coach Bill Herrion's first nine seasons as the program's head coach.
