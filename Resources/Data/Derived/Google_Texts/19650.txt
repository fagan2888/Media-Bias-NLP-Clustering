Webster, SD

A Webster man accused of rape has been sentenced to 25 years in prison.



Forty-two-year-old Jamie Campbell pleaded no contest to one count of felony rape on April 24. He was sentenced last month.



The charges stem from incidents involving a 9-year-old girl from April 7, 2014 to June 26, 2014.



He was initially faced two felony rape charges in addition to charges of sexual contact, sexual exploitation and indecent exposure.



Ten years of Campbell's sentence have been suspended and he's been given credit for time served in jail.



He's ordered to pay about $4,800 in restitution.
