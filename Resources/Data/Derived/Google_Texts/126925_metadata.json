Reagan bombed Libya \u2014 he scared our enemies. Now we\u2019ve got a president that\u2019s scared to scare our enemies,\u201d said Jodeit, 49.\n\nIn week two of the Cruz presidential campaign, the 44-year-old Texas senator drew enthusiastic crowds of conservative activists across Iowa, which hosts the first 2016 nominating contest. They laughed and cheered at all the right spots \u2014 the call to padlock the IRS and send all those agents to patrol the Mexican border, the vow to repeal Obamacare.\n\nThey nodded as he painted himself as a latter-day Reagan, a favorite trope that reflects the most pragmatic of challenges: Cruz may be a darling of tea partiers and evangelicals, but he will need support from a whole lot of others to win the GOP nomination, let alone the presidency.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of folks from Washington who say, \u2018Gosh, the way to win is we rush toward the mushy middle,\u2019\u201d Cruz said in Cedar Rapids.\n\nHe spoke of \u201ceerily uncanny\u201d parallels between Jimmy Carter, who gave way to Reagan, and Barack Obama, who, he hopes, gives way to him. Stagnation, weakness, feckless policies abroad, Cruz said, nudging audiences to view him as the latest savior of party and country since the 40th president.\n\n\u201cWashington despised Ronald Reagan. If you see a candidate who Washington embraces, run and hide,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cIf we want to win in 2016, we\u2019ve got to bring back to the polls the millions of conservatives, the millions of evangelicals who stayed home, the millions of Reagan Democrats \u2014 working-class, blue-collar Catholics who showed up in \u201904 and stayed home the last two cycles.\u201d\n\nThe crowd of 250 that packed a hotel ballroom drank it in. And Cruz\u2019s assessment of the GOP\u2019s electoral challenge is widely held: Winning back the White House will require a Reaganesque coalition.\n\nOutside Cruz\u2019s inner circle, though, few party strategists view the polarizing Texas firebrand as the uniter required. Based solely on appearances before friendly, conservative Iowa crowds, it\u2019s hard to gauge whether Cruz is truly equipped to lure in those elusive Reagan Democrats and others.\n\nBut of the activists who turned out to see Cruz at his five events Wednesday and Thursday in Iowa, many do see him as a strong contender, even a potential Reagan heir.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need another Romney. We don\u2019t need another McCain. We sure don\u2019t need another Bush,\u201d said Del Block, 88, a retired utility manager from Cedar Rapids. Cruz, he said, is \u201cjust so sincere about what we all as Republicans believe in.\u201d\n\nIn Cedar Falls, Cruz spoke with more than 200 party activists at a town hall sponsored by the county GOP and a local \u201cteavangelical\u201d group, Cedar Valley Patriots for Christ.\n\n\u201cThis is not your typical RINO Republican crowd,\u201d said the group\u2019s leader, Judd Saul, using a derogatory term \u2014 \u201cRepublican in Name Only\u201d \u2014 common among hard-liners.\n\n\u201cWe need real leadership,\u201d Saul said, adding that among evangelicals and tea partiers, Cruz \u201cis killing it.\u201d\n\nBut Cruz\u2019s appeal still seems mostly confined to the hard-right base, said Joshua Jackson, 26, a pastor at Grace Baptist Church in Waterloo, who also came to the Cedar Falls event.\n\nHe noted that Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has done far more to reach out to marginalized Americans, young voters and a host of constituencies that Cruz mentioned as the key to victory. It makes sense for Cruz to start within his comfort zone, Jackson said. But he\u2019ll have to do more than talk.\n\n\u201cThe really active folks are evangelicals,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wants to be this guy who can reach out to all people.\u201d\n\nIowa freshman U.S. Rep. Rod Blum, who accompanied Cruz to three events in eastern Iowa, said the party\u2019s next Reagan could only spring from the tea party-evangelical side of the party.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be some Washingtonian, inside-the-Beltway guy who appeals to corporate America and has been bought off by the big guys,\u201d Blum said \u2014 though he\u2019s not sure about Cruz\u2019s prospects for making inroads beyond the grass roots.\n\nAnd he conceded that Cruz hasn\u2019t really started to try.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what he needs to do. I\u2019m not sure how he does that,\u201d Blum said. \u201cObviously he\u2019s going to need to reach out to business groups and other groups outside of tea party groups. \u2026 When they hear him \u2014 it\u2019ll be interesting to see.\u201d\n\nIn Des Moines, Cruz\u2019s final appearance in his latest Iowa swing, about 250 people packed a ballroom at the Holiday Inn near the airport.\n\nOne voter confronted Cruz over the 16-day government shutdown he instigated in his effort to defund Obamacare. Congress eventually reopened the government, Obamacare still intact.\n\nCruz insisted \u2014 as he often does \u2014 that he bore no responsibility for the shutdown. In his telling, the fault lay entirely with Obama and Senate Democrats who were so \u201cbound and determined\u201d to protect a damaging law that they would risk harming the economy.\n\nAlso to blame, in his eyes: GOP leaders who promise to repeal Obamacare but run from a fight.\n\nThe combativeness attracts true believers. It\u2019s less likely to win over many other Republicans who view Cruz as a disruptive, even petulant, agitator driven more by ambition than good sense.\n\nAnother voter demanded an explanation of what Cruz would do about the 11 million or more people in the country illegally, given that he rejects the idea of comprehensive reform that would include a path to citizenship or other legal status. It was the second time that day a voter posed this question to Cruz.\n\nBoth times, he deflected, calling it a conversation for another day \u2014 a stance that certainly satisfied the crowds.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to solve everything all at once,\u201d he said, arguing that until the border is secure, \u201cthe American people aren\u2019t interested in a conversation about solving every other part of the problem.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s message plays well among some conservatives, among them Des Moines saleswoman Dawn Larkin, 56.\n\n\u201cWe need a Reagan for the morale of the country. It does feel incredibly hopeless some days,\u201d Larkin said.\n\nShe conceded, though, that Cruz would be a tough sell to people like her husband, a Democrat, and many friends and neighbors.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hard. Some people, their minds won\u2019t be open to it,\u201d she said. But: \u201cHe\u2019s my first choice.\u201d\n\nFollow Todd J.
