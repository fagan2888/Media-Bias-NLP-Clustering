Hundreds of left-wing activists showed up today to attack Hobby Lobby for its objection to the Obama Administration\u2019s HHS Mandate, specifically that the Christian-owned firm pays for abortifacient contraceptives in the employee health insurance plan Obamacare says it must provide.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, NARAL, NOW, the ACLU, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Secular Coalition for America and several \u201creproductive rights\u201d student groups were bussed in from within D.C. and even as far as New York for the rally Tuesday morning.\n\nSome of the more interesting signs: \u201cEating raped murdered animals makes you a hypocrite,\u201d \u201cGet out of my box [ie: vagina],\u201d \u201cThis [a Bible] is not a health care plan,\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s the boss? Me!\u201d and \u201cSex is beautiful, reproduction is optional.\u201d\n\nActivists also chanted \u201cSi Se puede!\u201d (Yes we can), the Cesar Chavez slogan that Obama co-opted, many different times throughout the rally. \u201cWe are the 99 Percent!\u201d from Occupy Wall Street, was also co-opted for the pro-choice movement, citing a statistic from the CDC erroneously. Leftist politics were obviously well represented.\n\nThis 99 percent statistic isn\u2019t even what the pro-choice crowd think it means. The statistic is from the CDC, which said in 2013, \u201cMore than 99% of women aged 15\u201344 who have ever had sexual intercourse have used at least one contraceptive method.\u201d However, the pro-choice movement twisted this finding to say that 99 percent of all women use all types of artificial contraception on a regular basis, including contraception such as Plan B or \u201cthe morning-after pill\u201d which many religious and otherwise pro-life people object to, as ending human life.\n\nOf course the standard, \u201cGet out of my uterus\u201d and \u201ctrust women to do what they want with their own bodies\u201d rhetoric was reiterated dozens of times through speakers and signs.\n\nThe pro-choice activists message was clear: Hobby Lobby\u2019s refusal to pay for something its management opposes on religious grounds \u2013 and which it was not required to provide until Obamacare was enacted \u2013 is an attack against all women in general, and their ability to get any type of contraception.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s a dishonest argument. Hobby Lobby\u2019s employees are free to go out and purchase abortifacients with their own money. What the left is really defending is a new entitlement to \u201cfree\u201d birth control.\n\nWhat\u2019s more is that they know it, organized the protest to rely on their numbers, flashy and simplistic signs, vague chants and a compliant media to parrot the bogus \u201cWar on Women\u201d rhetoric. This loud and abrasive group went oddly silent when asked factual questions. Culture and Media Institute reporter Katie Yoder attempted to interview several protestors from pro-choice groups such as NARAL and Planned Parenthood, but few would speak to her.\n\nIn stark contrast to the yelling and chanting of left-wing mantras and bankrupt slogans, and the signs dismissing the Bible, a simultaneous pro-life rally stood peacefully off to the side, heads bowed and praying.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hobby Lobby Opponent Says Pro-Lifers \"Eating Raped, Murdered Animals\" Are Hypocrites", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "What do Cesar Chavez, \u201craped animals,\u201d Margaret Sanger fans, and Occupy-esque mantras have in common?
