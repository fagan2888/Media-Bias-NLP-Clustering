Sadly, we shouldn’t be shocked that this happened (via the Hill):

The Obama administration on Wednesday announced nearly $70 million in federal grants to groups promoting the healthcare law. The grants will go to 100 groups in 34 states, including three Planned Parenthood affiliates. The provider’s affiliates in Iowa, Missouri and Montana will receive about $1 million in total.

It's apparently clear that this administration doesn't care that the non-profit had allegedly been caught by the Center for Medical Progress trafficking human body parts illegally. It was clear that cutting up babies for profit wasn’t an issue. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest admitted that he hadn’t watched the videos. Early in August, Earnest said in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper that the videos were meant for shock value, and that they might not be credible since they were edited. Tapper was quick to note that the entire, unedited video is available for viewing as well.

“Somebody at the White House should maybe watch the videos in full,” said Tapper.

Then again, President Obama is probably the most pro-abortion president this nation has seen in a long time. He personally thanked, and asked God to bless, Planned Parenthood at their National Conference in 2013.

As long as we've got to fight to make sure women have access to quality, affordable health care, and as long as we've got to fight to protect a woman's right to make her own choices about her own health, I want you to know that you've also got a President who's going to be right there with you fighting every step of the way. Thank you, Planned Parenthood. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.

He was the first sitting president to give remarks at such a venue. So, of course, this administration is unfazed by the CMP investigation. And the media seems to be more concerned about baby pandas than babies being hacked up for body parts.
