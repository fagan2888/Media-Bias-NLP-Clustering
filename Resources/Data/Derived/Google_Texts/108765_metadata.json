None of those arrested were teachers, Mondragon said.\n\nRiot police clubbed marchers and sprayed them with water cannons yesterday after the demonstrators lobbed objects in a struggle to control the square. Some protesters threw Molotov cocktails at the officers, according to Milenio TV. Thousands of teachers from southern Mexican states have set up a tent city to protest President Enrique Pena Nieto\u2019s education overhaul, which was passed this month and requires evaluations to hire and promote educators.\n\n\u201cThose detained were belligerents that broke up pavement to get rocks and brought gas tanks to use as flame throwers,\u201d Mondragon said. It was \u201cvery intense, aggressive action.\u201d\n\nThe government is still in talks with teachers and expects to find a solution to end the protests, Interior Minister Miguel Osorio Chong said, according to the statement. The educators now have moved to the Revolution Monument\u2019s Republic Square, about 1.6 miles (2.6 km) from the Zocalo, according to images broadcast by CNN Mexico.\n\n\u2018Grito\u2019\n\nThe Pena Nieto administration ordered the square cleared in time for tomorrow\u2019s Independence Day \u201cgrito,\u201d or shout, traditionally given from the national palace to spectators in the Zocalo.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this is so national festivities can be carried out in the capital\u2019s Zocalo without any incident,\u201d Deputy Interior Minister Eduardo Sanchez told reporters just before police removed protesters yesterday.\n\nTelevision images of the clashes showed one man with a bloody face and a police officer wheeled away on a stretcher. The federal police press office declined to comment when contacted by phone about people injured during the teachers\u2019 removal. Newspaper El Universal said 29 people received medical attention for injuries, citing the Mexican Red Cross, and 11 police officers were hurt.\n\nEducators have marched almost every day since occupying the square Aug. 19, at times blocking access to the airport, stock exchange and congressional building. More than 15,000 teachers halted traffic on Paseo de la Reforma, the main business boulevard, late last month.\n\nThe teachers are members of a union based in southern Mexican states known as the CNTE, whose local chapter in Oaxaca led a five-month revolt in 2006 to demand the resignation of the state\u2019s governor. Then President Vicente Fox sent more than 4,500 federal police into Oaxaca City to restore order.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Nathan Gill and Nacha Cattan", "twitter": {"description": "Mexico\u2019s police arrested 31 protesters in the capital city\u2019s main square as the government sought to clear thousands of teachers ahead of a ceremony to celebrate the nation\u2019s Independence Day.", "title": "Mexico Police Arrest 31 in Violent Protests on Eve of Ceremony", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-14/mexico-police-arrest-31-in-violent-protests-on-eve-of-ceremony", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipina8pbf0RU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Nathan Gill and Nacha Cattan", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Mexico", "news_keywords": "Mexico", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-14/mexico-police-arrest-31-in-violent-protests-on-eve-of-ceremony", "parsely-title": "Mexico Police Arrest 31 in Violent Protests on Eve of Ceremony", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-09-14T21:12:56.848Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Mexico\u2019s police arrested 31 protesters in the capital city\u2019s main square as the government sought to clear thousands of teachers ahead of a ceremony to celebrate the nation\u2019s Independence Day.", "parsely-tags": "Mexico,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2013-09-14T21:12:56.848Z", "parsely-section": "world", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Mexico\u2019s police arrested 31 protesters in the capital city\u2019s main square as the government sought to clear thousands of teachers ahead of a ceremony to celebrate the nation\u2019s Independence Day.", "title": "Mexico Police Arrest 31 in Violent Protests on Eve of Ceremony", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-14/mexico-police-arrest-31-in-violent-protests-on-eve-of-ceremony", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipina8pbf0RU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Mexico\u2019s police arrested 31 protesters in the capital city\u2019s main square as the government sought to clear thousands of teachers ahead of a ceremony to celebrate the nation\u2019s Independence Day."}, "parsely-post-id": "MT4TLW0D9L3B01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipina8pbf0RU/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2637\"", "article_summary": "None of those arrested were teachers, Mondragon said.\nThe educators now have moved to the Revolution Monument\u2019s Republic Square, about 1.6 miles (2.6 km) from the Zocalo, according to images broadcast by CNN Mexico.\nMexico\u2019s police arrested 31 protesters in the capital city\u2019s main square as the government sought to clear thousands of teachers ahead of a ceremony to celebrate the nation\u2019s Independence Day.\nThe federal police press office declined to comment when contacted by phone about people injured during the teachers\u2019 removal.\nRiot police clubbed marchers and sprayed them with water cannons yesterday after the demonstrators lobbed objects in a struggle to control the square."}
