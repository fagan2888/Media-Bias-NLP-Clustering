Carney, in which Carney wrote, \u201cThe final report relative to the investigation of Austan Goolsbee\u2019s press conference remark is completed, has gone through all the approval processes.\u201d\n\nGoolsbee, the former White House Council of Economic Advisers chairman, sparked a mini-scandal in 2010 when he told reporters during a background press briefing that Koch Industries\u2014the company of libertarian philanthropists Charles and David Koch\u2014paid no income taxes.\n\nConservative lawmakers and activists said Goolsbee\u2019s statements not only unfairly singled out the president\u2019s political opponents but also used confidential IRS documents to do so.\n\nTIGTA announced in response to a letter from six Republican senators that it was launching an investigation into Goolsbee\u2019s comments and whether he violated the law. However, the report was never released to the senators or the public.\n\nTIGTA refused to confirm or deny the existence of the investigation in response to several FOIA requests from the Washington Free Beacon, Koch Industries, and Cause of Action. The agency general cited a statute forbidding the unauthorized release of any citizen\u2019s tax returns.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The Obama administration will soon turn over thousands of documents related to improper disclosures of confidential taxpayer information by the IRS to the White House, a watchdog group announced Tuesd", "title": "Records on Taxpayer Leaks to White House to Be Released", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/records-on-taxpayer-leaks-to-white-house-to-be-released/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Goolsbee-150x150.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration will soon turn over thousands of documents related to improper disclosures", "creator": "@cjciaramella", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Goolsbee-150x150.png", "title": "Records on Taxpayer Leaks to White House to Be Released", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9210\"", "article_summary": "BY: Follow @cjciaramellaThe Obama administration will soon turn over thousands of documents related to improper disclosures of confidential taxpayer information by the IRS to the White House, a watchdog group announced Tuesday.\nA federal judge ruled in September that TIGTA could not hide the existence of an investigation it had previously acknowledged.\nTIGTA announced in response to a letter from six Republican senators that it was launching an investigation into Goolsbee\u2019s comments and whether he violated the law.\nTIGTA refused to confirm or deny the existence of the investigation in response to several FOIA requests from the Washington Free Beacon, Koch Industries, and Cause of Action.\nThe agency general cited a statute forbidding the unauthorized release of any citizen\u2019s tax returns."}
