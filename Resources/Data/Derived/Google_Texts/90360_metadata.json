In time that will sort itself out, but I think the market is sort of overreacting.\"\n\nPaulson, whose funds have $16.2 billion of assets under management, also said he was not concerned about the U.S. facing a new financial crisis, saying banks have \"more liquidity and higher quality portfolios\".\n\n\"The U.S. is on pretty solid ground,\" Paulson said. \"The concerns would be more from China.\"\n\nPaulson, a long-time bull on gold, said he still has a gold fund and significant investments in the gold sector, and said that the fund was \"doing very well.\"\n\nsoared on Thursday to one-year highs as global economic uncertainty, a weaker dollar and tumbling equities revived bullion\u2019s safe-haven status.
