House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), whose own support for the bank has been uneven, has deferred to conservatives who argue the bank is the post-child for \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d that favors large corporations over small businesses.\n\nThe hardliners successfully blocked its renewal in June.\n\nBut GE\u2019s announcements suggests that more companies may start blaming Congress for destroying America jobs.\n\nRelated: Obama Warns Republicans Not to \u2018Play Chicken\u2019 with the Economy\n\nEven so, the trade bank\u2019s opponents are unrepentant in the face of GE\u2019s announcement and don\u2019t plan on letting the agency return from the dead any time soon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re winning,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\n\u201cMiddle class tax payers don\u2019t want their money going to help get special deals for the biggest corporations in the country,\u201d he added. \u201cI love those big corporations, they\u2019re great success stories \u2026 But even Boeing said back during the debate this summer \u2018We\u2019ll finance these deals on our own\u2019 and middle class tax payers shouldn\u2019t have to pay for that.\u201d\n\nThe aerospace giant did say it might temporarily provide financing for some aircraft purchases by airlines whose portfolios are tied to the bank\u2019s future.\n\nRelated: GOP Debate Exposes a Rift that Could Topple Boehner\n\n\u201cI understand that crony capitalism is an easier way to do business simply getting politicians in Washington to carve out billions in favors for giant corporations, but it\u2019s not what congress should be doing,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), a 2016 presidential contender and one of the agency\u2019s harshest critics in the Senate.\n\nEven though other financial issues, like funding the federal government and avoiding a shutdown, top the congressional agenda, the bank remains on the minds of Democrats, including President Obama.\n\nIn speech last week to the Business Roundtable in Washington, he urged executives to pressure Congress to renew the agency.\n\n\u201cI think you have to flood the zone and let them know this is important,\u201d Obama said, suggesting a revival could happen as part of larger negotiations on the budget.\n\n\u201cIt is mind-boggling this wasn\u2019t reauthorized a year ago,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cases made by GE and Obama failed to persuade House Financial Services Committee chair Jeb Hensarling (R-TX), a staunch opponent of the bank.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s troubling that the head of President Obama\u2019s Jobs Council [GE chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt] is announcing GE is leaving Connecticut because the state\u2019s taxes are too high and is choosing to send jobs overseas because U.S. taxpayer-provided subsidies are too low,\" he said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, House Democrats forced a vote on a measure to reauthorize the bank and were promptly defeated.\n\n\u201cRepublicans\u2019 continuing refusal to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank is costing jobs and crippling American competitiveness in the global economy,\u201d House Minority Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said in a statement.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Democrats who want the bank to make a comeback. The Palmetto State\u2019s two Republican Senators were not happy with the news, either.\n\nOf the 500 GE jobs going overseas, 400 will come from a cluster of sites, including a power turbine plant in Greeneville, South Carolina.\n\n\u201cThis is bad news and I fear even worse news is still to come,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, another White House hopeful. \u201cThe sooner Congress reauthorizes the Export-Import Bank and puts us back on a level playing field, the better it will be for workers in Greenville and across our state. The United States should not unilaterally disarm, yet that is exactly what we are doing.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Sen. Tim Scott said the bank \u201chas returned $7 billion [in] taxpayer dollars to the treasury while helping \u2026 South Carolina businesses and other businesses interested in exporting. It\u2019s clear that Ex-Im is connected to a number of jobs.\u201d\n\nOutside groups who opposed the bank, such as Freedom Partners, reject those arguments, saying states couldn\u2019t lose out on jobs that didn\u2019t actually exist in the first place.\n\nWhile the path forward may seem murky for some, for Jordan the way is crystal clear.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the party of free enterprise, we\u2019re the party of free markets, we\u2019re the party of competition. We\u2019re not the party of cronyism, we\u2019re not the party of special deals for big companies,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Export-Import Bank \u201cshould go away and we have a natural wind-down process,\u201d he added, noting that existing contracts issued by the agency are still honored and \u201cthat\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most natural progression, natural wind-down you could come up with and, oh, by the way, it happens to be the free enterprise and the free -market way of doing things,\u201d Jordan said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Last week General Electric joined a growing list of major corporations to lash out at Congress for allowing the U.S. Export-Import Bank charter to lapse earlier this year.", "title": "What Happens When Political Ideology Costs U.S. Jobs?
