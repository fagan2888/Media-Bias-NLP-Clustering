He said the PPO-to-HMO change will happen overnight from Dec. 31 to Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say you happen to be in the hospital Dec. 27 and you fell taking your Christmas lights down and you have a busted something and you\u2019re waiting to have surgery. You\u2019re already admitted to the hospital and you have PPO coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cAs of Jan. 1, if we stay on the track that we\u2019re on and providers don\u2019t sign up for HMO coverage, then on Jan. 1, that facility is not in the network.\n\n\u201cYou think about the dynamics associated with that, and it\u2019s going to throw a monkey wrench for a lot of this community.\u201d\n\nFristoe said more details on how BCBSTX will change their plans should come out in early October. He said the insurance provider has said the change might not be a transition to a traditional HMO, but it could be a middle-of-the-road option between an HMO and a PPO.\n\nA PPO, he said, allows for coverage, to some degree, for in-network and non-network providers. An HMO only provides coverage for in-network providers. For example, under the HMO plans for this area, Kell West is part of BCBSTX\u2019s HMO coverage and only a few primary care physicians and specialists accept HMO insurance.\n\nFristoe said the change BCBSTX is going through is a result of the economics of the Affordable Care Act. He said his hope is BCBSTX will choose a hybrid of the PPO and HMO plans to lessen the blow on consumers.", "article_metadata": {"title": "BCBS plans for individuals to change", "og": {"url": "http://www.timesrecordnews.com/news/bcbs-plans-for-individuals-to-change-ep-1204687360-331393371.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/affordable-care-act_3426134_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 400}, "type": "article", "description": "Large finanical loss forces BCBSTX to change individual plans", "title": "BCBS plans for individuals to change"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/affordable-care-act_3426134_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Large finanical loss forces BCBSTX to change individual plans", "site": "@timesrecordnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "BCBS plans for individuals to change"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-trn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12ff\"", "article_summary": "Fristoe said the change BCBSTX is going through is a result of the economics of the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cThe retail market has evolved significantly since the opening of the Health Insurance Marketplace in 2014,\u201d BCBS told agents.\nPeople with employer-provided PPO plans will not be affected by the change.\nFor example, under the HMO plans for this area, Kell West is part of BCBSTX\u2019s HMO coverage and only a few primary care physicians and specialists accept HMO insurance.\nHe said his hope is BCBSTX will choose a hybrid of the PPO and HMO plans to lessen the blow on consumers."}
