What they don\u2019t prove, however, is that the current Republican Party could never be a vehicle for such a policy agenda. The Democratic Party of the late 1970s and early 1980s stood rather firmly for all kinds of ideas (price controls, middle class tax increases) that the Democratic Party of the 1990s deliberately backed away from. There is no necessary reason why the same could not be true of the G.O.P.\u2019s Obama-era fixation on the mooching 47 percent \u2014 especially since all kinds of prominent, ambitious Republicans have been backpedaling away from that idea ever since Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 defeat.\n\nAnd especially since, in backpedaling away, they\u2019ve moved closer (quite close, in the case of a not-at-all-insignificant figure like Marco Rubio) to what I would describe as the consensus \u201creform conservative\u201d position on welfare policy: Namely, that a reform of the safety net should concentrate on 1) increasing take-home pay for low-wage workers and 2) removing and minimizing perverse anti-work incentives created by current transfer programs.\n\nIs it really unimaginable that the national Republican Party would get behind such a two-part vision of reform? I would say not, since that\u2019s basically the thrust of reforms that were enacted under Republican Congresses and Republican presidents throughout the long pre-Obama period of conservative ascendance. If you look at this table, for instance, you\u2019ll see that federal income tax liability for the poorest 10 percent declined pretty steadily from the 1986 tax reform onward \u2014 quite often thanks to policy changes that Republicans either accepted or actively endorsed. Or again, if you look at this chart, you\u2019ll see that we cut taxes on low-wage workers three times (relying on the EITC and child tax credits) in the twenty years before the Obama era: first in the \u201986 tax reform, under Reagan; then in 1997, in a Clinton-Gingrich deal, and finally in 2001, in the Bush tax cuts. Those were not policies supported by all Republicans and conservatives by any means \u2014 hence the internal party debate, which swung in more Randian direction in 2009-2012 \u2014 but they were ideas that many Republican leaders embraced, pushed for, and signed into law.\n\nAnd of course they were accompanied, as in many of today\u2019s reformist proposals, by changes and cuts to existing welfare programs, with the overall goal of changing the incentive structures facing the poor, so that work would become more rewarding and attractive and idleness less so. Reasonable people can disagree about the consequences of these reforms, but there\u2019s a pretty plausible case that this combination of increased take-home pay and lower guaranteed benefits, rather than punishing the poor, tended to help them: At the very least, we seemed to make more progress reducing child poverty from the 1990s onward, as Scott Winship argued earlier this year in Politico, then we did in the years before the EITC/welfare reform/child tax credit combination became federal policy.\n\nChait\u2019s thesis, then, hinges on the idea that the ideological changes in the national G.O.P. since 2008 have been so sweeping, so revolutionary, that there can be no going back to the way that both tax reform and safety-net reform quite often proceeded during the years of substantial Republican influence and power that preceded Obama\u2019s election. And maybe he\u2019s right: As I keep saying in these arguments, I\u2019m a pessimist by nature, and I\u2019m not interested in making a Pollyanish case that the G.O.P. will necessarily embrace \u201creform conservatism,\u201d or any other flavor of reform for that matter. But I just think that both the historical record and the current drift of Republican policy thinking suggest that it\u2019s much more possible than Chait tends to allow.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140522160844, "BN": "douthat", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/douthat", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 22, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1400789324, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/rossdouthat/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-05-22T20:08:44-04:00"}, "keywords": "Chait Jonathan,Ponnuru Ramesh,Romney Mitt,Rubio Marco,Conservatism (US Politics),Federal Taxes (US),Income Tax,Tax Credits Deductions and Exemptions,Welfare (US),Republican Party,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/douthat/Must Conservatism Soak the Poor?
