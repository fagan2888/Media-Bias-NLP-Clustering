The Sears store in Muskogee is closing later this year, according to a company spokesperson.

The department store and auto center at Arrowhead Mall will shut down in early November and a liquidation sale will begin Aug. 15.

“Store closures are part of a series of actions we're taking to reduce on-going expenses, adjust our asset base, and accelerate the transformation of our business model,” Howard Riefs said. “These actions will better enable us to focus our investments on serving our customers and members through integrated retail - at the store, online and in the home.”

The Muskogee location has a combined 60 employees, all of whom will be eligible to receive severance and have the opportunity to apply for open positions at other area Sears and Kmart stores, Riefs said.

Kmart, which is owned by Sears, has announced no plans to close its Muskogee store, according to Shannon Murray, assistant manager.
