After a Tuesday morning setback (and a much larger disaster in 2009), NASA Wednesday officially launched its carbon-tracking satellite into orbit. Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 will work 438 miles above the earth’s surface, measuring CO2 levels in order to prove once and for all to climate deniers that man-made global warming is happening.

Just kidding, we know that already. We also know that humans release about 100 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere each day, and that those emissions are contributing to climate change. Half of those emissions end up trapped in the atmosphere, where concentrations of CO2 are astoundingly high — they’ve been above 400 ppm for a record-shattering three months in a row — and a quarter are absorbed by the oceans. But the rest is sucked up by trees, a process that scientists are still struggling to understand. Hence the satellite.

“Somewhere on earth, on land, one-quarter of all our carbon emissions released through fossil fuel emissions is disappearing,” David Crisp, a senior research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, explained to the New York Times. “We can’t identify the processes responsible for this. Wouldn’t it be nice to know where?”
