Still, growth has clearly picked up, and the public seems to be noticing. So what can we say about the Obama non-boom?\n\nI\u2019d argue that much of what we\u2019re seeing reflects the tapering off of austerity. The US has never had a proclaimed austerity plan, UK style, but we\u2019ve had a lot of the thing itself, especially from cutbacks in state and local spending. Spending hasn\u2019t rebounded yet, but at least it has stopped shrinking:\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd it\u2019s important to realize that, despite all the rhetoric about how Obamacare/antibusiness rhetoric/Kenyan Islamic atheism is destroying business, the private sector has actually been relatively strong under Obama. Here\u2019s employment:\n\nPhoto\n\nSince Obama took office, we\u2019ve gained 6.7 million private-sector jobs, compared with just 3.1 million at the same point under Bush. But under Bush we\u2019d added 1.2 million public sector jobs, while under Obama we\u2019ve cut 600,000. The point is that relatively good private sector performance has been masked by public-sector cutbacks; this is the opposite of what you usually hear, but that\u2019s no surprise.\n\nWhat about the prospects looking forward? As I\u2019ve pointed out before, business investment has been relatively strong throughout. Residential investment, however, has been very low since 2006, suggesting that there\u2019s a backlog of pent-up demand, which should come into play in an improving job market. So that\u2019s one source of strength. Also, low oil prices are going to be mostly positive, although with some adverse regional effects; more on that in a later post.\n\nOverall, then, the next year and probably the next two years are likely to be pretty good. This doesn\u2019t mean that the overall track record of policy has been good \u2014 we\u2019ve wasted trillions in foregone output, damaged the lives of millions if not tens of millions. But it will feel a lot better than the years before.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141228100338, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 28, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/The Obama Bounce ( 20141228 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Not a boom, but some good stuff is happening.", "title": "The Obama Bounce", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/the-obama-bounce/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Not a boom, but some good stuff is happening.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 28, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1419779018, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-12-28T15:03:38-05:00"}, "utime": 20141228150338, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141228, "pdate": 20141228, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Not a boom, but some good stuff is happening.", "title": "The Obama Bounce", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/the-obama-bounce/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/the-obama-bounce/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Obama Bounce", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae32\"", "article_summary": "But under Bush we\u2019d added 1.2 million public sector jobs, while under Obama we\u2019ve cut 600,000.\nAs I\u2019ve pointed out before, business investment has been relatively strong throughout.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that the overall track record of policy has been good \u2014 we\u2019ve wasted trillions in foregone output, damaged the lives of millions if not tens of millions.\nHere\u2019s employment:PhotoSince Obama took office, we\u2019ve gained 6.7 million private-sector jobs, compared with just 3.1 million at the same point under Bush.\nThe point is that relatively good private sector performance has been masked by public-sector cutbacks; this is the opposite of what you usually hear, but that\u2019s no surprise."}
