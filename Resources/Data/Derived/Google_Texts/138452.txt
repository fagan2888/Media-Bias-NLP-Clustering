Trying to winnow down the 12 best dishes I had as a restaurant reviewer in 2014 was a hard task, though I managed to do it in this posting that just went up today. (The print version follows on Christmas Eve.)

This doesn’t include meals I had while traveling, or at home, or even ones I enjoyed at Front Range restaurants I’ve reviewed in previous years. This is purely about the top dishes I had at restaurants I reviewed in the past 12 months.

It was a tough list to whittle down, and there were a couple of finalists that were bested, narrowly, by competing plates on the same menu. Two cases in point:



One of the dishes I named in this year’s best-of list was the squash salad at Argyll Whisky Beer in Denver’s Uptown neighborhood. But it narrowly beat out that restaurant’s own lamb burger, which is hands down one of the best burgers I’ve had in ages. It came on a toasted brioche roll with crispy lettuce, tzatziki sauce and a sweet-tart tomato jam. Yowzer.

Another close race: The spring pea brodo with hen egg at Bistro Barbès in Park Hill that edged the main course that followed it, a moist crispy-skinned seabass over ratatouille and a salad of Israeli cous-cous and Beluga lentils.

Check out this photo. When a dish this lovely is a runner-up in its own restaurant, you’ll see why 2014 was a great year in dining in the Denver area:
