Bush. But President Obama in 2009 banned the use of such \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d as the simulated drowning practice known as waterboarding.\n\nCIA agents are alleged to have used the practice against suspected terrorists held at \u201cblack sites\u201d around the world.\n\nCiting unidentified sources, The Associated Press reported late Friday that Secretary of State John Kerry reached out to Ms. Feinstein to rethink her plan to release the critical report.\n\nThe official said Mr. Kerry, a former senator himself, called Ms. Feinstein to talk about the implications of publicly releasing a declassified summary of her committee\u2019s report given the combustible situations in various world hot spots, the AP account said.\n\nHuman rights activists and many U.S. lawmakers have denounced the practices as \u201ctorture,\u201d arguing that U.S. government sponsorship of such practices was patently un-American.\n\nCongressional aides and outside experts familiar with the report have said it is highly critical of waterboarding and concludes that such practices provided no key evidence in the hunt for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nSome CIA officials have argued the contrary. Leon Panetta, who headed the spy agency under President Obama from 2009 to 2011 wrote in his memoir published this year that \u201charsh interrogation \u2026 produced leads that helped our government understand al Qaeda\u2019s organization, methods, and leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know we got important, even critical intelligence from individuals subjected to these enhanced interrogation techniques,\u201d Mr. Panetta wrote.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee\u2019s probe has been a source of unprecedented friction between Democrats and the CIA.\n\nTensions burst into the open last March when Mrs. Feinstein accused the agency of violating Constitutional separation-of-powers standards by hacking computers of Senate staffers conducting the investigation.\n\nCurrent CIA Director John O. Brennan has denied the claim. But media reports maintain that CIA officials had taken the action after accusing Senate staffers of illegally acquiring classified documents from the agency. Dispute over the case continues to play behind closed doors at the Justice Department.\n\nMrs. Feinstein\u2019s report, meanwhile, has exposed rifts among Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have disagreed on the question of whether enhanced interrogation actually worked, as well as on whether or not Intelligence Committee\u2019s findings should be released publicly.\n\nRepublican staffers on the committee sided with CIA calls for secrecy early in Mrs. Feinstein\u2019s probe and withdrew their participation in the investigation.\n\nTwo Republican senators in particular \u2014 Marco Rubio of Florida and James Risch of Idaho \u2014 have opposed making the report public, claiming it is the result of a \u201cone-sided\u201d and \u201cpartisan\u201d investigation and that declassification \u201ccould endanger the lives of American diplomats and citizens overseas and jeopardize U.S. relations with other countries.\u201d\n\nBut in a joint statement in April, the two said their criticisms did not mean they agreed with the CIA\u2019s interrogation program.\n\n\u201cNo member of the Senate condones torture, and the CIA\u2019s execution of its former interrogation and detention program has harmed the agency and the reputation of the United States,\u201d Mr. Rubio and Mr. Risch said. \u201cThe one saving grace about the eventual declassification of this report is that the minority views and the CIA position will also be declassified.\u201d\n\nBut other prominent Republican senators have stood more firmly with Mrs. Feinstein.\n\nSen. John McCain of Arizona, himself a victim of torture during the Vietnam war, has strongly denied the practices worked in drawing useful intelligence from terror suspects.\n\n\u201cI reject those on their face,\u201d Mr. McCain said in August. \u201cEven if there was some truth in it, the damage done to the United States of America\u2019s reputation is incalculable.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain was joined by Lindsay Graham, of South Carolina, who said the use of torture against detainees \u201cviolated\u201d the \u201cspirit of who we are\u201d as Americans.\n\nThe comments by Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham dovetailed with President Obama\u2019s own remarks on the issue.\n\n\u201cIn the immediate aftermath of 9/11, we did some things that were wrong,\u201d Mr. Obama said at an August press conference. \u201cWe did a whole lot of things that were right, but we tortured some folks. We did some things that were contrary to our values.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein is seeking to draw maximum media attention as she prepares the to release \"over the coming days\" of the panel's long anticipated and highly critical report on harsh CIA interrogation tactics used on terror suspects after the 9/11 attacks.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein is seeking to draw maximum media attention as she prepares the to release \u201cover the coming days\u201d of the panel\u2019s long anticipated and highly critical report on harsh CIA interrogation tactics used on terror suspects after the 9/11 attacks.", "title": "Feinstein readies release of damning report on CIA terror programs", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/5/feinstein-readies-release-damning-report-cia-terro/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/21/feinstein.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/21/feinstein.jpg", "description": "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein is seeking to draw maximum media attention as she prepares the to release \"over the coming days\" of the panel's long anticipated and highly cr", "card": "summary", "title": "Feinstein readies release of damning report on CIA terror programs"}, "Author": "Guy Taylor", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, United States Central Intelligence Agency, Dianne Feinstein, Senate"}, "article_summary": "Some CIA officials have argued the contrary.\nBut media reports maintain that CIA officials had taken the action after accusing Senate staffers of illegally acquiring classified documents from the agency.\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein is seeking to draw maximum media attention as she prepares the to release \u201cover the coming days\u201d of the panel\u2019s long anticipated and highly critical report on harsh CIA interrogation tactics used on terror suspects after the 9/11 attacks.\nThe Coercive Interrogation Program was used by the CIA under former President George W.
