The owners of craft store chain Hobby Lobby have been under federal investigation for acquiring ancient artifacts from Iraq—material that may have been looted—for their new Museum of the Bible, according to the Daily Beast. The Green family, which owns the company, is best known for its federal lawsuit that successfully claimed a closely-held corporation should be exempt from the Affordable Care Act, because that law would have compelled Hobby Lobby to pay for contraceptives. The museum the Green clan is building is set to open in Washington, D.C. in 2017.
