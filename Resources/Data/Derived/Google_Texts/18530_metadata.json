And we can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as single payer [health care], it works in Canada, it works incredibly well in Scotland. \u2026 You can\u2019t let the people in this country, the people without the money and resources, to go without healthcare.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople as they make more and more money can pay a higher percentage\u201d of taxes.\n\nOnly one of two conclusions can be drawn here. Either the Tea Party base\u2014which the media would have us think mainly consists of angry libertarians inveighing against taxes and runaway big government\u2014hasn\u2019t really been listening to Donald Trump, who made all the above statements, or, alternatively, most of the media have read the Tea Party and its true aims and ambitions entirely wrong.\n\nI suggest the latter is the correct answer. The success of Trump\u2019s campaign has, if nothing else, exposed the Tea Party for what it really is; Trump\u2019s popularity is, in effect, final proof of what some of us have been arguing for years: that the Tea Party is less a libertarian movement than a right-wing version of populism. Think William Jennings Bryan or Huey Long, not Ayn Rand. Tea Partiers are less upset about the size of government overall than they are that so much of it is going to other people, especially immigrants and nonwhites. They are for government for them and against government for Not-Them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Either the Tea Party base hasn\u2019t really been listening to Donald Trump, who made all the above statements, or, alternatively, most of the media have read the Tea Party and its true aims and ambitions entirely wrong.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Either the Tea Party base hasn\u2019t really been listening to Donald Trump, who made all the above statements, or, alternatively, most of the media have read the Tea Party and its true aims and ambitions entirely wrong.", "title": "Lind: Trump's Tea Party, GOP Base Populist and Nationalist - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/donald-trump-points-it-out-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/03/lind-trumps-tea-party-gop-base-populist-and-nationalist/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Either the Tea Party base hasn\u2019t really been listening to Donald Trump, who made all the above statements, or, alternatively, most of the media have read the Tea Party and its true aims and ambitions entirely wrong.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/donald-trump-points-it-out-AP.jpg", "title": "Lind: Trump's Tea Party, GOP Base Populist and Nationalist - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Tea party,donald trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-09-03T03:57:42-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Tea party"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca66d\"", "article_summary": "The success of Trump\u2019s campaign has, if nothing else, exposed the Tea Party for what it really is; Trump\u2019s popularity is, in effect, final proof of what some of us have been arguing for years: that the Tea Party is less a libertarian movement than a right-wing version of populism.\nAnd we can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cAs far as single payer [health care], it works in Canada, it works incredibly well in Scotland.\nTea Partiers are less upset about the size of government overall than they are that so much of it is going to other people, especially immigrants and nonwhites.\nEither the Tea Party base\u2014which the media would have us think mainly consists of angry libertarians inveighing against taxes and runaway big government\u2014hasn\u2019t really been listening to Donald Trump, who made all the above statements, or, alternatively, most of the media have read the Tea Party and its true aims and ambitions entirely wrong.\nThey are for government for them and against government for Not-Them."}
