One of the biggest firework displays along the Gulf Coast wrapped up the Fourth of July for many in the Panama City Beach area.

Thousands lined the sidewalks and streets of Pier Park Saturday evening to watch the fireworks and take in the family fun.

Seveal live musical performances filled the area including shows at Aaron Bessant park at 7:30 and then at 9:00 the fireworks took off.

The fireworks lit up the sky not only at the City Pier, but also the County Pier and Grand Lagoon.
