The study only measures changes in smoking over the past year and whether the subjects had ever used an e-cigarette. So, in Siegel\u2019s words, the \u201cstudy methods do not allow the investigators to determine which came first.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it is a cross-sectional study, it is impossible to know whether the change in smoking status preceded the use of electronic cigarettes or whether the use of electronic cigarettes preceded the smoking status change,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThis omission is critical, as it casts severe doubt over the claim that e-cigarettes are a cause of smoking initiation or failure to quit. The second fatal flaw is that the question used to assess vaping behavior only asked about ever use of e-cigarettes,\u201d Siegel wrote. \u201cIt does not assess the frequency of use or its duration. According to the methodology, participants were merely asked whether they had \u2018used\u2019 e-cigarettes at any point in the past 12 months.\u201d\n\nBut the term \u201cused\u201d was not clarified. Vapers, as defined in the study, included anyone who so much as tried one e-cigarette. \u201cIt is entirely possible that many of the participants who the study called vapers were actually not vapers at all, but merely people who had tried an e-cigarette,\u201d Siegel added.
