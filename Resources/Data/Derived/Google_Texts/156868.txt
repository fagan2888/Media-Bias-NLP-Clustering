Did you know that 39 percent of Republicans still believe that undocumented immigrants can get Obamacare? And 26 percent of Republicans still believe there are death panels? And only five percent of people actually know one of the most important facts of Obamacare: that it's costing less than expected—42 percent of all voters, Democrats and Republicans, get that one wrong.

On this fifth anniversary of the law being signed, it's a good opportunity to review the false predictions and the facts of the law's first five years. Here's just a handful of Republican prediction failures:



Failed Prediction #1: Americans won’t enroll in the ACA […]

Failed Prediction #2: The ACA won’t meet its enrollment goals […]

Failed Prediction #3: Insurers will want no part of the ACA system […]

Failed Prediction #4: The economy will suffer terribly because of ‘Obamacare’ […]

Failed Prediction #5: Even if Americans enrolled, they won’t pay their premiums […]

Failed Prediction #6: Even if people pay their premiums, the flawed ACA structure will send premiums soaring […]

Failed Prediction #7: The ACA won’t reduce the uninsured rate because it will only help those who already have coverage […]

Failed Prediction #8: The ACA will lead to a “net loss” on overall coverage […]

Failed Prediction #9: The ACA will lead to higher deficits and a weaker fiscal footing for the nation […]

Failed Prediction #10: Americans will end up hating the coverage they receive through the ACA […]

• Nearly 30 million Americans have gotten health insurance under Obamacare.

• The rate of uninsured adults has dropped to 12.3%. […]

• Number of adults without health insurance in 2013: 41 million. Today: 30 million.

• Percentage of insurance exchange customers who'd previously been uninsured: 57% […]

• Number of times Congress has voted to repeal Obamacare (so far): 56

• 63% of Americans say Republicans have no alternative to Obamacare. […]

• Americans who could lose subsidies for federal insurance exchanges if the Supreme Court rules against them later this year: 13.4 million

That's a whole lot of fail. Just take a look at this list of 20 statistics proving how the law is working to demonstrate how humungously Republicans have failed. Some highlights:In five years, Republicans have come up with nothing but fail in response to the law: no plan of their own, no recognition of reality, nothing but "no." That's worked for them, so far. But if the Supreme Court grants their fondest desire, and guts the law, fail isn't going to be an option anymore.
