Wednesday on the west lawn of he U.S. Capitol at the rally against President Barack Obama’s Iran Nuclear Agreement titled “Stop the Iran Deal Rally,” former Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AK) took a jab at Obama and his senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.



Palin said, “You don’t lift sanctions. You crack down on their assets. You cut off their oil and drill, baby, drill for our own. We don’t retreat. We reload against any foe daring to test us. And that is what Iran just did. So, Congress, you got to kill the deal. The president is playing you. He so disrespects you, Congress, and our Constitution, that he won’t even bring you the treaty.”

She continued, “So as Obama leads from behind the skirt of his right-hand man, Valerie Jarrett, then it’s up to Congress to close that window. He may propose. You dispose, Congress. You got to be in it to win it, because we want peace with unapologetic mighty red, white and blue. We’ll have peace. Because war is hell, yet as in all other things, this administration loves conflict so much that they’ll take pressure off the bad guys that reward bad behavior. Yeah, that’s an Obama world with borders wide open, IRS harassing, servers a wiping, where his bad actors are rewarded, while a Christian clerk goes to jail. So the call to action, friends, is take action. Do not play small. It does us no good to play small. That’s not why you were created. And we have not enough time to play small. You be empowered, and render a biased lap-dog media powerless. Hey, media, they’re onto ya! Your role is played out and you’re relegated to the ash heap of history. Look around, friends, you’re not alone. There are more of us than there are of them. Take action! And don’t let your praying knees get lazy! God bless you. God bless Israel. God bless the United States of America.”
