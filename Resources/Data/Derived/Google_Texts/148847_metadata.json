Because of this broken promise, the taxpayer is still left with a \u00a3400 million a year tab to keep the 10,000 foreign prisoners behind bars, an enormous drain on stretched budgets.'\n\nPrisons minister Jeremy Wright (right) told the House of Commons that just 17 EU prisoners had been sent home with ten UK prisoners returning\n\nAccording to official figures, almost 800 prisoners from the Republic of Ireland are not included in the repatriation deal costing the British taxpayer an estimated \u00a327 million a year.\n\n\n\nSo far, 18 out of 27 EU states have signed the 2011 agreement allowing nations to send prisoners back to their native home.\n\n\n\nWorse still for Mr Cameron, a plan to send home 773 Jamaicans held in British jails failed after the Kingston government refused the British request.\n\n\n\nThere are almost 800 prisoners from the Irish Republic being detained in England and Wales who are not subject to transfer at a cost to the taxpayer of \u00a327 million a year\n\nPrisons minster Jeremy Wright MP confirmed that there were 4,106 prisoners from EU countries being held in England and Wales. Of that, 2,307 were from one of the 18 nations subject to the EU deal, with 1,422 having received a sentence.\n\n\n\nIn a written reply to the parliament, Mr Wright said: 'To date 18 member states (including the United Kingdom) have implemented the agreement. The European Court of Justice will have jurisdiction over the measure from December 1, 2014 and member states may face infraction proceedings if they have not implemented the agreement by then.\n\n\n\n'The use of the EU PTA is at an early stage and the number of prisoners transferred remains low. However, we expect to see a significant increase in the number of prisoners transferred once the Agreement has been implemented by all member states.\n\n\n\n'To date 17 prisoners have been transferred to other jurisdictions.'\n\n\n\nThe European Court of Justice in Luxembourg (pictured) assumes responsibility for policing the EU Prisoner Transfer Agreement on December 1, 2014\n\nMr Wright claimed the number of foreign nationals jailed in England and Wales had almost doubled between 1997 and 2010.\n\n\n\nHe added: 'All foreign national offenders (FNOs) sentenced to custody are referred to the Home Office to consider them for deportation at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\n\n'The prisoner transfer process is just one mechanism for removing FNOs. The number of FNOs deported under the Early Removal Scheme (ERS) has increased under this government. In 2013, we removed nearly 2,000 FNOs.'\n\n\n\nWHO ARE THE 17 PRISONERS AND HOW LONG DO THEY HAVE TO SERVE?\n\nBelgian serving eight years for wounding with intent with 1,016 days remaining.\n\nBelgian serving five years and five months for facilitating illegal entry with 634 days in prison remaining.\n\nBelgian serving nine years for drugs offences with 1,135 days remaining.\n\nLatvian serving ten years for causing death by dangerous driving with 882 days remaining.\n\nMaltese serving six years for sexual offences with 576 days remaining.
