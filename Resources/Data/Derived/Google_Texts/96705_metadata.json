A report by ABC News, meanwhile, indicates that Ohio Gov. John Kasich is also planning a run that he\u2019ll announce officially in June or July.\n\nGraham and Kasich both seem likely to present themselves as moderate candidates with potential bipartisan appeal. Kasich has won election twice in Ohio, a state that Barack Obama carried in both 2008 and 2012, and unlike a number of other Republican governors, Kasich has participated in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid at the state level. Graham\u2019s willingness to compromise with Democrats on issues such as immigration has long made him a target of conservative activists who call him a RINO, aka Republican In Name Only. (Graham is also, however, an advocate of an aggressive foreign policy who has been critical of Obama\u2019s handling of the Middle East.)\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Lindsey Graham, John Kasich Also Expected to Run for 2016 Republican Nomination", "sailthru.author": "Ben Mathis-Lilley", "description": "Republican South Carolina Sen.
