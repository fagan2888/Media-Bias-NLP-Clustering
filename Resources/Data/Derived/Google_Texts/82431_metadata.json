The top 10 losses for the shutdown, by state, were: \u2022 California: $31 million\n\n\u2022 Arizona: $27 million\n\n\u2022 North Carolina: $25 million\n\n\u2022 Wyoming: $24 million\n\n\u2022 Virginia: $21 million\n\n\u2022 Tennessee: $18 million\n\n\u2022 Utah: $17 million\n\n\u2022 Colorado: $17 million\n\n\u2022 Maine: $16 million\n\n\u2022 Pennsylvania: $16 million\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Arizona saw a $27 million drop in spending at its national parks during October\u2019s partial federal government shutdown, with $17 million in losses at Grand Canyon National Park alone, according to a new report.\n\nThe Department of the Interior report released Monday said that Arizona had the second-highest losses in the nation for the shutdown, trailing only California, which lost $31 million. The losses were based on park spending in October 2013 compared to the average park spending for the same month over the preceding three years.\n\nThe estimated-loss report was one of two from the department Monday, which also released its annual report on the economic impact that national parks had on local communities in 2012.\n\nThat report said 282 million park visitors spent more than $14.7 billion in 2012, supporting 243,000 local jobs in hotels, restaurants, bars and other tourism-related businesses. In Arizona, park visitors spent $745.6 million in 2012, supporting 11,470 jobs, according to the report.\n\n\u201cParks are economic engines for their communities,\u201d Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said during a conference call on the release of the two reports. \u201cThey bring in dollars from visitors to keep communities going strong.\u201d\n\nBut the 16-day government shutdown cut sharply into that revenue stream, even in states like Arizona which eventually paid the federal government to reopen the Grand Canyon.\n\nJewell said deals had to be reached with each state during the shutdown to fund park openings, and disputed claims that the department can refund that money now to states, saying that is a decision only Congress can make. But she tried to find a bright side to the shutdown.\n\n\u201cA silver lining in all this is that now people can see just how important their parks are to their way of life,\u201d Jewell said.\n\nThat statement was echoed by Kevin Dahl, spokesman for the Southwest office of the National Parks Conservation Association.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise to those who pay attention that we were hit that badly,\u201d Dahl said of the local economic impact of the parks\u2019 shutdown. \u201cA lot of our hotels, restaurants, and outfitters depend on those parks being open.\u201d\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Prescott, agreed that the national parks are important to local economies, calling the loss of revenue is \u201ctragic\u201d for those who depend on it. But he laid the blame for the shutdown squarely on President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe outsized impact of President Obama\u2019s government shutdown on Arizona is an absolute shame,\u201d Gosar said in an emailed statement Monday. \u201cThe hardship this inflicted on families in Arizona, and throughout the country, is tragic. I sincerely hope that President Obama and Senate Democrats will not put the American people at risk again.\u201d\n\nThe Senate did pass a budget to keep the federal government operating in October, but House Republicans tried to send it back to the Senate with provisions to block implementation of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, that took effect Oct. 1. The Senate and White House had insisted that Obamacare was nonnegotiable, and when neither side would budge, the government was forced to partially shut down.\n\nA deal was reached on Oct. 16 to extend the budget at previous levels through early 2014, while budget negotiations continued. The deal also raised the debt ceiling, allowing the government to continue paying its bills on the eve of what some feared could be a government default.\n\nDahl said an overwhelming majority of Americans want to see parks fully funded, without such interruptions.\n\n\u201cIn all the independent polling that I have seen, no matter if you\u2019re Republican or Democrat, around 90 percent want these parks to stay completely open,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the budget stalemate is over, Dahl said the struggle is not over yet. Budget cuts from recent years have created a maintenance backlog that he is fears will make parks less tourist-friendly if they are not addressed.\n\nJewell expressed a similar concern, saying national parks have an $11.5 billion maintenance backlog that will need strong tourism and a restored budget to be met.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "index.html", "image": "http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/13/10/11-low-sign-lead.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Arizona saw a $27 million drop in spending at its national parks during October\u2019s partial federal government shutdown, with $17 million in losses at Grand Canyon National Park alone, according to a new report.
