Or vice versa. In games we pitch well, we don\u2019t score.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s a bad time to be facing the Brewers. Their 51 victories this year are the most in the majors, and they have won eight of their past 10. The Rockies are 11 games under .500 (35-46) and on the fast track toward the National League West basement.\n\nStarting pitcher Jhoulys Chacin, who won 14 games last season and was being counted on to be the Rockies\u2019 right-handed ace this season, got the Charlie Brown treatment from the slugging Brew Crew. Chacin got his socks and shoes blown off, giving up seven runs and 11 hits in just 5 innings.\n\nHis latest meltdown began in the first inning when Ryan Braun and Jonathan Lucroy singled and then jogged home on Carlos Gomez\u2019s three-run homer. It\u2019s been said that chicks dig the longball, but it should be added that the Rockies\u2019 opponents do too. Gomez\u2019s homer was the 101st given up by Colorado this season, the most in the National League. That\u2019s not just a Coors Field aberration; 48 of the homers have come on the road.\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado Rockies 4, Milwaukee Brewers 7, June 28, 2014\n\nChacin is supposed to be a sinkerball pitcher, but he\u2019s failing to get groundball outs. He served up 11 home runs in 197 innings last season. He\u2019s already given up eight in just 64 innings this year.\n\n\u201cMy game is throwing down in the zone and throwing sinkerballs, and I haven done that this year,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been missing too much in the middle of the plate. You can\u2019t do that in the big leagues.\u201d\n\nMilwaukee right-hander Matt Garza blanked Colorado for five innings until the Rockies plated two in the sixth, then two more in the seventh on a two-run single by LeMahieu.\n\nColorado had a chance to get back into the game in the eighth against reliever Will Smith. Drew Stubbs led off with a double and Troy Tulowitzki drew a walk, but Smith struck out Corey Dickerson and Wilin Rosario, and Lucroy threw out Tulowitzki at second base on a failed double steal.\n\nRockies manager Walt Weiss encourages his players to be aggressive on the bases and gives them a lot of freedom, but that\u2019s not what he wanted with pinch-hitter Charlie Culberson at the plate. \u201cNot a great play right there,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nTulo agreed with him, and shouldered the blame.\n\n\u201cI probably got a bad jump, so I probably should have stayed,\u201d he said. \u201cOn top of that, Lucroy made a perfect throw. It was bang-bang, but it can\u2019t be that close there. Looking back on it, I should have stayed if I didn\u2019t have a good jump. It was a bad play on my part and something I\u2019ll learn from.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb08\"", "article_summary": "With a 7-4 loss to the streaking Brewers at Miller Park, the Rockies have now lost four straight and 11 of their past 12.\nThe Rockies are 11 games under .500 (35-46) and on the fast track toward the National League West basement.\nPHOTOS: Colorado Rockies 4, Milwaukee Brewers 7, June 28, 2014Chacin is supposed to be a sinkerball pitcher, but he\u2019s failing to get groundball outs.\nIn games we pitch well, we don\u2019t score.\u201dAnd it\u2019s a bad time to be facing the Brewers.\nGomez\u2019s homer was the 101st given up by Colorado this season, the most in the National League."}
