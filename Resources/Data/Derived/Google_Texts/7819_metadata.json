The war against the Islamic State group, or ISIS, has also boosted arms deals in the Middle East. Now defense industry watchers worry that a Trump administration could be bad for business.\n\n\u201cAnti-Muslim rhetoric absolutely does not help when you\u2019re trying to sell to the Middle East,\u201d one lobbyist with close ties to the defense industry said.\n\nRelated: Trump and Sanders Lash Out at a Common Enemy: Free Trade\n\nIn the past year, the U.S. government has approved nearly $21 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia. More than $1 billion in weapons has been approved for the United Arab Emirates, and hundreds of millions more for Gulf Cooperation Council members Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman. That\u2019s all in addition to the $4.2 billion in arms sales Washington has approved for Iraq.\n\nGulf allies at odds with Iran have not been thrilled with the Iran nuclear deal that the Obama administration brokered last year, and the expected tradeoff was supposed to be increased arms sales to Gulf states. Kuwait and Qatar have been waiting for the administration to approve fighter jet sales. Kuwait\u2019s parliament last week approved $500 million to start buying Eurofighter warplanes made by BAE, Finmeccanica, and Airbus. But Israel, which America guarantees will retain a \u201cqualitative military edge\u201d in the region, opposes Qatar\u2019s bid to buy F-15 fighter jets. The Obama administration is negotiating a 10-year, multibillion-dollar aid package for Israel.\n\nCombine that market with the anti-Islamic comments made by Trump, who has pledged to temporarily bar all Muslims from entering the United States, and the bonds formed with allies around the world could be damaged.\n\nRelated: The Brutal Economic Truth Behind the Rise of Trump\n\n\u201cIt is certainly an issue, but it is not simply a matter of arms sales,\u201d said Anthony Cordesman, a Middle East expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former Pentagon and State Department official. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about strategic partnerships.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s nationalistic comments could have ripples beyond the Middle East. \u201cDo you really think that Europeans, or Asians, or Latin Americans are going to be any more trusting?\u201d Cordesman said.\n\nThe U.S. has increasingly relied upon Japan in recent years to counter China\u2019s growth. U.S. arms exports topped $36 billion in 2014. But Trump has accused Japan and South Korea, both major consumers of U.S. arms, of not paying enough to the U.S. for their security. \u201c[T]here could be a backlash that impacts U.S. defense firms. Japan and South Korea might seek to reduce reliance on U.S. defense imports and build their own capabilities,\u201d Callan wrote.\n\nOther candidates also have made similar statements, Cordesman said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., advocated carpet-bombing ISIS and seeing whether \u201csand can glow in the dark.\u201d\n\nAmerican made arms are considered the gold standard and there is a prestige factor that comes with buying them, a factor that plays well globally. U.S. allies are not likely to cut off arms sales entirely. \u201cThey really do want the U.S. equipment,\u201d one defense industry source said.\n\nIt\u2019s a long way from November, though. Cordesman wonders \u201chow seriously anyone outside the United States takes what candidates say.\u201d\n\nUntil they become commander in chief, that is.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Defense One.
