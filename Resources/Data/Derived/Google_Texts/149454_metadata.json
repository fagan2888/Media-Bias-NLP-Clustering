Clinical trials have shown the heart often recovers its own rhythm during that time, making the pricey defibrillators unnecessary.\n\n\"The settlements announced today demonstrate the Department of Justice's commitment to protect Medicare dollars and federal health benefits,\" said Wifredo A. Ferrer, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.\n\n\"Guided by a panel of leading cardiologists and the review of thousands of patients' charts, the extensive investigation behind the settlements was heavily influenced by evidence-based medicine.\"\n\nA 2011 study led by researchers at Duke University of 111,707 patients that received cardioverter defibrillators found that nearly a quarter received no clinical benefit. Those patients were also shown to develop significantly more post-procedural complications, including death.\n\nThe settlements, said to be among the largest of their kind, are the result of a federal whistleblower lawsuit filed in Florida 7 years ago by cardiac nurse Leatrice Ford Richards and Thomas Schuhmann, a health care reimbursement consultant.\n\nUnder the False Claims Act, the whistleblowers will reap about $38 million from the settlements. A portion of that will go to Bryan Vroon, their Atlanta-based attorney.\n\nAmong the large health-care providers involved, Hospital Corporation of America, headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, agreed to pay $15.8 million. Ascension Health, of St. Louis, Missouri, settled for $14.9 million.\n\nThe Justice Department lists all of the companies and hospitals involved in the settlement in this document.
