During this current stretch, their operating majority has ranged from as small as a 51-49 edge, to a 60-40 veto- proof majority.\n\nWith the election of New Jersey\u2019s Corey Booker to the upper chamber in October, the Democratic advantage now sits at 55-45; if the GOP wants to oust Harry Reid as majority leader, they\u2019ll need to net six seats in the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nOn paper, this is an attainable goal. Democrats are facing a much more challenging map to defend, and nearly every single one of the Republican-held seats up for grabs is considered to be safe.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect the GOP to start measuring the drapes in Reid\u2019s office just yet. Netting six Senate seats is a tall task, nearly everything needs to break the right way to pull it off.\n\nPlus, the party has failed to live up to expectations in the very recent past. Republicans were initially expected to make a strong run at a Senate majority heading into the 2012 cycle, when the political terrain appeared to be similarly favorable. They ended up losing two seats.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How Republicans can win the Senate in 2014..05/24/2016 2:03:41AM EST.", "author": "Conn Carroll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "How Republicans can win the Senate in 2014.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Bye Bye, Harry?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2014/01/01/bye-bye-harry-n1765841", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/351/553cacf0-b352-4a34-8fc7-dd8de1c42352.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "How Republicans can win the Senate in 2014.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Bye Bye, Harry?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2014/01/01/bye-bye-harry-n1765841", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/351/553cacf0-b352-4a34-8fc7-dd8de1c42352.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Bye Bye, Harry?, Conn Carroll, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd163c\"", "article_summary": "Republicans were initially expected to make a strong run at a Senate majority heading into the 2012 cycle, when the political terrain appeared to be similarly favorable.\nNetting six Senate seats is a tall task, nearly everything needs to break the right way to pull it off.\nDuring this current stretch, their operating majority has ranged from as small as a 51-49 edge, to a 60-40 veto- proof majority.\nDemocrats have controlled the United States Senate since 2007.\nWith the election of New Jersey\u2019s Corey Booker to the upper chamber in October, the Democratic advantage now sits at 55-45; if the GOP wants to oust Harry Reid as majority leader, they\u2019ll need to net six seats in the 2014 midterm elections."}
