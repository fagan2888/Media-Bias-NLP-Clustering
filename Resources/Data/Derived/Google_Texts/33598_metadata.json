House Speak\u00ader John Boehner went through two at\u00adtor\u00adneys be\u00adfore fi\u00adnally find\u00ading a third that stuck, with re\u00adports that the first two dropped out after pres\u00adsure from their oth\u00ader cli\u00adents.\n\nBut now it is get\u00adting a day in court. Judge Rose\u00admary Colly\u00ader of the U.S. Dis\u00adtrict Court for the Dis\u00adtrict of Columbia will hear ar\u00adgu\u00adments on the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion\u2019s mo\u00adtion to dis\u00admiss the law\u00adsuit, which al\u00adleges that the House doesn\u2019t have leg\u00adal stand\u00ading to sue at all.\n\nThe weird\u00adest thing about the whole case, though, is: the House ac\u00adtu\u00adally agrees with one of the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtrat\u00adive changes\u2014at least the un\u00adder\u00adly\u00ading policy.\n\nRe\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are su\u00ading over two spe\u00adcif\u00adic ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtrat\u00adive ac\u00adtions taken by the Health and Hu\u00adman Ser\u00advices De\u00adpart\u00adment: Pay\u00ading cost-shar\u00ading sub\u00adsidies to in\u00adsurers that help people with the low\u00adest in\u00adcomes without the fund\u00ading be\u00ading ap\u00adpro\u00adpri\u00adated by Con\u00adgress and uni\u00adlat\u00ader\u00adally delay\u00ading the em\u00adploy\u00ader man\u00addate\u2019s pen\u00adal\u00adties for one year.\n\nBut the House has voted more than once to post\u00adpone the em\u00adploy\u00ader man\u00addate for a year, some\u00adtimes on its own, some\u00adtimes in tan\u00addem with the in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal man\u00addate. So the GOP isn\u2019t ar\u00adguing that it op\u00adposes the delay, just that the way it was done was il\u00adleg\u00adal.\n\n\u201cWe are fo\u00adcus\u00ading spe\u00adcific\u00adally on ex\u00adec\u00adut\u00adive ac\u00adtions re\u00adlat\u00ading to the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act, but don\u2019t lose sight of the crit\u00adic\u00adal im\u00adport\u00adance of these is\u00adsues at the core of our rep\u00adres\u00adent\u00adat\u00adive demo\u00adcracy,\u201d Rep. Peter Roskam, chair\u00adman of a Ways and Means sub\u00adpan\u00adel said at a hear\u00ading last week. \u201cThe ques\u00adtion be\u00adfore us is not wheth\u00ader the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion is im\u00adple\u00adment\u00ading the health care law. It\u2019s wheth\u00ader the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion is un\u00adder\u00admin\u00ading the rule of law.

Mike Kelly ad\u00added more suc\u00adcinctly. \u201cIt\u2019s about the health care of our Con\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtion.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the tightrope that con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans have been walk\u00ading since Ju\u00adly 2013, when the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion first an\u00adnounced it would delay the man\u00addate. Just a few days after HHS said the man\u00addate wouldn\u2019t ap\u00adply in 2014 as planned, Rep. Tim Griffin of Arkan\u00adsas in\u00adtro\u00adduced a bill to do the same thing. The House passed the bill, but the Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic-led Sen\u00adate nev\u00ader took it up.\n\n\u201cThe White House may be\u00adlieve it can uni\u00adlat\u00ader\u00adally delay im\u00adple\u00adment\u00ada\u00adtion of Obama\u00adcare\u2019s em\u00adploy\u00ader man\u00addate, but only Con\u00adgress can change the law,\u201d Griffin said in a state\u00adment then.\n\nAnd that\u2019s been the con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtion ever since.\n\nBoehner noted in a Novem\u00adber op-ed ex\u00adplain\u00ading the law\u00adsuit that the House had \u201cpassed le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion to ad\u00address this prob\u00adlem.\u201d But, he wrote, \u201cthere must be ac\u00adcount\u00adab\u00adil\u00adity\u201d for the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion al\u00adlegedly cir\u00adcum\u00advent\u00ading the Con\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtion. His al\u00adlies re\u00adit\u00ader\u00adated that po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtion last week.\n\n\u201cThere have been nu\u00admer\u00adous in\u00adstances when the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion has made what many mem\u00adbers of Con\u00adgress con\u00adsider to be good changes to the law, but not with\u00adin the stat\u00adutory au\u00adthor\u00adity,\u201d Grace-Mar\u00adie Turn\u00ader, founder of the con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive Ga\u00adlen In\u00adsti\u00adtute health-care think tank, told mem\u00adbers at the over\u00adsight hear\u00ading. She cited the em\u00adploy\u00ader-man\u00addate delay spe\u00adcific\u00adally.\n\n\u201cWe can agree that the policy res\u00adult \u201c\u00a6 that the bur\u00adden on em\u00adploy\u00aders should be lim\u00adited, but the law doesn\u2019t give the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion that kind of flex\u00adib\u00adil\u00adity without Con\u00adgress, cor\u00adrect?\u201d North Car\u00ado\u00adlina Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan George Hold\u00ading asked one of oth\u00ader wit\u00adnesses at the hear\u00ading.
