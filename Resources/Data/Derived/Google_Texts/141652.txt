A Southwest Airlines plane taking off on a flight from Denver to Los Angeles turned back Sunday evening shortly after takeoff when the pilot recognized a mechanical problem, likely a blown tire.

“They did land safely and there were no reports of any injuries,” Denver International Airport spokesman Heath Montgomery said.

Denver firefighters went to the aircraft and helped guide passengers from the plane to buses.

The Southwest Airlines flight 2869 landed at 5:58 p.m.

“Early indications are it appears to be a blown tire,” Southwest spokesman Brad Hawkins said. “Our maintenance teams will have the first look and final say.”

The aircraft pilot “worked with air traffic controllers and the operational teams at the airfield to declare the emergency required to deviate from a filed flight plan and return back to DIA, the nearest point to have a better look on the ground,” Hawkins said.

Southwest staffers in Denver were working with any of the 175 customers whose travel plans may be affected.
