Col. Andr\u00e9 Dean (Ret.) spent 27 years fighting for his country as an officer in the U.S. Army.\n\nReturning home to Texas, and seeing the state of the leadership of his country, has compelled him to fight on a different battlefield \u2014 the battlefield of politics.\n\nDean, a Republican, is in Madisonville for fundraising and to raise awareness of his candidacy. He\u2019s running against Kevin Brady, the Republican incumbent in Texas 8th district.\n\n\u201cI ran against him 17 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s been in office, 19 years. That\u2019s a long time in office.\u201d\n\nDean said that years ago, while campaigning for a justice of the peace job in Brazos County, he had his first opportunity to hear Kevin Brady speak.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Oh, my gosh. That\u2019s the strength of our leadership there?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI had just come from active duty at that point, and I was used to strong, charismatic leaders, and Kevin doesn\u2019t have much of that.\u201d\n\nDean said that the incumbent doesn\u2019t feel very strongly about many things; \u201cMaybe a \u2018safe\u2019 politician is the way to describe him. But it\u2019s not my world of leadership.\u201d\n\nFor Dean, living in the 8th District, which he describes as the second most conservative district in Texas, provides the perfect base from which to lead on strong conservative issues.\n\n\u201cThat we\u2019re not is a serious lack of leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nDean began his path to leadership as student council president in Madisonville High School, because, he said, he liked \u201cbeing in the thick of trying to win the confidence of my peers, and trying to make a difference in school spirit and raising visibility of student programs.\u201d\n\nHe later achieved a master\u2019s degree in public policy from the University of Texas, where he was an aide to Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.\n\nAfter turning down a position with the CIA, he took a commission as a second lieutenant in the Army.\n\n\u201cI gave service to country in the military, and service through student council in high school,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel if you give a little extra time like that, you will make the world a better place. I would like to be in a discussion about where we are as the American People. I think I can make the world a little bit better.\u201d\n\nThe biggest change necessary, Dean said, one that he feels most passionate about, is the national debt.\n\n\u201cWe need to wage war on the $18.2 trillion national debt,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about climate change, even by the president to the midshipmen at Annapolis, that (climate change) is the greatest danger to our nation; any of the polls I read say it\u2019s not even in the top 20.\u201d\n\nDean said that if the country continues to spend more than it has, again and again, it will come to ruin.\n\n\u201cWe will be Greece, we will be Spain, we will be Italy \u2014 countries losing control of their own government because they overspend,\u201d he said.\n\nTo eliminate the debt, Dean is an advocate of the penny plan, which asks government to cut one penny of every dollar of spending each year for five years, then caps spending at 18 percent of national income.\n\nOther points that Dean advocates are:\n\n\u2022eliminating the IRS;\n\n\u2022securing the border;\n\n\u2022expunging the Affordable Care Act;\n\n\u202212-year term limits for Congress;\n\n\u2022jail Lois Lerner and Eric Holder for contempt of Congress; and\n\n\u2022pass a 30th Amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman.\n\nDean said he has become aware of a sense of despair and lost hope in the people of this country. However, he said he and his campaign are reaching to the area to let people know there\u2019s hope.\n\n\u201cIn my life, I hadn\u2019t heard, like I have recently, people throwing up their hands and saying, \u2018I give up. We\u2019re over. This nation is done,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI say, \u2018Don\u2019t say that,\u2019 and they say, \u2018Don\u2019t you see what\u2019s happening in this nation?\u2019\n\n\u201cI say we\u2019re not done. If we go through another eight years like we just went through, then I\u2019d say we\u2019re on an irreversible track, but we\u2019re not done yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we just get good people who don\u2019t care about their own wealth, who love their country and have a proven record of preparation and intelligence and can make good decisions, we can turn the ship around.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Madisonville Meteor", "description": "Lt.
