Medi-Cal is California's Medicaid program.\n\nThe brief was released by the UC-Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education and the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research (Karlamangla, Los Angeles Times, 3/25).\n\nBackground\n\nIn November 2014, Obama announced a plan to allow up to five million undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for at least five years and who have no record of felony offenses or serious misdemeanors to apply for a program to avoid deportation (California Healthline, 11/21/14). In addition, Obama expanded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (Los Angeles Times, 3/25).\n\nThe DACA program grants undocumented children legal status and authorization to work in the U.S. for two-year periods. Although Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act bars coverage for undocumented immigrants, a caveat in California allows those with \"deferred action status\" to gain coverage.\n\nUnder federal law, undocumented immigrants still are not eligible for health benefits through the ACA's exchanges (California Healthline, 11/21/14).\n\nHundreds of Thousands Could Become Eligible\n\nAccording to the Times, several states sued to stop Obama's plans, and a federal judge in Texas ordered a temporary injunction.\n\nHowever, if the injunction is lifted, about 1.25 million undocumented immigrants in California could become eligible for some sort of relief within the state.\n\nOf those, about 66% would be eligible for Medi-Cal coverage based on their income, according to the policy brief (Los Angeles Times, 3/25).\n\nSpecifically, the brief estimates that between 360,000 and 500,000 undocumented immigrants who qualify for DACA or Deferred Action for Parents of U.S. Citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents would become eligible for Medi-Cal. However, researchers do not expect all of those who become eligible to actually enroll (Lucia et al., UC-Berkeley/UCLA brief, 3/26).\n\nNadereh Poura, a UCLA professor and co-author of the brief, said, \"There are several steps [to becoming eligible and enrolling], and all those hurdles have to be cleared.\"\n\nExtra Beneficiaries Could Strain Medi-Cal\n\nSome stakeholders have expressed concerns that the Medi-Cal program would not be able to keep pace with such an increase in demand, the Times reports.\n\nThe program currently covers more than 12 million residents -- nearly one-third of the state population.\n\nObservers have said that adding hundreds of thousands of new enrollees to Medi-Cal could result in the program being unable to:\n\nCover its costs, which currently total $18 billion annually; and\n\nMaintain enough physicians to provide care to new beneficiaries.\n\nState Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), who supports expanding Medi-Cal coverage, said, \"There's just a lot of work that's still left\" (Los Angeles Times, 3/25).", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new policy brief finds that up to 500,000 undocumented Californians would become eligible for Medicaid coverage if a temporary injunction on President Obama's executive action is lifted.
