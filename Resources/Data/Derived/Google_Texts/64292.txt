HANOVER - In a 3-2 vote, the zoning board of adjustment voted to uphold an administrative decision that bars Alpha Delta fraternity from using its stately building on East Wheelock Street as student housing...Zoning board chairman Carolyn Radisch, and board members H. Bernard Waugh Jr., and Arthur Gardiner voted to uphold the decision of Hanover Zoning Administrator Judith Brotman, while Katherine Connolly and David Donegan voted against the motion...Connolly said she felt the use of the building as student housing was more than grandfathered."As far as I'm concerned, it's not only grandfathered, it's great-grandfathered," she said.Waugh said use of the house as student housing is not in contention, but rather that town zoning regulations require student housing in the Institution District to be operated in conjunction with Dartmouth College...The college ended its affiliation with the fraternity in April after a member was branded with the fraternity's letters.After a preliminary decision on the fraternity losing its affiliation with Dartmouth in early April, Hanover Zoning Administrator Judith Brotman issued the group a violation notice on April 23, saying the organization's status as an unaffiliated fraternity meant the building could no longer be used for housing, and that the fraternity would incur a $275 per-day fine until the members living in the house moved out.Gardiner added a provision to the decision allowing the fraternity time before fines would be levied...mpierce@newstote.com..
