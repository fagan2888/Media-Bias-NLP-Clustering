Rather than dreaming up every conceivable way to color or restrict constitutionally legal edibles, let\u2019s just do what Amendment 64 asked of us: to regulate these products like alcohol.\n\nThere has been no media or legislative outcry demanding that all alcohol be dyed or labeled green, red or any other color outside the bottle. And this is in spite of the fact that accidental alcohol consumption by both minors and adults is hundreds, arguably thousands, of times higher than that of cannabis.\n\nAlready, every recreational edible product is sealed in a childproof container, has a warning label, and provides specific, tested dosage information. The cannabis industry has willingly supported and complied with each of these steps as we work together for continued public education and safety.\n\nWe\u2019ve lived with legal, adult-only products for a very long time in America. We are comfortable with a mature level of responsibility being placed on the consumers of all such products.\n\nWe ask media and lawmakers to please stop making marijuana the exception. It\u2019s not what Coloradans asked for when they legalized marijuana, and it\u2019s certainly not what Colorado needs for a safe, sustainable future.\n\nAt the same time that politicians in Denver continue to call for an over-regulated new cannabis market that only bolsters black-market activity, local public polls show an increasing majority of approval of legal marijuana. Let\u2019s listen to and trust the people of Colorado instead of our own echo chamber.\n\nTyler Henson is president of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: Colorado shouldn\u2019t give up on marijuana edibles", "title": "Guest Commentary: Colorado shouldn\u2019t give up on marijuana edibles", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/03/guest-commentary-colorado-shouldnt-give-up-on-marijuana-edibles/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150403__20150405_Z00_OP05G_CHAMBERp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150403__20150405_Z00_OP05G_CHAMBERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-03T11:05:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T10:23:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbfe6\"", "article_summary": "Tyler Henson is president of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce.\nThe Denver Post\u2019s editorial board applauded lawmakers for upholding an added mandate that all edible marijuana products be specifically stamped or colored outside of the packaging.\nIt\u2019s not what Coloradans asked for when they legalized marijuana, and it\u2019s certainly not what Colorado needs for a safe, sustainable future.\nAt the same time that politicians in Denver continue to call for an over-regulated new cannabis market that only bolsters black-market activity, local public polls show an increasing majority of approval of legal marijuana.\nRe: \u201cDon\u2019t give up on marijuana edibles mandate,\u201d March 28 editorial."}
