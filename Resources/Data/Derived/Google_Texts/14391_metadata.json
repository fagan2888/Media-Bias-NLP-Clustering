Tall guy. Dark hair. Glasses. Moved to Milwaukee in August.\n\nHe did a couple of stories over the summer about Bevin and his failure to pay taxes. Bevin didn\u2019t like the stories, so, the GOP gubernatorial candidate publicly shut him out.\n\nHe refused to answer Keith\u2019s questions during press conferences and went so far as to accuse him of being on Democrat Jack Conway\u2019s payroll. As you may recall, there is a long list of reporters to whom Bevin won\u2019t speak.\n\nWhat you didn\u2019t know and what I didn\u2019t realize until this week was that Bevin had also shut out WAVE from his advertising budget \u2014 small as it may be. Since those stories ran, Bevin hasn\u2019t run a single ad on WAVE.\n\nThe campaign didn\u2019t answer an email asking why it wasn\u2019t advertising on WAVE but was buying time on the three other major stations in Louisville.\n\nBut Ken Selvaggi, the vice president and general manager at WAVE, said Bevin\u2019s media buyer told the station that Bevin had ordered the firm not to buy ads on WAVE because of the station\u2019s news coverage of him.\n\nNow, this on the surface, seems short-sighted a couple of ways.\n\nBuy Photo At the Lincoln Day Dinner in Lexington on Saturday, nominee for Governor Matt Bevin showed his support for U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell in a video featuring his use of \u2018Team Mitch\u2019 shirts and stickers, as well as interactions with McConnell. Bevin is shown here during a press conference at the Republican Party of Kentucky Headquarters in Frankfort, KY. (Photo: Frankie Steele/Special to the Courier-Journal)\n\nFirst of all, even if the news coverage has a pro-Conway flair (which I\u2019m not saying it has), the lack of advertising for Bevin ensures that viewers of WAVE get a triple dose of anti-Bevin media throughout the day with news stories, Conway campaign ads, as well as ads from a Democratic super PAC.\n\nThose messages are not being balanced by any Bevin ads, nor is it being balanced by ads from the Republican Governors Association, which, fed up with Bevin\u2019s refusal to raise money or kick more of his own in to the race, stopped advertising a few weeks ago.\n\nSecond of all, it also misses the point of commercial television stations. They aren\u2019t charities that exist to collect money from good-hearted candidates who want to enrich their owners with campaign cash. The stations provide a service in advertising that the candidates find beneficial.\n\nBy ignoring one station, they are missing out on reaching thousands upon thousands of potential voters \u2014 not just in Louisville but in the entire Louisville media market, which stretches far beyond Jefferson County. And as one television executive told me, \u201cthere are no dog stations in this market.\u201d\n\nOne is hard pressed to recall a Kentucky politician who was under more fire from the media than former Gov. Paul Patton after former WHAS-11 reporter Mark Hebert aired a story accusing him of having an affair with a woman who had received a gubernatorial appointment.\n\nIt almost cost Patton the governorship and his marriage, and it did cost him any chance of winning a U.S. Senate seat in 2004. Yet Patton never expressed anger to Hebert or tried to exact revenge on WHAS.\n\n\u201cHe told me, \u2018Mark\u2019s just doing his job,\u2019 recalled Denis Fleming, Patton\u2019s former general counsel.\n\nJoseph Gerth can be reached at (502) 582-4702 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.
