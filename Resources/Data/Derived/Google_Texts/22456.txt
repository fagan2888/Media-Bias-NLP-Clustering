Kyle Flood has been fired as Rutgers football coach, two people familiar with the decision told NJ Advance Media on Sunday.

Rutgers University President Robert Barchi confirmed the changes in a letter to the Rutgers community on Sunday afternoon.

Flood's ouster comes one day after the Scarlet Knights capped a 4-8 campaign, ending a tumultuous campaign that saw Flood get suspended for three-games for violating a university compliance policy and the arrests of seven players on various charges.
