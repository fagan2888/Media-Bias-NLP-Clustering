(ST. JOSEPH, Mo) Black Friday shopping at can be a pain, especially when it comes to those long checkout lines.



This year, managers at one of St. Joseph's Walmart stores are working to make the lines more organized.



Four bright-colored poster boards already hang from Walmart's ceiling.



Manager Joe Huber said this is part of the plan for cutting down wait times.



"This is a process we're going through that is safe, but also customer friendly try to get them through faster," said Huber.



Huber is the store manager at the Walmart on North Belt Highway in St. Joseph.



He says the labeled poster boards are his way of keeping check out lines from turning into a zoo.



"What they'll do, is they'll come through, back here in apparel behind shoes and different places, and be able to get into a line and just start the process to get checked out," said Huber.



The posters are numbered, 1, 2, 3 or 4, each representing an entry point to a different line.



Huber says they tried something similar last year, but it didn't work out so well.



"It was a lot more overcrowded. People kind of worked their way through things, instead of really having a sense of direction of where they needed to go," said Michelle Weikman, Walmart.



But Huber is confident, with the help of all his employees guiding the hundreds of shoppers, this plan will keep things organized.



"They'll be funneled along together, that way the customers don't fight each other," Huber added.



Aside from a shorter time in line, safety is also a concern.



"We just want to make sure that our customers are safe, and that they get what they need, what they come for, and that they have a good experience when they leave," added Weikman.
