Meanwhile in Trenton, legislators and business leaders continue to battle over a bill to create a statewide paid sick leave law.\n\nPiotr Marcinski, ThinkStock\n\n\u201cMy bill allows employees who currently don\u2019t earn any paid time off to earn one hour for every 30 hours worked accumulating up to either five days or ten days depending on the size of the business,\u201d said Assemblywoman Pam Lampitt (D-Voorhees).\n\nMembers of the business community testified against the legislation Thursday. Some said if the state forces them to devote resources to paying people who are not at work, they may have to make it up by cutting somewhere else.\n\n\u201cIf you are requiring businesses to pay for a worker who is not at work how do they make up those costs?\u201d asked Stefanie Riehl, assistant vice president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.\n\nLampitt said a statewide policy is needed because there are businesses with offices in cities that are offering paid sick leave to employees in those cities, but not in other Garden State municipalities where they also have offices. Lampitt called that \u201cdyslexic.\u201d\n\nMany in the business community are against the measure because they said it would represent another expensive, but unfunded state mandate.\n\n\u201cWe have to consider the fact that this policy that is being proposed is not operating by itself. We have a minimum wage increase that just happened. We have the Affordable Care Act. We have higher taxes. All of those things coupled together may very well result in a business deciding that they cannot make it in New Jersey,\u201d Riehl said\n\nCalifornia and Connecticut have statewide earned leave policies and things are going well in both states, according to Lampitt.\n\n\u201cWhat we have heard from them is that at least a-third of the industries said they\u2019ve had improved morale and good percentage of the industries have said that there has not been abuse,\u201d Lampitt explained.\n\nThe Assembly Labor Committee was scheduled to vote on the bill Thursday, but Lampitt said before the hearing that the legislation would only be discussed so that she could better understand concerns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been speaking to business leaders. I\u2019ve been speaking to employees that we want to affect positive change for and we know that there are several amendments out there,\u201d Lampitt said.\n\nMost First World countries have some sort of paid sick leave policies.\n\n\u201cA comparison of paid sick leave policies in the 22 wealthiest countries in the world finds that unfortunately the United States is the only country without a paid sick law,\u201d Eric Richard, legislative coordinator for the New Jersey State AFL-CIO, testified. \u201cIt\u2019s time for New Jersey to adapt to the needs of a changing workforce and changing society and do what the federal government hasn\u2019t done, which is to pass an earned sick leave bill into law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/nj1015.com/files/2014/10/RS4789_111932943.jpg", "sailthru.author": "kevinmcardle", "description": "Six New Jersey municipalities have earned paid sick leave statutes in place and two more are scheduled to vote on the issue in November.
