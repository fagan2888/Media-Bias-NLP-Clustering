Four days later, little has changed, except now the pool of players for the men\u2019s 2014 World Cup team roster has been whittled to 16.\n\nWizards guards John Wall and Bradley Beal, as well as Hawks forward Paul Millsap, were let go from the 19 that competed in Vegas, USA Basketball announced Tuesday.\n\nIn speaking to reporters for the first time since George\u2019s gruesome injury ended Friday\u2019s game and the camp early, U.S. coach Mike Krzyzewski and USA Basketball\u2019s managing director Jerry Colangelo offered their thoughts on the roster finalists.\n\nBut with every question, it seemed, thoughts would revert to George. And how could they not, really?\n\n\u201cWe needed a few days to sit back and let some time go by, and we did,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cThe great news there is that, in communication with the players, they are all on board. They recognize that injuries and sports go together, unfortunately, and we all have experiences that we could talk about, where players have been lost in practice, players have been lost in games and in pickup games, for seasons.\u201d\n\nColangelo said that George will soon be discharged from the hospital in Las Vegas where he underwent emergency surgery Friday to repair the open tibia-fibula fracture in his right leg.\n\nWithout George on the wing, the U.S. team, which was already stacked with backcourt players, will inevitably be smaller on the perimeter. Some of the guys who are a 2-guard, Krzyzewski said, might also need to be a small forward.\n\n\u201cWhen you lose a player of that caliber, you take a hit,\u201d Krzyzewski said of George. \u201d And especially because his willingness to be a team member and do the dirty work was right there.\u201d\n\nGeorge\u2019s defense will be among the most notable on-court losses for Team USA, but there is optimism that Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried will help to fill some of that void.\n\n\u201cHe is a really good defensive player, but he\u2019s capable of being a great defensive player,\u201d Krzyzewski said. \u201cHe can guard a center, too, for short periods of time.\n\n\u201cKenneth is a very, very good player, especially when he goes to his strengths. And defense should be one of his strengths.\u201d\n\nFaried is a \u201cdifferent\u201d player, Krzyzewski said, whose specialties are \u201crebounding and energy and good running. \u2026 Guys like playing with Kenneth.\u201d\n\nHowever, lingering effects of George\u2019s loss will be, and have already been, felt beyond the team\u2019s roster alterations.\n\nImmediately after he was hurt, it was reported that the backboard stanchion in which he jammed his right foot during the scrimmage was slightly closer to the court than those in NBA games.\n\nBut was that to blame?\n\n\u201cI think the stanchion is not the issue here,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cSome people want to make it the issue, but it isn\u2019t. It appeared to us that Paul George was already in a stressful situation the way he came down on his leg and then hit that stanchion. I think the focus is probably where it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nAmong other topics Krzyzewski and Colangelo addressed Tuesday:\n\n\u2022 On the debate about NBA players competing in international games, Colangelo said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a debate, necessarily. I think there are some opinions and it may lead to some debate that takes place among the owners.\n\n\u201d Mark Cuban\u2019s comments \u2026 I think people need to read between the lines, which is basically, he\u2019s not against international competition. He\u2019s against international competition when he believes the beneficiary, being the IOC, is getting the money. So he\u2019s basically saying it\u2019s OK for the players to play internationally if the money goes to the NBA and to the team owners. That\u2019s the difference.\u201d\n\n( Cuban later responded on Twitter with: \u201che is right. I\u2019m not against international competition when the financial benefit is shared by the player and the nba.\u201d\n\n\u2022 When asked if Kevin Love was ruled out as a possible addition to the team if his contract details are resolved with a trade, Colangelo said that they have to be \u201crealistic about his circumstances\u201d regarding his reasons for not wanting to play in the first place. \u201cChances are, that won\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nTeam USA will resume its training Aug. 14 in Chicago and will play an exhibition game against Brazil on Aug. 16 at the United Center.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4220\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe is a really good defensive player, but he\u2019s capable of being a great defensive player,\u201d Krzyzewski said.\nAnd defense should be one of his strengths.\u201dFaried is a \u201cdifferent\u201d player, Krzyzewski said, whose specialties are \u201crebounding and energy and good running.\nUSA Basketball\u2019s training camp in Las Vegas ended last Friday with emotions running high and thoughts on Paul George.\nWithout George on the wing, the U.S. team, which was already stacked with backcourt players, will inevitably be smaller on the perimeter.\n\u201cWhen you lose a player of that caliber, you take a hit,\u201d Krzyzewski said of George."}
