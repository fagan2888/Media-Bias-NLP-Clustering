I\u2019m drinking less and getting help for my bones and my heart,\u201d said Tommie Faccio. \u201cHaving a home saved my life.\u201d\n\nFaccio and 27 other \u2018hardcore\u2019 homeless people were recruited to participate in Project 25 (originally aimed at the 25 most costly but it grew to include 36). The pilot project was designed to test the cost-effectiveness of the emerging housing first model.\n\n\u201cData has always been a problem in these studies,\u201d said economist Lynn Reaser, of the Fermanian Business & Economics Institute at Point Loma Nazarene University, who wrote the independent analysis. \u201cThis was the first study with very good data \u2013 it was meticulously designed to have accurate, consistent data.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is some resistance to the housing first approach, which turns the current model of services for the homeless on its head,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to have solid research and conclusions that are reached from unimpeachable data.\u201d\n\nThe data used for the analysis was that of the 28 participants where they were involved for the whole program, and data was thorough and accurate. Much of the data came from hospitals and ambulance services, since nearly all of the costs involved getting to and staying in hospitals.\n\nThe conclusion: even with the costs of intense case management, the rent, the investment in medical care, putting people in homes reduced costs to local government by $1.6 million the first year and $2.1 million the second year.\n\nAlmost 94 percent of the 2010 costs of $3.5 million were connected to medical care; 64 percent went for hospital care, another 22 percent for ER visits; and 8 percent for ambulance trips to the hospital. The remaining six percent went for jail time and police services.\n\nBy 2012, the first full year of tracking, those costs had dropped to $1.5 million and by 2013, costs were down to $1.1 million. Arrests and ER visits were down 78 percent; the length of hospital stays fell by more than 2/3, and costs per person had dropped from 2010\u2019s $111,000 per person to $11,717.\n\nTypical was the experience of one client known as \u201cHutch.\u201d In 2010, he used public services cosing more than $168,000, including 48 ER visits and 64 days of inpatient care. In 2012 and 2013, given a place to live, those numbers dropped dramatically. He spent one day in the emergency room each year, no nights in the hospital and no ambulance trips. He died in July 2014 of natural causes after 11 months of sobriety.\n\n\u201cAlmost all were eligible for services and financial assistance, like social security disability payments and food subsidies and MediCal that they couldn\u2019t access and maintain without an address,\u201d Reaser said. \u201cAs they became more stable, they became less expensive.\u201d\n\nProject 25 began in 2011 when the United Way of San Diego brought $1.5 million to the table as seed money for the project \u2013 and the collection of data to see if it was effective. St. Vincent de Paul Village provided services for 16 clients and coordinated the rest with San Diego County.\n\nWith apartment rental vouchers provided by the San Diego Housing Commission, and a contract with a medical provider to create a \u2018medical home,\u2019 St. Vincent de Paul social worker Marc Stevenson began approaching the people they\u2019d identified as the greatest consumers of services.\n\n\u201cThese individuals were the last to have a chance to receive housing,\u201d Reaser said. \u201cNone them can be sent back to work. Almost all have mental health issues. Most have significant substance abuse issues. Many have significant health challenges.\u201d\n\nThey were savvy about living on the street \u2013 they knew the cops, where the services are, that you can shelter in an emergency room lobby for a long time, who had a motel room and a bus pass. And they were wary of the program at the beginning.\n\n\u201cMany of our folks have significant relationships with other homeless people, and they worried that having a home would disconnect them from their community,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t trust us very much and it took time and commitment to form relationships.\u201d\n\nIt also took time and commitment to find landlords willing to accept them as tenants \u2013 especially in an area with a very low apartment vacancy rate and a low number of Section VIII rental units.\n\nThe medical \u2018home\u2019 \u2013 or as Stevenson says, one white coat \u2013 was critical to the program success. The combination of having a relationship with one doctor and medical team, and having a home proved critical to the sustained health improvements that clients saw \u2013 which, in turn, reduced the trips to and days in the hospital.\n\n\u201cPeople with health issues want a relationship with someone they can trust, and they will work with that trusted care-giver to improve their health and the quality of their lives,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cWe were surprised by how much our peoples\u2019 physical and mental health improved and how that lead to less substance abuse and even choosing sobriety because they didn\u2019t need to self-medicate.\u201d\n\nBut even with the success of the pilot project and its ironclad data, no one has taken the lead to implement a housing first approach.\n\n\u201cIt was an incredible success that demonstrates we can achieve deep, deep cost savings,\u201d says Jennifer LeSar, a Housing First advocate. \u201cBut it requires that we have coordination and collaboration between public agencies \u2013 someone has to take the lead and be the homelessness czar to move this great pilot to scale at a regional level.\u201d\n\nSince most of the savings was in medical costs \u2013 much of which is borne by insurance companies in the post-Affordable Care Act world, LeSar says that insurance companies are the key beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cThey should be motivated to commit to managing costs for this medically fragile population,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hope to see insurance companies become partners in the housing first approach since they benefit so much.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 1374972679394361}, "description": "Originally posted at California Health Report.
