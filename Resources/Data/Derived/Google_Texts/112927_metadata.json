U.S. companies will also face fewer checks than in the past when selling some military aircraft to dozens of countries.\n\nCritics, including some who\u2019ve worked on enforcing arms export laws, say the changes could undermine efforts to prevent arms smuggling to Iran and others.\n\nBrake pads may sound innocuous, but \u201cthe Iranians are constantly looking for spare parts for old U.S. jets,\u201d said Steven Pelak, who recently left the Department of Justice after six years overseeing investigations and prosecutions of export violations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be easier for these military items to flow, harder to get a heads-up on their movements, and, in theory, easier for a smuggling ring to move weapons,\u201d said William Hartung, author of a recent report on the topic for the Center for International Policy.\n\nIn the current system, every manufacturer and exporter of military equipment has to register with the State Department and get a license for each planned export. U.S. officials scrutinize each proposed deal to make sure the receiving country isn\u2019t violating human rights and to determine the risk of the shipment winding up with terrorists or another questionable group.\n\nUnder the new system, whole categories of equipment encompassing tens of thousands of items will move to the Commerce Department, where they will be under more \u201cflexible\u201d controls. Final rules have been issued for six of 19 categories of equipment and more will roll out in the coming months. Some military equipment, such as fighter jets, drones, and other systems and parts, will stay under the State Department\u2019s tighter oversight.\n\nCommerce will do interagency human rights reviews before allowing exports, but only as a matter of policy, whereas in the State Department it is required by law.\n\nThe switch from State to Commerce represents a big win for defense manufacturers, who have long lobbied in favor of relaxing U.S. export rules, which they say put a damper on international trade. Among the companies that recently lobbied on the issue: Lockheed, which manufactures C-130 transport planes, Textron, which makes Kiowa Warrior helicopters, and Honeywell, which outfits military choppers.\n\nOverall, industry trade groups and big defense companies have spent roughly $170 million over the last three years lobbying on a variety of issues, including export control reform, a ProPublica analysis of disclosure forms shows.\n\nThe administration says in a factsheet that \u201cspending time and resources protecting a specialty bolt diverts resources from protecting truly sensitive items,\u201d and that the effort will allow them to build \u201chigher fences around fewer items.\u201d Commerce says it will beef up its enforcement wing to prevent illegal re-exports or shipments to banned entities. The military has also supported the relaxed controls, arguing that the changes will make it easier to arm foreign allies.\n\nAn interview with Commerce Department officials was canceled due to the government shutdown, and the State Department did not respond to questions.\n\nThe shift is part of a larger administration initiative to update the arms export process, which many acknowledge needed to be streamlined. But critics of the move to Commerce say that decision has been overly driven by the interests of defense manufacturers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve cut through the fat, into the meat, and to the bone,\u201d said Brittany Benowitz, who was defense adviser to former Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisc., and recently co-authored a paper on the pending changes.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that the views of the enforcement agencies and actors charged with carrying out the controls haven\u2019t won the day,\u201d said Pelak, the former Justice Department official.\n\nCurrent controls haven\u2019t prevented the U.S. from dominating arms exports up to now: In 2011, the U.S. concluded $66 billion in arms sales agreements, nearly 80 percent of the global market. The State Department denied just one percent of arms export licenses between 2008 and 2010.\n\nAt a recent hearing, a State Department official touted the economic benefits, saying the \u201cdefense industry is going to become even more competitive than they are already.\u201d\n\nUnder the new policy, military helicopters, transport planes and other types of military equipment that typically need approval may be eligible for license-free export to 36 allied governments, including much of Europe, Argentina, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand.\n\nAccording to Colby Goodman, an arms-control expert with the Open Society Policy Center, once an item is approved for that exemption, it\u2019s not clear that there will be any ongoing, country-specific human rights review. (The State Department hasn\u2019t yet responded to our request for comment on that point.)\n\nGoodman is particularly concerned about Turkey, where in the last year authoritiesviolently suppressed protests and \u201csecurity forces committed unlawful killings,\u201d according to the most recent State Department Human Rights report.\n\nUnder the new system, some military parts can now be sent license-free to any country besides China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria. Other parts that are deemed not \u201cspecially designed\u201d for military use, while also initially banned from those countries, have even fewer restrictions on re-exports.\n\nSpare parts are in high demand from sanctioned countries and groups, which need them to keep old equipment up and running, according to arms control researchers. Indonesia scrambled to keep its C-130s in the air after the U.S. blocked exports for human rights violations in the 1990s. In a report on trade in arms parts, Oxfam noted that by the time of the 2011 NATO intervention in Libya, Muammar Qaddafi\u2019s air combat fleet was in dire shape, referred to by one analyst as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest military parking lot.\u201d Goodman said Congolese militia members may be using aging arms that the U.S. sold decades ago to the former Zaire.\n\n\n\n\n\nPelak says the changes will make enforcement harder by getting rid of part of the paper trail as parts and munitions exit the U.S.: \u201cWhen you take away that licensing record, you put the investigation overseas.\u201d His office handled dozens of cases each year in which military items had been diverted to prohibited countries. The Government Accountability Office raised concerns last year about Commerce\u2019s enforcement abilities as it takes control of exports that once went through the State Department.\n\nThe president is authorized \u2013 in fact, required \u2013 to revise the list of items under State Department control. But the massive shift to Commerce means that laws and regulations that were designed with the longstanding State Department system in place may now be up to presidential prerogative.\n\nVetting for human rights compliance is one such requirement. The Commerce Department said it will also continue to publicly report the sales of so-called \u201cmajor defense equipment.\u201d\n\nOther laws may not get carried over, however. For example, if firearms are moved to Commerce, manufacturers may no longer have to notify Congress of foreign sales.\n\nSeveral organizations, including the Center for International Policy, the Open Society Policy Center, and the American Bar Association\u2019s Center for Human Rights, have called on the administration to hold off moving some military items from the State Department, and have asked Congress to apply State\u2019s reporting requirements and restrictions to more of the military items and parts soon to be under Commerce control.\n\nIn one area, the administration does appear to have temporarily backed off \u2013 firearms and ammunition. Any decision to loosen exports for firearms could have conflicted with the president\u2019s call for enhanced domestic gun control.\n\nAccording to a memo obtained by the Wall Street Journal last spring, the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security both opposed draft versions of revisions to the firearms category. (The Justice Department press office is out of operation due to the government shutdown, and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.) Shifting firearms was also likely to be a lightning rod for arms control groups. As the New York Times\u2019 C.J. Chivers has documented, small arms trafficking has been the scourge of conflicts around the world.\n\nDraft rules for firearms and ammunitions were ready in mid-2012, according to Lawrence Keane, general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group for gun manufacturers. The Commerce Department even sent representatives to an industry export conference to preview manufacturers on the new system they might fall under.\n\nBut since the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., last December, no proposed rule has been published.\n\nKeane thinks the connection is irrelevant. \u201cThis has nothing to do with domestic gun control legislation. We\u2019re talking about exports,\u201d he said. \u201cOur products have not moved forward, and we\u2019re disappointed by that.\u201d\n\nThe defense industry has long pushed for a loosening of the U.S. export controls. Initial wish-lists were aimed at restructuring and speeding up the State Department system, where the wait for a license had sometimes stretched to months. The current focus on moving items to Commerce began under the Obama administration.\n\nThe aerospace industry has been particularly active, as new rules for aircraft are the first to take effect. Commercial satellites had been moved briefly to Commerce in the 1990s, but when U.S. space companies were caught giving technical data to China in 1998, Congress returned them to State control. Last year, satellite makers successfully lobbied Congress to lift satellite-specific rules that had kept them from being eligible for the reforms.\n\nNewer industries want to cash in, too. Virgin Galactic wrote in a comment on a proposed rule that the \u201cnascent but growing\u201d space tourism industry was hindered by current rules. At a conference in 2011, the chief executive of Northrup Grumman warned of \u201cthe U.S. drone aircraft industry losing its dominance\u201d if exports weren\u2019t boosted. (Drones are regulated under missile technology controls, and are mostly unaffected by the current changes.)\n\nLauren Airey, of the National Association of Manufacturers, named two main objections to the current system. First off, fees: Any company that makes a product on the State Department list has to be registered whether or not they actually export, with yearly costs starting at $2,500. There\u2019s no fee for the Commerce list.\n\nSecondly, any equipment that contains a listed part gets \u201clifetime controls,\u201d Airey said. If a buyer wants to resell something, even for scrap, they need U.S. approval. (For example, the U.S. is currently debating whether to let Turkey re-sell American attack helicopters to Pakistan.) Under Commerce, \u201cthere are still limitations, but they are more flexible,\u201d Airey said.\n\nAirey\u2019s association (and other trade groups) makes the case that foreign competitors are \u201ctaking advantage of perceived and real issues in U.S. export controls to promote foreign parts and components \u2013 advertising themselves as State-Department-free.\u201d Airey demurred when asked for an estimate on the amount of business lost: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put a number directly on how much export controls cause U.S. companies to be avoided.\u201d\n\nAn Aerospace Industries Association executive noted at a panel this spring, \u201cWe really did not move the needle at all by complaining about the fact that we weren\u2019t making as much money as we wanted to.\u201d\n\nBut at a recent hearing of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, members of Congress highlighted economic impact.\n\n\u201cIn my district in Rhode Island,\u201d said David Cicilline, D-R.I., \u201cas many of our defense companies are looking to expand their business, really, to respond to declines in defense domestic spending, international sales are becoming even more important and really critical\u2026to the job growth in my state.\u201d\n\nWilliam Keating, D-Mass., said that \u201cwith declining defense budgets, arms sales are even more critical to the defense industry in my state to maintain production lines and keep jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would not have been the response a decade ago,\u201d said one staffer who works on the issue. \u201cNational security hawks would have been worried about defense items moving to the Commerce list. The environment on the Hill has dramatically changed.\u201d\n\nOne concern came from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which believes that easing controls on military technology and software could actually lead to more outsourcing of production.\n\nWilliam Lowell, who spent a decade of his 30 years at the State Department directing defense trade controls, told ProPublica that the move represents a major shift in the U.S. attitude towards international arms trade. U.S. policy has long been aimed at \u201cdenying the entry of U.S. military articles of any type into the international gray arms market \u2013 for which small arms and military parts are the lifeblood,\u201d Lowell wrote in comments opposing the new rules. \u201cCommercial arms exports have never been considered normal commercial trade.\u201d\n\n\u2013Cora Currier, ProPublica", "article_metadata": {"description": "The United States is loosening controls over military exports, in a shift that former U.S. officials and human rights advocates say could increase the flow of American-made military parts to the world\u2019s conflicts and make it harder to enforce arms sanctions.
