The 50-mile stretch of road will reopen at 3 p.m.\n\nThe news comes as a welcome surprise after city officials had earlier said they didn\u2019t expect the road to reopen until Thursday at the earliest.\n\nIn order to open the rural two-lane highway, crews had to clear debris estimated at hundreds of feet long and up to 40 feet deep. They also had to contend with a chance of severe flooding from water that was pooling up behind the avalanche.\n\nBut that water was sufficiently draining underneath the huge snow dam, city officials said.\n\nRichardson Hwy remains blocked by water &snow after Fri #avalanche but life in #Valdez goes on http://t.co/MbpGyEgLe1 pic.twitter.com/RJ09aGOTt0 \u2014 KTUU.com (@Ch2KTUU) January 29, 2014\n\nAvalanche experts say the unseasonably warm temperatures across Alaska this month contributed to the record landslide.\n\nResidents, meanwhile, have had to rely on either a ferry or flight service if they wanted to get out of Valdez. Safeway, the only major grocery store in the city, has been shipping in barges of food to ensure the community wouldn\u2019t be without essentials.\n\nGetting fresh produce, however, has been tricky, residents say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a great time to get a salad,\u201d Laurie Prax, who owns local radio station KVAK, told NBC News on Tuesday.\n\nWhile having your town\u2019s sole highway closed off might sound scary, Prax assures that it has been business as usual for most residents. Valdez, along southern Alaska\u2019s Prince William Sound, is normally \u201claid back\u201d precisely because it\u2019s isolated, she added. (Anchorage is a six-hour drive away.)\n\n\u201cIf anything, you learn to plan ahead of time even more,\u201d Prax said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Residents of a small Alaska city choked off by a monster avalanche can rejoice: The sole highway in and out of town is no longer blocked and will reopen Wednesday, officials said.\nSince a series of landslides on Jan. 24 and 25 sent debris crashing down o", "author": "U.S. News", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Residents of a small Alaska city choked off by a monster avalanche can rejoice: The sole highway in and out of town is no longer blocked and will reopen Wednesday, officials said.\nSince a series of landslides on Jan. 24 and 25 sent debris crashing down o", "title": "Road into Alaska town cut off by avalanche set to reopen", "url": "http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/02/04/22573344-road-into-alaska-town-cut-off-by-avalanche-set-to-reopen", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/g-cvr-140128-alaska-avalanche-11a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": 22573344, "section": "{\"domainName\":\"usnews\",\"displayName\":\"U.S. News\",\"avatar\":\"http:\\/\\/m.static.newsvine.com\\/servista\\/imagesizer?file=null-null241F51EE-A064-FA2F-4165-00271F9FF35C.jpg&width=30\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/usnews.nbcnews.com\\/\",\"type\":\"group\",\"ass\":\"\",\"groupId\":\"4952\",\"articleCount\":\"13904\",\"seedCount\":\"13056\",\"memberCount\":\"54\",\"description\":\"Stories from NBC reporters around the country.\",\"createDate\":1189092600,\"groupType\":null,\"groupTypeId\":\"5\",\"blessed\":0,\"lastPub\":1464304368,\"isEnabled\":1}", "title": "Road into Alaska town cut off by avalanche set to reopen - U.S. News", "trackData": "{\"section\":\"US news\",\"subSection\":\"usnewsfranchise\",\"sitePageId\":\"a22573344\",\"headline\":\"Road into Alaska town cut off by avalanche set to reopen\",\"pageSource\":\"U.S. News\",\"typeName\":\"Story\",\"byline\":\"U.S. News\",\"tags\":[\"alaska\",\"snow\",\"avalanche\",\"valdez\"],\"seedSource\":\"\"}", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"asap\", \"load_pers\":\"1\"}", "cip": "208.185.118.4", "nv": {"contentId": 22573344, "contentType": "n"}, "date": "May 26, 2016, 5:14 pm", "server": "web09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "canonical": "http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/02/04/22573344-road-into-alaska-town-cut-off-by-avalanche-set-to-reopen"}, "article_summary": "Avalanche activity is shown in Keystone Canyon on Richardson Highway, about 12 miles north of Valdez, Alaska, on Jan. 26, 2014.\nResidents of a small Alaska city choked off by a monster avalanche can rejoice: The sole highway in and out of town is no longer blocked and will reopen Wednesday, officials said.\nThe news comes as a welcome surprise after city officials had earlier said they didn\u2019t expect the road to reopen until Thursday at the earliest.\nBut that water was sufficiently draining underneath the huge snow dam, city officials said.\nThey also had to contend with a chance of severe flooding from water that was pooling up behind the avalanche."}
