Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille says it's time reconsider the city's tradition of flying the Confederate flag twice a year at a busy Old Town intersection.

The city raises three "stars and bars'' flags at the intersection of Prince and Washington streets on Robert E. Lee's birthday in January and on Confederate Memorial Day in May. A statue dedicated to Confederate war sits in the middle of that same intersection.

Euille told The Washington Post that he expects the city council to take up the issue when it reconvenes in September and that he would like to end the practice.
