Germany, which expects the influx of refugees and migrants to quadruple to about 800,000 this year, has witnessed more than 100 arson attacks on asylum shelters in recent months.\n\n\"One resident who tried to rescue himself by jumping out of a window from the second floor was seriously wounded,\" police spokeswoman Christiane Kobus said in a statement.\n\nFour people were slightly injured by smoke poisoning, she said. More than 60 refugees from countries such as Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Ethiopia were accommodated in the three-storey residential building.\n\n\"The fire was extinguished quickly. According to initial findings, the fire emerged behind the entrance door for unknown reasons,\" Kobus said. Police and state prosecutors had started an investigation into the cause of the fire, she said.\n\nMost of the recent attacks on asylum shelters in Germany have been on empty buildings slated to become shelters. However, politicians have warned that it was only a matter of time before refugees might be hurt.\n\nEurope is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. The crisis has strained the European Union's asylum system to breaking point, divided its 28 nations and fed the rise of right-wing populists.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Paul Tait)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There was no immediate indication of how the blaze began.", "title": "German police say five people hurt in fire at refugee shelter", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/04/German-police-say-five-people-hurt-fire-refugee-shelter", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-germany-fire_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/04/German-police-say-five-people-hurt-fire-refugee-shelter", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-germany-fire_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There was no immediate indication of how the blaze began.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3778\"", "article_summary": "Most of the recent attacks on asylum shelters in Germany have been on empty buildings slated to become shelters.\nEurope is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.\nGermany, which expects the influx of refugees and migrants to quadruple to about 800,000 this year, has witnessed more than 100 arson attacks on asylum shelters in recent months.\nHowever, politicians have warned that it was only a matter of time before refugees might be hurt.\nMore than 60 refugees from countries such as Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Ethiopia were accommodated in the three-storey residential building."}
