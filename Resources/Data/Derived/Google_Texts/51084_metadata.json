Elizabeth Warren recounted a dinner she had with President Barack Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Summers, in April 2009, when Warren was the outspoken chairman of a congressionally appointed panel probing the government\u2019s response to the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cLarry leaned back in his chair and offered me some advice. \u2026 He teed it up this way: I had a choice. I could be an insider or I could be an outsider. Outsiders can say whatever they want. But people on the inside don\u2019t listen to them. Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas. People \u2013 powerful people \u2013 listen to what they have to say. But insiders also understand one unbreakable rule. They don\u2019t criticize other insiders.\u201d\n\nAdditional Images More than 300 former campaign staffers and organizers for President Obama have signed a letter urging Sen.

She\u2019s remained outspoken, but has become even more influential. She hasn\u2019t stopped throwing bombs at the rich and powerful, but she\u2019s won a spot in Senate leadership, changed the shape of congressional debates over financial regulation and continued to draw widespread attention as a potential presidential candidate.\n\nIt all helps to explain why \u2013 for the 300 former Obama campaign officials who last week urged her to run in 2016 \u2013 she is the one they\u2019ve been waiting for.\n\n\u201cRising income inequality is the challenge of our times, and we want someone who will stand up for working families and take on the Wall Street banks and special interests that took down our economy,\u201d they wrote.\n\nOver the past week, Warren galvanized liberals across Capitol Hill against a government spending bill that weakened a key provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law tightening oversight of Wall Street.\n\nThe Senate may have passed the legislation late Saturday, but it was not before Warren and other liberals asserted their power in a confrontation with the White House, even winning over House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who had previously supported the legislation.\n\nWarren is also in an unusually public battle with the White House and Treasury Department over Antonio Weiss, an investment banker tapped for a key Treasury position. White House officials say Weiss is sympathetic to Democratic views. But Warren has won over several colleagues in trying to block the nomination, saying the administration is too cozy with Wall Street.\n\nIt\u2019s a topic she reprised in a speech Friday evening after losing the battle over the spending bill, in which see singled out Citigroup as an example of a bank with too much power.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough with Wall Street insiders getting key position after key position and the kind of cronyism we have seen in the executive branch,\u201d she said. \u201cEnough is enough with Citigroup passing 11th-hour deregulatory provisions that nobody takes ownership over but that everybody comes to regret. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\nCritics of Warren, even if they\u2019re sympathetic to her view, would say that by taking absolutist positions, she won\u2019t achieve much more than fiery rhetoric.\n\nThe history of Obama\u2019s presidency is a story of compromises that disappointed liberals but achieved policy gains, including the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTo the degree Obama seeks congressional accords in his final two years, he will be forging them with Republican leadership. But should he move far in hopes of a compromise with the GOP, Obama will likely find Warren leading a liberal flank in opposition. It\u2019s hard to know if she would succeed, but the past few weeks show that she has the influence to make a difference.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the U.S. senator from Massachusetts continues to speak out against special interests \u2013 Washington is listening.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "As the U.S. senator from Massachusetts continues to speak out against special interests \u2013 Washington is listening.", "title": "Elizabeth Warren\u2019s outspoken ways gain influence - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/554322_330238-Warren-2016_Quin.jpg", "height": 959}, "updated_time": "2014-12-15T08:26:01-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/12/14/elizabeth-warrens-outspoken-ways-gain-influence/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the U.S. senator from Massachusetts continues to speak out against special interests \u2013 Washington is listening.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/554322_330238-Warren-2016_Quin.jpg", "title": "Elizabeth Warren\u2019s outspoken ways gain influence - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Nation & World", "published_time": "2014-12-14T19:06:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-15T08:26:01-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc06b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEnough is enough with Wall Street insiders getting key position after key position and the kind of cronyism we have seen in the executive branch,\u201d she said.\nWhite House officials say Weiss is sympathetic to Democratic views.\nWarren is also in an unusually public battle with the White House and Treasury Department over Antonio Weiss, an investment banker tapped for a key Treasury position.\nTo the degree Obama seeks congressional accords in his final two years, he will be forging them with Republican leadership.\nThe Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192Warren ignored the warning."}
