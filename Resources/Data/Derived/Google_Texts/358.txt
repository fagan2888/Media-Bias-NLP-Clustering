Throughout his 18-plus seasons in the NBA, Kobe Bryant has drawn comparisons to Michael Jordan for obvious reasons. Now the Lakers great and five-time champion is on the verge of passing His Airness at No. 3 on the NBA’s all-time scoring list, a feat he’s all but certain to achieve Sunday at Minnesota (he needs only nine points).

The Denver Nuggets, for better or worse, deserve some credit here. Although Bryant has posted his best scoring average (27.9 points per game) against the Golden State Warriors and has saved the most 40-plus-point games for the Phoenix Suns (11), he scored 40 or more against the Nuggets nine times, tied with Houston for the third-most. (He did it to the Warriors 10 times.)

Here’s a look back at those nine games against the Nuggets, starting with his first two on back-to-back nights:
