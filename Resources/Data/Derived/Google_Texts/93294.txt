A man in psychological distress apparently cut off his own hand and was found naked outside by a neighbor Sunday night, Aurora police and fire officials said.

He used a hand tool inside his garage, where his left hand was found.

His name was not released. He was in serious but stable condition at Medical Center of Aurora South on Sunday night.

A neighbor saw the man in a back yard in the 2700 block of South Mobile Street and called for help just before 6 p.m.

The hand was recovered from the man’s garage, said Wendy Lippman, a spokeswoman for Aurora Fire Department.

Police took the lead in the case at that point, she said.

Lt. Eric Wittman said that although Aurora police assisted the fire department with the call, there was nothing criminal about the self-mutilation. “It wasn’t criminal in nature, because it involved a person doing this to himself.”

The man’s age was not released.

“I can tell you it’s not a child or a young adult,” Wittman said. “It was a full-grown adult who, obviously, was having a psychological episode.”
