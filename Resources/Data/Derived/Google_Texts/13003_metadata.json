But it\u2019s important to note that the Silver State has correctly picked the eventual winner of the presidential election, with only one exception, since 1908.

As Nevada historian Guy Rocha says: \u201cWe are the bellwether, no other state has been better.\u201d With Nevada being such an important swing state some constituents with a particular degree of \u201cpull\u201d have decided to try to endorse Hillary as only they (legally) can. Yup, the prostitutes from the \u201cMoonlite Bunny Ranch\u201d (link absolutely NSFW) have officially endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. According to proprietor Dennis Hof, \u201cAir Force Amy has announced that she\u2019s going to give another half-hour to any donor who donates to Hillary.
