During every other month of the year, however, an overall decline was observed by researchers at Gallup.\n\n\u201cIt is common for presidents to have an extended period of decline in approval at the start of a presidency. It\u2019s the reality check after the honeymoon, and Obama also experienced this,\u201d a release on their findings states. \u201cIt is also common to see extended downturns in approval following a major job approval rally such as George H.W. Bush experienced after the 1991 Gulf War, and George W. Bush experienced after 9/11.\u201d\n\nThe release continued, \u201cIt has been less common to see sustained periods of significant decline during the normal course of a presidency, such as what Obama experienced this year, his fifth in office.\u201d\n\nHis attempts at more stringent gun control legislation and the budget sequestration reportedly took their toll on his numbers earlier on in 2013. The botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature health care legislation, and the government shutdown are said to have contributed to his decline in popularity later in the year.\n\nThose involved in the polling feel that these issues and others may continue to have a negative effect on Obama\u2019s approval ratings.\n\nThey noted, \u201cAs long as these issues linger, particularly without major progress felt on the economy, Obama\u2019s job rating could continue to languish in 2014 and beyond.\u201d\n\nFor the past two weeks, Obama and his family have been enjoying the longest vacation to Hawaiian islands of his presidency. He and daughters Malia and Sasha returned to the White House on Sunday after the trip, which spanned Christmas and New Year\u2019s.\n\nObama has spent most of his vacation playing golf and staying in a rented home in the sleepy suburb of Kailua on Oahu\u2019s eastern coast.\n\nMichelle Obama stayed behind to spend time with friends ahead of her upcoming 50th birthday party. The White House says the extra time in the islands is part of Mrs. Obama\u2019s birthday gift from the president.\n\nThe first lady turns 50 on Jan. 17. The White House did not say when she planned to return to Washington.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
