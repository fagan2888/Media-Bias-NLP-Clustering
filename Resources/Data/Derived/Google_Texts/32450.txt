“Father God, we ask that you just be with us, continue to love us today, tomorrow and forever like we've never felt it before,” a Crutcho school board member said as she prayed.



“I'm sorry,” Bowser said.



Bowser could barely speak before he broke down in tears. The rifle he was holding last Thursday accidentally discharged, killing Lebron Davis.



Keandre and Bell were present at the time of the shooting inside a Midwest City home.



“He was in my arms. I cried," recalled Bell. "My boy died in my arms, but all I can say is he in a better place. That's all I can say.”



“I can't get over it, I really can't,” said Lebron's brother, Mikhael Hobby. “I just miss my little brother, that's all that is.”



An entire community came out to show their support for Lebron's family with a message of hope.

“Send your Holy Spirit to comfort them right now,” a Crutcho school board member said.



“Every day that I see pictures, I still believe that he's still in that room next door to me,” Hobby said.



“I know he's looking down on me and everything,” said Bell. “He's looking down on all of us.”



The Oklahoma City Police Department donated 100 gun locks to the community Wednesday.
