Bowe Bergdahl 's Article 32 preliminary hearing has recommended that the soldier accused of desertion avoid jail time for his actions, according to Bergdahl's civil defense attorney.\n\nLt. Col. Mark Visger's report to Gen. Robert Abrams , the head of Army Forces Command who is in charge of the case, also will advise that the matter be decided at a special court-martial, lawyer Eugene Fidell told Army Timeson Saturday, confirming reports in other media outlets. Soldiers facing special courts-martial can receive no more than a year in jail and no worse than a bad-conduct discharge; punishments regarding hard labor and pay forfeiture have similar restrictions.\n\nVisger also recommended Bergdahl not face a punitive discharge for his alleged actions, Fidell said. A memo from Bergdahl's defense team to Visger regarding the report \u2014 released late Friday by Fidell to media members \u2014 said the officer's recommendations didn't go far enough and requested nonjudicial punishment, better known as an Article 15, instead of a special court-martial.\n\nVisger isn't the first officer connected with the case to recommend against jail time; Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl, who was charged with investigating Bergdahl's 2009 capture by the Taliban , testified last month that the now-29-year-old soldier should not be imprisoned for his actions.\n\nThe memo to Visger also requests that his report be made public \u2014 a familiar request from Fidell regarding evidence related to the case.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/10/lawyer_bergdahl_to_get_little_or_no_jail_time.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Lawyer: Bergdahl to get little or no jail time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6fd\"", "article_summary": "Bowe Bergdahl 's Article 32 preliminary hearing has recommended that the soldier accused of desertion avoid jail time for his actions, according to Bergdahl's civil defense attorney.\nVisger also recommended Bergdahl not face a punitive discharge for his alleged actions, Fidell said.\nThe memo to Visger also requests that his report be made public \u2014 a familiar request from Fidell regarding evidence related to the case.\nSoldiers facing special courts-martial can receive no more than a year in jail and no worse than a bad-conduct discharge; punishments regarding hard labor and pay forfeiture have similar restrictions.\nVisger isn't the first officer connected with the case to recommend against jail time; Maj.
