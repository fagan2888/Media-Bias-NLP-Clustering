Guti\u00e9rrez warns of last GOP president\n\nDemocratic Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez said Tuesday that if House Republicans don\u2019t help to pass immigration reform in 2014, George W. Bush will be \u201cthe last Republican president in American history.\u201d\n\n\u201cLatino voters are repelled, and the loud but small contingent of immigration opponents have backed the Republican Party into a corner that they don\u2019t have the courage to break out of,\u201d the Illinois congressman said in a speech on the House floor. \u201cSo, Mr. Speaker, I give you George W. Bush, the man who will go down in history as the last Republican president in American history. Tom Donohue is right: There is a demographic reality that will make Republicans a footnote in history \u2014 just like the Whigs and Know-Nothings \u2014 unless they do something to get the immigration issue off the table.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez was referring to U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue, who last week said Republicans \u201cshouldn\u2019t bother to run a candidate in 2016\u201d if Congress doesn\u2019t pass immigration reform this year.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: States take on immigration)\n\nIn his speech, Guti\u00e9rrez added that the House needs to act before the July 4 holiday if it wants any chance at approving legislation, given that the 2014 midterm campaign will ramp up during the summer.\n\nThe congressman has long been a fierce advocate for immigration reform. In 2011, he was arrested in front of the White House while participating in an immigration rally. He has often criticized President Barack Obama for his deportation policy and for what Guti\u00e9rrez called his failure to address the issue adequately during his first term. He was also reportedly part of a group of Hispanic lawmakers who almost blocked a vote on the Affordable Care Act in 2010 in the interest of forcing the president to act on immigration reform.\n\nIn his speech Tuesday, Guti\u00e9rrez mentioned that the demographic trends of Hispanics in the U.S. make immigration reform a political necessity for both parties. \u201cLatino voters are a force that is growing faster than Republicans can withstand and are tilting more towards the Democrats with each day Republicans stand in the way of stopping deportations that are breaking up immigrant families,\u201d he said.\n\nAppearing alongside a poster with pictures of former Republican Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Bush, Guti\u00e9rrez said: \u201cIf you do nothing on immigration, I guess you can take comfort in knowing that from Abraham Lincoln to George W. Bush, you had a pretty good run.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He says Republicans won't have the Latino vote if they do not pass immigration reform in 2014.", "title": "Guti\u00e9rrez warns of last GOP president", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/luis-gutierrez-immigration-house-gop-chamber-commerce-george-w-bush-tom-donahue-106883.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/07/17/130716_luis_gutierrez_ap-605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Immigration Reform,Luis Gutierrez,House Republicans", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He says Republicans won't have the Latino vote if they do not pass immigration reform in 2014.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde902\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSo, Mr. Speaker, I give you George W.
