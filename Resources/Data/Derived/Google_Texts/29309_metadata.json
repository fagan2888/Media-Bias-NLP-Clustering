(Photo: The Tennessean)\n\nNASHVILLE \u2014 The Tennessee Department of Corrections will not say if it has the chemicals needed to execute inmates via lethal injection.\n\nAttorneys for inmates challenging the state's protocol say the drugs are not on hand. And an opportunity for the attorneys to ask prison supervisors about the drug supply did not take place as planned Friday because of a canceled court hearing.\n\nAs an increasing number of national medical organizations oppose participation in the controversial executions, it could be a challenge for Tennessee to find the drugs it needs.\n\n\"It's certainly clear that it has become more difficult for states to find the drugs that their protocols say they are supposed to use,\" said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes the death penalty. \"What the response to that will be is unclear.\"\n\nDrug supply\n\nAttorneys for Tennessee and attorneys for more than 30 death-row inmates \u2014 who are challenging the state's lethal injection and electrocution procedures \u2014 had planned to gather in front of Davidson County Chancellor Claudia Bonnyman on Friday.\n\nThe inmates and their attorneys say the state's protocols are unconstitutional and violate protections from cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe state filed a motion for a Friday hearing, asking Bonnyman to stop any court proceedings related to electrocutions. That issue is pending before the Tennessee Supreme Court.\n\nAttorneys for the inmates used it as a chance to file documents suggesting the state is unable to carry out lethal injection executions.\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Corrections has said it is confident it will be able to carry out executions, but when previously asked by The Tennessean, did not say whether the lethal-injection drugs were on hand.\n\nThe inmates' attorneys say in court documents that they subpoenaed Riverbend Maximum Security Institution leaders Tony Parker and Charles Carpenter to bring proof the state has the drugs. The execution chamber and death row inmates are housed at Riverbend in Nashville.\n\nAttorneys for the inmates expected both men who oversee the prison to testify during a hearing that the Department of Corrections does not have a supply of the drugs.\n\nThe state withdrew its request for the Friday hearing. And then it asked the Tennessee Supreme Court to intervene.\n\nNational opposition\n\nThe battle happening inside the Nashville courtroom unfolds as an increasing number of national groups oppose lethal injection.\n\nOn Monday, the leaders of the American Pharmacists Association will take a final vote whether to oppose pharmacist participation in executions. The APA is the largest group of pharmacists with 62,000 members.\n\nThe policy under consideration says that \"such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as providers of health care.\"\n\nThe American Medical Association, American Board of Anesthesiologists, American Nurses Association and National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians each discourage their members' participation in executions.\n\n\"The first rule for doctors is the Hippocratic Oath: Do no harm,\" Dunham said.\n\nIn response to botched executions and public pressure, manufacturers of the lethal-injection drug pentobarbital barred their products from being used in executions. States have turned to compounding pharmacies, which alter manufactured drugs, for a supply.\n\nBut last week the International Association of Compounding Pharmacists issued a statement discouraging its 4,000 members from supplying compounded lethal injection drugs.\n\nThe statement reflects increasing concern that states will alter the chemicals and cause pharmacists to face legal problems, according to the association.\n\nStill, that does not mean the drugs are unavailable and executions will halt.\n\n\"I think that will further restrict the availability of these drugs,\" Durham said. \"And it will create further incentives for those few compounding pharmacies that are acting against the generally accepted view of their community, it will create more incentives for them to be secretive about their involvement in this activity.\"\n\nIn early March, Texas announced it was running low on pentobarbital.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice announced it had found a pharmacy to temporarily supply the chemical, and executions would continue.\n\nOTHER EVENTS IN THE DEATH PENALTY CASE\n\n\u2022 Davidson County Chancellor Claudia Bonnyman ordered documents revealing the name of pharmacists supplying lethal injection drugs be returned to the Tennessee Department of Corrections. Federal public defenders got the documents, with one of the names poorly redacted, through a public records request. They sealed the documents and notified the court on March 20.\n\n\u2022 The state has asked the Tennessee Supreme Court to stop any Chancery Court proceedings related to the condemned inmates' claims that the electric chair is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments May 6 whether challenges to the electric chair can be made. The state argues since no inmate is currently set to be executed by electrocution, the inmates' claims are invalid.\n\n\u2022 The Tennessee Supreme Court has asked the state to show why four executions scheduled for later this year should not be rescheduled, given that the Chancery Court case likely will not be resolved by then.\n\n\u2022 What's next: A hearing to address pending motions in the case is set for April 10. Trial is set for July 7.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Co2tqU", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "NASHVILLE \u2014 The Tennessee Department of Corrections will not say if it has the chemicals needed to execute inmates via lethal injection.
