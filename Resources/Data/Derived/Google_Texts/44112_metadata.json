The move by her campaign to go directly to supporters comes as the publicly defiant candidate faced an onslaught of attacks on Wednesday by Republicans.\n\nClinton has received strong criticism in recent months for her exclusive use of private email while serving as President Obama's top diplomat. Questions have been raised as to whether her use of the server may have breached classified information.\n\nIn the memo, Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's campaign communications director, contended that Clinton \u201cdidn't send any classified material over email.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo information in her emails was marked classified at the time she sent or received them,\u201d wrote Palmieri. \u201cShe viewed classified materials in hard copy in her office or via other secure means while traveling, not on email.\u201d\n\nThis spring, Clinton's personal office said that more than 62,000 messages were sent or received over her four-year tenure at the State Department. Half of those emails were listed as private by her office -- including messages about her daughter's wedding and her mother's death -- and destroyed.\n\nThe remaining emails were turned over to the State Department to be reviewed before they were made public. Last month, the inspector general for the intelligence community notified members of Congress and the Justice Department that some of the emails had information that should have been marked and handled as classified.\n\nClinton has remained steadfast in stressing that she wants all of her emails to become public.\n\n\u201cI want those emails out,\u201d she has repeatedly told reporters.\n\nRepublican candidates including Donald Trump and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker issued statements attacking Clinton after her campaign said she'd turn over the server.\n\n\u201cShe cannot be trusted to keep America's secrets or its citizens safe, and therefore cannot be trusted to be commander in chief,\" Walker said.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "In Nevada, Jeb Bush rally interrupted by Black Lives Matter demonstrators", "Description": "More from Trail Guide Dec. 10 Donald Trump backs out of his Israel trip Dec. 9 Some U.S. mayors want Donald Trump to stay out of their cities Dec. 8 Hillary Clinton looks to tie GOP candidates to Trump's rhetoric about Muslims Dec. 7 Presidential rivals denounce Donald Trump's call to ban Muslims...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "More from Trail Guide Dec. 10 Donald Trump backs out of his Israel trip Dec. 9 Some U.S. mayors want Donald Trump to stay out of their cities Dec. 8 Hillary Clinton looks to tie GOP candidates to Trump's rhetoric about Muslims Dec. 7 Presidential rivals denounce Donald Trump's call to ban Muslims...", "title": "In Nevada, Jeb Bush rally interrupted by Black Lives Matter demonstrators", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-08122015-htmlstory.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55cc8ac9/turbine/la-na-trailguide-08122015", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp10.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-08-12", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5a6\"", "article_summary": "Under siege for her use of a private email account while secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton is playing defense.\nThe correspondence was sent a day after the Democratic presidential candidate announced she would turn over her private email server to the Justice Department.\nThe remaining emails were turned over to the State Department to be reviewed before they were made public.\nClinton has received strong criticism in recent months for her exclusive use of private email while serving as President Obama's top diplomat.\nIn an effort to quell concern among supporters about the questions surrounding the private email server, her campaign released a nearly 700-word memo Wednesday urging them to understand that \"the truth matters.\""}
