At a meeting over the weekend, aides for the campaigns appeared to reach consensus and outlined their list of demands and questions in a letter to TV networks. Now that consensus seems to be crumbling.\n\n\u201cI just want to answer the questions and be done with it,\u201d Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Tuesday.\n\nTrump and his campaign manager said they plan to negotiate their preferred terms for future debates directly with the hosting networks, opting out of the collected effort of his fellow candidates.\n\n\"We\u2019re being asked very rude questions, many of them directed at me,\u201d Trump added. \u201cI just want to have a debate. I want to answer tough questions.\u201d\n\nAmong the demands outlined in the draft letter were abolishing lightening rounds of questioning by moderators. Another request is to keep the debate venue\u2019s temperature a breezy 67 degrees.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, presidential candidate and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal offered this suggestion in an e-mail to supporters: \u201cHow about this \u2013- if you want to participate in the next Republican debate, you should be required to be smart enough to have a plan to replace Obamacare and restore freedom and sanity to America\u2019s health care system.\u201d\n\nLike Trump, at least three other presidential candidates, including Ohio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, have said they will not sign the letter to debate sponsors.\n\nIn an email obtained by ABC News, Carly Fiorina\u2019s deputy campaign manager, Sarah Flores, informed Ben Ginsberg, a Republican attorney who has taken a lead role in drafting the letter, that Fiorina would not be signing the letter.\n\n\"We have consistently and successfully discussed our concerns with the networks and the voters -- and not behind closed doors like the political class seems to like to do,\" Flores wrote. \"We do not care whether it's 67 degrees or our green room isn't as plush as another candidate.\"\n\nIn an appearance on Fox News on Monday, Christie lashed out at demands being asked by his fellow candidates.\n\n\u201cStop complaining,\u201d Christie said. \u201cDo me a favor, set up a stage, put podiums up there and let's just go. Ok?\"\n\nLast week Sen. Lindsey Graham told ABC News he favors two evenly divided debates so that every candidate gets a fair shot.\n\nThe next Republican debate will be hosted November 10 by Fox Business/Wall Street Journal in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "GOP Candidates Divided Over New Demands", "description": "GOP Candidates Divided Over New Demands", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "To debate, or how not to debate \u2013 that is the question.\nThe Republican presidential campaigns are struggling to agree on changes to the structure of future primary debates.
