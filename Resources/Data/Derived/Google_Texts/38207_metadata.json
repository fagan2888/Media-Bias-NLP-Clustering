Jim McDermott of Washington, and Lloyd Doggett of Texas. All worked to help steer Obama's law through rancorous congressional debates from 2009-2010.\n\nThe lawmakers say they are concerned that many of their constituents will find out about the penalties after it's already too late for them to sign up for coverage, since open enrollment ended Sunday.\n\nThat means they could wind up uninsured for another year, only to owe substantially higher fines in 2016. The fines are collected through the income tax system.\n\nThis year is the first time ordinary Americans will experience the complicated interactions between the health care law and taxes. Based on congressional analysis, tax preparation giant H&R Block says roughly 4 million uninsured people will pay penalties.\n\nThe IRS has warned that health-care related issues will make its job harder this filing season and taxpayers should be prepared for long call-center hold times, particularly since the GOP-led Congress has been loath to approve more money for the agency.\n\n\"Open enrollment period ended before many Americans filed their taxes,\" the three lawmakers said in a statement. \"Without a special enrollment period, many people (who will be paying fines) will not have another opportunity to get health coverage this year.\n\n\"A special enrollment period will not only help many Americans avoid making an even larger payment next year, but, more importantly, it will help them gain quality health insurance for 2015,\" the lawmakers added.\n\nSo far, administration officials have deflected questions about whether an extension will be granted. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell has authority to grant special enrollment periods under certain circumstances.\n\nSupporters of the law say an extension would mainly help low- to middle-income uninsured people, the same group that Obama's coverage expansion was intended to serve. But Republicans may criticize it as another tweak to what they see as unworkable \"Obamacare.\"\n\nThe health care law imposes fines on uninsured people whose incomes are deemed high enough to enable them to afford coverage. The goal is to broaden the pool of insured people, helping to keep premiums in check for everybody.\n\nThe law also offers subsidies to lower the cost of private coverage for people who don't have job-based health care. That financial assistance is provided through a new tax credit.\n\nAlthough the tax credit subsidies cover most of the premiums for many people, the coverage requirement and the fines that enforce it remain deeply unpopular.\n\nAnd the cost of being uninsured in America is going up significantly.\n\nFor 2014, the fine was the greater of $95 per person or 1 percent of household income above the threshold for filing taxes. That fine will be collected when taxpayers file their 2014 returns.\n\nBut this year the fine will jump to the greater of 2 percent of income or $325. By 2016, the average fine will be about $1,100, based on government figures.\n\nPolls show that many taxpayers are unaware of the potential financial exposure.\n\nFloyd Cable, a real estate agent from Wichita Falls, Texas, said the escalating fines were part of the motivation for him and his wife to sign up last week. Both are self-employed, and stretching to pay health insurance premiums has been a struggle.\n\n\"We have been going without insurance the last couple of years just because the rates are so astronomical,\" Cable said.\n\nBut they were also concerned they could wind up on the wrong side of rising penalties. And, being in his early 60s, Cable said he recognizes the value of having health insurance against unexpected illness.\n\nAn extension would probably help people still on the fence, like he was.\n\n\"Anything that could be done to give people more time to sort through this, is not only a good move for the administration, but just makes common sense,\" Cable said.\n\nSince both the subsidies and penalties under the health law are administered through the tax system, some experts have urged the Obama administration to permanently schedule sign-up season to overlap with tax-filing season.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "house", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Democrats", "dcterms.modified": "2015-03-27 11:05:38 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "The official sign-up season for President Obama's health care law may be over, but leading congressional Democrats say millions of Americans facing new tax penalties deserve a second chance.", "twitter": {"description": "The official sign-up season for President Obama's health care law may be over, but leading congressional Democrats say millions of Americans facing new tax penalties deserve a second chance.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/16/dems-to-press-administration-for-obamacare-sign-up-extension-as-fines-loom.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/02/16/0/0/021615_ff_hhs_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Dems to press administration for ObamaCare sign-up extension, as fines loom", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Democrats\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics/house\",\"title\":\"Dems to press administration for ObamaCare sign-up extension, as fines loom\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/02/16/0/0/021615_ff_hhs_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-16T12:58:13Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/16/dems-to-press-administration-for-obamacare-sign-up-extension-as-fines-loom.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"50f02dfb-b849-44e5-80b6-96be5909ea2e\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "The official sign-up season for President Obama's health care law may be over, but leading congressional Democrats say millions of Americans facing new tax penalties deserve a second chance.", "dc.identifier": "50f02dfb-b849-44e5-80b6-96be5909ea2e", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "healthcare,democrats", "description": "The official sign-up season for President Obama's health care law may be over, but leading congressional Democrats say millions of Americans facing new tax penalties deserve a second chance.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "Associated Press", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Dems To Press Administration For Obamacare Sign-up Extension, As Fines Loom", "dcterms.created": "2015-03-27 11:05:38 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "The official sign-up season for President Obama's health care law may be over, but leading congressional Democrats say millions of Americans facing new tax penalties deserve a second chance.", "title": "Dems to press administration for ObamaCare sign-up extension, as fines loom | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/16/dems-to-press-administration-for-obamacare-sign-up-extension-as-fines-loom.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/02/16/0/0/021615_ff_hhs_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-02-16", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Democrats\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics/house\",\"title\":\"Dems to press administration for ObamaCare sign-up extension, as fines loom\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/02/16/0/0/021615_ff_hhs_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-16T12:58:13Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/16/dems-to-press-administration-for-obamacare-sign-up-extension-as-fines-loom.html\",\"post_id\":\"50f02dfb-b849-44e5-80b6-96be5909ea2e\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdacfc\"", "article_summary": "\"Without a special enrollment period, many people (who will be paying fines) will not have another opportunity to get health coverage this year.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M.
