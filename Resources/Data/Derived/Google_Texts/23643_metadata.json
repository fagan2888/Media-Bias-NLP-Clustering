Right here in New York City!\n\nAs my colleague Murtaza Hussain ably documents, \u201cit appears that none of the three men was in any condition to travel or support the Islamic State, without help from the FBI informant.\u201d One of the frightening terrorist villains told the FBI informant that, beyond having no money, he had encountered a significant problem in following through on the FBI\u2019s plot: his mom had taken away his passport. Noting the bizarre and unhinged ranting of one of the suspects, Hussain noted on Twitter that this case \u201csounds like another victory for the FBI over the mentally ill.\u201d\n\nGreenwald notes with some case studies (see some clips by me at the end of the post on the same theme) that so many of the FBI's victories over terror involve their own nudging otherwise harmless people along to do or say things they can be arrested for\u2014what Greenwald summarizes, in this week's domestic ISIS case and others, as giving us cause to \"thank the brave men and women of the FBI for saving us from their own terror plots.\" resulting in \"sending young people to prison for decades for \u201ccrimes\u201d which even their sentencing judges acknowledge they never would have seriously considered, let alone committed, in the absence of FBI trickery.\"\n\nGreenwald asks a question I've been asking since at least 2006 about the domestic terror threat:\n\nhow serious of a threat can all of this be, at least domestically, if the FBI continually has to resort to manufacturing its own plots by trolling the Internet in search of young drifters and/or the mentally ill whom they target, recruit and then manipulate into joining? Does that not, by itself, demonstrate how over-hyped and insubstantial this \u201cthreat\u201d actually is? Shouldn\u2019t there be actual plots, ones that are created and fueled without the help of the FBI, that the agency should devote its massive resources to stopping?\n\nGreenwald ends with a quote he got from the ACLU of Massachusetts\u2019s Kade Crockford from the mouth of former FBI assistant director Thomas Fuentes, discussing one of the agency's terror stings:\n\nIf you\u2019re submitting budget proposals for a law enforcement agency, for an intelligence agency, you\u2019re not going to submit the proposal that \u201cWe won the war on terror and everything\u2019s great,\u201d cuz the first thing that\u2019s gonna happen is your budget\u2019s gonna be cut in half. You know, it\u2019s my opposite of Jesse Jackson\u2019s \u2018Keep Hope Alive\u2019\u2014it\u2019s \u2018Keep Fear Alive.\u2019 Keep it alive.\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of 9/11 I asked \"Where's the Terror?\" and revisited the strange lack of much demonstrated terror threat against our quite porous country allegedly facing a relentless and unstoppable worldwide gang of suicidal maniacs in such posts as \"Undercover Federal Provocateurs Continue to Threaten America!\", \"Myths of Domestic Terror,\" and \"The FBI: Making Sure we Don't Need to Import Terror from Overseas.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "A continuing pattern of domestic terror, courtesy of our FBI.", "title": "The FBI and Domestic ISIS Arrest: Keeping Fear Alive as a Government Mission", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/02/26/the-fbi-and-domestic-isis-keeping-fear-a", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14249993058535.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14249993058535.jpg", "description": "A continuing pattern of domestic terror, courtesy of our FBI.", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The FBI and Domestic ISIS Arrest: Keeping Fear Alive as a Government Mission"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "World", "published_time": "2015-02-27T02:17:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/brian-doherty"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae55\"", "article_summary": "\", \"Myths of Domestic Terror,\" and \"The FBI: Making Sure we Don't Need to Import Terror from Overseas.\"\nGlenn Greenwald at The Intercept has some perspective worth keeping in mind regarding this week's spincter-tightening announcement of Domestic ISIS!\nYou know, it\u2019s my opposite of Jesse Jackson\u2019s \u2018Keep Hope Alive\u2019\u2014it\u2019s \u2018Keep Fear Alive.\u2019 Keep it alive.\nand revisited the strange lack of much demonstrated terror threat against our quite porous country allegedly facing a relentless and unstoppable worldwide gang of suicidal maniacs in such posts as \"Undercover Federal Provocateurs Continue to Threaten America!\nShouldn\u2019t there be actual plots, ones that are created and fueled without the help of the FBI, that the agency should devote its massive resources to stopping?"}
