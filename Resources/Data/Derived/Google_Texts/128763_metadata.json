Alton Strupp, The C-J\n\nBuy Photo Robert Otto and Wendy Boyd, students who are also a couple, recently signed up for Medicaid health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. After a past back surgery Otto fell on hard times. \"I had to lay in bed for a year because I couldn't move my leg. I had to quit my job. I had four kids. It was bad.\" Otto feels that since the implementation of the ACA he is much better off, but he still has opposition to the law. \"I don't think it's right that people are forced to get it.\" (Photo: Alton Strupp, The Courier-Journal)Buy Photo\n\nRobert Otto used to go to the emergency room for care when he was uninsured \u2014 if he sought care at all.\n\n\"A lot of times, when I got sick, I suffered,\" said Otto, 38, a psychology student at Big Sandy Community & Technical College in Floyd County, Ky.\n\nBut that changed last February when Otto signed up for Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act. Now, he said, he goes to the doctor whenever it's necessary. That's meant finally getting regular care for his bad back, which at one point kept him couch-bound much of the time.\n\n\"Obamacare has helped him and many people in Floyd County,\" said his fiance and fellow student, Wendy Boyd.\n\nStill, both Otto and Boyd share a sentiment common in these hills \u2014 that the ACA shouldn't fine people for not having insurance, as it does. While insurance is valuable to most people, Boyd said, not everyone believes they have to have it, and \"I don't think you should be penalized for something you don't need.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1G0T1ew", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Kentucky student now gets care when needed, not when desperate", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Kentucky student now gets care when needed, not when desperate", "title": "Couple benefit from Obamacare but balk at fines", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2015/04/16/couple-benefit-obamacare-balk-fines/25905059/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kentucky student now gets care when needed, not when desperate", "title": "Couple benefit from Obamacare but balk at fines", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/38f8e999d02c5aea64d9d9a72f0555bf5eb00756/c=588-0-3088-2500&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/16/B9316962413Z.1_20150416192226_000_GF3AGJ771.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ca1f74cdf8eb3613d1a0ca41fd5697722667cdd/c=900-0-2775-2500/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/16/B9316962413Z.1_20150416192226_000_GF3AGJ771.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/63d9dfeba15d3dede5d2ff7995a182400a0f2fe1/c=588-0-3088-2500/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/16/B9316962413Z.1_20150416192226_000_GF3AGJ771.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/00d1f4fac95997d33a88b1ebc7187d7f27191655/c=172-0-3505-2500/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/16/B9316962413Z.1_20150416192226_000_GF3AGJ771.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/84fb912335cfe4798b8c64022031e2aa25b89f15/c=0-216-3676-2284&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/16/B9316962413Z.1_20150416192226_000_GF3AGJ771.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-17T10:23:12.550000-04:00", "shorthed": "Couple benefit from ACA, balk at fines", "articleid": 25905059, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70da6e1ccf71caf642ec7ef1e60d69c53e162136/c=0-216-3676-2284/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/16/B9316962413Z.1_20150416192226_000_GF3AGJ771.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d5224f498000d7d51da585cf04a4ca3bb1bf88b/c=1135-0-2541-2500/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/16/B9316962413Z.1_20150416192226_000_GF3AGJ771.1-0.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Couple benefit from Obamacare but balk at fines", "pageclass": "article", "author": "Laura Ungar"}, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Appalachia, Affordable Care Act, Chris Kenning, Laura Ungar, ACA in Appalachia, kynect, health care law, Eastern Kentucky, ACA penalties, Obamacare penalties"}, "article_summary": "\"Obamacare has helped him and many people in Floyd County,\" said his fiance and fellow student, Wendy Boyd.\nAlton Strupp, The C-JBuy Photo Robert Otto and Wendy Boyd, students who are also a couple, recently signed up for Medicaid health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\nBut that changed last February when Otto signed up for Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act.\nStill, both Otto and Boyd share a sentiment common in these hills \u2014 that the ACA shouldn't fine people for not having insurance, as it does.\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share USA Today health reporter Laura Ungar revisits Appalachia to take a look at the thoughts and opinions of residents one year after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act."}
