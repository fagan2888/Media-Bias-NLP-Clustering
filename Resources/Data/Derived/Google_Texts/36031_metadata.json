The discovery spurred a new round of privacy concerns about the much-maligned website.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLawmakers on the House Subcommittee on Research and Technology heard from top government cybersecurity research officials and private sector tech and security executives.\n\n\u201cThey sell that information to any number of people,\u201d said Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), wondering \u201cwhether that makes the website more vulnerable.\u201d\n\nNewhouse grilled an official from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the government standards-setting agency, about the issue.\n\nIn 2013, President Obama directed NIST to develop a cybersecurity framework to help the private sector and government regulators assess cyber risks.\n\n\u201cDoes the NIST cyber framework contemplate that a federal agency would be certified, then allow scores of data mining shops\u201d to sit on Healthcare.gov? Newhouse asked.\n\nCharles Romine, who directs NIST\u2019s Information Technology Laboratory, declined to comment on \u201cthe specific issues in this case.\u201d He did note the cyber framework directs organizations to \u201censure that privacy considerations are taken into account\u201d when assessing cybersecurity risks.\n\nCybersecurity experts also raised concerns about the scope of the data sharing.\n\n\u201cI do find it surprising that there are that many additive websites or technologies that are able to access the data,\u201d said Cheri McGuire, vice president of global government affairs and cybersecurity policy at security firm Symantec.\n\nWhile McGuire couldn\u2019t \u201cspeak to the specifics,\u201d she added that opening up a network to outsiders \u201cwould provide some additional vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nShortly after the practice was reported, two Republican senators told the administration it had violated the privacy of millions of Americans. A few days later, the administration added extra layers of encryption to the site, which cut back the amount of information that could flow to outside companies.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is companies are not actually perched on Healthcare.gov,\u201d said Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), the subcommittee\u2019s ranking member, in response to Newhouse\u2019s comments. \u201cThey\u2019re being given data from there. That\u2019s very different.\u201d\n\nHealthcare.gov has had repeated technical challenges and privacy issues since it\u2019s launch in October 2013.\n\nLipinski cautioned that he didn\u2019t want to \u201csuggest that everything is wonderful with Healthcare.gov and especially the D.C. website, which was completely atrocious once again for the second year in a row.\u201d\n\nBut the recent discovery about sharing Healthcare.gov data with outside companies is \u201ca whole different issue,\u201d Lipinski said.\n\nStill, it\u2019s still an issue Congress can and should look into, he told The Hill after the hearing.\n\n\u201cI always have privacy concerns,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"They sell that information to any number of people,\" Rep.
