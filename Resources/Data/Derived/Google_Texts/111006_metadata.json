Photo: AFP\n\nGalle Sri Lanka Leg-spinner Yasir Shah claimed a career-best 7-76 as Pakistan stunned Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the first Test on Sunday to take the lead in the three-match series.\n\nYasir spun a web around the Sri Lankan batsmen to skittle them for 206 in their second innings just before tea on the fifth and final day.\n\nSet a victory target of 90, Pakistan raced home in 11.2 overs with Mohammad Hafeez unbeaten on 46 and Ahmed Shehzad on 43 at the Galle International Stadium.\n\nJob well done: Pakistan's openers Ahmed Shehzad and Mohammad Hafeez leave the field after knocking off the 90 runs needed to defeat Sri Lanka.

Sara Oval in Colombo on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPakistan's remarkable recovery from 5-96 in the first innings came after the entire first day's play had been washed out and just 64 overs were bowled on the second day.\n\nOpener Dimuth Karunaratne top-scored with 79 in Sri Lanka's second innings, while Lahiru Thirimanne made 44 and and Dinesh Chandimal was last man out for 38. But the rest of the batsmen folded against Pakistan's incisive bowling.\n\nSri Lanka lost their last five wickets for 39 runs after being 5-167 at one stage.\n\nThe hosts took their overnight score of 2-63 to 4-144 by lunch, before they collapsed in front of some 1000 fans.\n\nSri Lanka lost nightwatchman Dilruwan Perera off the first ball of the day, clean-bowled by Yasir, but the left-handed pair of Karunaratne and Thirimanne put on 69 runs for the fourth wicket.\n\nWith the hosts just 15 runs ahead, left-arm seamer Wahab Riaz had Thirimanne caught low at first slip by Younis Khan to keep the interest alive during the lunch break.\n\nSri Lanka suffered a massive blow off the second ball after resumption when skipper Angelo Mathews was controversially given out caught at short leg by TV umpire Chris Gaffaney.\n\nThe New Zealander upheld a decision made by on-field umpire Richard Illingworth, who had ruled that the batsman was out even though replays proved inconclusive on whether the ball had come off the bat.\n\nMathews, who had called for a review as soon as the umpire raised his finger, was visibly furious as he returned to the pavilion.\n\nNeither hot-spot or snickometer technology is part of the Decision Review System for the series.\n\nKarunaratne's patience ran out after more than four hours at the crease when he attempted a big hit off Yasir, missed the line and was smartly stumped by an agile Sarfraz Ahmed to make it 6-167.\n\nIt soon became 7-175 as Kithuruwan Vithanage swept a flighted ball to Zulfiqar Babar at square-leg, giving Yasir his second haul of five wickets or more in an eight-Test career.\n\nDhammika Prasad was stumped off Babar and Rangana Herath holed out in the deep off Yasir, before Chandimal was last man out, stumped off Yasir.\n\nAFP", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cricket", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Leg-spinner Yasir Shah claimed a career-best 7-76 as Pakistan stunned Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the first Test.", "title": "Leg-spinner Yasir Shah bowls Pakistan to victory over Sri Lanka", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/legspinner-yasir-shah-bowls-pakistan-to-victory-over-sri-lanka-20150621-ghtug2.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/h/t/u/i/g/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.ghtug2.png/1434886447575.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/h/t/u/i/g/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.ghtug2.png/1434886447575.jpg"}, "description": "Leg-spinner Yasir Shah claimed a career-best 7-76 as Pakistan stunned Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the first Test.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Leg-spinner Yasir Shah bowls Pakistan to victory over Sri Lanka"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Leg-spinner Yasir Shah claimed a career-best 7-76 as Pakistan stunned Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the first Test."}, "article_summary": "Photo: AFPGalle Sri Lanka Leg-spinner Yasir Shah claimed a career-best 7-76 as Pakistan stunned Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the first Test on Sunday to take the lead in the three-match series.\nPhoto: AFPIt was Pakistan's first Test win in Sri Lanka since an eight-wicket triumph in Kandy in 2006.\nJob well done: Pakistan's openers Ahmed Shehzad and Mohammad Hafeez leave the field after knocking off the 90 runs needed to defeat Sri Lanka.\nPakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah is overjoyed after dismissing Sri Lanka's Rangana Herath.\nSri Lanka lost their last five wickets for 39 runs after being 5-167 at one stage."}
