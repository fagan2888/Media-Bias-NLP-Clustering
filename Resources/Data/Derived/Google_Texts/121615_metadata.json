Starting immediately, Penguin UK will sell its ebooks on the Readmill system. You can now read the works of best-selling authors\u2014including George Orwell, John LeCarr\u00e9, and Zadie Smith\u2014on the lesser-known but elegant reading system, Readmill.\n\nOption #2: Amazon\u2019s Kindle devices . The retail giant has both its own line of gray, hardy e-readers and also makes reading software for other platforms, including Apple and Android phones/tablets. It has lots of books to read, but, once purchased, you can only read them on Kindles. Some of its software, too, suffers for its extensibility. At its worst, the Kindle system can feel like Windows 95: closed, hard to leave, and a bit stodgy.\n\nOption #1: Apple\u2019s iBooks system . Chipper and colorful, iBooks is easy to use if you own an iPhone or iPad. In its zeal to convince you that, yes, you are reading a book!, though, it can cartoonishly oversell the reading experience. (Case in point: Apple has patented its page-turning animation.)\n\nFounded in early 2011, Readmill may be the best-designed e-reading system out there. Unlike Amazon or Apple, it doesn\u2019t manufacture hardware of its own. Rather, it has develops e-reading software for Apple and Android devices, which is tied to a web-based social network.\n\nReadmill has many of the same features as more popular reading systems. Its social network allows recommendations and rating; earlier this fall, it deployed a feature that let you share annotations with your friends, and comment on each others. It is, in other words, one of many reading startups and social networks out there, a competitor to both Amazon\u2019s Kindle system and the Amazon-owned GoodReads social network.\n\nIt just presents many of those popular features better, though. It doesn\u2019t demand book ratings from it readers, but it presents well the ratings and recommendations you do choose to give it. Above all, I\u2019m nearly certain it has the best digital typography among e-reading software today. On Readmill, digital books look like books, not text files foisted into an extensible reading enviromnent.\n\nBefore the Penguin deal, though, it was hard to find contemporary books for Readmill. Classics could be found at Project Gutenberg. Small, digitally-savvy publishers, like the boutique Emily\u2019s Books and the design house A Book Apart, made their books easy to download to it, too. But publishers\u2014the ones who dominate the best-selling lists\u2014did not.\n\nWith the addition of Smith and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn and Anthony Burgess, that\u2019s changed. Readmill isn\u2019t perfect: It might be more expensive to use than Amazon\u2019s Kindle system, for example. But, at least on phones and tablets, it is a far superior experience. If they\u2019re not satisfied with their current options, thoughtful digital readers might want to give Readmill a try.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new deal with Penguin UK means a greater variety of books for the insurgent platform.", "author": "Robinson Meyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A new deal with Penguin UK means a greater variety of books for the insurgent platform.", "title": "The E-Reading Software That's Better Than Kindle or iBooks", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/4843656855_883607a91c_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/the-e-reading-software-thats-better-than-kindle-or-ibooks/282003/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/yayitsrob"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3c7d\"", "article_summary": "At its worst, the Kindle system can feel like Windows 95: closed, hard to leave, and a bit stodgy.\nReadmill isn\u2019t perfect: It might be more expensive to use than Amazon\u2019s Kindle system, for example.\nYou can now read the works of best-selling authors\u2014including George Orwell, John LeCarr\u00e9, and Zadie Smith\u2014on the lesser-known but elegant reading system, Readmill.\nThe retail giant has both its own line of gray, hardy e-readers and also makes reading software for other platforms, including Apple and Android phones/tablets.\nStarting immediately, Penguin UK will sell its ebooks on the Readmill system."}
