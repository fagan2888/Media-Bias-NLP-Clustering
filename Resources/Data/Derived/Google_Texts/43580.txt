The maker of the world’s best-selling chocolate candy is advocating that people eat less added sugar.

Mars Inc., maker of M&M’s and Snickers, is throwing its support behind a proposal by U.S. regulators to include measurements of added sugar in the mandated Nutrition Facts labels for food, a move that bucks broad opposition to the proposal by big food companies.

In a letter submitted to government officials Thursday, Mars said it also backs calls by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which counsels the federal government, recommending that people should limit added sugar to 10% of daily calories.

“It might appear to be counterintuitive, but if you dig down a bit more, we know candy itself is not a diet,” said Dave Crean, global head of research and development at Mars. “It shouldn’t be consumed too often, and having transparency of how much it should be consumed is actually quite helpful to consumers.”

Sugar is currently one of the few nutrients that doesn’t have a recommended consumption level on U.S. food labels, because the Food and Drug Administration hasn’t proposed a specific limit. Critics have blamed pressure from food companies. The U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee’s February recommendation was its first for how much added sugar should be consumed.
