Others reach for roll-ons, clear gels or creams. Natural types evangelize \u201cthe rock,\u201d rubbing an alum stone directly on their armpits.\n\nOne format Americans rarely rhapsodize about is sprays. They make up only 2 to 5 percent of the market here, according to industry sources.\n\nAerosol underarm protection fell out of favor in the United States in the 1970s and \u201980s when it became clear that the chlorofluorocarbons in the propellants were bad for the environment, and despite occasional appearances in seventh-grade gym lockers or on your French friend\u2019s bathroom shelf, they mostly disappeared.\n\nBut now, like other totems of that time \u2014 bangs and baby-doll dresses, say \u2014 they are starting to reappear, a resurgence spurred by their popularity in the rest of the world. In Europe and Latin America, sprays make up more than 60 percent of the market.\n\nIn December, Unilever introduced antiperspirant sprays for five of its brands: Dove Women, Dove Men + Care, Degree Men, Degree Women and Axe. They are nearly identical to those the company sells internationally, but comply with federal regulations.\n\n\u201cLots of people will still like their stick,\u201d said Matthew McCarthy, senior marketing director for antiperspirants and deodorants for Unilever. \u201cBut a couple of years ago, we said, \u2018What does the future look like?\u2019 We didn\u2019t need to look further than the format that\u2019s our No. 1 elsewhere in the world. It hasn\u2019t been rocket science.\u201d\n\nAntiperspirants, by the way, stop sweating, while deodorants keep funky smells at bay, usually with essential oils that zap bacteria but don\u2019t stop sweating itself.\n\nSmaller companies, like Weleda from Switzerland and Aesop from Australia, are also promoting their non-aerosol sprays here. Kate Hudson and Carolyn Murphy use Weleda Wild Rose natural deodorant spray, and Aesop is advertising its lemongrass- and-clove spray deodorant with a black-and-white photo of woman deeply inhaling a man\u2019s underarm.\n\n\u201cThe benefit of having the product in a spray in a water and alcohol mixture is that it all evaporates quickly, and you\u2019re left with essential oils,\u201d said Kate Forbes, head of products and research and development for Aesop.\n\nThe main draw of sprays, aficionados agree, is that they dry as soon as you spray them on, so there is no flapping your arms up and down before putting on your shirt. And they don\u2019t leave excess goop or white crumbles under your arms. Will swapping your morning swipe for a spray make you smell better or sweat less?\n\nDavid Pariser, a past president of the American Academy of Dermatology, said that with antiperspirants, which use aluminum- based compounds to plug the sweat glands, the format doesn\u2019t have anything to do with how dry it will keep you.\n\n\u201cThe effectiveness is based on the active ingredients, not whether it\u2019s delivered in a solid and spray,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother advantage of a spray is that it can be used on areas like hands, where people tend to sweat a lot.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to want to put a solid on your hands,\u201d Pariser said. \u201cIt\u2019s all goopy. That\u2019s a technical term.\u201d\n\nFor some people, though, sprays can be irritating, depending on the ingredients.\n\n\u201cIf it has alcohol in it, or some ingredient that would cause it to dry quickly, they may end up causing more irritation than sticks or roll-ons,\u201d Pariser said", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/03/hfwell10.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd69ee\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLots of people will still like their stick,\u201d said Matthew McCarthy, senior marketing director for antiperspirants and deodorants for Unilever.\n\u201cThe effectiveness is based on the active ingredients, not whether it\u2019s delivered in a solid and spray,\u201d he said.\nIn December, Unilever introduced antiperspirant sprays for five of its brands: Dove Women, Dove Men + Care, Degree Men, Degree Women and Axe.\nIt hasn\u2019t been rocket science.\u201dAntiperspirants, by the way, stop sweating, while deodorants keep funky smells at bay, usually with essential oils that zap bacteria but don\u2019t stop sweating itself.\nAnother advantage of a spray is that it can be used on areas like hands, where people tend to sweat a lot."}
