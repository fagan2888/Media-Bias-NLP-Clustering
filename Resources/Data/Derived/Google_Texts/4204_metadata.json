Not surprisingly the General Assembly\u2019s most conservative Republicans collected best scores.\n\nSen. Vicki Marble of Fort Collins was tops in the upper chamber with an 89 percent score for her voting record on 30 bills that were good for taxpayers\u2019 bottom lines, according to CUT.\n\nThe House had four Republican legislators tied with 93 percent: Stephen Humphrey of Severance, Gordon Klingenschmitt of Colorado Springs, Patrick Neville of Castle Rock and Kim Ransom of Littleton.\n\nRepublicans, collectively, scored 71 percent in the Senate and 79 percent in the House. Democrats had an abysmal session in CUT\u2019s view: 27 percent in the Senate and just 11 percent in the House.\n\nRep. Dan Pabon of Denver, who has a reputation as one of the statehouse\u2019s most business-friendly Democrats, got the worst score of any member in the General Assembly, 3.9 percent. Among House Democrats, Dianne Primavera of Broomfield scored 6.9 percent. Paul Rosenthal of Denver graded out at 7.61 percent and Max Tyler of Lakewood received 7.14 percent.\n\nSen. Jessie Ulibarri of Adams County got the lowest score among Democrats in the Senate, 8.70, followed by Andy Kerr of Lakewood with 10 percent\n\nOn the House Republican side, Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg scored a second-place high score in the Senate behind Marble with 84 percent. Rep. Dan Nordberg of Colorado Springs came in fifth among House Republicans with 92 percent.\n\nAs with the left-leaning scorecards released to date, the scores are based on partisan positions on specially selected bills that the organizations doing the grading either supported or strongly opposed.\n\nThe legislature overall got an F from CUT.\n\n\u201cColoradans can rejoice,\u201d the report card, which is not available online, states. \u201c(The) Senate killed many terrible bills.\u201d\n\nThe Senate, of course, is controlled by Republicans, and the House has a Democratic majority.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado Union of Taxpayers,Gordon Klingenschmitt,Kim Ransom,Patrocl Mevo;;e,Stephen Humphrey,Vicki Marble", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "The Colorado Union of Taxpayers gave its highest grades to Republicans during the last legislative session, but the legislature overall still got an F.", "title": "Colorado Union of Taxpayers grades legislature", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/07/04/colorado-union-of-taxpayers-gives-high-grades-to-republican-legislators/121743/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2011/05/scarydome-1-e1305117671913-495x333.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Colorado Union of Taxpayers gave its highest grades to Republicans during the last legislative session, but the legislature overall still got an F.", "title": "Colorado Union of Taxpayers gives high grades to GOP legislators", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/07/04/colorado-union-of-taxpayers-gives-high-grades-to-republican-legislators/121743/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2011/05/scarydome-1-e1305117671913-495x333.jpg", "creator": "@joeybunch", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Colorado Union of Taxpayers gave its highest grades to Republicans during the last legislative session, but the legislature overall still got an F."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96ad\"", "article_summary": "The conservative Colorado Union of Taxpayers has published its report card on the legislative session that ended in May.\nRep.
