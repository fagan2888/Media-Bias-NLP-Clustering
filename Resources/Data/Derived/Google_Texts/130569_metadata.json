The Federal Open Market committee has made it clear that rates will only rise when the economy\u2019s recovery from the Great Recession is well under way. But for the federal budget, the news about rising rates is anything but good.\n\nRelated: Summers--Infrastructure Spending Key to Economic Growth\n\nThe Federal Government is currently $17.3 trillion in debt, and is projected to continue adding to the national debt every year for the foreseeable future. And when interest rates go up, so does the cost of servicing both new debt and debt that is rolled over in the form of newly-issued Treasury securities.\n\nThe likelihood of rates going up in the near future is almost beyond dispute. Yellen\u2019s confirmation was still headline news this morning when Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren delivered a speech urging the Fed to be cautious as it dials back its stimulus programs and considers when it should begin tightening up the money supply.\n\nWhat made Rosengren\u2019s speech particularly interesting, though, was its tone of resignation. Rosengren, who just finished a year\u2019s service on the Federal Open Market Committee, spent 2013 as a vocal supporter of the Fed\u2019s policy of keeping interest rates low and using asset purchases to stimulate the economy. In his last vote as a member of the FOMC in December, Rosengren was the sole dissenter when the committee decided to begin reducing its asset purchases and signaled future interest rate increases.\n\nHe may not believe rates should come up any time soon, but in his speech, the Boston Fed president seems to have accepted the fact that his side lost the argument.\n\nRelated: How to Tell If Fiscal Policy Works\n\nRather than argue against tightening monetary policy, he simply argued, \u201cU.S. policymakers should remove monetary accommodation gradually, to minimize the costs and risks of not returning to full employment more quickly.\n\nThat rising interest rates are practically inevitable means the price of servicing the federal debt is about to jump. A study last fall by the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget noted that total interest payments on the federal debt in 2013 were approximately $255 billion. To put that in perspective, the sequester that was the focus of such debate in 2013 and ultimately led to a government shutdown only cost $85.3 billion in its first year.\n\nBut that figure is somewhat misleading. The $255 billion is about the same amount the government paid to service its debt in 2006, when the debt outstanding was equal to only 40% of today\u2019s total.\n\nThe difference? Low interest rates. Right now, the Treasury pays 0.01 percent on three-month T-bills and 2.98 percent on ten-year notes. The historical average for those two securities are 3.3 percent and 5.2 percent.\n\nRelated: Why the Global Economy Could Go Off the Rails In 2014\n\nAccording to the CFRB, if interest rates rise as most estimates expect (3-month Treasuries to approximately 4 percent by 2018 and 10-year Treasuries to approximately 5.2 percent) interest payments on the Federal debt will soar to $505 billion in 2018.\n\nFollow Rob Garver on Twitter @rrgarver\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Assuming economic conditions continue to improve, incoming Federal Reserve Board Chair Jane Yellen will, sooner or later, preside over substantial increases in interest rates \u2013 and when she does, the effect on the federal budget will be dramatic.", "title": "Here\u2019s the Giant Shoe About to Drop on the Economy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/08/Rising-interest-rates-will-slam-Federal-Budget", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08052011_US_debt_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/08/Rising-interest-rates-will-slam-Federal-Budget", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08052011_US_debt_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Assuming economic conditions continue to improve, incoming Federal Reserve Board Chair Jane Yellen will, sooner or later, preside over substantial increases in interest rates \u2013 and when she does, the effect on the federal budget will be dramatic.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "With rising interest rates and expected increases in the Federal debt, at some point in the next ten years, annual interest payments are on pace to exceed the U.S. defense budget.\nThat rising interest rates are practically inevitable means the price of servicing the federal debt is about to jump.\nBut for the federal budget, the news about rising rates is anything but good.\nWhen she does, the rising rates will come in the company of generally good news.\nLow interest rates."}
