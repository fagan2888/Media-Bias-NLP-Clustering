They've doubled the sizes of some of barns.\n\nHe looks at before and after pictures, amazed by how far they've come to be able to reopen just four months later.\n\nOrr says, \"This quick. I didn't think so at all.\"\n\nHe gives all the credit to friends, family and strangers for keeping his spirits up enough to be able to tell a story of strength.\n\n\"That gives you a wonderful feeling,\u201d says Orr. \u201cLike wow! Maybe we're going to be able to do this!\"\n\nOnce again, Orr can enjoy his livelihood and ride around his property proudly.\n\n\"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart,\u201d says Orr. \"It's Oklahoma Strong you know!\"\n\nThe grand reopening is set for Sept. 28 and will stay open for the fall through November.\n\nVisitors can enjoy train rides, those barnyard animals, pumpkin patch, hayrides and a tornado themed, giant corn maze.\n\nThe attraction will be open from Oct. 1 through Nov. 2.\n\nHours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and 1 to 6 p.m. on Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "35.364713;-97.495638", "description": "MOORE, Okla - An outpouring of support has helped a beloved family attraction rebuild after devastation.
