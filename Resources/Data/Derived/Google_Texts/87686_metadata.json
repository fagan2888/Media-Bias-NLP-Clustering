Insurers will be allowed to offer those plans, many of which do not provide comprehensive coverage, to existing customers in the individual market for a year, as long as they educate those re-enrolling about the alternatives in the health care law\u2019s insurance marketplaces.\n\n\u201cI completely get how upsetting [losing insurance] could be for many Americans, especially after they heard assurances from me,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can to help Americans who are receiving these cancellation notices.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate,\u201d Obama added. \u201cMy working assumption was that the majority of those folks would find better policies and lower costs or the same costs in the marketplaces.\u201d\n\nBefore Obama spoke, a senior White House official said that \u201cinsurers can offer customers the option to renew their 2013 plan in 2014 without change, allowing these people to keep their plans.\u201d\n\nAccording to senior White House officials, the regulatory solution would remove the need for legislative action that is being pushed by both parties on Capitol Hill. One bill, offered by Republican Rep. Fred Upton, would allow those less comprehensive plans to be sold to new customers. The officials said such a plan \u201cwould undermine the Affordable Care Act and the marketplaces.\u201d The White House has been skeptical of any legislative solution, which would quickly become a Christmas tree for amendments to undermine the bill.\n\n\u201cI will not accept proposals that are just another brazen attempt to undermine or repeal the law,\u201d Obama said.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner said what Obama offered \u201clittle more than a political response designed to shift blame rather than solve the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter finally acknowledging he repeatedly misled the American people to sell his health care law, the president is asking Americans to trust him again,\u201d Boehner said in a statement. \u201cThe President has absolutely no credibility on his promise.\u201d\n\nThe health insurance industry quickly warned that the administration\u2019s fix could have unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cChanging the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,\u201d Karen Ignagni, president of the trade group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement. \u201cPremiums have already been set for next year based on an assumption of when consumers will be transitioning to the new marketplace. If due to these changes fewer younger and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange, premiums will increase in the marketplace and there will be fewer choices for consumers.\u201d\n\nThe White House shift follows a revolt among congressional Democrats over the law\u2019s rocky implementation, one year before the midterm elections. Officials acknowledged that Obama directed the change in response to public outcry over millions of cancellation notices received by Americans in the individual market, saying the change was designed to further \u201ca better and smoother transition\u201d for them onto the exchanges.\n\nBut the administration fix is not an absolute fulfillment of Obama\u2019s promise. It doesn\u2019t require state regulators to allow the continuation of the plans, and simply allowing insurers to continue offering 2013 plans does not mean they will. Insurers have already sent letters to millions of Americans in the individual market, canceling plans. They now presumably have the option of reversing course. But this is a paperwork nightmare and could be very confusing for consumers. Some may have already selected new plans on Obamacare\u2019s insurance exchanges to replace policies they thought were disappearing. Whether these selections can now be reversed is still not clear.\n\nThe other risk of allowing insurers to continue underwritten 2013 plans is that doing so could skew the risk pool of Americans shopping for ACA-compliant policies in the exchanges. Obamacare requires new plans to accept all comers, regardless of health or preexisting conditions. Young and health consumers shopping in the individual market will generally pay more through the ACA-regulated exchanges than under the old system. Likewise, older and sicker consumers will pay less through the exchanges. This could lead to adverse selection. If the exchanges only attract the sickest consumers and the healthiest ones stay out \u2014 at least for one year \u2014 that could drive premiums up in 2015, as insurers try to recover money they lost by setting 2014 premiums on the assumption they would have a diverse risk pool. The White House officials said they do not believe the delay would adversely impact the makeup of the exchanges.\n\nEither way, next year Americans with these plans will find themselves in the same situation, unless the administration makes this \u201cfix\u201d all over again.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama announced an \u201cadministrative fix\u201d Thursday morning to allow Americans with insurance plans that were supposed to disappear under his health care reform law to keep that coverage for another year, responding to a weeks-long maelstrom of cancellation notices that have rattle...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "With Democrats in revolt over cancellations, an attempt to fulfill pledge that \"if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan\"", "title": "Obama Offers Partial \u2018Fix\u2019 To \u2018You Can Keep It\u2019 Health Care Promise | TIME.com", "url": "http://swampland.time.com/2013/11/14/obama-offers-partial-fix-to-you-can-keep-it-health-care-promise/", "image": "https://timeswampland.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/ap371932039539.jpg?w=753", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Political insight from the Beltway and beyond", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "application-name": "Swampland", "keywords": "health care,", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://swampland.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/11d9978cfec7d5a71822113fdc067df5?s=16", "news_keywords": "health care,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef29\"", "article_summary": "The president\u2019s announcement partly corrects his infamous promise that \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,\u201d at least for a year.\nWith Democrats in revolt over cancellations, an attempt to fulfill pledge that \"if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan\"Charles Dharapak / AP President Barack Obama speaks about his signature health care law.\n\u201cWe fumbled the roll-out on this health care law,\u201d Obama said bluntly.\n\u201cThe President has absolutely no credibility on his promise.\u201dThe health insurance industry quickly warned that the administration\u2019s fix could have unintended consequences.\nThe White House officials said they do not believe the delay would adversely impact the makeup of the exchanges."}
