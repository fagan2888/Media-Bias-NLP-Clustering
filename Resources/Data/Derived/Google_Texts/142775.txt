Police found suspect’s wallet in garbage can

A Bound Brook man who fled the psychiatric unit at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital — Somerville has been charged with burglarizing a nearby home and stealing a bicycle.

Daniel Villano, 41, of Bound Brook, has been charged with stealing a bike from the garage of an Eastern States Parkway home on Sept. 24, according to an affidavit filed Tuesday in Superior Court.

Police investigating the theft of the bike found Villano’s wallet, with his driver’s license, in a garbage can in the garage, the affidavit said.

Police say the garage was entered through an unlocked door.

Earlier that day, the hospital reported that Villano had fled its psychiatric ward. Villano was wearing green scrub pants and a white T-shirt. He was also seen carrying a piece of structure pipe, the affidavit said.

After he was identified as a suspect, Bound Brook Police located Villano and returned him to the psychiatric unit, the affidavit said.
