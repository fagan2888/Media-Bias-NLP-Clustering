Or should Donnie Wahlberg stick to Wahlburgers?\n\nThe star of CBS\u2019s \u201cBlue Bloods\u201d and A&E\u2019s upcoming \u201cWahlburgers\u201d used Twitter Friday to drop a simple-sounding proposal to fixing HealthCare.gov, the website for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAlso read: Mark and Donnie Wahlberg Serving \u2018Wahlburgers\u2019 for A&E\n\n\u201cWhy dump 600,000,000 taxpayer dollars into healthcare website?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhy not dump $2,000,000 in the pockets of 300,000,000 U.S. taxpayers instead?\u201d\n\nYeah! Exactly! Has Obama heard about this? Except\u2026 oh wait.\n\nAccording to calculators, 600,000,000 divided by 300,000,000 is two.\n\nAlso read: Mark Wahlberg Says He Wasn\u2019t Cursing Out Tom Cruise\n\nSo that would be two dollars for every American.\n\nThere were some other problems with Wahlberg\u2019s otherwise great idea. There\u2019s lots of debate about whether the website really costs $600 million. And not all of the 300 million or so Americans pay taxes. Some of them are children, tax-exempt, or lazy good-for-nothings. (The 2012 Romney campaign asked us to mention that last group.)\n\nWahlberg backtracked after providing Friday afternoon tweeters the chance to do what they love best: Make fun of a famous person.\n\n\u201cThat is not a bash on our president. I respect and admire him. Just doing the math,\u201d he said.\n\nLater he conceded he had done the math wrong.\n\n\u201cI know my math is f***ed. Ha Ha Ha! Thats why I stick to acting!\u201d he said. \u201cThats only $2 a person. Enough for half an aspirin! Screw it. Forget what I said! Load up the website and healthcare for all!\u201d\n\nScarier than one of our most beloved celebrities making a public mistake was how many didn\u2019t catch the mistake.
