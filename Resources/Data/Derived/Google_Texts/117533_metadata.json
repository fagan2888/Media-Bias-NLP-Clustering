Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) earlier this year in an effort to protect the nation's lakes and streams from getting clogged with the little pieces of plastic, passed by voice vote.\n\nBecause the beads, which are often used to exfoliate the skin, are less than five millimeters in size, they escape water filtration systems and end up in bodies of water where they are mistaken as food by fish and wildlife.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSimply put, microbeads are causing mega-problems,\u201d said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.). \"Once they\u2019re flushed down the drain, that\u2019s when the problem really begins.\"\n\n\"We must put a stop to this unnecessary and avoidable pollution,\" said Pallone, the ranking Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe bill would pre-empt states from issuing their own their own laws to regulate microbeads. Last month, Pallone said the provision was added because the federal law would phase out products faster than any state law now in place.\n\nThe legislation applies to any non-prescription rinse-off cosmetics, including toothpaste.\n\nA companion bill has also been introduced in the Senate by Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.), who are concerned about protecting the nation\u2019s Great Lakes.\n\nA report earlier this year by the State University of New York in Fredonia found anywhere from 1,500 to 1.1 million microbeads per square mile in the world's largest source of freshwater.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The plastic beads can cause problems once they enter the water system.", "description": "The plastic beads can cause problems once they enter the water system.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The plastic beads can cause problems once they enter the water system.", "title": "House votes to ban microbeads in soap", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/262347-house-votes-to-ban-microbeads-in-soap", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/uptonfred12072015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-07T17:32:23-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-12-07T17:32-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/262347-house-votes-to-ban-microbeads-in-soap", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-07T16:27-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cristina Marcos", "author": "Lydia Wheeler and Cristina Marcos", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Microbeads,Frank Pallone, Fred Upton,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-07T16:27:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-07T17:32:23-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/262347-house-votes-to-ban-microbeads-in-soap", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The plastic beads can cause problems once they enter the water system.", "card": "summary", "title": "House votes to ban microbeads in soap"}, "dcterms.title": "House votes to ban microbeads in soap"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe027f\"", "article_summary": "House lawmakers voted Monday to ban plastic microbeads from bath products such as soaps and body washes.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cSimply put, microbeads are causing mega-problems,\u201d said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.).\nLast month, Pallone said the provision was added because the federal law would phase out products faster than any state law now in place.\nThe bill would pre-empt states from issuing their own their own laws to regulate microbeads.\nDebbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.), who are concerned about protecting the nation\u2019s Great Lakes."}
