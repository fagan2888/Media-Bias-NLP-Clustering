All told, the government spent $172 million over the five-year period. The IG called it a \"grossly excessive\" use of taxpayer dollars.\n\nThe report found taxpayers could save about $14.4 million a year if Medicare put a payment limit on the devices and/or included them in a competitive bidding program.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it agreed with recommendations by the IG aimed at curbing spending on penis pumps, but suggested that Congress bears the most responsibility for fixing the problem.\n\n\"Medicare prices for medical equipment prescribed to a patient by a doctor are set in statute by Congress,\" said CMS spokesman Aaron Albright. \"While Medicare strives to pay appropriately for items and services, and has had success replacing outdated pricing with more reasonable market prices for items covered by our competitive bidding program, CMS does not currently have the authority to subject this equipment to competitive bidding.\"\n\nOnly Congress has the authority to designate items and services which are subject to the competitive bidding program, Albright said. Male vacuum erection systems are currently not covered.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Medicare Penis Pump Spending Called 'Grossly Excessive'", "description": "Medicare Penis Pump Spending Called 'Grossly Excessive'", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/01/medicare-penis-pump-spending-grossly-excessive/", "site_name": "ABC News", "title": "Medicare Penis Pump Spending Called 'Grossly Excessive'"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbda7\"", "article_summary": "Only Congress has the authority to designate items and services which are subject to the competitive bidding program, Albright said.\nGetty ImagesAmerican taxpayers are \"grossly\" overpaying for penis pumps for Medicare beneficiaries to the tune of millions of dollars each year, a government watchdog says.\nMedicare spent $38.6 million on VES in 2011 - up from $20.6 million in 2006, the report found.\nThe IG called it a \"grossly excessive\" use of taxpayer dollars.\nThe little-noticed IG report, completed in December, is grabbing attention this week as Congress turns its focus to a new $1.1 trillion budget agreement and efforts to cut waste."}
