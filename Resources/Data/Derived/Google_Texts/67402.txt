A house in Hampton that started as a log cabin may be one of the oldest standing in Allegheny County, and it's for sale again.

The Walter House on Mount Royal Boulevard in Hampton was built by Revolutionary War soldier John Walter. Records show it dates to about 1794.

Owners Andrew and Jo-Ann Travis began uncovering rustic brick-built fireplaces, including one in their bedroom, soon after moving into the onetime log cabin in 1999.

“We also kept the one log wall in our bedroom, which also is in three other rooms and the hall,” Jo-Ann Travis said. “That helped provide us with the historic nature of the property.”

Exactly when Walter built his log cabin isn't clear. Public records, newspaper stories and legends indicate the home was erected as early as 1787 to 1800. The Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission list the date as 1830-1849.

But experts say such dates are hearsay or guesses made by researchers with little documentation.

The oldest houses in Allegheny County include the Graham House in Monroeville, built in 1780, and the Neville House between Bridgeville and Heidleberg, built in 1785, researchers at the Carnegie Library in Oakland said.

Walter was born in 1761 and died in 1846, according to a grave marker. The marker says he was a Revolutionary War soldier, serving as a private in Capt. J. Irwin's 8th PA Regiment between 1776 and his discharge in 1779 at age 18. The marker is a few houses away from the Travis home. According to various accounts, Walter's log cabin was expanded and remodeled by various owners. A bedroom and the beginning of a second story were added in the 1840s. Around 1900, the owners added three bedrooms upstairs as well as a dining room and kitchen, according to a 2003 book, “Historic Hampton Township.”

The Travises bought the house from Pat and Jim Rafferty, of Florida, who spent 30 years there, adding modern improvements without disturbing the historical nature of the house. Jim Rafferty said it was in “bad shape” when they bought it.

Various claims about the Walter house seem to back up the idea of its origin in the late 1700s, while other books and maps create more questions than answers.

According to a “History of Allegheny County, Pa.,” published in 1876 by L.H. Everts & Co., Walter settled on a 15-acre tract of land in Hampton in 1794. Census records show Walter as a resident of the county in 1800.

That the house was built around that time was noted by Sue Addis Stanny, formerly of the Depreciation Lands Museum, who wrote “somehow Walters knew George Washington well, and sometime between the Revolutionary War and the start of his presidency (in 1789) Washington stopped at the Walters cabin.” She was quoted in a 2011 In Hampton magazine article. She could not be reached for comment.

Karen Parsons, office manager and volunteer coordinator for the Depreciation Lands Museum, said a map shows John Walter formally acquired the land in 1829.

“Regardless of the date of the house, it is an important historic home,” she said.

Sandy Bardoner Rodenbaugh of Medina, Ohio, grew up in the house in Hampton where John Walter's grave is located. She is writing a history of Hampton, and believes the log cabin was erected in 1794 because of information that shows John Walter got a land grant that year, possibly as payment for his Revolutionary War service.

Census records viewed by the Tribune-Review online show a John Walter living in Westmoreland County in 1790, and apparent family records show he married Catherine Freund there in 1782. The 1800 census showed a John Walter living in Pine — a portion of which became Hampton — in Allegheny County.

Jo-Ann Travis says a man named Elmo Jay Walter Jr. showed up at her front door one day in 2010.

“He said he was a descendant of John Walter, that he loved the house and wanted to look around,” she said.

After a tour, he wrote down the family tree back to John Walter's father and mother, who had 11 children.

“John Walter (was) in Revolutionary War for 9 months,” he wrote. “Had to prove to Allegheny County he was in the war (to confirm) Depreciation Land,” wrote Walter, who could not be reached for comment.

The Travises are asking $288,000 for the house.
