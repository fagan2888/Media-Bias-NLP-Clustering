It\u2019s a reminder \u2014 especially to the media \u2014 that, with the federal government rendered impotent by partisan gridlock and poor leadership \u2014 significant political and policy action is taking place at the state level.\n\nEvery good newspaper and TV network needs to upgrade and systematize its (currently haphazard) coverage of good and bad things happening at the state level and the politics behind them.\n\nAs Nicholas Confessore\u2019s piece reports, almost every one of the 23 states totally dominated by Republicans has passed new restrictions on abortion, made it harder to vote, refused to expand Medicaid as part of Obamacare, moved to limit union power and barred same-sex marriage.\n\nMost all of the 13 states dominated by Democrats and the 13 mixed-control states \u2014 Nebraska has a nonpartisan legislature \u2014 have rejected abortion and voting restrictions, have expanded Medicaid, have a minimum wage higher than the national federal requirement and either have legalized same-sex marriage or are close to doing so.\n\nWhat needs systematic reportage is not just what\u2019s happening on these and other fronts, but what the consequences are.\n\n2. The NYT piece is another reminder of how polarized the country is \u2014 the map shows the South, Mountain West and (since 2010) significant parts of the Midwest in bright red.\n\nThat, plus this recent Gallup poll report showing the 70 percent domination of the GOP by conservatives and increasing liberal influence among Democrats \u2014 means that we are becoming two nations, deeply divided ideologically and geographically. That\u2019s the bad news.\n\n3. The good news, if there is any, is that this will be a good time for the states to be closely examined as \u201claboratories of democracy.\u201d\n\nGood reporting \u2014 by the media, assisted by think tanks \u2014 should be tracking not just policy changes imposed in single-party states but the human results they produce \u2014 unemployment, economic growth and poverty rates, health statistics, education performance, incarceration rates, pollution levels, voter participation, etc.\n\nIf you read The Wall Street Journal editorial page, you find lots of assertions that red states like Texas are booming. If you listen to MSNBC, you\u2019d think ordinary people are systematically victimized there and California is again Paradise. Anyone is free to comb databases to track the truth, of course, but the media should do it all the time.\n\n4. Likely as not, at least a few 2014 GOP candidates for president will be governors \u2014 New Jersey\u2019s Chris Christie (if Tollgate doesn\u2019t eliminate him), Louisiana\u2019s Bobby Jindal, maybe Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker and Ohio\u2019s John R. Kasich. And Texas Gov. Rick Perry seems to think he deserves a second try.\n\nAnd among Democrats, let\u2019s hope New York\u2019s Andrew M. Cuomo and Maryland\u2019s Martin O\u2019Malley won\u2019t be scared off by the Hillary Rodham Clinton juggernaut.\n\nInstead of waiting until the campaign gets started and charges and countercharges fly about the performance of these governors, the media should be paying systematic attention starting now. Who has improved student performance? Job growth? Public health? How do GOP governors stack up against Democrats?\n\n5. The Times story is basically about crafty fundraising \u2014 especially how use of loopholes in various states\u2019 laws masterminded by gifted GOP strategist Ed Gillespie for the Republican State Leadership Committee resulted in huge gains for that party in 2010, then was copied by liberal and gay groups in 2012.\n\nIt\u2019s an implicit lament for the demise of the campaign finance reform movement that culminated in the 2002 McCain-Feingold Act limiting the size and use of political money. Increasingly \u2014 maybe, as ever \u2014 anything goes in campaign finance, and now it\u2019s been blessed by the U.S. Supreme Court. And may be again.\n\nThe upshot is that political reformers need to radically change focus away from trying to control money and start trying at the state level to combat gerrymandering, open up primaries and make voting easier \u2014 all to enhance participation by moderates and independents.\n\n6. Final lesson that underscores all of the above: Gillespie & Co. were so successful in 2010 that GOP legislatures and governors gerrymandered their party into Republican domination of the U.S. House for the rest of this decade. This means that politics in Washington is going to remain gridlocked and impotent \u2014 Democratic president, hostile Congress \u2014 until at least 2017. So the action is going to be at the state level. Let\u2019s watch it \u2014 really closely.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The New York Times\u2019 front-page story\u00a0on Jan. 12 on one-party domination of all but 13 state governments is an important piece of journalism that should cause serious rethinking and action.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "The New York Times\u2019 front-page story\u00a0on Jan. 12 on one-party domination of all but 13 state governments is an important piece of journalism that should cause serious rethinking and action.", "title": "It's the States, Stupid! | Pennsylvania Avenue", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/its-the-states-stupid", "image": {"type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2014-01-22T15:00:44Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "The New York Times\u2019 front-page story\u00a0on Jan. 12 on one-party domination of all but 13 state governments is an important piece of journalism that should cause serious rethinking and action.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,author,category,pennsylvania-avenue", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-22T15:00:44Z", "modified_time": "2014-01-22T15:00:44Z"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/its-the-states-stupid", "site": "@rollcall", "description": "The New York Times\u2019 front-page story\u00a0on Jan. 12 on one-party domination of all but 13 state governments is an important piece of journalism that should cause serious rethinking and action.", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)", "title": "It's the States, Stupid! | Pennsylvania Avenue"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "If you read The Wall Street Journal editorial page, you find lots of assertions that red states like Texas are booming.\nHow do GOP governors stack up against Democrats?\nMost all of the 13 states dominated by Democrats and the 13 mixed-control states \u2014 Nebraska has a nonpartisan legislature \u2014 have rejected abortion and voting restrictions, have expanded Medicaid, have a minimum wage higher than the national federal requirement and either have legalized same-sex marriage or are close to doing so.\nThis means that politics in Washington is going to remain gridlocked and impotent \u2014 Democratic president, hostile Congress \u2014 until at least 2017.\nWhat needs systematic reportage is not just what\u2019s happening on these and other fronts, but what the consequences are."}
