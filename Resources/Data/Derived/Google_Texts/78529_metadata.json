The couple spoke to moms in the Oval Office Wednesday, just five days before a Dec. 23 deadline for consumers to select a plan if they want coverage at the beginning of the new year.\n\nMrs. Obama rarely gets involved in her husband's policy battles. But public opinion polls show she's a more popular advocate than her husband, so she's helping push his unpopular law ahead of the critical deadline.\n\nObama has enlisted his wife to help him explain the health insurance reform.

Minorities are less likely to have health insurance, so the administration has been targeting them in sign-up campaigns.\n\nThe Obama administration needs millions of Americans _ especially younger, healthy people _ to sign up through new exchanges to keep prices low. Insurance sign-ups through the exchanges have been hindered in the first months by widespread website problems.\n\nFirst lady Michelle Obama speaks to the media on how health care reform benefits families. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nObama told seven moms and one aunt sitting on couches in his office that their experiences keep him fighting to make the law work. Several of the moms have children with pre-existing conditions that are required to be covered by the law or have sons and daughters who now are able to stay on family plans until age 26.\n\n``There's something about moms,'' Obama said. He said they have credibility, often make family health care decisions and ``can tell young people who think they're invincible that they're not and prod them to at least get information.''\n\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama joined the President for an Oval Office meeting with mothers to discuss health care reform. (MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA)\n\nThe first lady added that convincing young adults that they aren't invincible is ``our job as mothers.''\n\n``Make it a Christmas treat around the table to talk about a little health care,'' she told the mothers in front of media invited in to cover the end of the meeting. ``Ring in the New Year with new coverage.''\n\nAs reporters were leaving the room, the women could be heard laughing after Obama added, ``Although I will say you should probably get another Christmas present.''", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "Michelle Obama is suggesting a different kind of Christmas present for moms to give this year _ a family discussion on health insurance.", "title": "Michelle Obama helps the President sell Obamacare", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/michelle-obama-helps-president-sell-obamacare-article-1.1552678", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1552674.1387462303!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, Michelle Obama", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.tags": "Barack Obama, Michelle Obama", "nydn_tags": "michelle obama", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Michelle Obama", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/michelle-obama-helps-president-sell-obamacare-article-1.1552678", "parsely-title": "Michelle Obama helps the President sell Obamacare", "sailthru.date": "2013-12-19T09:14:46-0500", "sailthru.title": "Michelle Obama helps the President sell Obamacare", "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-12-19T14:14:46", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1552674.1387462303!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama.jpg", "description": "Michelle Obama is suggesting a different kind of Christmas present for moms to give this year _ a family discussion on health insurance.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Michelle Obama is suggesting a different kind of Christmas present for moms to give this year _ a family discussion on health insurance.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Michelle Obama is suggesting a different kind of Christmas present for moms to give this year _ a family discussion on health insurance.", "title": "Michelle Obama helps the President sell Obamacare", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/michelle-obama-helps-president-sell-obamacare-article-1.1552678", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1552674.1387462303!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "michelle obama", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1552674.1387462303!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "sailthru.credits": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa3e\"", "article_summary": "First Lady Michelle Obama joined the President for an Oval Office meeting with mothers to discuss health care reform.\nFirst lady Michelle Obama speaks to the media on how health care reform benefits families.\nFirst lady Michelle Obama is suggesting a different kind of Christmas present for moms to give this year _ a family discussion on health insurance.\n``There's something about moms,'' Obama said.\nObama has enlisted his wife to help him explain the health insurance reform."}
