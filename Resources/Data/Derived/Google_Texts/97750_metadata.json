Also, the ACA limits apply only to health-contingent wellness programs, not to participatory wellness programs, so there's no limit on the incentives employers can offer for participatory programs that don't track individuals' health outcomes.\n\nBut the EEOC's 30 percent incentive limit applies to health-contingent and participatory wellness programs, if the program includes medical exams or inquiries. And the EEOC proposal doesn't include a separate 50 percent incentive permitted by the ACA regulations for an employee's enrollment in a tobacco cessation program.\n\nThe \u201cgood news\u201d is the EEOC allies itself with the existing regulations under the ACA issued by the departments of Labor, Treasury and Health and Human Services, according to Gretchen Young, general counsel with the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington.\n\nHow Calculate Incentive?\n\nBut the \u201ckey ambiguity\u201d in the EEOC's proposal is how to calculate the incentive, Young told Bloomberg BNA May 4.\n\nThe ACA tri-agency regulations allow employers to offer more generous monetary incentives for participation in wellness programs, including 30 percent off an employee's cost for family coverage if an employee's family members also can participate in the wellness program, said Mark Girouard of Nilan Johnson Lewis in Minneapolis.\n\nIf the EEOC proposal is finalized without significant changes, employers offering wellness programs would be subject to \u201cdifferent standards\u201d under the EEOC and tri-agency regulations, Girouard told Bloomberg BNA May 22.\n\nThe EEOC's proposed 30 percent maximum incentive is \u201ca far smaller amount\u201d than an employer currently can offer under the ACA regulations, said Solander of Epstein Becker.\n\nIt's also troubling that the EEOC proposal doesn't include the tobacco cessation incentive provision, Solander told Bloomberg BNA April 29. Presumably the EEOC instead would wrap any incentives for smoking cessation into the overall 30 percent limit, he said.\n\nUnder the EEOC proposal, there's a danger \u201cthe \u2018incentive' becomes so small it may not act as an incentive\u201d for employees to participate in wellness programs, said Frank Morris, also with Epstein Becker in Washington.\n\nMultiple Notices Potential \u2018Headache.'\n\nThe EEOC's proposal includes a written notice requirement stating that the employer must clearly explain to employees offered a wellness program what medical information will be obtained, how the information will be used, the restrictions on its disclosure and the methods the employer will use to prevent improper disclosure.\n\nThe EEOC's proposed rule permits disclosure to employers of medical information obtained by wellness programs \u201conly in aggregate form,\u201d except as necessary to administer the health plan.\n\nTo the extent that the EEOC would require employers to provide notice \u201cseparate and above\u201d that already required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, it could cause administrative \u201cheadaches\u201d that create a \u201cdisincentive\u201d to offer wellness programs, Girouard said.\n\nSolander also expressed misgivings about the EEOC's notice provision. Under the ACA's tri-agency regulations, an employer already must provide participants with notice of \u201calternative pathways\u201d to achieve a wellness plan's health objectives, he said.\n\nThe EEOC notice is \u201cgoing to be duplicative\u201d and \u201ccould raise problems\u201d in getting employees to sign acknowledgments that they've received, read and understood the notice, Solander said. It's already \u201cvery difficult\u201d to get employees to return signed notices, so the EEOC proposal could \u201creally hinder\u201d wellness plan participation, he said.\n\nIf an employer can't offer one \u201cblanket notice\u201d that would satisfy its ADA, ACA and HIPAA obligations, it's \u201clikely to chill the willingness to offer\u201d employee wellness plans as part of group health coverage, Girouard said.\n\nAffordability, Plan Design Could be Problems\n\nThe EEOC also is seeking comment on whether additional protections for low-income employees may be needed to ensure their participation in a covered wellness program truly is voluntary under the ADA.\n\nThat suggests that the EEOC may require employers to test the \u201caffordability\u201d of health care coverage for each of its plans for each employee, Girouard said.\n\n\u201cIf that suggestion becomes the rule, then the same wellness plan incentives could be voluntary for some employees, and non-voluntary for others, which would obviously create significant administrative headaches,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother \u201cpotential problem area\u201d is the EEOC's discussion and request for comments on the \u201creasonable design\u201d of wellness plans, Morris said. Under HIPAA and the ACA, wellness plans must be reasonably designed to achieve positive health outcomes.\n\nThe tri-agency regulations under the ACA give employers \u201ca fair amount of leeway\u201d on setting up their wellness programs, Morris said. But the EEOC's proposal threatens to make the agency an \u201carbiter\u201d of how such programs are designed, he said. Morris expressed doubt the EEOC really is authorized to do so under the ADA.\n\nDisfavoring Wellness Programs?\n\nThe EEOC's proposal in some respects is \u201ca death by a thousand cuts\u201d regarding wellness programs, Solander said. The agency's proposal could be seen as \u201cdisfavoring\u201d wellness programs, he added.\n\nAlthough the EEOC says consistency with the ACA and the tri-agency regulations is important, it's striking how much the EEOC proposal veers away from the health care law and its implementing regulations, Morris said.\n\nMorris emphasized that wherever the EEOC lands with its final rule, the agency must give employers plenty of lead time to modify wellness programs. An employer can't just \u201cturn around\u201d its group health plan provisions except during the plan's open season, he said.\n\nThe effective date of an EEOC final rule has to be \u201csomewhat realistic,\u201d Morris said. He suggested a final rule effective for plan years that begin Jan. 1, 2017, or later, for example, would provide appropriate lead time for employers. An EEOC rule that took effect \u201cimmediately\u201d or within 30 days would be a problem, Morris said.\n\nThe EEOC's proposal diminishes the prospects for congressional action on Republican-backed legislation addressing wellness programs, said Young of the ERISA Industry Committee. Employers also are relieved the EEOC apparently will refrain from suing employers under the ADA regarding wellness programs while its proposed rule is pending, she said.\n\n\u201cMy employers will comply with just about anything\u201d provided they know the rules, Young said. The EEOC proposal has eased employers' anxieties about whether federal law permits financial incentives for participation in wellness plans encouraged by the ACA, she said.\n\nDisability Rights Advocate Disappointed\n\nThe EEOC's proposal allowing financial penalties or incentives is \u201cnot a surprise,\u201d but it's disappointing from the perspective of disability rights groups to see the agency apparently \u201cwalk back\u201d the ADA's protections, said Mathis of the Bazelon Center.\n\nThe EEOC's rationale \u201cseems a little perplexing\u201d as the agency says it needs to conform ADA regulations with separate health care laws\u2014the ACA and HIPAA\u2014that have different purposes and can coexist with the ADA, Mathis said.\n\nThis is \u201cexactly the same set of concerns\u201d the EEOC faced in developing its GINA rules, but the agency then decided \u201cvoluntary\u201d in the GINA context meant an employer couldn't impose financial penalties or offer inducements for disclosure of an individual's genetic information, Mathis said.\n\nThe EEOC should reach the same conclusion regarding medical exams and inquiries under the ADA exception for \u201cvoluntary\u201d health programs, she said.\n\nIn its introduction to the proposed ADA regulations, the EEOC says \u201cit's a plausible interpretation\u201d that the act precludes employers from imposing financial penalties for an individual's declining to submit to medical inquiries or exams, Mathis said. But then for reasons that aren't entirely clear, except to move the ADA regulations closer to those under the ACA, the EEOC abandons that position, she said.\n\nNo Conflict Between ADA and ACA\n\nThere isn't a conflict between the ADA and the ACA, which is a separate health-care law with purposes entirely distinct from federal anti-discrimination law, Mathis said.\n\nInstead of producing a financial incentive regimen under the ADA that is inconsistent with both the ACA and its own GINA regulations, the EEOC should say no financial penalties can be levied on an employee who refuses to answer medical questions or submit to a medical exam, Mathis said.\n\nEmployers still could sponsor wellness programs that include health risk assessments or questionnaires but could flag the questions that are medical inquiries, Mathis said. Many of the questions on such assessments involve lifestyle inquiries that don't trigger the ADA, she said. The EEOC should say employers then must make clear an employee declining to answer the medical questions can't be financially penalized or otherwise disadvantaged regarding employee benefits, Mathis said.\n\nThe EEOC proposal does include \u201csome small protections\u201d for employees, such as the notice provision requiring employers to inform workers in advance what information is being sought and how it will be used and protected from disclosure, Mathis said.\n\nBut overall, the EEOC leaves employees faced with \u201ca Hobson's choice\u201d of surrendering their medical information or refusing and having to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars in penalty, Mathis said. \u201cThat doesn't solve the problem\u201d of the potential for coercive disclosure of information the ADA is meant to protect, she said.\n\nThe EEOC later this year plans to issue a proposed GINA rule regarding employer financial incentives for family members participating in wellness plans. Given the agency's ADA proposal, Mathis said she fears the EEOC is poised to redefine \u201cvoluntary\u201d in the GINA context as well.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kevin McGowan in Washington at kmcgowan@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Susan J.
