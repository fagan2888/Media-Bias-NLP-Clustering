Kim Clijsters and her husband Bryan Lynch welcomed a new baby boy into the world this week.

People Magazine reports that this is the second child for Clijsters and Lynch. The new baby, who was born on September 18, was given the name Jack Leon Lynch.

The couple made the announcement on Twitter, writing: “Jack Leon Lynch is born! Born at 7:06 p.m. tonight and we are both doing well… His big sister, mama and daddy are very proud and happy!”

Clijsters and Lynch already have a five-year-old girl named Jade Ellie.

Kim Clijsters is known by many as a tennis champion but the 30-year-old mother of two hung up her racket last year after the US Open.

Cljisters said at the time: “As a little girl, I got Christmas rackets under the tree and outfits of Steffi Graf and Monica Seles, and I would want to wear them to bed, I was so excited… So for me to have been able to have been a part of women’s tennis, and on top of women’s tennis for so many years — you don’t think about it when you’re in it; you’re kind of on automatic pilot…. Now that I think about it, it’s been a crazy rollercoaster at times, as well.”

Shortly after her retirement, Clijsters announced that she was pregnant with her second child.

The tennis champion said: “We are of course delighted… I’m doing fine, even though I tire more easily right now.”
