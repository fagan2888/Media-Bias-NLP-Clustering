And based on the risk factors in the best-performing counties, the report highlights disparities the authors say could be changed if all Floridians had the same opportunities:\n\n544,000 fewer adult smokers\n\n478,000 fewer adults who are obese\n\n799,000 fewer adults who drink excessively\n\n1,000,000 fewer people who are uninsured\n\n296,000 more adults ages 25-44 with some education beyond high school\n\n147,000 fewer people who are unemployed\n\n196,000 fewer children in poverty\n\n56,000 fewer violent crimes\n\n664,000 fewer households with severe housing problems\n\n\u201cThis is really a call to action,\u201d says Dr. Roderick King, a pediatrician and the CEO of the Florida Institute for Health Innovation in Miami.\n\nKing and the organizations behind this study hope that by highlighting these gaps throughout Florida, communities and policymakers will approach things like employment and housing and police policies as public health opportunities.\n\nAccording to King, it may not be obvious at first, but those are the kinds of things that can have a big impact on health in the long term.\n\n\u201cYour capacity to graduate from high school is linked to your ability to have meaningful employment and to be able to provide for yourself and your family financially,\u201d says King. \u201cBut what we also found is that if you're unable to do those things and hold a job that means you\u2019re less likely to have health insurance, you\u2019re less likely to probably have a healthier lifestyle.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A new study of state death rates shows more Floridians die early in some counties than in others\u2014and researchers have a few ideas about how to change that.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/where-you-live-matters-floridians-die-earlier-some-counties", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201511/screen_shot_2015-11-11_at_11.14.03_am.png", "type": "article", "description": "A new study of state death rates shows more Floridians die early in some counties than in others\u2014and researchers have a few ideas about how to change that.", "title": "Where You Live Matters: Floridians Die Earlier In Some Counties"}, "org_id": 0, "has_audio": 0, "author": "Sammy Mack", "wordCount": 361, "dc": {"title": "Where You Live Matters: Floridians Die Earlier In Some Counties"}, "nid": 12652, "datePublished": "2015-11-12", "keywords": "death rates, preventable deaths, Florida State Health Gaps report", "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A new study of state death rates shows more Floridians die early in some counties than in others\u2014and researchers have a few ideas about how to change that.\nThe Florida State Health Gaps report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute examines factors that influence health\u2014everything from smoking and obesity rates, to unemployment, to air pollution\u2014alongside county-by-county death rates.\nControlling for county population size, researchers found there are nearly 8,000 preventable deaths annually in Florida.\nAccording to King, it may not be obvious at first, but those are the kinds of things that can have a big impact on health in the long term.\n\u201cBut what we also found is that if you're unable to do those things and hold a job that means you\u2019re less likely to have health insurance, you\u2019re less likely to probably have a healthier lifestyle.\u201d"}
