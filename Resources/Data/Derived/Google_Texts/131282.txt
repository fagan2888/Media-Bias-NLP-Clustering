WASHINGTON — A federal judge has turned down a request from a Guantanamo Bay hunger striker to alter the way he is force-fed, including the daily practice of inserting and removing his feeding tube.

U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler on Friday ruled against Syrian prisoner Abu Wa’el Dhiab. He’s been held at Guantanamo without charge for 12 years and was cleared for release in 2009.

Last year, Dhiab joined a mass hunger strike to protest the condition inside the prison and the delays in releasing many detainees who also have been cleared for release.

The judge described Dhiab as “sick, depressed and desperate,” but said he did not overcome legal hurdles to change the way he is fed.
