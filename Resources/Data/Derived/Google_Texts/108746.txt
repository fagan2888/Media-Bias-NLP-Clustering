Monarch freshman Trimm wins twice in BoCo debut

THORNTON — The girls state swim meet is about three weeks away, but it wouldn't be a stretch to say Fairview is ready now.

The favored Knights poured it on Saturday at the Boulder County Invitational at the Veterans Memorial Aquatics Center, performing to their lofty ambitions and even exceeding some.

Most prominent were freshman Brittney Beetcher and junior Julia Box, who each went 4 for 4, winning their individual events in addition to the relays they participated in.

"Both Brittney and Julia performed at expectations," Fairview coach Bob Smartt said. "They're both at the junior-national level, so a lot is expected of them. It's the girls right below that who came up with a really good meet."

Monarch freshman Sidney Trimm sheds a winning smile after placing first in the 50 freestyle at the Boulder County Invitational.

Beetcher won 200 and 500 freestyle races, setting a meet record in the 200 in 1 minute, 53.11 seconds (.59 better than Monarch's Anna Lobazon in 2010).

"I was super happy to get the record," Beetcher said. "Even though it wasn't a personal best, I was still really proud of myself and it was fun to win it for Fairview."

The Knights scored a whopping 909 points, easily distancing themselves from second-place Monarch (524) and No. 3 Boulder (451). Fairview won nine of the 12 events, including triumphs by Box in the butterfly and backstroke.

"I'm pretty content with all my races today," Box said. "None of them were bests, but they were all close so I'm super happy with where I am. Looking at state, I think I'm going to do pretty well."

Fairview winners also included Sandra Freeman (200 individual medley) and Julia Benz (diving) in addition to victories in all three relays.

The Knights also had a goal of qualifying 24 swimmers for state this season. They qualified five new ones Saturday to push their total to 28. Included were Lucia Majeticova, Hannah Keay and Cassidy Waldrip (all in breastroke), Greta Dunn (butterfly) and Victoria Felton (50 and 100 free).

Monarch freshman Sidney Trimm broke through the Fairview curtain to post two victories of her own. She won the 50 freestyle in 24.34 and the 100 free in 52.61.

"It feels good," Trimm said. "We had some tough competition here and I just wanted to do the best for my team. It was a lot of fun."

Trimm swims club with the Front Range Barracudas, who use VMAC as their home pool. She felt right at home in that regard and continued a stellar freshman season that's soon to make her a household name on the circuit.

"I thought I was going to do well this year, but it's a shock for me," said Trimm, who also assisted the Coyotes to a third-place finish in the medley relay amd a second-place finish in the 200 freestyle relay.

Monarch also got good production from Courtney Roeber (fourth in 50 free), Brie Yost (fifth in 500 free) and diver Savannah Magness, who finished second.

The only other non-Fairview winner was Niwot's Hannah Driscoll, a breaststroke extraordinaire who won the event in 1:06.26.

Boulder earned its third-place finish despite competing without standouts Amanda Richey, Natasha Reidenbach and Miranda Sullivan, who were at club meets. Panthers sophomore Josie Valette finished fourth in the 200 IM and sixth in the butterfly, and junior Hannah Varner placed sixth in each the 200 and 500 free style.

"Varner got her cut for the 200 free which was good, because we've had nine individual people qualify for state," said Boulder coach Curt Colby, who team also posted two top-four relay finishes. "Josie was solid and a couple other girls saw some drops."
