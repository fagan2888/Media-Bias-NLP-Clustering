It started in Boston, where a widow dropped a diamond ring and wedding band into a Salvation Army red kettle, an act of generosity that sparked others to do the same this holiday season.

On Tuesday in Racine, someone left a diamond engagement wedding ring set at a Salvation Army kettle located at a Pick 'n Save at 1202 S. Green Bay Road.

"They seem to be popping up all over," said Ken Nicolai, a major at the Salvation Army. "You marvel at those kinds of stories. This was truly an unexpected find. It's just very generous, especially since the person is anonymous."

The donation was first reported Wednesday by the website, Racine County Eye.

"We don't know how much the ring is worth," Nicolai said, but noted a volunteer who is an appraiser told him the diamond was genuine. Nicolai said he believed the donation was also genuine, and not a mistake by someone who lost the ring.

It has been quite a finish to the holiday season for the Racine Salvation Army. Heading into last weekend, the organization was well short of its kettle campaign goal of more than $300,000. But on Saturday, volunteers raised a record $17,938. Nicolai said S.C. Johnson announced it would "double match" Saturday's haul to boost the total.

"We had that wind in our sails and yesterday (Tuesday) the diamond ring appeared," Nicolai said. "It has been like a miracle. We expected to go into the new year short but this has been a real Christmas blessing for us."
