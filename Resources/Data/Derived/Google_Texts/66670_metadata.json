Patty Disney came to see George Spellman.\n\nSpellman, who said he is in his sixties, is not a world leader or a celebrity. He is a homeless man, living on the streets and battling colon cancer and a broken heart. His 10-year-old daughter was killed, hit by a car, and his life unraveled from there.\n\nBut as Francis delighted hundreds of thousands with his appearances at Independence Hall and on Benjamin Franklin Parkway Saturday (Sept. 27), Disney and a band of 360 volunteers bypassed the crowds and went in search of people like Spellman \u2014 down and out and living on the streets.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just be present with the Holy Father,\u201d Disney said, preferring a \u201ctrue spirit of service and a missionary heart.\u201d\n\nAnd that heart is inspired by Francis, who has said, \u201cA little bit of mercy makes the world less cold and more just.\u201d\n\nREAD: \u2018God weeps,\u2019 says Pope Francis, calling for accountability on sex abuse crimes\n\nDisney came to Philadelphia with Love and Serve, an Atlanta-based group whose weekend mission trip was dubbed \u201cServe with Francis.\u201d\n\nWhile the pope was busy encouraging immigrants, praising the family, and consoling clergy sex abuse victims, the volunteers poured out into the streets \u2014 an army in bright yellow T-shirts \u2014 to bring clothes, toiletries and food to this city\u2019s estimated 5,500 homeless.\n\nThey also gave the people they ministered to a Catholic message \u2014 a book with a collection of the pope\u2019s writings and a rainbow of colored plastic rosaries.\n\nThe volunteers \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 set up camp at St. Andrew Lithuanian Roman Catholic Church, just a few blocks from the secure enclosure where Francis is set to celebrate Mass on Sunday (Sept. 27).\n\nThey organized bundles of gently used clothing, shoes and care packages of food, toothpaste, shampoo and soap.\n\nThe organization divided into separate groups and ventured off to different sections of the city, from homeless shelters to city streets.\n\nAs the volunteers moved, people began to slide out of hidden places to engage with them. One of those was James Williams, who said he had been homeless since his mother died last May.\n\n\u201cGod is here,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if he wasn\u2019t here.\u201d\n\nClick on the logo for more Religion News Service coverage of the pope in the U.S.\n\nYS/AMB END WILKINS", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Catholic, Christian, homeless, Lithuanian Catholic, Love and Serve, ministry, outreach, Pope Francis, U.S. papal visit", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "PHILADELPHIA (RNS) Bands of volunteers came here not to see Pope Francis, but to minister to the homeless.", "title": "Inspired by Pope Francis, 360 volunteers minister to homeless people", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/27/inspired-pope-francis-360-volunteers-minister-homeless-people/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/thumbRNS-PHILLY-MINSTRY092715a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/27/inspired-pope-francis-360-volunteers-minister-homeless-people/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/27/inspired-pope-francis-360-volunteers-minister-homeless-people/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "PHILADELPHIA (RNS) Bands of volunteers came here not to see Pope Francis, but to minister to the homeless."}, "article_summary": "PHILADELPHIA (RNS) Most people here came to see Pope Francis.\nPatty Disney came to see George Spellman.\nHe is a homeless man, living on the streets and battling colon cancer and a broken heart.\nThe organization divided into separate groups and ventured off to different sections of the city, from homeless shelters to city streets.\n\u201cImagine if he wasn\u2019t here.\u201dClick on the logo for more Religion News Service coverage of the pope in the U.S.YS/AMB END WILKINS"}
