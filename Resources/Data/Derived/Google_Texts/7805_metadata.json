He covered the 800 in 2:00.07, the 1,600 in 4:36.06.\n\n\"We had about five or six sick kids, so we were shuffling some things around,\" LHS coach Paul Quere said. \"Marcus obviously had a really good meet, winning two tough races and setting meet records against some pretty decent competition.\n\n\"We had some kids step in and do a really good things, so it was definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nMarcus wasn't the only Indian finding the top step on the podium as the Loveland girls put together a pair of winning relays, the 400 and 3,200. Hannah Weinmaster, Blair Bernhardt, Rae McCloughan and Sara Jones took care of the shorter event; Kristina Ritschard, Ashlyn Brent, Courtney Bale adn Madeline Kelster the longer. Brent also went on to win the 800 (2:29.86), while McCloughan had a pair of top-three individual finishes, Josie Eder and Weinmaster one each.\n\nThe boys 800 relay team took second, while Treven Long was third twice, both in the 100 and 200 sprints. Kyle Brinkman and Zach Jones also had third-place finishes.\n\nBerthoud was also at the meet and came away with a meet record, as Josie Spitz set a new standard in the girls pole vault at 11-1. Alyssa Strong won the 100 hurdles and placed second in the triple jump, with coach Colby Schultz adding that freshman Sophie Visger continues to excel in the high jump and sprint events.\n\n\"I expected Josie and Alyssa to exceed my expectations, but the great surprise for me today was freshman Sophie Visger in the high jump and her leg of the sprint medley,\" Schultz said. \"The last two weeks Sophie has me thinking she could be the next Cheyenne Hall (currently running for CSU) for BHS. Good things sometimes come in small packages.\"\n\nHe also felt the freshmen additions for the boys are starting to bolster the relays, still led by Michael Woodiel.\n\nHarrison Panther Invitational\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 Mountain View continues to prove why its a legitimate state title contender for both the boys and the girls with wins for each team Saturday. The boys won comfortably with 131 points, while the girls were closer but still dominant at a mark of 95.\n\n\"We had great conditions to go out and compete and you can't ask for much more than that,\" MVHS coach Kevin Clark said. \"I think overall, we're not there (at state title level) yet, but it was good for establishing confidence and at a 24-plus team meet and to walk away with both team titles was pretty nice.\n\n\"Plain Creek is as good as it gets at 5A in relays and we were able to get some. I think that was probably more of the focus today, to show our strength in the relays.\"\n\nOn the girls' side, the 3,200 relay team of Rachel Franklin, Kate Benner, Caroline Foster and Abby Stewart won with a 10.28.02, and the 800 relay of Yasmine Hernandez, Sammi Watson, Kellie Benner and Joscelyn Wind took first in 1:47.67. Sophomore Lauren Offerman and senior Riley Cooney each won individually in the 800 (2:21.90) and 1,600 (5:11.56).\n\nFor the boys, the 3,200 relay won in 8:38.52 (AJ Marcus, Michael Gheller, Peter Frankling and Julian Von Holton), as did the 800 relay of Nolan Kembel, Logan Stewart, Ryan Vomacka and Jon Goltz (1:32.19). Scott Sipes won the discuss with a throw of 146-00.50 and Stewart the long jump in 21-08.50.\n\nValor Christian Invitational\n\nHIGHLANDS RANCH \u2014 For it only being Thompson Valley's first big track meet of the season, the Eagles impressed by coming out of the gate strong and setting a high standard for the rest of the year.\n\nThe Eagles already started setting personal records, including many of the veteran athletes competing for TV coach Ryan Williams, with wins across the board on both the boys and girls' sides.\n\n\"We had a great day. It was good competition and a lot of our top kids stepped up; several set PRs and they're looking strong,\" Williams said. \"It was a really good meet. It was an all-around good day in their first big meet of the season. For this early in the year, we're excited.\"\n\nSenior Ali Artzberger placed first in long jump (17-08) and the 800 relay team of Kelsi Schuetz, Maren Janda, Megan Irvine and Artzberger also won (1:45.59). Schuetz won the 100 (12.82) in the girls' race, while Irvine placed first in both the 200 (25.90) and 400 (58.03) and Kendra Larson won the 300 hurdles (46.25). Andrew Bradburry took the crown in the 100 (11.14) for the boys.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/preps/ci_27714814/prep-track-roundup-lovelands-marcus-quere-has-record", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0314/20150314__15rhspreptrackw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Sports Staff", "description": "Windsor InvitationalWINDSOR \u2014 While Loveland coaches shuffled through some injuries and illness to put together strong relays and produced second-place team finishes for the boys and girls at the meet, Marcus Quere was having none of it.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:27714814:view"}, "startDate": "2015-03-14T21:01:59-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/preps/ci_27714814/prep-track-roundup-lovelands-marcus-quere-has-record", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0314/20150314__15rhspreptrackw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Windsor InvitationalWINDSOR \u2014 While Loveland coaches shuffled through some injuries and illness to put together strong relays and produced second-place team finishes for the boys and girls at the meet, Marcus Quere was having none of it.", "title": "Prep Track Roundup: Loveland's Marcus Quere has record day"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Windsor InvitationalWINDSOR \u2014 While Loveland coaches shuffled through some injuries and illness to put together strong relays and produced second-place team finishes for the boys and girls at the meet, Marcus Quere was having none of it.", "title": "Prep Track Roundup: Loveland's Marcus Quere has record day", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/preps/ci_27714814/prep-track-roundup-lovelands-marcus-quere-has-record", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0314/20150314__15rhspreptrackw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-14T21:01:59-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Prep Track Roundup: Loveland's Marcus Quere has record day", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0314/20150314__15rhspreptrackw~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Preps", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "modificationDate": "2015-03-14T21:02:23-0600", "endDate": "2025-03-14T20:57:38-0600", "byline": "By Sports Staff", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2015-03-14T21:02:28-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland Colorado ReporterHerald sports preps high schools"}, "article_summary": "\"Marcus obviously had a really good meet, winning two tough races and setting meet records against some pretty decent competition.\nThe boys 800 relay team took second, while Treven Long was third twice, both in the 100 and 200 sprints.\nThe boys won comfortably with 131 points, while the girls were closer but still dominant at a mark of 95.\nSenior Ali Artzberger placed first in long jump (17-08) and the 800 relay team of Kelsi Schuetz, Maren Janda, Megan Irvine and Artzberger also won (1:45.59).\n\"It was a really good meet."}
