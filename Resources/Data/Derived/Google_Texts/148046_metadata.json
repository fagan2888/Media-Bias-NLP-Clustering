I talk about three of them a lot: The first is to eat differently, focusing on good food and especially plants; the second is to bring change to your work, whether that means becoming a farmer or helping other people eat better through your role as a teacher, doctor, artist, techie, lawyer or journalist. The third is to work locally to effect change in, for example, school systems or municipal politics.\n\nThe fourth is the toughest: Change the system that governs everything, including food. This means changing dominant economic theories and practices, and indeed the nature of capitalism itself. That isn\u2019t happening anytime soon.\n\nBut incremental changes are possible within that system. Some believe that food is a bipartisan issue, since it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interests to eat better and to protect the environment from the ravages of industrial agriculture. But it\u2019s also true that public health, income inequality, mitigating climate change and fighting racism (just a few examples) are bipartisan issues as well, and we know how slowly change comes with those, even though change is in the interest of all but a few defenders of the status quo.\n\nThe fact is, it\u2019s easy to predict where most members of our two major political parties will stand on almost any issue. And food, like most of these other examples, is deeply partisan. Since one party will fight social progress pretty much no matter what, people who care about good food have to make the other party \u2014 the one that claims to fight for progress \u2014 do so.\n\nThe Obama administration has been recent history\u2019s most vocal and progressive when it comes to food. But it has often been swimming against the tide because Democratic candidates are usually positioned as non-Republicans rather than as progressives with an innovative national campaign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSuch a campaign would propose to improve the lives of working people by raising the minimum wage, establishing better policies for sick leave and family leave, creating better jobs and working conditions, improving the safety net, and supporting the re-establishment of unions, and truly progressive taxation on the rich and on corporations. And so on; these are also \u201cfood issues.\u201d\n\nIgnoring these issues in the midterm elections gave Republicans what they wanted: a series of contests between not very different candidates, half of whom were in the party of a largely unpopular and arguably stymied president. The results were predictable. (That Obama\u2019s project has been blunted by an often spiteful Congress is true, but when people\u2019s standards of living fall the party in power suffers.)\n\nStill, many successful Democrats these days are genuine progressives, and good on food as well. In the Senate they include Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Richard Blumenthal (Connecticut), Jon Tester (Montana), Cory Booker (New Jersey) and Kirsten Gillibrand (New York); in the House, Chellie Pingree (Maine) (full disclosure: a friend), Tim Ryan (Ohio), Earl Blumenauer (Oregon), Rosa DeLauro (Connecticut), Louise Slaughter (New York) and others. Ryan, Pingree and Tester, who is a farmer, have undoubtedly been helped into office in part by their stands on food issues.\n\nFrom this perspective, perhaps the most interesting result in this election was the defeat of Steve Southerland, a two-term Florida Republican congressman who worked hard to cut food stamps and to require those who did get them to do mandatory work. (He also voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act over 40 times.) It\u2019s not so much that Southerland was defeated, but how: the two-year-old social welfare organization Food Policy Action (F.P.A.) threw its limited resources behind Gwen Graham, in what was a close race, believing that it could demonstrate the importance of food as an issue.\n\nI talked to Tom Colicchio, the well-known chef and F.P.A. board member, about this. \u201cWe targeted Southerland,\u201d he said, \u201cnot only because of his poor voting record on food but also because we knew that he was vulnerable.\u201d Colicchio believes that F.P.A.'s work \u201cmade a difference.\u201d\n\nWe are beginning to see the power of food as an issue.\n\nSeven months into office, Obama did mention a national soda tax, and later promised to \u201clet folks know\u201d whether their food was genetically modified. (We know how that worked out.) But as a candidate he certainly wasn\u2019t asked, in an open forum, where he stood on eliminating the nonmedicinal use of antibiotics in raising animals, sub-minimum wages in food service, restricting the marketing of junk food to children, and so on. Americans are increasingly aware of and concerned about these issues, and come 2016, it\u2019s the job of F.P.A. and of everyone who can be active in national elections to grill candidates about their views and hold them accountable for their words.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s our job to push for progressive stances. Because many of today\u2019s Democrats, in order to demonstrate that they\u2019re loyal Wall-Street-supported neo-liberals (but not Republicans!), often begin negotiating from a position of compromise. Cuts in SNAP (food stamps), for example, were all but inevitable in the Farm Bill, because Democrats were among the first to propose them.\n\nThat\u2019s got to stop. In food as in other issues, Democrats must put forth policies that are wholly different from \u2014 and better than \u2014 the Republicans\u2019. People often vote for candidates who represent change. And, historically, in the United States big-time change comes from social movements and from swings in voting blocs. We saw this in the 1930s around labor rights and the beginnings of the social safety net, and in the 1960s around civil rights and the safety net\u2019s expansion.\n\nFood policy has the potential to change the way people think and the way they vote; if we make our candidates take progressive positions on food, we\u2019ll be forging more progressive candidates. For people interested in good food, there\u2019s no better work to do.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20141125200426, "twitter": {"description": "We should make our candidates take progressive positions on food.
