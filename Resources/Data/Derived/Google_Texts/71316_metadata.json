Public debt outstanding has since dipped slightly but will probably exceed $18 trillion again in a matter of days.\n\nWhen President Obama took office Jan. 20, 2009, debt held by the public plus intragovernmental holdings totaled $10.63 trillion. During Obama\u2019s presidency, the national debt has increased by $7.38 trillion \u2014 an average of more than $3.4 billion every day.\n\nThe tower of debt depicted above contains 100,000 bundles of $10,000 stacked 10 wide, 80 deep and 125 high. It takes most American families more than two months to earn $10,000; the U.S. Census Bureau estimates median household income was $51,939 last year.\n\nAt more than $56,000 per man, woman and child, each American\u2019s share of the national debt is greater than the median household income. The federal government\u2019s debt is also greater than America\u2019s 2013 gross domestic product of $16.8 trillion.\n\nEven trying to visualize $1 trillion \u2014 100 million bundles of $10,000, or 10 billion $100 bills \u2014 is difficult. The $18 trillion national debt would fill 2,392 48-foot semi trailers jammed full of $100 bills.\n\nCovering a football field like the one where Obama gave his presidential nomination acceptance speech in 2008, the national debt in $100 bills would reach 124 feet into the air.\n\nThe federal government ran annual deficits exceeding $1 trillion every year of Obama\u2019s first term, with President George W. Bush presiding over several months of fiscal year 2009 before Democrats passed Obama\u2019s $800 billion \u201cstimulus\u201d package.\n\nNational debt increased by slightly less than $5 trillion through the entirety of Bush\u2019s two profligate terms. As of June, international investors and foreign governments held more than $6 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities according to the Treasury department.\n\nPublic debt reported by the Department of the Treasury does not include an estimated $49 trillion in unfunded Medicare and Social Security liabilities, and it does not include more than $4 trillion in unfunded state pension liabilities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America's national debt topped $18 trillion last Friday, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "America's national debt topped $18 trillion last Friday, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.", "title": "Here's what $18 trillion in national debt looks like - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/18trillion-debt-thumbnail.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-03T15:22:52+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/185494/18-trillion-debt/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "America's national debt topped $18 trillion last Friday, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.", "creator": "@jasonahart", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/18trillion-debt-thumbnail.jpg"}, "title": "Here's what $18 trillion in national debt looks like - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Budget and Spending", "published_time": "2014-12-04T04:00:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-03T15:22:52+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "18 trillion, Obama debt, Obama deficits, federal spending, deficit spending, U.S. national debt, America national debt, America debt"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf11a\"", "article_summary": "The $18 trillion national debt would fill 2,392 48-foot semi trailers jammed full of $100 bills.\nBy Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgAmerica\u2019s national debt topped $18 trillion Friday, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nPublic debt outstanding has since dipped slightly but will probably exceed $18 trillion again in a matter of days.\nDuring Obama\u2019s presidency, the national debt has increased by $7.38 trillion \u2014 an average of more than $3.4 billion every day.\nAt more than $56,000 per man, woman and child, each American\u2019s share of the national debt is greater than the median household income."}
