In many cases, the study used financial information not previously made public.\n\nJust one in five of the best buyouts examined were bought from other private equity firms. The remaining businesses were carved out from corporates, taken private, sourced from founding families or taken from other primary sources of deal flow.\n\nRhonda Ryan, a partner and head of Emea investments at Altius Associates, said she was concerned about the current level of secondary buyouts.\n\nShe said: \u201cI like to see where the value-add is coming from. I like to see that people are buying smartly and if they can demonstrate that with a secondary transaction, that\u2019s great. But I think it\u2019s harder to demonstrate than if it is a primary transaction.\n\n\u201cIf you take a corporate carve-out, for example, there\u2019s a lot more heavy lifting to do and therefore you would expect a better price coming out of it and you\u2019d expect a better return.\u201d\n\nAmong the most successful exits where new information was disclosed is the 2006 deal where Triton Partners, a private equity firm focused on Northern Europe, bought distressed logistics automation company Dematic from German conglomerate Siemens. The sale of the business to AEA Investors and Teachers\u2019 Private Capital in 2012 reaped a 36.5 times multiple and 73% internal rate of return, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nOthers include Danish firm Axcel\u2019s 2008 buyout of Pandora from its two founders. An initial public offering of the Danish jeweler just two years later and Axcel\u2019s gradual exit from the business has yielded a 40 times multiple and an internal rate of return of 290% so far, another person said.\n\nOliver Gottschalg, a professor at HEC Paris and founder of Peracs Analytics, said that while the average returns from secondary buyouts were lower, there were some benefits to secondary deals.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the flip side, the previous private equity owner has probably fixed [the company] up enough so you\u2019re not likely going to find yourself with something where you\u2019ve been completely misled and it falls into pieces \u2013 so you also don\u2019t get the extreme negative outcomes.\u201d\n\nRead the full list of the top performing European buyouts exited in the last 10 years here.\n\nWrite to alec.macfarlane@wsj.com; follow him on Twitter @alecmac11", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "An overwhelming majority of the most successful European exits in the past decade were from primary buyouts, fueling concern that the increasing wave of secondary deals will significantly reduce future returns.This is one of the findings of a study by Private Equity News into the best buyouts of the past 10 years, based on nominations from the industry and PEN\u2019s own research, and measured by cash multiples generated on exit.
