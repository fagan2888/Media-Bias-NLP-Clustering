SendGrid’s rapidly growing e-mail delivery service has the Boulder company heading West in search of more tech talent.

The company said Friday it will open an office in Redwood City — its first in Silicon Valley — to accommodate up to 40 employees.

“A Redwood City office will provide us with access to an additional talent pool of software engineers who have worked on scaling (software as a service) businesses and those who have worked in the e-mail space before,” said David Friedman, a SendGrid spokesman.

The expansion coincides with SendGrid hiring Craig Kaes as vice president of engineering. Kaes, who previously was in the mobility group of Cisco, will oversee SendGrid’s 100-person engineering and development team.

The new office, which is a 6,000-square-foot space, is expected to open in the first week of April. About five to 10 Colorado employees will relocate to California.

SendGrid employs 260 people, mostly in Boulder and Denver. It also has offices in Orange, Calif., and London.
