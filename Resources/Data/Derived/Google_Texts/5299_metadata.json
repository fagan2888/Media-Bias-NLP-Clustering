Every year, millions of dollars are spent on breast enhancements, from push-up bras to plastic surgery, to showcase this form of the female body. But the cultural fascination with boobs, specifically for men, is deeply tied to our species' survival instinct.\n\nBreasts have not only evolved as a means of feeding but as a measure of mate selection for men. A woman\u2019s breast size can reveal a plethora of information regarding her age and fertility. This is why men unconsciously are on the prowl for a woman with the right chest-to-waist-to-hip ratio.\n\nLarry Young and Brian Alexander, authors of the book The Chemistry Between Us: Love, Sex, and the Science of Attraction, have dissected the emotional, biological, and cultural reasons behind why men love breasts. They affirm a woman\u2019s chest is an area that naturally revs up a man\u2019s sexual drive.\n\n\"Men are the only male mammals fascinated by breasts in a sexual context,\" Young wrote. \"And women are the only female mammals whose breasts become enlarged at puberty, independent of pregnancy. We are also the only species in which males caress, massage, and even orally stimulate the female breasts during foreplay and sex.\"\n\nWhen a man touches, massages, or nibbles a woman\u2019s breasts, it sparks the same process of brain events as nursing. A baby\u2019s stimulation of its mother\u2019s breasts triggers the release of oxytocin from the hypothalamus, which promotes mother-infant bonding. This explains why human sexuality has \u201cexploited\u201d the mother-infant bonding brain circuitry to establish bonds between lovers.\n\nMen\u2019s obsession with breasts is not only biological, however. It can also reveal their personality traits.\n\n1. Hungry men prefer big breasts.\n\nLarge breasts are subconsciously seen as \u201cfood security\u201d for men because they act as a signal for fat reserves, which translates to access to an abundance of resources. Since ethnicity is known to influence breast size preferences, a group of British researchers sought to examine the effect hunger and satiety had on white British men\u2019s breast size preference, to eliminate any factors that may affect the outcome. The two-part 2008 study published in The Journal of Socio-Economics found hungry men preferred larger breasts compared to satiated men. It seems resource security significantly impacts a man\u2019s preference in breast size.\n\n2. Sexist men prefer big breasts.\n\nA man\u2019s attitude toward women and their role in society may influence his preference in their bust size. In a 2013 study published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, over 300 white men ages 18 to 68 were shown 3D models of women with a range of breast sizes. The participants were asked to identify which women they found most attractive, followed by completing a survey measuring hostility and attitudes toward women, relationships, benevolent sexism, and how much a man objectified a woman.\n\nThe study found men who have sexist views toward women are more likely to find big breasts attractive. These men admitted to displaying behavioral traits of sexism and hostile attitudes toward women. Moreover, men perceived women with large and very large breasts with \u201ctraditional\u201d femininity and as \u201cmeek and weak.\u201d\n\n3. Men who want a submissive partner prefer small breasts.\n\nA man\u2019s preference for small breasts may indicate his desire for a submissive partner. Psychologist Stuart Fischoff believes these men want a more submissive, non-threatening partner who\u2019s more likely to be loyal.\n\n\u201cAlso, you may get the psychological hint that she\u2019s not trying to compete with other women who have larger breasts, and therefore she\u2019ll be loyal to you. Or maybe the very first girl you had a crush on had small breasts, and if she constructed your earliest example of what\u2019s sexy, her memory may still lead you to find small-breasted women exciting,\u201d he told Men\u2019s Health.\n\n4. Men who are independent and non-nurturant prefer large breasts.\n\nA male who prefers a top heavy set woman may be more likely to have a need for heterosexual contact and for exhibitionism, according to a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. In other words, he\u2019ll say witty things and be the center of attention. Also, a large breast preference was associated with a \u201cPlayboy\u201d image.\n\n5. Men financially stable prefer small breasts.\n\nThe amount of money he earns could dictate the size of breasts he prefers. A 2008 study published in The Journal of Socio-Economics found a link between financial security and men\u2019s breast size preference. The study found financially unstable men or those going through \u201cresource security\u201d have a preference for larger breasts while their financially well off counterparts had a tendency to like smaller breasts. This suggests wealthy men who have plenty of resources don\u2019t need a woman with excessive fat reserves, unlike their unwealthy counterparts who seek abundance.\n\n6. Men ready for fatherhood prefer large breasts.\n\nA man ready to procreate may favor large breasts over small breasts from a reproduction standpoint. According to a 2012 study published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, the desire to remain childless was associated with a preference for a combination of smaller breasts and larger waist-to-hip ratio. Men who wished to become a dad chose women with larger breasts. This is not surprising, since larger breasts are a signal of a woman\u2019s capacity and ability to bear and nurture children.\n\nAlthough a man\u2019s size preference does reveal more about his personality and attitude, though, in the end, he'll always love breasts \u2014 no matter the size.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "large breasts, small breasts, big boobs, small boobs, breast size, bra size, plastic surgery, breast enhancement, push-up bra, preference, attitudes, men, women, dating, relationships, personality traits, treasure chest", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A man\u2019s influence in breast size preference ranges from his appetite to his interest in fatherhood.", "title": "Why Men (Really) Care About Your Breast Size", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/treasure-chest-what-mans-breast-size-preference-says-about-his-personality-traits-319504", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/26/man-unhooking-womans-bra-bed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A man\u2019s influence in breast size preference ranges from his appetite to his interest in fatherhood.", "title": "Why Men (Really) Care About Your Breast Size", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/treasure-chest-what-mans-breast-size-preference-says-about-his-personality-traits-319504", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/26/man-unhooking-womans-bra-bed.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/26/man-unhooking-womans-bra-bed.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-01-27T07:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-28T09:11:12-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A man\u2019s influence in breast size preference ranges from his appetite to his interest in fatherhood."}, "article_summary": "Since ethnicity is known to influence breast size preferences, a group of British researchers sought to examine the effect hunger and satiety had on white British men\u2019s breast size preference, to eliminate any factors that may affect the outcome.\nAlthough a man\u2019s size preference does reveal more about his personality and attitude, though, in the end, he'll always love breasts \u2014 no matter the size.\nA 2008 study published in The Journal of Socio-Economics found a link between financial security and men\u2019s breast size preference.\nIt seems resource security significantly impacts a man\u2019s preference in breast size.\nA woman\u2019s breast size can reveal a plethora of information regarding her age and fertility."}
