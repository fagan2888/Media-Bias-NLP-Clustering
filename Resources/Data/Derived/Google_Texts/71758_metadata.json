Politicians and their aides have a point they want to make. and they use language to make it and win the argument at hand. This has been true since the time of the ancient Greeks. The unwritten rules of the game are that two sides offer up their solutions to solve a problem and the stronger argument of the two gets adopted.\n\nActually, those used to be the rules; they aren\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s hard to pin down when exactly they were changed, but Democrats often find themselves playing by these old rules.\n\nIn the theater of public policy, many Republicans have adopted a strategy of not admitting a problem exists. What they do is create doubt about the veracity or severity of a problem thereby delaying any serious debate about it. A new film called Merchants of Doubt, directed by Academy Award nominee Robert Kenner, explains how and why they do it.\n\n[moko_youtube src=\u201dj8ii9zGFDtc\u201d]\n\nOn climate change, vaccinations, Obamacare, and other critical issues, casting a mere sliver of doubt has worked. The spin doctors find one shred of uncertainty in a piece of science\u2013which is all about uncertainty\u2013and use it to cast doubt about an entire theory. It\u2019s like taking a car to the junk yard because it has a flat tire.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just science that has been affected by the strategy of creating doubt\u2013we\u2019ve seen it in the myths of income inequality, \u201ctrickle-down economics,\u201d education policy, gun control, immigration, and social programs. The list goes on.\n\nWho knows if the \u201cmerchants of doubt\u201d even believe what they say? It doesn\u2019t matter. They don\u2019t have to lie, they just have to obfuscate. If the spin doctors were just talking among themselves, they\u2019d be harmless. But they often appear on Fox News (and media that should know better) and weave their narrative and then, before you know it, you have a large segment of the population who don\u2019t believe in scientific facts and elect like-minded people to positions of great importance.\n\nIt\u2019s important to be skeptical, but it becomes something pernicious when skepticism exists for its own sake.\n\nTo find out when Merchants of Doubt plays at a theater near you, click here.\n\nH/T: Sony Classics Merchants of Doubt", "article_metadata": {"description": "What Republicans are now doing is creating doubts about the veracity or severity of a problem thereby delaying any serious debate about it.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "What Republicans are now doing is creating doubts about the veracity or severity of a problem thereby delaying any serious debate about it.", "title": "New Movie Shows How Spin Doctors Manipulate Debate Over Science", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Propaganda.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-21T14:21:21-04:00", "url": "https://bluenationreview.com/new-movie-shows-how-spin-doctors-manipulate-debate-over-science/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "What Republicans are now doing is creating doubts about the veracity or severity of a problem thereby delaying any serious debate about it.", "title": "New Movie Shows How Spin Doctors Manipulate Debate Over Science", "image": {"src": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Propaganda.jpg"}, "creator": "@ShawnDrurySC", "site": "@bluenationrev", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Blue Nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bluenationreview", "section": "Uncategorized", "tag": "anti-vaxxer,big tobacco,climate change,climate denier,Koch Brothers,Merchants of Doubt,Robert Kenner,Shawn Drury", "published_time": "2015-05-05T11:22:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-21T14:21:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In the theater of public policy, many Republicans have adopted a strategy of not admitting a problem exists.\nIf you follow politics, you know that much of what comes out of a political hack\u2019s mouth is spin.\nWhat they do is create doubt about the veracity or severity of a problem thereby delaying any serious debate about it.\nA new film called Merchants of Doubt, directed by Academy Award nominee Robert Kenner, explains how and why they do it.\nTo find out when Merchants of Doubt plays at a theater near you, click here."}
