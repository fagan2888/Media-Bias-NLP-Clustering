He notes that programs like NBC\u2019s Today have honed in on dads by rebranding long-running segments like Today Moms into Today Parents (with an extra nod to Modern Dads). And online, Gresko says, \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a growing trajectory of men writing honestly and openly about parenting\u201d as a counterbalance to the well-established mommy-blogosphere. Still, Gresko notes that while \u201cthere are also the so-called momoirs,\u201d that genre doesn\u2019t quite exist yet for dads. His new anthology, When I First Held You, compiles 22 essays on fatherhood from a host of distinguished contemporary attempts to showcase the wide range of experiences that men have as they grapple with being called \u201cDad.\u201d I spoke with Gresko about the changing nature of fatherhood and visibility inside and outside of the home. When did you become a stay-at-home dad and why was that the best decision for your family at the time?\n\nMy decision to be a writer and to be a dad all came kind of at the same time for me, or out of the same catalyst. At the time, my then-girlfriend was nearing 30 and wanted to have a family. That was a stumbling block in our relationship, and I took a year to get some space, and teach, and write in China. While I was there, I not only fell into a more regular practice of writing, but I also decided that I did, indeed, want to get married and start a family. When I came back home, I enrolled in an MFA program at The New School, my wife and I got married, and she became pregnant. My son was born a week after I got out of school, so my wife wanted to go back to work. I had taken myself out of a career path at that point already, and it appealed to me to stay at home and have time to write in the evenings and while my son napped. But it also really appealed to me emotionally because even though I had not wanted to be a father for most of my life, I had decided to embrace it as fully as I could. What was the environment like for stay-at-home dads at the time? This was in Brooklyn in 2009, so it wasn\u2019t foreign, but even today it\u2019s much more normal to see guys walking around with their babies strapped to them or with strollers. A few guys would give me looks like, You\u2019re walking around with a baby? What\u2019s up with that?\u2014but it was mostly women. I would get unsolicited advice, as if I didn\u2019t know what I was doing and nannies looking for work would kind of assume that I would rather be working, and that I must be looking for someone to take care of my child. To take yourself out of the workforce was seen as very strange. I was met with, \u201cWell, this must be a nice little vacation for you,\u201d or \u201cYou must be taking a sabbatical to try and reboot yourself. I wish I could do that,\u201d instead of recognizing what I was doing as another kind of work. So, those first couple of years when I was at home with my son were very lonely. How did you feel about fatherhood when you became a dad, especially since as you say, you didn\u2019t actually want to be one for most of your life?\n\nWhen I was a child, my parents revealed to me that the guy I grew up thinking was my biological father was actually my adopted father. It was a really tense conversation and an uncomfortable thing for them to talk about, so we never discussed it again after that. During the process of my dad legally adopting me, my parents had been asked, \u201cHow would you address this with the child?\u201d They were advised to talk about it with me at an early age, but not bring it up again unless I wanted to, and that\u2019s what they did. Partly because of my natural temperament, which was to avoid making waves, and partly because I felt that my parents were still upset about it, I felt somewhat shameful and kind of guilty that I had caused this upset for them, so I kind of swallowed it. But I always felt very different. When I was a teenager, I was more academic and a natural reader, and my parents are a little more sporty and great at fixing things around the house\u2014things that I just didn\u2019t have an inclination for. I started thinking that maybe I was different because my biological father had given me something other than what I was getting at home, and being such a reader, I started to imagine that he was someone like Henry Miller. I really fell in love with Henry Miller and it made sense to me that if [my father] was this really bright, creative guy, then he couldn\u2019t be tied down to a kid since he was pursuing his own artistic path. All of that synched into this identity for me, where I was going to be a writer and an artist, but I would not be a family person\u2014and that felt right because of what I was interested in, and also because of the pain that I had around the idea of fatherhood and around the idea of family. So what led you to making this book? I wanted to hear from guys that are really amazing artists and writers, that you could be a great writer and also be a loving, engaged, active father. That, from the start, is something that has surprised me about fatherhood. I had always completely accepted the idea that a writer or artist had to choose between their work and having a family, but that is not the case. You want to be the best dad you possibly can, but it's impossible to always have as much patience as kids require. In fact, the experience of having a kid opens you up emotionally in a way that [causes] you to see the world totally differently. You feel things more deeply; you feel love in a different way. You might have only experienced romantic love and now you\u2019re experiencing this really warm sense of protection for another human being. You feel vulnerable; you want to protect them but you know you can\u2019t. You want to be the best dad you possibly can, but it\u2019s impossible to always have as much patience as kids require, or to be your best self all the time. Those feelings can really feed your creative work, and that\u2019s something I never anticipated. That\u2019s interesting, especially given the idea that corporate careers are the ones that limit family time, while \u201ccreative\u201d ones are seen as more flexible or accommodating\u2014even though writing can be a very solitary thing.\n\nI think of the old Modernist image of the male writer as being unattached and kind of hardheaded; someone hard-drinking with big opinions. Norman Mailer comes to mind, or Kerouac, or Henry Miller, or even Hemingway, who has this macho air about him. He had kids and writes about them a little bit, but mostly writes about going out to bullfights, and on fishing trips, and drinking at bars. That stereotype still looms large. Writing is a very solitary act and it requires that you have time to think into your imagination and be alone, but it\u2019s also a communicative art. You\u2019re writing about people and that requires not just knowing yourself but [also] paying attention to what goes around you. Most people on this planet become parents at some point, so these are really universal relationships. The men in this book have written books that are just as hard and heavy-hitting as any of the books Modernist authors would have put out\u2014but they\u2019re also really engaged with their families and they don\u2019t hide that. How does the title of the book relate to the idea of fatherhood? For many women who give birth, experiencing the physical changes that accompany pregnancy might help them feel a connection to their children sooner, whereas men might continue to grapple with the reality of being a parent until there\u2019s actually a baby in front of them. Women experience those changes in many different ways. I know friends who have said that they loved being pregnant, and there are other people like my wife who just did not enjoy it. But men are completely outside of that. The experience of their partner\u2019s pregnancy is very abstract. We don\u2019t really ever have the experience of our bodies being out of control unless we\u2019re sick\u2014and when that happens, it\u2019s weird. With pregnancy, you\u2019re taking care of this creature that\u2019s growing inside of you, and it\u2019s changing you and making you feel all sorts of things. A guy can hear about that and know the baby is coming, but it\u2019s not a physical reality in the same way that it is for a woman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dads reflect on the unexpected moments that defined them as parents.", "author": "Judith Ohikuare", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Dads reflect on the unexpected moments that defined them as parents.", "title": "What Makes A Great Dad", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/06/dadly/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/how-men-become-fathers/372678/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "And online, Gresko says, \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a growing trajectory of men writing honestly and openly about parenting\u201d as a counterbalance to the well-established mommy-blogosphere.\nWhen did you become a stay-at-home dad and why was that the best decision for your family at the time?\nMy son was born a week after I got out of school, so my wife wanted to go back to work.\nAs writer and stay-at-home dad Brian Gresko sees it, narratives about fatherhood are slowly but surely becoming more present in overall conversations about parenthood.\nStill, Gresko notes that while \u201cthere are also the so-called momoirs,\u201d that genre doesn\u2019t quite exist yet for dads."}
