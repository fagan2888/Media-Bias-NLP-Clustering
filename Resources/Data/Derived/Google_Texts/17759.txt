It's that time of year again, when New Yearâ€™s weight-loss resolutions become that much harder to stick to.

The Girl Scouts of the Florida panhandle gathered today for the arrival of the famous Girl Scout cookies.

Early this morning, the group met at advantage North American on Frankford Avenue to welcome 8,000 boxes of cookies today.

The cookies which include Thin Mints, Tagalongs, and Thank You Berry Bunches, will be delivered throughout Bay County as well as to places like Vernon and Franklin County.

Once the troop leader receives the boxes they will hand them out to the Girl Scouts who will then begin delivering them to everyone who has ordered cookies.

Girl Scout, Elizabeth Harrison said, "The cookies sales is very important. It teaches the girls their life skills, money management, skill building, goal setting, business ethics and people skills."

All proceeds that are made from the cookie sale will be going to the Girl Scouts program.
