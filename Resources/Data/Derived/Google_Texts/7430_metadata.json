We\u2019ve done that there and I don\u2019t want to (fool) with any kind of tradition. He led the team and I texted him last night, \u2018I appreciate how you did that and helped me out.'\u201d\n\nCSU players sing the fight song and the alma mater on the field, accompanied by the band, and then the fight song again a capella after wins in the dressing room.\n\nSaid Carlson: \u201cCSU\u2019s been singing that in the locker room after victories for as long as I can remember, so I wanted to make sure we kept that going. His mind\u2019s going a bunch of different ways after a game anyway, so I was like, \u2018Hey, we have to sing the fight song.\u2019 So I just started off, \u2018One, two, one, two, three four\u2026\u2019 and off we go. . . Coach looked like he was at least trying to mouth the words back there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought it was awesome,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve seen these other universities that sing the fight song with the band and get everybody involved in the pride of the university. We didn\u2019t do that at Georgia. I\u2019ve always wanted to do that. I enjoyed it. I got a few of the words down, but I have to do better. I definitely don\u2019t know the alma mater, but I\u2019ve got the swaying back and forth down.\u201d\n\nCarlson, from nearby Wellington and Fort Collins\u2019 Poudre High, is starting at right tackle and will be a game captain for the second straight week Saturday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing as well as anybody we\u2019ve ever had at the offensive line position,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cEvery day, he takes it serious, he\u2019s trying to get better. He\u2019s tough, he\u2019s athletic, he can bend, and he cares about Colorado State. He loves putting on the uniform, and he takes pride in it. When one of your better players who\u2019s a senior and is from this state, becomes one of your leaders, I think that\u2019s always a good thing for your football team.\n\n\u201cHe was not an outspoken guy when we got here. When I had my exit meetings with all the players, every player to a man, when I asked who the leaders are on the football team, said Sam Carlson. . . He is stepping up in that leadership role, making him a little bit uncomfortable, but he has accepted the challenge.\u201d\n\nSaid Carlson: \u201cIt\u2019s something as a senior I need to do, lead this team. The faith that they\u2019re placing on me isn\u2019t anything I can\u2019t handle. . . Historically, I\u2019ve always been kind of a lead-by-example type of guy, so for me to step out of my comfort zone and lead this team vocally and stuff like that is something I definitely need to be able to do. It\u2019s a good thing and I need to get better at it.\u201d\n\nCarlson noted that Saturday\u2019s game against Minnesota \u201cis kind of going to let us know where we are.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado State,Mike Bobo,Sam Carlson", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Field House", "description": "CSU coach Mike Bobo gets help from Stalwart Ram RT Sam Carlson", "title": "Mike Bobo gets help from Stalwart Ram RT Sam Carlson", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2015/09/07/csu-coach-mike-bobo-gets-some-help-from-stalwart-ram-rt-sam-carlson/33810/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2015/09/Sam.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "CSU coach Mike Bobo gets help from Stalwart Ram RT Sam Carlson", "title": "CSU coach Mike Bobo gets some help from Stalwart Ram RT Sam Carlson", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2015/09/07/csu-coach-mike-bobo-gets-some-help-from-stalwart-ram-rt-sam-carlson/33810/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2015/09/Sam.jpg", "creator": "@TFrei", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Colorado State coach Mike Bobo gets help from Stalwart Ram RT Sam Carlson"}, "article_summary": "'\u201dCSU players sing the fight song and the alma mater on the field, accompanied by the band, and then the fight song again a capella after wins in the dressing room.\n\u201cAfter I got finished talking, (Carlson) got everybody together to sing the fight song, and I didn\u2019t know we did that in the locker room,\u201d Bobo said.\n\u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve seen these other universities that sing the fight song with the band and get everybody involved in the pride of the university.\nCoach looked like he was at least trying to mouth the words back there.\u201d\u201cI thought it was awesome,\u201d Bobo said.\nHe led the team and I texted him last night, \u2018I appreciate how you did that and helped me out."}
