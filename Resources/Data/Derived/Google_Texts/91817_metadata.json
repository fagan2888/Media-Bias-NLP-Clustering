Once that is done, the agency will conduct a second partial validation audit of the data.\n\nAAA's analysis of ACA's risk adjustment program noted for the 2014 plan year, plans expected to receive risk corridor payments only received 12.6% of those payments, which CMS last November stated it eventually wants to make good on its promise to insurers.\n\nBut some payers were counting on those payments to make ends meet while taking on consumers with higher risks. Failure to receive those expected payments led to some of the ACA-created health co-ops plans to shutter their doors or be forced out of the system. Of the 23 nonprofits co-ops, only 11 remain.\n\nThe co-ops' failure has resulted in a $1.2 billion debt in federal loans and it is unlikely most of it will be recouped, according to a report released last month by a Senate investigations panel.\n\nSo, yes, some insurers experience with the risk adjustment program varied.\n\n\u201cSome of these differences may be due to underlying differences in premiums (e.g., due to different provider discounts), operational issues (e.g., technical issues with loading data), and difference in coding practices, many of which may decline over time,\u201d AAA's analysis stated. Research could help to sort out whether variations in financial outcomes stem from risk adjustment, premium levels, or administrative expenses.\n\nAs plans gain experience with the program and its operational and technical processes, some of the uncertainty may lessen, according to the report, which stresses the importance of monitoring risk-adjustment experience over time.\n\nThe analysis also found insurers\u2019 premiums need to reflect the level of risk in the entire market pool, not just their beneficiaries. This was especially difficult in 2014 when there was a lot of uncertainty about enrollee risk profiles, the report says.\n\nThe report suggested ways CMS could further the program\u2019s goals. Recommendations included incorporating pharmacy data in risk-adjustments, a change the agency is already weighing; updating the model coefficients and metal tier induced demand factors; adjusting for high-cost outliers; adjusting for partial-year enrollees; and basing risk-adjustment transfers on the part of the state average premium that relates to claims.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nKeyC News 12: Actuaries Release Analysis of ACA Permanent Risk Adjustment Program\u2019s First Year\n\nAmerican Academy of Actuaries: Insights on the ACA Risk Adjustment Program\n\nHealthcare Dive: Drug data in ACA risk pools: A wonky topic insurers, pharma & gov can agree on\n\nHealthcare Dive: The profitable Maryland ACA co-op lays out 3 strategies for profitability in 2016", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/15/76/15768e2874cc1098a14026651b011f4f.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-health-law,healthcare-policy-reg", "news_keywords": "Payer,Health Law,Policy & Regulation,Policy & Reg", "category": "News Post", "title": "Insurers' experience all over the map during first ACA risk adjustment year", "pub_date": "apr 13, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-13T22:09:46", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Wednesday, April 13, 2016, 10:09 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-04-01T22:09:46", "teaser": "<p>An analysis by the American Academy of Actuaries&nbsp;states&nbsp;premiums need to reflect the level of risk in an&nbsp;entire market pool, not just insurers&#39;&nbsp;beneficiaries.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-04-13", "sailthru.description": "An analysis by the American Academy of Actuaries\u00a0states\u00a0premiums need to reflect the level of risk in an\u00a0entire market pool, not just insurers'\u00a0beneficiaries.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "An analysis by the American Academy of Actuaries\u00a0states\u00a0premiums need to reflect the level of risk in an\u00a0entire market pool, not just insurers'\u00a0beneficiaries.", "title": "Insurers' experience all over the map during first ACA risk adjustment year", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/insurers-experience-all-over-the-map-during-first-aca-risk-adjustment-year/417310/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/8655954187_9e22b170f1_b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/53/e4/53e4261e6411c982ea226dd909cb0fe3.jpg"}, "article_summary": "So, yes, some insurers experience with the risk adjustment program varied.\nRecommended ReadingKeyC News 12: Actuaries Release Analysis of ACA Permanent Risk Adjustment Program\u2019s First YearAmerican Academy of Actuaries: Insights on the ACA Risk Adjustment ProgramHealthcare Dive: Drug data in ACA risk pools: A wonky topic insurers, pharma & gov can agree onHealthcare Dive: The profitable Maryland ACA co-op lays out 3 strategies for profitability in 2016\nResearch could help to sort out whether variations in financial outcomes stem from risk adjustment, premium levels, or administrative expenses.\nDive Brief:In its first-year, experience among individual insurers in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s risk-adjustment program varied considerably, an analysis by the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) found.\nTo keep scores in check, CMS now requires insurers get an initial validation audit of their risk score data."}
