Started in 2007, the California-based firm helps underwater homeowners \u2014 those whose houses are worth less than what they owe on their mortgage \u2014 decide whether they should stop paying on their loans. If borrowers choose to default, the company\u2019s advisors then walk them through the foreclosure process.\n\nCo-founder Jon Maddux says that when the firm launched in 2007, real estate professionals told him it might last two or three years. But the steady stream of clients kept coming, and Maddux says he\u2019s shocked the company is still in business.\n\nNow, some of Maddux\u2019s clients could be the target of renewed efforts by government-backed mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pursue money the borrowers owed on their foreclosed homes. The focus follows two inspector general\u2019s reports last September that chastised both firms for failing to go after people who could have paid on their mortgages but chose to walk away. Doing so could recoup more of the $187.5 billion in taxpayer bailouts that Fannie and Freddie have gotten since 2008, the reports said.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that nearly all of that money \u2014 $185 billion \u2014 has already been paid back. With the rebound in the housing market, the two government-run providers of housing finance have returned to profitability. They sent $39 billion in dividends to the Treasury last month, meaning that taxpayers could soon start profiting from the investments that saved the mortgage giants from insolvency.\n\nIn most states, after Fannie and Freddie foreclose on a home and then sell it, they can pursue the former owner for the difference between the sale price and what the borrower owed on the loan. But the inspector general concluded that the companies failed to do so in more than 100,000 cases that together represented at least $6 billion. The FHFA is developing plans by the end of this month to ensure that the Fannie and Freddie do a better job of pursuing those who defaulted but could have kept paying.\n\nThe inspector general noted that going after those borrowers for the deficits could help deter future strategic defaulters. Barry Habib, CEO of mortgage market intelligence company MBS Highway, says that defaulting, once considered \u201cshameful,\u201d is now widely acceptable.\n\nAn October 2012 national survey commissioned by consumer risk management firm ID Analytics found that a third of those polled said homeowners should be able to strategically default on their mortgages without facing any consequences. Thirteen percent said they\u2019d likely strategically default on a mortgage, and 17 percent said they know someone who has. Strategic defaulting has led to higher interest rates for other borrowers, says Edward Pinto, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former executive vice president at Fannie Mae.\n\nEven if the inspectors think Fannie and Freddie should go after more strategic defaulters, actually doing so may be another story. One reason is state law: 12 states bar lenders from suing foreclosed owners for the deficits, and 10 others have very short statutes of limitations for doing so \u2014 between 30 to 180 days, depending on the state.\n\nRelated: 7 Reasons Rentals Are Rocking the Housing Market\n\nAnother problem is figuring out who had the ability to pay and who didn\u2019t. \u201cIf you have to install a new computer system or spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to do this, it might not be worth it,\u201d says Robert Pozen, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\nFannie and Freddie told the inspector general that they are capable of determining who could have paid, but an FHFA response to a previous inspector general\u2019s report admitted that assessing borrowers\u2019 finances isn\u2019t easy or cheap. An FHFA spokeswoman declined to answer a question about how Fannie and Freddie assess whether borrowers can pay, directing inquiries to the inspector general\u2019s office, which didn\u2019t respond to a request for details.\n\nThe case of 41-year-old Dave Astle shows how hard it may be to suss out those who could have paid. In 2005, Astle and his wife bought a 3,100-square-foot house in Temecula, California for $500,000 with no money down. By 2009, they were getting a divorce and needed to sell the home, since they couldn\u2019t continue to live together. By then value of the house had dropped to $300,000, so they\u2019d be on the hook for $200,000 \u2014 enough to wipe out their savings \u2014 if they sold.\n\nThe couple stopped paying their mortgage, and the bank foreclosed the following year. Actually proving they had the means to pay would require collecting reams of financial documents going back five years and then making a determination--possibly in consultation with a judge--about whether their decision was reasonable.\n\nEven if Fannie and Freddie can identify voluntary defaulters, the inspector\u2019s reports admit that actually collecting can take months or years. \u201cTrying to get a billion dollars out of a bank is one thing. Trying to get $20,000 out of 50,000 homeowners is an entirely different story,\u201d says Pinto. \u201cYou have to go down a torturous road to do it.\u201d\n\nReal Estate Red Alert: Where Have All the Houses Gone\n\nMaybe most important, Pinto doesn\u2019t think pursuing defaulters will be a priority for new FHFA director Mel Watt, the former Democratic Representative from North Carolina who started on Jan. 7. Pinto believes Watt will be focused on expanding Fannie and Freddie\u2019s footprint in the housing market, increasing access to loans through policies like enforcing affordable housing mandates, and even offering principal reductions to borrowers who are upside down on their loans, which previous director Edward DeMarco declined to do. FHFA\u2019s press office said that it couldn\u2019t comment on Watt\u2019s priorities at this early stage.\n\nIn any case, the changing market already has cut into the pool of strategic defaulters. No one keeps statistics on their number, but Habib thinks it\u2019s quickly falling as home values rise and improve homeowners\u2019 equity. Already the proportion of those who are upside down on their mortgages has shrunk from a third to under 15 percent, he says. A likely factor in the reduction is the FHFA\u2019s Home Affordable Finance Program, which lets many underwater and near-underwater homeowners refinance, minimizing their motivation to default.\n\nJon Maddux offers the best clue about where trends are headed. YouWalkAway\u2019s business has shrunken dramatically, with virtually no new clients coming in the door seeking help with strategic defaults. So he\u2019s resigned to launch a new venture called AfterForeclosure.com. It will help \u201cboomerang buyers\u201d\u2014people who have been through foreclosure who want to try home ownership again.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Two inspector general\u2019s reports last September chastised Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for failing to go after people who could have paid on their mortgages but chose to walk away.
