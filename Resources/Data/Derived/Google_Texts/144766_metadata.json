He said Hungary considered the measure to be in line with relevant international laws.\n\nThe changes also involve stronger penalties for the illegal crossing of borders and for damaging the fence being built at the Serbian border and would enable Hungary to expel migrants violating the new rules.\n\n\"We believe these tools can be adequate for us to handle on a national level the extraordinary difficulties brought on by migration over the past months,\" Gulyas said.\n\nData from the Immigration Office showed on Friday that in August so far 38,912 people have requested asylum in Hungary, up from 16,578 in June. Police have caught more than 140,000 migrants on the border with Serbia this year.\n\n(Reporting by Gergely Szakacs; Editing by Louise Ireland)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Ruling Fidesz party lawmaker Gergely Gulyas told a news conference that the changes wo", "title": "Hungary to tighten migrant laws, set up holding camps at border", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/28/Hungary-tighten-migrant-laws-set-holding-camps-border", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-hungary_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/28/Hungary-tighten-migrant-laws-set-holding-camps-border", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-hungary_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Ruling Fidesz party lawmaker Gergely Gulyas told a news conference that the changes wo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Transit zones near the Serbian border would hold migrants while their asylum requests are processed and that could take several days, he said.\nPolice have caught more than 140,000 migrants on the border with Serbia this year.\n\"These zones will be open toward Serbia, but entry into Hungary will not be allowed until these procedures are finished,\" Gulyas said.\nHe said Hungary considered the measure to be in line with relevant international laws.\nThe changes also involve stronger penalties for the illegal crossing of borders and for damaging the fence being built at the Serbian border and would enable Hungary to expel migrants violating the new rules."}
