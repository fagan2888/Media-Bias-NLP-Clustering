And Mourinho was quick to remind Arsenal fans after the game that their team hasn\u2019t won the title since 2004. Chelsea has won the league three times since then, with the 2005 and 2006 titles coming in Mourinho\u2019s first reign.\n\n\u201cYou support a club and you are waiting, waiting, waiting and for so many years without a Premier League title,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI think that is very boring,\u201d\n\nManchester United counterpart Louis van Gaal had nothing to brag about on Sunday after a 3-0 defeat Everton. The heaviest in the league of Van Gaal\u2019s first season in charge left United fourth, but still on course for Champions League qualification.\n\nChelsea is 12 points in front of United and can seal the title with victories over Leicester on Wednesday and then Crystal Palace next Sunday.\n\nInjuries to strikers Didier Drogba and Loic Remy forced Mourinho to start without a recognized striker at the Emirates, with Oscar often the most advanced player in the first half.\n\nThe midfielder, though, made way for striker Didier Drogba at halftime as a precaution following a clash after 15 minutes.\n\nAfter the Brazilian lobbed David Ospina, the Arsenal goalkeeper clattered into him. Chelsea\u2019s doctor came onto the field to attend to Oscar but the playmaker returned to action and was only substituted at halftime.\n\nMourinho said Oscar went to a hospital because \u201cwe were a bit scared.\u201d But when asked if the player suffered concussion in the collision, Mourinho replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nArsenal couldn\u2019t exploit Chelsea\u2019s injury problems, only managing one shot on target when Mesut Ozil\u2019s effort was collected by Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.\n\nIt left Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger without a victory in 13 attempts against Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea.\n\n\u201cIn the first half we had the right intensity,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe dropped that in the second half and came back into the right level for the last 20 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe could have finished the game off\u2026 But they came to defend well, and they did that well, and everybody knows that.\u201d\n\nAt Goodison Park, Van Gaal accused his United players of lacking motivation after they slumped to a second successive loss following last weekend\u2019s setback at Chelsea.\n\nJames McCarthy netted the opener after five minutes between goalkeeper David de Gea\u2019s legs after skipping through weak challenges by Paddy McNair and Daley Blind. John Stones doubled the lead in the 35th minute by heading in Leighton Baines\u2019 corner before Kevin Mirallas rounded off the victory in the 74th.\n\n\u0081\u201dThis is the first match that the other team have shown more fighting spirit than us,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u0081\u201dOur motivation, inspiration and aggression was not as high as the opponent. \u201cI had already the feeling and my colleagues (assistants) Ryan Giggs and Albert Stuivenberg had the feeling because the warm up was not so good as usual.\n\n\u0081\u201dIn the last minutes before the game you hope you can recover and stimulate your players but then it is too late.\u201d\n\nEverton, which is now unbeaten in six matches, moved into the top 10.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With a tenacious defensive display, Chelsea held Arsenal to a 0-0 draw on Sunday to close in on its first Premier League title in five years.", "Author": "ROB HARRIS", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With a tenacious defensive display, Chelsea held Arsenal to a 0-0 draw on Sunday to close in on its first Premier League title in five years.", "title": "Mourinho answers \u2018boring\u2019 jibe as Chelsea nears title", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/26/mourinho-answers-boring-jibe-as-chelsea-nears-titl/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/26/0a0eda4faebbc912740f6a7067004bec.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/26/0a0eda4faebbc912740f6a7067004bec.jpg", "title": "Mourinho answers \u2018boring\u2019 jibe as Chelsea nears title", "description": "With a tenacious defensive display, Chelsea held Arsenal to a 0-0 draw on Sunday to close in on its first Premier League title in five years.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded91\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou support a club and you are waiting, waiting, waiting and for so many years without a Premier League title,\u201d Mourinho said.\nAnd Mourinho was quick to remind Arsenal fans after the game that their team hasn\u2019t won the title since 2004.\nLONDON (AP) - With a tenacious defensive display, Chelsea held Arsenal to a 0-0 draw on Sunday to close in on its first Premier League title in five years.\nAfter the Brazilian lobbed David Ospina, the Arsenal goalkeeper clattered into him.\nChelsea has won the league three times since then, with the 2005 and 2006 titles coming in Mourinho\u2019s first reign."}
