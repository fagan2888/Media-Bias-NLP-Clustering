Adam Carolla says in 2016, he’s on Team Tucker, should The Daily Caller co-founder mount a campaign.

The actor and comedian expressed his support for a Tucker Carlson presidential run during an extensive interview with TheDC about politics, Hollywood and his new book, “President Me: The America That’s in My Head.” TheDC will be featuring segments from the interview throughout the week.

“I like the cut of his jib. He would definitely get my vote,” Carolla said of Carlson when asked if he has a favorite 2016 contender. “That’s a no-nonsense hombre right there.”

TheDC was unable to reach Carlson for comment on whether he is laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign in 2016.
