Why does the penalty matter?

The penalties were intended as a way to increase the number of people signing up, thereby maximizing the pool of insured. Insurers are concerned that the exemptions could make it easier for younger, healthier people to forgo coverage, leaving the pools overly filled with old people or those with health problems. That, in turn, could cause premiums to rise. Studies have shown that, without a mandate, the number of people who would remain uninsured would be higher than with the mandate. The law’s critics say the Obama administration’s waivers are so broad that almost anyone could qualify. Supporters say it provides necessary flexibility for consumers.
