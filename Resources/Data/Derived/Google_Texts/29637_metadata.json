( Special to the Reporter-Herald )\n\nMyrtle spurge is considered a noxious weed by the state of Colorado. (Special to the Reporter-Herald)\n\nStunning yet illegal, the showy plants myrtle spurge and cypress spurge have been designated for statewide eradication. Once commonly sold in nurseries and used in drought tolerant landscaping, now the Colorado Noxious Weed Act calls it a \"List A\" species and communities within the Larimer County Weed District have been working hard for several years to locate and remove these spring blooming plants.\n\n\"In the spring both of these weeds display bright yellow blooms earlier than most other plants in your garden.\" says Jan Vail, weed code enforcement officer for the city of Loveland. \"This is the time of year that I can find populations that have eluded us in the past.\"\n\n\"The public has been very helpful in identifying and reporting sightings of these weeds. In order to prevent them from invading sensitive ecosystems, out competing native plants, and spreading into open lands where they are difficult to manage we need to be diligent in finding every last plant.\" Vail added.\n\nOnce in bloom, seeds can be projected up to 15 feet and may be able to produce new plants for eight eight years, so this fight will not end soon. Hand pulling or digging when the soil is moist is a viable option for eliminating small infestations but care must be taken to avoid contact with the toxic milky sap. Gloves and eye protection should be worn when handling these poisonous plants and all plant waste must be disposed of in the trash \u2014 never composted. If you have questions or to report a sighting, call Weed Code Enforcement at 962-2792.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee https://larimer.org/weeds/ for more information on these weeds.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/larimer-county/ci_27892738/plants-might-look-nice-but-they-are-noxious", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0410/20150410__11RHBY4~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Special to the Reporter-Herald", "description": "Stunning yet illegal, the showy plants myrtle spurge and cypress spurge have been designated for statewide eradication.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:27892738:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-12T18:51:32-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/larimer-county/ci_27892738/plants-might-look-nice-but-they-are-noxious", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0410/20150410__11RHBY4~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Stunning yet illegal, the showy plants myrtle spurge and cypress spurge have been designated for statewide eradication.", "title": "Plants might look nice, but they are noxious weeds"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Stunning yet illegal, the showy plants myrtle spurge and cypress spurge have been designated for statewide eradication.", "title": "Plants might look nice, but they are noxious weeds", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/larimer-county/ci_27892738/plants-might-look-nice-but-they-are-noxious", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0410/20150410__11RHBY4~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-12T18:51:32-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Plants might look nice, but they are noxious weeds", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0410/20150410__11RHBY4~2.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Northern Colorado News", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "modificationDate": "2015-04-12T18:51:47-0600", "endDate": "2025-04-12T18:51:32-0600", "byline": "Special to the", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2015-04-12T18:52:15-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland Reporter Herald news weather information larimer county"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdedb5\"", "article_summary": "( Special to the Reporter-Herald )Myrtle spurge is considered a noxious weed by the state of Colorado.\n(Special to the Reporter-Herald)Stunning yet illegal, the showy plants myrtle spurge and cypress spurge have been designated for statewide eradication.\nCypress spurge was once sold in garden centers, but it is now considered a noxious weed.\n\"In the spring both of these weeds display bright yellow blooms earlier than most other plants in your garden.\"\nsays Jan Vail, weed code enforcement officer for the city of Loveland."}
