For the second consecutive year, Marrero-Ragusa Volunteer Fire Co. No. 3 lacked proper documentation for meals it bought with department credit cards, according to its 2012 audit released Tuesday. The finding mirrors a similar conclusion reported by the accounting firm of Duplantier, Hrapmann, Hogan & Maher in the department's 2011 audit.





The new report says the fire chief and some directors were issued credit cards. Because the agency received more than $2.3 million in public money last year from Jefferson Parish, it must document how the money was used.

State law requires that meals purchased by credit cards be documented with receipts, names of those participating and the business purpose. After reviewing the questioned expenses, fire officials reported most of the meals were purchased during training, the audit said.

Duplantier, Hrapmann recommended the department's management review policies for credit card use. "Although there has been improvement, we feel this issue still needs to be continually monitored by management as it pertains to Louisiana state law,'' the audit said.

In its response, the Fire Department said it will review policies for credit card use and stress proper documentation for expenses.

Marrero-Ragusa has 24 paid firefighters and 25 volunteers. It is one of three departments that serve West Jefferson's largest fire protection district.
