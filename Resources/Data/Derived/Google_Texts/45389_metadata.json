But patients still chose to seek care elsewhere, and the losses at Quincy Medical Center mounted. The hospital is on track to lose $20 million this year.\n\nThe problem, Steward executives and health care specialists said, is that there are too many hospital beds in the area. More than a dozen hospitals sit within a 10-mile radius of Quincy Medical Center. In recent years, the hospital has faced increased competition from South Shore Hospital in Weymouth, which is planning a merger with Partners HealthCare, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center\u2019s hospital in Milton.\n\nMany patients also prefer the big teaching hospitals in Boston.\n\n\u201cThis is not a pleasant process,\u201d said David Cutler, a health care economist at Harvard University. \u201cIt is an economic reality about health care. There\u2019s no fighting economic realities.\u201d\n\nThe shutdown of Quincy Medical Center follows two other sizable hospital closings this year. Radius Specialty Hospital, a rehab facility in Quincy and Roxbury, shut down last month, and North Adams Regional Hospital closed in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteward\u2019s plans to close Quincy Medical Center on Dec. 31 appear to violate an agreement the company signed with Attorney General Martha Coakley when it acquired the hospital in 2011. The agreement required Steward to keep the hospital open for at least 6\u00bd years and give 18 months\u2019 notice before shutting down.\n\nDr. Mark Girard, president of Steward\u2019s hospitals, said the company was in touch with state officials about the hospital\u2019s problems before the closure was announced.\n\nCoakley, who lost her bid for the governorship Tuesday, was formally notified of the closure decision Thursday. Her office is \u201creviewing it in the context of Steward\u2019s legal obligations,\u201d Coakley\u2019s spokesman, Brad Puffer, said.\n\nState law requires hospitals to give 90 days\u2019 notice and a public hearing before closing. The Department of Public Health said it has yet to receive notice from Quincy Medical Center.\n\n\u201cDPH will work closely with Steward and other area providers to ensure that any closure plan includes the appropriate continuity of care for patients,\u201d spokeswoman Anne Roach said.\n\nSteward did not respond to questions about the Coakley agreement. The company said it will pay its Quincy workers for 60 days and try to find jobs for them at other Steward facilities. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about 980 open job slots,\u201d Girard said.\n\nQuincy Medical Center has struggled for years, forcing Steward to use revenues from its other hospitals to keep it afloat. These days, just 40 of Quincy Medical Center\u2019s 196 beds are generally filled. About 70 percent of its patients are on Medicaid, government insurance for the poor, or Medicare, government insurance for seniors, which both pay less than commercial insurers.\n\nThe situation is so dire that even local officials and labor unions, while disappointed, are not fighting the hospital\u2019s closing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s met with great sadness, but I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m extremely shocked,\u201d said Mayor Thomas P. Koch of Quincy. \u201cThis institution has been on a roller-coaster ride for many years.\u201d\n\nQuincy, with a population of about 93,000, will become the largest city in Massachusetts without its own hospital.\n\n\u201cI was born there in 1934,\u201d said Quincy resident Robin Solletti. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible loss, a city without a hospital.\u201d\n\nSteward Health Care, owned by the New York private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, entered the Massachusetts market in 2010, when it bought the Caritas hospital system from the Archdiocese of Boston. Steward, which today operates 10 hospitals in the state, promised to create a new model for health care by delivering it more efficiently and at lower costs in community settings.\n\nThough Quincy Medical Center is closing, Steward executives say they plan to maintain a 24-hour emergency room and open a new urgent care clinic in other Quincy locations. They did not say where or when those services would open.\n\n\u201cThis is about aligning the delivery system with the needs of the Quincy community,\u201d Girard said.\n\nGirard said the company does not plan to close any other hospitals.\n\nQuincy Medical Center\u2019s employees are affiliated with two unions, the Massachusetts Nurses Association and Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union.\n\n\u201cOur goal in all of this is to make sure that our employees are protected and made whole, and just as important, to make sure the community needs are met,\u201d said David Schildmeier, a spokesman for the nurses\u2019 union.\n\nGale Martell, an SEIU leader and 38-year employee at the hospital, said she believed Steward did all it could to try to keep the hospital running. But the news of the shutdown still hit workers hard, she said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re worried about their jobs,\u201d said Martell, a medical technologist.\n\nQuincy Medical Center\u2019s problems worsened in recent years as a referral partner, Granite Medical Group, part of the Atrius Health doctors\u2019 network, sent more patients to other hospitals.\n\n\u201cGranite Medical Group\u2019s admission patterns have shifted over the last five years to include more of Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Milton, and South Shore Hospital,\u201d Bob Calway, Granite\u2019s interim chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cThese changes are a result of changing patient preferences and Granite\u2019s ongoing efforts to develop effective and collaborative working relationships with all of the hospitals in the communities in which our patients live and work.\u201d\n\nRelated coverage:\n\n\u2022 Mass. hospital profits rose last year, report says\n\n\u2022 Quincy Medical Center seeks fiscal turnaround\n\n\u2022 Boston Capital: Steward hospital finances prompt protest\n\n\u2022 Quincy Medical Center puts its new face forward", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.198983847", "eomportal-id": 169207, "description": "Steward Health Care System is notifying its 680 employees Thursday that it plans to shut down its unprofitable 196-bed Quincy Medical Center on Dec. 31, in what would be the largest Massachusetts hospital closure in more than a decade.", "eomportal-instanceid": 29, "og": {"city": "Quincy", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Steward Health Care System is notifying its 680 employees Thursday that it plans to shut down its unprofitable 196-bed Quincy Medical Center on Dec. 31, in what would be the largest Massachusetts hospital closure in more than a decade.", "zip": 2169, "title": "Steward to shut down Quincy Medical Center, in largest Massachusetts hospital closure in a decade - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/11/06/steward-shut-down-quincy-medical-center-largest-massachusetts-hospital-closure-decade/bVl0qPstKwouQLMKQ3UJiI/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2014/10/10/BostonGlobe.com/Metro/Images/ryan_quincymedical1_met.jpg", "state": "MA", "longitude": "-71.0141122", "streetaddress": "114 Whitwell St", "latitude": "42.2510475", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Steward Health Systems,Quincy Medical Center,Hospitals,South Shore", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 05:16:28 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Steward Health Systems,Quincy Medical Center,Hospitals,South Shore", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "759f1af0-65d0-11e4-89b1-4681d59fe968"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb798\"", "article_summary": "hospital profits rose last year, report says\u2022 Quincy Medical Center seeks fiscal turnaround\u2022 Boston Capital: Steward hospital finances prompt protest\u2022 Quincy Medical Center puts its new face forward\nThere\u2019s no fighting economic realities.\u201dThe shutdown of Quincy Medical Center follows two other sizable hospital closings this year.\nQuincy Medical Center has struggled for years, forcing Steward to use revenues from its other hospitals to keep it afloat.\nMore than a dozen hospitals sit within a 10-mile radius of Quincy Medical Center.\nQuincy Medical Center\u2019s employees are affiliated with two unions, the Massachusetts Nurses Association and Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union."}
