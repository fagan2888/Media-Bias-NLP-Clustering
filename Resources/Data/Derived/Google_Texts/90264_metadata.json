That\u2019s right, layoffs have spread throughout the legal profession, and we recently received word that a prominent public-interest organization would be sweeping out a healthy percentage of its attorney workforce.\n\nWhich organization brought April showers of doom and gloom for its lawyers?\n\nThat would be the American Civil Liberties Union, which just dumped out 23 employees \u2014 about seven percent of its workforce \u2014 like yesterday\u2019s trash. Attorneys in New York, D.C., California, and Wyoming were let go.\n\nAccording to a memo sent out by ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero on March 26, the ACLU had been working with a $15 million annual operating deficit for the past few years, and the time for additional cost-cutting measures had come. Everyone in the legal profession knows that the easiest way to cut costs is to cut attorney headcount, so that\u2019s exactly what the ACLU did. Those affected by the cuts were notified earlier this week. Romero\u2019s memo is available in full on the following page.\n\nHere\u2019s what some of our tipsters have said about the ACLU\u2019s layoffs earlier this week:\n\n\u201cIt was shocking because this is the ACLU. People were in tears and very upset. The news came out of nowhere. The email alluded to a \u2018yearlong process of strategic planning,\u2019 yet some of the people affected had been hired less than a year ago \u2014 which raises questions of incompetence on the part of ACLU leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ACLU had a mass layoff Monday and Tuesday. People are very upset. Affected workers were told to pack their belongings and immediately leave the premises. Morale is extremely low. Affected employees were not given any notice and some have expressed feeling blindsided.\u201d\n\nAnother employee who was affected by the ACLU\u2019s cuts spoke to Catherine Ho of the Washington Post, observing all too appropriately, \u201cThe very organization entrusted with protecting civil liberties didn\u2019t even respect the civil rights of its own employees.\u201d\n\nSome of the employees who fell victim to Romero\u2019s layoffs were hired as recently as a few months ago \u2014 despite the claim in his email of a \u201cyearlong process of strategic planning\u201d \u2014 which makes the situation reek of mismanagement. We also wonder if ACLU donors knew that mass layoffs were planned for this month \u2014 and whether they might have tried to help had they known.\n\nRomero has a history of controversy as a workplace leader. Back in 2007, he was accused of promoting \u201cworkplace policies unbecoming of a civil-liberties organization\u201d; according to New York Magazine, staffers complained of a \u201crepressive, communist-like atmosphere,\u201d and noted that unhappiness at the ACLU\u2019s headquarters was \u201cheavy, palpable, and widespread.\u201d It\u2019s sad that even our nation\u2019s do-gooders can\u2019t escape layoffs.\n\nIf your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs or stealth layoffs or voluntary buyouts, please don\u2019t hesitate to let us know.
