Company representatives responded by asking for patience.\n\nAdams said some of the calls concerned other types of coverage, outside of the government program. Typically, December is when people renew their health insurance policies, a process that coincided with the Obamacare sign-up, he said.\n\n\u201cThe pace of enrollment has continued to improve as the government has addressed technical issues associated with the marketplace,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWe have also experienced a steady increase in visits to our website, calls to our customer hotlines and attendance at community events.\u201d\n\nWhen the new federal law went into effect Oct. 1, millions of applicants overwhelmed the federal website intended to field questions and process applications for all but 17 states. The online site, HealthCare.gov, was revamped as of Dec. 1.\n\nAs of Nov. 30, the federal government was reporting that only 14,038 Texans had applied, been approved and picked a plan under Obamacare. A much larger group, 244,695 Texans, completed their applications but did not choose a specific plan by the end of last month.\n\nConsidering Texas has 4.8 million uninsured residents, even the higher number of completed applications would represent just 5.1 percent of those who could apply for coverage in the state.\n\nThe federal government, which is overseeing Texas\u2019 sign-up, will not provide December\u2019s enrollment numbers until early January.\n\nThe last report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services tallied 364,682 individuals who had completed the application process and picked a plan nationwide. An additional 583,473 applications were pending completion.\n\nSuch a slow rollout does not surprise the people who have watched the launch of other national insurance programs over the years.\n\nMedicare Part D, offering drug coverage to senior citizens, frustrated pharmacists and patients alike when it kicked off in 2006. Private health insurance companies implemented the new benefit, but prescriptions weren\u2019t necessarily filled. Some pharmacists called it a fiasco.\n\nHector De La Torre, executive director of the Transamerica Center for Health Studies, said the Affordable Care Act is requiring a much more complicated process.\n\nOnline enrollment requires consumers to provide information about income and family members. Then the government decides who qualifies for a tax subsidy. Finally, an approved applicant must peruse a menu of insurance plans, pick one and pay for it.\n\n\u201cAnd when you think about the people who are trying to sign up for the first time, it\u2019s even more complicated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMany are in lower-paid jobs that don\u2019t have insurance, which means they may have lower education levels, too. This was never going to be easy.\u201d\n\nDiane McCollum: It\u2019s not a \u2018free ride,\u2019 but counselor is pleased\n\nAlthough she is just two years short of Medicare coverage, Diane McCollum has been eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMcCollum, a 63-year-old mental-health counselor, lost her health care coverage when her job was reduced to part time five years ago. Ironically, her full-time job was cut back after the state trimmed Medicaid for mental-health services.\n\n\u201cIndigent children with mental-health needs got 1 hour and 15 minutes of therapy each month instead of an hour every week,\u201d McCollum said. \u201cWe\u2019re allowed to give more time than that, but it\u2019s without pay. It\u2019s a tragedy for them.\u201d\n\nMcCollum, who lives in Lake Highlands, used COBRA to extend her insurance and then found an individual plan that cost nearly $360 a month, a good chunk of her reduced paycheck. And it would have increased to almost $600 next year.\n\nUnder the new law, she found a more comprehensive policy, and she qualified for a $200 tax credit that lowers it to $250 monthly, McCollum said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting a free ride,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have good coverage if I need it.\u201d\n\nDiane McCollum\n\n\u2022 Age: 63\n\n\u2022 Coverage: Individual\n\n\u2022 Tax subsidy: $200 monthly\n\n\u2022 Premium: $250 monthly\n\n\u2022 Deductible: $7,000\n\nBrenda Copple: Costs go down without subsidy\n\nRetiring early as a corporate marketing executive sounded like a good idea a decade ago, said 56-year-old Brenda Copple.\n\n\u201cI was ready to go back to school and reinvent myself,\u201d said Copple, who lives in Uptown.\n\nShe also took advantage of COBRA and then looked for a private health plan that would give her the coverage she\u2019d always had. She believed her hours on the treadmill and good health made her an attractive candidate.\n\nBut Copple forgot about a test result on her first colonoscopy, offered as part of a comprehensive physical awarded to top executives. It picked up a slight abnormality that turned out to be nothing.\n\n\u201cI was rejected for individual coverage because of that test result,\u201d she said. \u201cThey called it a pre-existing condition, and I couldn\u2019t buy insurance anywhere.\u201d\n\nSo Copple ended up in the Texas high-risk pool, paying $758 in monthly premiums with a $5,000 annual deductible. Never once did she spend enough per year to put in an insurance claim, she said.\n\nEven though Copple doesn\u2019t qualify for a tax subsidy, her new plan is $20 cheaper a month, and she cut her deductible and out-of-pocket costs to $3,250 a year.\n\n\u201cAnd I got $40-a-month dental coverage after 10 years without anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI am thrilled.\u201d\n\nBrenda Copple\n\n\u2022 Age: 56\n\n\u2022 Coverage: Individual\n\n\u2022 Tax subsidy: None\n\n\u2022 Premium: $738 monthly\n\n\u2022 Deductible: $3,250\n\nHarry O. Davis: Keeping his specialists, reducing costs\n\nWhen you have a chronic condition that could be fatal, you need to pay attention to the details in your insurance plan, Harry O. Davis said.\n\nThe 57-year-old North Dallas consultant lost his group coverage when he sold his small business five years ago. While he doesn\u2019t like to talk specifics about his health, he concedes that someday he might need an organ transplant.\n\nBeing relegated to the state\u2019s high-risk pool meant Davis paid the full $5,000 deductible each year, plus $9,000 in total premium costs.\n\n\u201cI feel great now, but I follow every order my doctors give me,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey are kind of amazed at how well I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nAs Davis shopped this fall for a new plan under Obamacare, his biggest concern was hanging on to those specialists.\n\nHe found half a dozen plans that allowed him that access. He chose a gold plan that will reduce his future out-of-pocket costs by about $1,800 a year.\n\n\u201cI had no problem with the health exchanges,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d\n\nHarry O. Davis\n\n\u2022 Age: 57\n\n\u2022 Coverage: Individual\n\n\u2022 Tax subsidy: None\n\n\u2022 Premium: $662 monthly\n\n\u2022 Deductible: $3,250\n\nDaryn DeZengotita: Partners find way to cover the family\n\nDaryn DeZengotita was uninsured until she met her partner, Celia Barshop, who worked for a company that offered the couple a family health plan. They have two sons.\n\nThe coverage lasted until Barshop took a different job that made the family policy too expensive.\n\nBeing a self-employed small-business owner, DeZengotita shopped for her own coverage. She found a $656-a-month policy that covered her and the two boys.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t provide her much beyond an annual checkup and mammogram, the 48-year-old Rowlett resident said.\n\nWorking downtown in a lofty incubator office, DeZengotita said she pored over her insurance options when the federal government began accepting applications in October. She waited patiently to get through when the federal website collapsed.\n\nShe found a plan for $414 a month, qualifying for a $63 subsidy. The boys will stay on her plan.\n\n\u201cI love the fact I can keep my doctor,\u201d said DeZengotita, who works 30 hours a week. \u201cI spent so much of my life getting health care at Planned Parenthood that it\u2019s a luxury to have a doctor at all.\u201d\n\nDaryn DeZengotita\n\n\u2022 Age: 48\n\n\u2022 Coverage: Family\n\n\u2022 Tax subsidy: $63 monthly\n\n\u2022 Premium: $414 monthly\n\n\u2022 Deductible: $6,000\n\nLuis Veloz: \u2018I can tell people for the first time I\u2019m going to the doctor\u2019\n\nWhen he was in second grade, Luis Veloz fell and broke his arm. But he didn\u2019t tell his family about the pain because he was worried it would cost too much to get it fixed.\n\nHe knew about medical bills because his uninsured father suffered his first heart attack earlier that year. Veloz remembered the stunned look on his parents\u2019 faces every time they opened a hospital bill.\n\n\u201cPeople think the kids don\u2019t notice things. But kids know,\u201d said the 20-year-old Veloz, who lives in East Dallas.\n\nHe made the best of his pain by writing with the other hand, until his teacher noticed something was wrong. The school nurse diagnosed the broken bone and his mother took him to the doctor for a cast.\n\nHis arm would heal, but not his anxiety about medical bills.\n\nWhen he was a student at Southern Methodist University, studying for his first-semester finals, his father suffered another heart attack. This time, it required open-heart surgery, and the family\u2019s medical bills would top $250,000.\n\n\u201cI was living the American dream,\u201d Veloz said. \u201cBut my family needed my help. I realized I could go to school later.\u201d\n\nHe worked as a waiter for almost a year without health insurance. But his family\u2019s experience of being uninsured inspired him to join the Texas Organizing Project in 2011. He went door to door last summer explaining how the Affordable Care Act would work.\n\nLast week, he sat down at a computer and picked out an individual health insurance plan that will cost him $114 a month. After he pays the first premium, he plans to schedule his first physical exam. His family will pick a plan early next year.\n\n\u201cI can tell people for the first time I\u2019m going to the doctor,\u201d Veloz said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that awesome?\u201d\n\nLuis Veloz\n\n\u2022 Age: 20\n\n\u2022 Coverage: Individual\n\n\u2022 Tax subsidy: None\n\n\u2022 Premium: $114 monthly\n\n\u2022 Deductible: $6,000", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five Dallas-area residents with insurance under the president\u2019s plan share their success stories.", "og": {"description": "Five Dallas-area residents with insurance under the president\u2019s plan share their success stories.", "title": "Obamacare sign-ups picking up steam in Texas", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20131221-obamacare-sign-ups-picking-up-steam-in-texas.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131221-nm_19obamacare01.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NM_19ObamaCare01.jpg", "height": 460}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2013-12-22T06:14:27Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2013-12-22T05:23:49Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare sign-ups picking up steam in Texas\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20131221-obamacare-sign-ups-picking-up-steam-in-texas.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131221-nm_19obamacare01.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NM_19ObamaCare01.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1354146\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-22T05:23:49Z\", \"section\": \"General News\", \"author\": \"SHERRY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131221-nm_19obamacare01.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NM_19ObamaCare01.jpg", "publishtime": "2013-12-22T05:23:49Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3732\"", "article_summary": "Typically, December is when people renew their health insurance policies, a process that coincided with the Obamacare sign-up, he said.\nLast week, he sat down at a computer and picked out an individual health insurance plan that will cost him $114 a month.\nAny such enrollment rush is likely to be tied to Monday\u2019s deadline for anyone wanting their new health insurance plan to kick in next month.\nI realized I could go to school later.\u201dHe worked as a waiter for almost a year without health insurance.\nPrivate health insurance companies implemented the new benefit, but prescriptions weren\u2019t necessarily filled."}
