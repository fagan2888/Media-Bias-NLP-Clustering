Loomis had spent the last 13 months fulfilling the role, while also carrying out chief operating officer duties.\n\nThe veteran executive said he will focus on delivering primary and specialty care and ensuring the hospital system formerly known as Mercy Health Partners is providing affordable, accessible and high-quality care to residents.\n\nAs president, Loomis will continue carrying out the policies of the hospital, interacting with its trustees board and working closely with medical staff, including the senior leadership team.\n\nHere are five more things to know about Loomis and his vision for Mercy Health Muskegon:\n\n\u2018Bug for Healthcare\u2019\n\nLoomis launched his career in health care at 17 after securing a job at Hackley Hospital.\n\n\u201cI really did get the bug for healthcare back then,\u201d said Loomis, who unloaded trucks and delivered medical supplies. \u201cI really appreciated the work and the environment of working in the hospital.\u201d\n\nHe recalls a supervisor telling him everything he did would have an impact on the facility\u2019s patients and that has stayed with him through the decades, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we do matters to the community \u2014 they are coming in for serious matters,\u201d Loomis said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what hospitals and their staffs provide to the patients that is important to me.\u201d\n\nLoomis briefly left Hackley for the Navy, where he worked as a hospital corpsman for four years. He returned to Hackley and enrolled in a business program at Grand Valley State University, where he later earned his MBA. Loomis went on to work at Muskegon General Hospital, where he secured his first leadership position as the facility\u2019s admitting supervisor.\n\n\u2018A Time for Change\u2019\n\nLoomis said the biggest challenge facing Mercy Health Muskegon will be adapting to health care reform \u2014 and that does not just encompass the changes that come with the Affordable Care Act, he said.\n\nHealth care providers are now being reimbursed on the quality of service, patient satisfaction and efficiency rather than volume, Loomis said.\n\nIn 2012, Loomis said Mercy Health Muskegon\u2019s inpatient admissions had declined by 14 percent since fiscal year 2009 and that patients occupied less than half of its hospital beds.\n\nLoomis said the declining admission rates will continue, while patients will begin to seek primary care services more frequently. The trend has triggered a new outlook on how the hospital uses its facilities and has led to the consolidation planned for its Mercy Campus, 1500 E. Sherman Blvd, he said.\n\nThe first phase of the project will cost $97 million and will relocate operating rooms from the hospital\u2019s Hackley Campus, 1700 Clinton St.\n\n\u201cThis really is a time of change certainly for all of health care,\u201d Loomis said. \u201cWe still have a foot in the past, but very quickly we\u2019re being assessed on the quality of service and other areas.\u201d\n\n\u2018High Quality Health Care\u2019\n\nLoomis said Mercy Health Muskegon will continue to take several measures to gauge and ensure patients have access to high quality health care, which is one of its \u201cfive strategic pillars.\u201d\n\nThat includes regular meetings among the hospital\u2019s board quality committee members and a \u201cvery active\u201d patient safety committee led by the chief nursing officer, Loomis said.\n\nMercy Health Muskegon officials also look at its readmission rate, which many health care advocates contend make hospitals more accountable for what happens once patients return home.\n\nLoomis described the hospital\u2019s readmission rates as \u201cgreat,\u201d which was supported by a recent Becker's Hospital Review ranking that recognized Mercy Health Muskegon as the No. 1 hospital with low readmission rates for heart attack patients.\n\n\n\nThe rates calculate the percentage of inpatient discharges in which patients sought re-hospitalization. Under the Affordable Care Act, hospitals with high readmission rates lose a portion of Medicare reimbursement monies.\n\nHelping Staff Help Patients\n\nLoomis said the hospital will continue to recruit talent to the region and make sure its staff has access to the technology and personnel support they need to perform more efficiently.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re aggressively trying to make sure we have the positions in Muskegon filled,\u201d Loomis said.\n\nHospital leadership efforts to help doctors include recruiting supporting staff such as social workers, nurses, physician assistants and medical practitioners, he said.\n\nLoomis said doctors can better handle their workloads if others are around to handle phone calls and other day-to-day occurrences.\n\nLoomis also said the Muskegon operation will work more closely with its CHE Trinity affiliate Mercy Health Saint Mary\u2019s in Grand Rapids.\n\nIn response to a past resident concern about overworked nurses and how nurses and doctors collaborate, Loomis said the relationship between the two groups has improved over the years.\n\n\u201cOur nursing leadership and our medical staff leadership over the past few years have really taken that on and have been collaborative. We measure nurse and physician relationships, and continue to improve in that regard,\u201d Loomis said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if our nurses are overwhelmed. Everyone is going through a lot of change right now and that may cause some stress.\u201d\n\n\u2018Process Excellence\u2019\n\nLoomis said the hospital has borrowed a philosophy from Toyota and other automotive industry companies by creating a department solely focused on \u201clean.\u201d\n\nAlso called \u201clean production\u201d or \u201clean enterprise,\u201d the philosophy focuses on efficiency and \u201cdriving waste out of the hospital system,\u201d Loomis said.\n\nMercy Health created a Process Excellence Department in fall 2012 and it is led by an individual who has been directing the effort for about a year, Loomis said.\n\nLoomis said the implementation of the lean philosophy means the hospital will serve patients with the facilities and resources the hospital already has. It will affect the design of the Mercy Health facilities, he said.\n\n\u201cMy main goal is to make sure things get better and better as we go into the future,\u201d Loomis said.\n\nMercy Health Muskegon spokeswoman Joan Kessler said Loomis will continue to act as COO until officials make a decision regarding the position.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "health,hospital,Mercy Health,Mercy Health Muskegon", "title": "Five things to know about new Mercy Health Muskegon leader Greg Loomis and his goals", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Five things to know about new Mercy Health Muskegon leader Greg Loomis and his goals \", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/index.ssf/2014/01/five_things_to_know_about_new.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/chronicle/news_impact/photo/14011799-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11927061\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-04T11:53:01Z\", \"author\": \"Michelle D.
