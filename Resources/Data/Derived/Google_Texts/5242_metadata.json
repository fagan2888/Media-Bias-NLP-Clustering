The order names seven officials of the Venezuelan state whose assets are to be frozen and their entry into the U.S. blocked, but in reality this is an unjustified attack against the national sovereignty of Venezuela. The government of the U.S. has not even produced any evidence that any of these individuals have any assets in the U.S. or have travelled to the U.S. in the past.\n\nThe idea that these sanctions are imposed with the aim of defending human rights, freedom of expression, democratic institutions and attacking corruption in Venezuela is laughable if one looks at the track record of the United States.\n\nFor example, the government of the United States:\n\nis responsible for local police forces which regularly kill unarmed teenagers just because of the color of their skin.\n\nis involved in mass surveillance and spying on its own citizens.\n\ncarries out the illegal detention and torturing of foreign citizens at its military base in Guantanamo, despite Obama\u2019s promise to close it down.\n\nthrough its CIA is involved in the kidnapping and torturing of foreign citizens in countries outside the USA.\n\nThroughout its history, the USA has been involved in countless interventions in foreign countries in order to depose governments they did not like and to support and defend brutal dictatorships. More recently, in Latin America, Washington has been involved in successful and failed coups in Bolivia (2008), Honduras (2009) and Paraguay (2012).\n\nIn Colombia and Mexico, the government of the United States has no problem in supporting governments which are responsible for horrific violations of human rights and for corruption and are linked to drug cartels. No executive orders in these cases. They are not considered \u201ca threat to national security.\u201d\n\nThis is the latest measure of U.S. imperialist meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation like the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and as such is strongly condemned by the Hands off Venezuela campaign.\n\nHow can President Obama even talk about human rights and democratic institutions when barely six weeks ago he headed a high level delegation to Saudi Arabia to attend the funeral of that country\u2019s ruthless despot and described him as \u201cone of our closest allies\u201d?\n\nHow can the president of the U.S. describe Venezuela as an \u201cextraordinary threat to U.S. national security\u201d when the United States was directly involved in the coup which overthrew the democratically elected government of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in April 2002?\n\nThe U.S. has not ceased to fund and support opposition groups in Venezuela that have been involved in attempts to remove by force the democratically elected government of the country. Washington has not ceased in its constant interference against the democratic will of the Venezuelan people. Who is a threat to whom?\n\nThe only threat which Venezuela presents to U.S. imperialism is the threat of being a good example. Venezuela\u2019s Bolivarian revolution has eradicated illiteracy, massively extended free health care and education, substantially reduced poverty and unemployment, built affordable housing for hundreds of thousands of families and generally inspired progressive and democratic change in the whole of Latin America and beyond.\n\nChavez\u2019 call for socialism has reverberated among millions of workers and youth across the world who are suffering from the policies of cuts and austerity. Even in the United States, thousands of poor families have benefited from fuel subsidies provided by the Venezuelan government.\n\nThe democratic credentials of the Bolivarian revolution cannot be questioned by anyone. There have been 18 elections and referenda since 1998, with all bar one (December 2007) being won by the candidates and proposals of the Bolivarian movement. This year there will be National Assembly elections again.\n\nThe latest sanctions imposed by President Obama affect only seven individuals, but in reality they represent a threat to the Bolivarian revolution. They are an escalation of the sanctions already imposed in December 2014 and the language used opens the door for further and more severe economic sanctions, the funding of opposition groups in violation of national sovereignty and other forms of intervention.\n\nIt is not by chance that this executive order comes less than a month of the uncovering of a coup plot in Venezuela, the organization of which took place partly on U.S. soil.\n\nGiven these events, we reaffirm our solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution and the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela faced with imperialist aggression. We call on the labor movement, the youth and progressive and democratic public opinion throughout the world to join in a powerful movement rejecting U.S. interference in Venezuela.\n\nU.S. Hands off Venezuela!\n\nRespect the Democratic Will of the Venezuelan People!\n\nDefend and Complete the Bolivarian Revolution!\n\nThis story first appeared at http://www.marxist.com/venezuela-a-threat-to-us-national-security.htm.\n\nCastro, Correa and Morales rally behind Venezuela to condemn U.S. sanctions\n\nby TeleSUR English\n\nVarious Latin American countries have rallied behind Venezuela to condemn new U.S. sanctions against the South American nation.\n\nThe Cuban government has slammed the U.S. sanctions as \u201carbitrary and aggressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is Venezuela a threat to the United States? Thousands of kilometers away, without strategic weapons and without the resources \u2026 to conspire against the U.S. constitutional order; the (White House) declaration has little credibility,\u201d read a statement published in the newspaper Granma on Tuesday.\n\nFormer Cuban President Fidel Castro has also praised Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s \u201cbrilliant and valiant\u201d response to what he described as \u201cbrutal\u201d U.S. plans against Venezuela. The comments were made in a short letter to Maduro on Monday night.\n\nThe Cuban government has slammed the U.S. sanctions as \u201carbitrary and aggressive.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Bolivia\u2019s President Evo Morales said the regional blocs CELAC and UNASUR should immediately hold an \u201cemergency meeting,\u201d arguing the U.S. sanctions pose a threat to \u201call of Latin America and the Caribbean.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe condemn, we repudiate, in the 21st century we won\u2019t accept this kind of intervention by the United States,\u201d Morales said. \u201cAll of our solidarity and our support goes to President Maduro and the revolutionary Bolivarian government and people of Venezuela.\u201d\n\nUNASUR\u2019s head and other regional leaders including Ecuador\u2019s President Rafael Correa have already slammed the White House\u2019s decision to impose more sanctions on Venezuela.\n\n\u201cAn executive order by Obama declaring Venezuela a national security threat and declaring a national emergency to face this threat \u2026 It must be a bad joke, which reminds us of the darkest hours of our America, when we received invasions and dictatorships imposed by imperialism \u2026 Will they understand that Latin America has changed?\u201d said the Ecuadorean leader Tuesday through his Facebook account.\n\n\u201cWe condemn, we repudiate, in the 21st century we won\u2019t accept this kind of intervention by the United States,\u201d Morales said. \u201cAll of our solidarity and our support goes to President Maduro and the revolutionary Bolivarian government and people of Venezuela.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, President Barack Obama declared Venezuela an \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat\u201d to the United States.\n\nObama also issued sanctions on several high ranking Venezuelan government officials. The measures were issued under an executive order. In the past, the Obama administration has condemned Maduro for using executive orders to pass legislation.\n\n\u201cWe believe the separation of powers and the presence of independent branches of government are essential elements of democracy,\u201d a White House spokesperson said in 2013, after Maduro used an executive order to pass legislation aimed at stabilizing consumer prices.\n\nIn response to Obama\u2019s announcements, Maduro requested the use of the Enabling Act to pass by executive order \u201ca special law to preserve peace in the country\u201d in the face of U.S. threats.\n\nIf the powers are granted by the National Assembly, Maduro plans to draft an \u201canti-imperialist law to prepare us for all scenarios and to win,\u201d he said.\n\nIn unison with Latin American leaders\u2019 comments, social media users have coined the hashtag #ObamaYankeeGoHome, posting over 80,000 tweets with the tag within the first 24 hours following Obama\u2019s announcements.\n\nThe phrase \u201cYankee go home\u201d has been used in Latin American pop culture and leftist circles since the 1950s, long after the United States established a firm imperialist attitude toward independent-minded governments south of its borders.\n\nIn 1973, renowned Venezuelan folk singer Ali Primera wrote a song called \u201cWorking-Class Latin America,\u201d in which the expression is sung in refrain.\n\nThis story previously appeared at http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/11259.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "San Francisco Bay View", "description": "On March 9, 2015, U.S. President Obama issued an executive order declaring a \u201cnational emergency\u201d affirming that \u201cthe situation in Venezuela\u201d poses an \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.\u201d This is the latest measure of U.S. imperialist meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation like the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and as such is strongly condemned by the Hands off Venezuela campaign.", "title": "Venezuela a threat to US national security?", "url": "http://sfbayview.com/2015/03/venezuela-a-threat-to-us-national-security/", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/sfbayview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Venezuela-President-Nicolas-Maduro-speaks-holding-Venezuela-Constitution-by-Reuters.jpg?fit=960%2C619", "type": "article"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9790\"", "article_summary": "The terms of Obama\u2019s executive order would be farcical if the situation was not in fact very dangerous.\nThe Cuban government has slammed the U.S. sanctions as \u201carbitrary and aggressive.\u201d\u201cHow is Venezuela a threat to the United States?\nEven in the United States, thousands of poor families have benefited from fuel subsidies provided by the Venezuelan government.\n\u201cWe condemn, we repudiate, in the 21st century we won\u2019t accept this kind of intervention by the United States,\u201d Morales said.\nThe only threat which Venezuela presents to U.S. imperialism is the threat of being a good example."}
