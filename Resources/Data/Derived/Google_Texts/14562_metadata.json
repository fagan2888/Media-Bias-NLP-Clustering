We are happy \u2014 and very, very proud.\n\n\u201cIt was a joy to see Shelley doing the job she loved. And I praise ESPN for sticking by her throughout her ordeal.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s return performance generated a huge \u201cwelcome back\u201d response via Facebook, Twitter and e-mail \u2014 in and out of the sports world. Smith was recuperating in her Los Angeles-area home when ESPN called, asking if she would like to go to Hawaii on assignment to cover Mariota\u2019s entry into the NFL.\n\nMariota was one of a handful of notable college athletes who remained at home rather than going to the huge Chicago ceremony.\n\nSmith\u2019s travel plans included a visit to a Los Angeles barber who shaved her head.\n\nWriting on ESPN Front Row, Smith noted: \u201cHaving no hair is a sign of strength. \u2026 At least I won\u2019t have to worry about the wind blowing my hair.\n\n\u201cThis experience has made me stronger and has given me a better understanding of how people can really help others.\u201d\n\nHer next assignment: a trip to New York on Tuesday for the Sports Emmy Awards, where she will be a presenter. Smith won an Emmy in 1997 for a segment on Magic Johnson during ESPN\u2019s lengthy coverage of AIDS and athletes.\n\nSmith is undergoing positive radiation treatment, which indicates the chemo procedure has been successful.\n\nA Denver-area native, Smith graduated from Wheat Ridge High School and attended the University of Nebraska.\n\nShe joined ESPN in 1997, following eight years at Sports Illustrated.\n\nRatings roulette. Thursday\u2019s opening night coverage of the NFL draft on ESPN and the NFL Network produced more than 8.8 million national viewers, the third-largest figure in draft viewing history.\n\nESPN coverage produced 7.0 million.\n\nSuch figures display the absolute loyalty of NFL fans across the country who watched ongoing scenes of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell giving hugs to draftees. Or was it the other way around?\n\nActually, ESPN and the NFL Network competed in a Hyperbole Bowl with experts on both networks producing grandiose praise for the early draftees. \u201cHe\u2019s the best \u2026\u201d\n\nESPN narrowly won the Hyperbole Bowl, with Mel Kiper Jr. and Jon Gruden unloading compliments to players who haven\u2019t even strapped on NFL helmets.\n\nLongtime Denver journalist Dusty Saunders writes about sports media each Monday in The Denver Post. Contact him at tvtime@comcast.net.\n\n\u201c30 for 30\u201d taking on O.J. Simpson\n\nSeveral online sports broadcasting sources have reported that ESPN is producing a five-hour \u201c30 for 30\u201d documentary on the life of O.J. Simpson.\n\nNo air date has been set. October will mark the 20th anniversary of Simpson\u2019s acquittal on charges of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dusty Saunders: Shelley Smith makes parents proud with ESPN comeback", "title": "Dusty Saunders: Shelley Smith makes parents proud with ESPN comeback", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/03/dusty-saunders-shelley-smith-makes-parents-proud-with-espn-comeback/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-03T19:24:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T10:43:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8936\"", "article_summary": "NFL draft coverage produced parental hugs for most of the 256 players selected.\nESPN coverage produced 7.0 million.\nShelley Smith was in Hawaii, covering the selection of Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota, the second college player picked (Tennessee Titans) during the three-day draft.\nSmith won an Emmy in 1997 for a segment on Magic Johnson during ESPN\u2019s lengthy coverage of AIDS and athletes.\nBut it\u2019s doubtful if any of these parents displayed the pride and joy of Ron and Luanne Smith of Denver."}
