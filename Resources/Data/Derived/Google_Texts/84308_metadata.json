She was miserable.\n\n\u201cIt was very different from everything I expected,\u201d said the second year UC-Davis medical student who came to the U.S. under the country\u2019s political asylum program. \u201cI had this image that the U.S. was more advanced.\u201d\n\nFor the first two years, she hated her small town of Merced. \u201cIn Columbia, I was sheltered,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents had good health insurance, and language was not a barrier. When I came here, my parents depended on me to translate at doctor\u2019s appointments.\u201d And because she was an immigrant taking English-as-a-second-language classes, she said her teachers didn\u2019t champion her or her peers \u2014 most of them from farm worker families \u2014 as college material. She also saw that farm workers lacked access to health care and health education.\n\nBut then she left for college at UC-Davis, and she realized her experiences were not universal; they were unique to an impoverished place. And quite frankly, she was ticked off.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think of California as Los Angeles and the Bay Area,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s this large part of the state that\u2019s extremely poor. Most of what you eat comes from the Central Valley.\u201d\n\nSo she applied to San Joaquin Valley PRIME and now plans to return to the valley as a physician. \u201cI was not born and raised there but I would say my heart is in the Central Valley,\u201d said Valenzuela-Riveros. \u201cA lot of passion and drive came from what I saw when I emigrated.\u201d\n\nPRIME \u2014 Programs in Medical Education \u2014 is a training program at six UC campuses focused on preparing students for health care jobs as clinicians, administrators and policy makers in underserved parts of California.\n\nPRIME Students Form Tight Cohorts\n\nPassion and drive are typical for SJV Prime students. \u201cThey all have some sort of deep connection to the valley, a shared experience centered around a place,\u201d said Tonya Fancher, SJV PRIME associate director for curriculum at UC-Davis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe program is so focused on the geography that it allows for a really unique swath of students.\u201d\n\nTake Maricela Rangel-Garcia, a third-year medical student who grew up in Clovis near Fresno.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived here all my life but to be on this side of seeing patients and learning about my community in a different manner than I\u2019m used to has been a real eye opener for me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what I love about the experience. The people I go to school with, we\u2019re all really dedicated to the Central Valley.\u201d\n\nSJV PRIME is a collaborative effort. UC-Merced and UC-Davis fund the program, and special consideration is given to UC-Merced students. UC-Davis Medical School partners with UC-San Francisco, which has been training medical students in Fresno since the 1970s. The hope is that UC-Merced will eventually open its own medical school.\n\nThe lack of a medical school in the valley is one reason there\u2019s such a large brain drain, said Kenny Banh, site director for UC-Davis clerkships at UCSF-Fresno. To combat this, SJV PRIME students do their third and fourth year rotations with UCSF at Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno. Typically UC-Davis students do their rotations in Davis or Sacramento.\n\n\u201cWith SJV PRIME, not only are kids from here, but they spend the second half of medical school here,\u201d said Banh.\n\nRangel-Garcia is starting her third year and can already see there\u2019s a physician shortage. \u201cPeople wait a long time to see a physician and with the transition [to the Affordable Care Act] people have insurance but no physician to see.\u201d\n\nKeeping Valley Connection During Medical School\n\nOne of the challenges is maintaining that valley connection for the first two years when students are at Davis, said Fancher. One strategy is to have first-year students spend a day working at a no-cost clinic in the valley such as the Tzu Chi clinic in Fresno. The students also attend monthly workshops that cover a variety of topics integral to the SJV PRIME mission of instilling leadership in the valley.\n\nIn addition, students do their clinical requirements for the first two years at Kaiser in Stockton and Modesto. \u201cThat\u2019s the closest we can get and still be able to come back to UC-Davis for classes in the afternoon,\u201d said Fancher.\n\nThe physicians they work with become powerful role models, Fancher added, because they also made the choice to work in the valley. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing we can do until there is a freestanding program in the valley,\u201d she said referring to the possibility of a medical school at UC-Merced.\n\nOverwhelming Needs in the Valley\n\nChristina Thabit, 28, said when she applied to Davis four years ago, SJV PRIME was brand new. \u201cAnd I thought, it\u2019s like me in a nutshell. I just applied to it because it summed up all the reasons why I wanted to go to medical school.\u201d\n\nHer grandparents were dairy farmers in Tulare. \u201cMy grandpa was always into community service; for him it was the Latino community,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t whether you wanted to, it was how you were going to do it, your obligation to give back.\u201d\n\nThabit said it is sometimes overwhelming working at Community. \u201cI feel like every single patient has needs. With every encounter, I could relate their story to why there\u2019s disparity in the valley, whether it\u2019s poverty, not speaking the language or not having an education. Every single story has some element of that.\u201d\n\nThe experience is sometimes bittersweet. Thabit gets to make a difference in in the community she knows and loves, but it\u2019s also sad because she realizes she can only do so much.\n\nRangel-Garcia agrees. Her first rotation was in obstetrics and gynecology. She\u2019s already seen patients delivering pre-term because they\u2019re addicted to methamphetamine, a huge problem in the valley.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of poverty here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m seeing the hardships people face living in poverty, and how it affects people\u2019s health.\u201d She sees a lot of room for growth and change. \u201cOne of our responsibilities in this program is not just being trained, but being advocates for the community, leaders in health care in the valley.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>San Joaquin Valley PRIME, one of six University of California programs recruiting medical students committed to working with underserved populations, focuses on boosting the number of Central Valley physicians. </p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "San Joaquin Valley PRIME, one of six University of California programs recruiting medical students committed to working with underserved populations, focuses on boosting the number of Central Valle\u2026", "title": "UC Program Aims To Increase Number of Health Care Professionals in Central Valley", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/uc-program-aims-to-boost-physician-ranks-in-central-valley/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-08-18T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-18T03:00:00+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd760\"", "article_summary": "PRIME Students Form Tight CohortsPassion and drive are typical for SJV Prime students.\nUC-Davis Medical School partners with UC-San Francisco, which has been training medical students in Fresno since the 1970s.\nMost of what you eat comes from the Central Valley.\u201dSo she applied to San Joaquin Valley PRIME and now plans to return to the valley as a physician.\nOverwhelming Needs in the ValleyChristina Thabit, 28, said when she applied to Davis four years ago, SJV PRIME was brand new.\n\u201cWith SJV PRIME, not only are kids from here, but they spend the second half of medical school here,\u201d said Banh."}
