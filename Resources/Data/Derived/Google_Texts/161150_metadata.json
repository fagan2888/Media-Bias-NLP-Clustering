And more proof that she really meant what she initially said about putting \u201ca lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,\u201d is the fact that she seemed so joyful when saying it.\n\n\u201cShe lied to you. Right to your face when she said that, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Hannity asked.\n\n\u201cIt would seem so, or at least the way I took it, it was,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cBut, you know, she did say that she\u2019s trying to bring clean energy into the coalfields. But the tone that she had when she said we\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and \u2026 and co-operations out of work, really, yes, it just seemed like it was a lot of joy in her voice when she said it,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a friend of the coal industry while at a campaign rally in West Virginia on Thursday, and it seems to have worked. The West Virginia Coal Association later voted to endorse the presumptive GOP nominee.\n\n\u201cTrump has said he will reverse the Democratic regulatory assault that has cost the coal industry more than 40 percent of our production and jobs since 2008,\u201d Bill Raney, the group\u2019s president, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn contrast,Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposals essentially double-down on the job killing Obama policies,\u201d he said. \u201cWest Virginia can\u2019t afford that and neither can the nation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "They aren't buying her non-apology apology. .05/26/2016 18:34:51PM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "They aren't buying her non-apology apology.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Unemployed Coal Miner: Clinton Sounded Joyful When She Attacked Us", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/05/06/unemployed-coal-miner-clinton-sounded-joyful-when-she-attacked-us-n2159028", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/5/6/0.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "They aren't buying her non-apology apology.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Unemployed Coal Miner: Clinton Sounded Joyful When She Attacked Us", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/05/06/unemployed-coal-miner-clinton-sounded-joyful-when-she-attacked-us-n2159028", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/5/6/0.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Unemployed Coal Miner: Clinton Sounded Joyful When She Attacked Us, Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The West Virginia Coal Association later voted to endorse the presumptive GOP nominee.\nAnd more proof that she really meant what she initially said about putting \u201ca lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,\u201d is the fact that she seemed so joyful when saying it.\nTrump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a friend of the coal industry while at a campaign rally in West Virginia on Thursday, and it seems to have worked.\n\u201cWest Virginia can\u2019t afford that and neither can the nation.\u201d\n\u201cTrump has said he will reverse the Democratic regulatory assault that has cost the coal industry more than 40 percent of our production and jobs since 2008,\u201d Bill Raney, the group\u2019s president, said in a statement."}
