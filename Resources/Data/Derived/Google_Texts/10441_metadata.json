The men were operating out of a secret CIA annex.\n\nIn an interview ahead of the release of a new book \u201c13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi,\u201d security contractors Kris Paronto, Mark Geist, and John Tiegen spoke publicly about the attack with Fox News. Four diplomats were killed that night, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stephens.\n\nMr. Paronto said the team was ready to move to the compound within five minutes of hearing news of the attack just after 9:30 p.m., but were held back by the top CIA officer, whom they only refer to as \u201cBob.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt had probably been 15 minutes I think, and \u2026 I just said, \u2018Hey, you know, we gotta \u2013 we need to get over there, we\u2019re losing the initiative,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tiegen said. \u201cAnd Bob just looks straight at me and said, \u2018Stand down, you need to wait.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Paronto said that the security team started to get calls from the State Department employees begging for help, until finally the team defied orders and headed to the consulate nearly 30 minutes later. The team members said they asked their CIA superiors to send air support, which never came.\n\nThe men told Fox News that they believe the outcome would have been much different without the delay.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Stevens and Sean [Smith], yeah, they would still be alive, my gut is yes,\u201d Mr. Paronto said in the interview.\n\nA senior intelligence official insisted in a statement to Fox News that, \u201cThere were no orders to anybody to stand down in providing support.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three members of a U.S. security team in Libya during the Sept. 11, 2012 terror attack on the the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi say they were held back from immediately responding by a top CIA officer.
