The whole country has caught “Powerball Fever,” and Kansas Lottery players are no exception.

Players are turning out in huge numbers in their quest to win a world record Powerball jackpot which has now rolled to an astonishing $1.3 billion for Wednesday’s drawing. The cash option on the prize would be $806 million.

Sally Lunsford, director of public affairs with the Kansas Lottery, said the state set a new sales record in Saturday’s drawing, selling more than $6.767 million worth of Powerball tickets. At the peak of the buying frenzy, which occurred from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday night, players were buying Powerball tickets at the rate of $7,107 per minute.

The January 9 winning numbers were 16-19-32-34-57, Powerball 13, Power Play 3. No ticket matched all numbers.

Although the jackpot eluded Kansas players (and everyone else), there were 134,395 winning Powerball tickets in Kansas Saturday night, which won players $728,132 in prizes, Lunsford said. One ticket sold in northeast Kansas, matched four of the first five numbers and the Powerball to win $50,000.

Amidst the Powerball excitement, one ticket matched all numbers in Super Kansas Cash to win a $565,887 cash jackpot. The winning ticket was sold in north-central Kansas. The winning numbers in the Jan. 9 Super Kansas Cash drawing are 2-5-14-26-27 Cashball 22. The jackpot returns to $100,000 for Monday’s drawing.
