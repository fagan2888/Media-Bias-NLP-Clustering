Now it looks like they only brought their JVs with them this time.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s speech focused on protecting the privacy of everyone from pot smokers and atheists to evangelical Christians from government intrusion into their privacy.\n\n\u201cThe Bill of Rights is not for the prom queen,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe Bill of Rights isn\u2019t for the high school quarterback. The Bill of Rights is for those who are unpopular. The Bill of Rights is for those who want to speak their mind. You can be a minority because of the color of your skin, or the shade of your ideology.\u201d\n\nThe libertarian-leaning Kentucky senator discussed how he filed a class-action lawsuit a year ago this week against President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder over the National Security Agency\u2019s widespread spying on U.S. citizens\u2019 communications that was revealed the summer before by Edward Snowden (or, as Paul mistakenly said, \u201cEric Snowden\u201d).\n\nPaul said he opposed Obama\u2019s nominee to succeed Holder when he retires, Loretta Lynch, over her support for civil asset forfeiture as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. The controversial practice has likely taken millions of dollars from people with minimal or no connection to crimes and is something Holder has recently attempted to reform.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about these issues with college kids, social issues are something that they\u2019re very concerned about,\u201d said Elizabeth Hayes, a 21-year-old senior in political science at the University of Iowa and regional co-chair of YAL who supports Paul. \u201cHowever, fiscal issues really hit home with them \u2026 when you talk about state tuition and Obamacare and how that directly affects them, it really gets them excited to get involved and support Rand.\u201d\n\nPaul is expected to make a decision on whether to run for president this spring. If he does, his father\u2019s popular campaigns in the first-in-the-nation caucus state in 2008 and 2012 could bolster his prospects.\n\nBut others believe the unpopularity in GOP establishment circles of A.J. Spiker, an Ames real estate agent and former state party chairman who supported Ron Paul and now serves as a strategist for his son, could hamper the Kentucky senator\u2019s grassroots outreach.\n\nThat didn\u2019t appear to concern Paul, who told the Ames Tribune after his speech, \u201cMy goal has been, when I\u2019ve been in politics, to really try to unite people, not to divide people. You wouldn\u2019t find me debating the one point we disagree with; I\u2019m trying to find the eight or nine out of 10 points we do agree with.\u201d\n\nKevin Corbett, an independent-minded, 27-year-old senior in finance at ISU who didn\u2019t see eye-to-eye with Paul on a question he asked him about student loan interest forgiveness, liked that consensus-building attitude.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many issues that are equally important or have greater importance than this, and I feel like I agree with him on those,\u201d Corbett said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. senator and prospective presidential candidate Rand Paul, R-Ky., visited Ames Saturday to catch the first half of the Iowa State men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s 75-38 rout of Texas Tech before swinging over to the Scheman Building to make a civil liberties-focused pitch to college students attending a watch party.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Gavin Aronsen Staff Writer garonsen@amestrib.com", "og": {"site_name": "Ames Tribune", "description": "U.S. senator and prospective presidential candidate Rand Paul, R-Ky., visited Ames Saturday to catch the first half of the Iowa State men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s 75-38 rout of Texas Tech before swinging over to the Scheman Building to make a civil liberties-focused pitch to college students attending a watch party.", "title": "Rand Paul touts civil liberties, catches Cyclones\u2019 rout of Red Raiders in Ames", "url": "http://amestrib.com/news/rand-paul-touts-civil-liberties-catches-cyclones-rout-red-raiders-ames", "image": "http://amestrib.com/sites/amestrib.com/files/field/media/web1__Z3A0314--1-WEB_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://amestrib.com/news/rand-paul-touts-civil-liberties-catches-cyclones-rout-red-raiders-ames", "image": {"src": "http://amestrib.com/sites/amestrib.com/files/field/media/web1__Z3A0314--1-WEB_1.jpg"}, "title": "Rand Paul touts civil liberties, catches Cyclones\u2019 rout of Red Raiders in Ames", "description": "U.S. senator and prospective presidential candidate Rand Paul, R-Ky., visited Ames Saturday to catch the first half of the Iowa State men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s 75-38 rout of Texas Tech before swinging over to the Scheman Building to make a civil liberties-focused pitch to college students attending a watch party.", "creator": "@AmesTribNews"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "ames-tribune://?eid=1036581", "app_name": "ames-tribune", "package": "com.stephensmedia.amestribune"}, "ios": {"url": "ames-tribune://?eid=1036581", "app_store_id": 552175169, "app_name": "ames-tribune"}}, "keywords": "News,Ames and Story County,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-07T22:56:53-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think I\u2019m bringing them good luck,\u201d Paul joked, referring to the Cyclones\u2019 shock loss to the Red Raiders Jan. 24.\n\u201cThe Bill of Rights is not for the prom queen,\u201d Paul said.\nIf he does, his father\u2019s popular campaigns in the first-in-the-nation caucus state in 2008 and 2012 could bolster his prospects.\nThe Bill of Rights is for those who want to speak their mind.\n\u201cThe Bill of Rights isn\u2019t for the high school quarterback."}
