Perrone thus exaggerates the number of deaths and blames them on marijuana through post hoc, ergo propter hoc reasoning. This in an essay about \"the junk 'science' behind the marijuana legalization movement,\" written by the chief science officer at an organization called the Center for Accountability in Science. I guess if you say \"science\" enough, you needn't worry about being scientific.\n\nThe day after Perrone's essay appeared, Ron Schwerzler, an opponent of Oregon's legalization initiative, claimed at a debate that \"there have been five infant children deaths in Colorado that have picked up those drugs,\" referring to marijuana edibles. The actual number, as Schwerzler was forced to admit the following day, is zero. \"I really need to retract that statement because I can't back it up,\" he said. Like Perrone, Schwerzler is a man of science: director of medical services at an addiction treatment center in Eugene.\n\n[Thanks to Judith Posch for the Oregonian link.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "In a Washington Post&nbsp;commentary published on Monday, Joseph Perrone claims \"a handful of&nbsp;deaths&nbsp;in Denver were tied to edible marijuana", "title": "Pot Prohibitionists Invent Marijuana Deaths, Scientifically", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/10/24/pot-prohibitionists-invent-marijuana-dea", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jsullum/2014_10/Joe-Perrone.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a Washington Post&nbsp;commentary\npublished on Monday, Joseph Perrone claims \"a handful\nof&nbsp;deaths&nbsp;in Denver were tied to edible marijuana use\nthis year.\" That's true, if by \"handful\" you mean \ntwo and if by \"tied\" you mean attributed by pot\nprohibitionists.", "title": "Pot Prohibitionists Invent Marijuana Deaths, Scientifically", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jsullum/2014_10/ron_schwerzler.jpg", "creator": "@jacobsullum", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "War on Drugs", "published_time": "2014-10-24T21:54:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/jacob-sullum"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda51a\"", "article_summary": "Perrone thus exaggerates the number of deaths and blames them on marijuana through post hoc, ergo propter hoc reasoning.\nLike Perrone, Schwerzler is a man of science: director of medical services at an addiction treatment center in Eugene.\nThat's true, if by \"handful\" you mean two and if by \"tied\" you mean attributed by pot prohibitionists.\nIn a Washington Post commentary published on Monday, Joseph Perrone claims \"a handful of deaths in Denver were tied to edible marijuana use this year.\"\nThis in an essay about \"the junk 'science' behind the marijuana legalization movement,\" written by the chief science officer at an organization called the Center for Accountability in Science."}
