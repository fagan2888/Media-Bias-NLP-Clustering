This is also known as Shigellosis, and it\u2019s a painful intestinal infection that causes diarrhea with blood or mucus, as well as fever and abdominal pain. So the worst stomach bug you\u2019ve ever had.\n\nBetween May 2014 and February 2015, the CDC identified 157 cases of S. sonnei in 32 states and Puerto Rico, half of which were associated with international travel. In addition to these cases, the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) identified 95 cases of the same drug-resistant strain to bring the grand total of cases to 243; 74 of these cases were among people who were homeless or living in a single-room occupancy hotel. Massachusetts, California, and Pennsylvania also reported clusters of cases.\n\nThe bacterial infection can be resolved without treatment, but patients with mild illness are often treated with an antimicrobial medication called Ciproflaxin in order to reduce their symptoms. But when patients are repeatedly exposed to this antibiotic, the bacteria become resistant. Resistant bacteria will either mutate or take on new genes entirely, which is why antibiotics can\u2019t kill or inhibit their growth. In which case, the CDC calls for clinicians to only prescribe antibiotics to patients with poor immune systems and/or other underlying illnesses.\n\n\u201cDrug-resistant infections are harder to treat and because Shigella spreads so easily between people, the potential for more \u2014 and larger \u2014 outbreaks is a real concern,\u201d Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re moving quickly to implement a national strategy to curb antibiotic resistance because we can\u2019t take for granted that we\u2019ll always have the drugs we need to fight common infections.\u201d\n\nShigella is mostly transmitted through contaminated food and water; people who handle food are believed to be primary transmitters.\n\n\"When hand washing isn\u2019t practiced perfectly, germs can be transferred from one person\u2019s hands to the next, into that person\u2019s food, or into the food that person prepares for others,\" Dr. Anna Bowen, a CDC medical epidemiologist and lead author of the present report, told U.S News & World Report.\n\nAlthough Bowen did add \u201cit is possible for the bacteria to spread in health care facilities if there are lapses in hygiene,\u201d transmissions mostly occur in less established settings, such as childcare centers and among the homeless (as was the case in San Francisco).\n\nThe CDC emphasized hygiene promotion and increased access to hygiene and sanitation infrastructure will prevent a larger outbreak. Health care providers should culture stool samples of patients with symptoms consistent with Shigella, and reculture patients who do not improve after being prescribed antibiotics.\n\nSource: Bowen A, et al.
