Officials have confirmed that the victim of the early morning accident on Dixie Highway at Greenwood Road is 26-year-old Shelley Ann Hurt, according to a report from WHAS11.com.

Hurt was a passenger in a silver Crown Victoria that was struck when it turned left into an on-coming black Pontiac Bonneville.

The driver of the Victoria, an unidentified male, was taken to University Hospital with injuries of an unknown severity. Those riding in the Bonneville, two men and one woman, were all transported to University Hospital with what are believed to be non life-threatening injuries.
