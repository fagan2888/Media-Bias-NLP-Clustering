It can be easy to overlook mental health issues in children, but it\u2019s crucial to pay attention to them; mental illness in childhood can have lasting effects on social, financial, and emotional health later on.\n\nA new study published in Pediatrics examines mental health in children \u2014 and how they\u2019re getting treated for it. Interestingly enough, while adults are typically referred to therapists or psychiatrists for mental health needs, the study argues that pediatricians and primary care physicians are good starting points to care for a child\u2019s mental health needs.\n\nSome 35 percent of kids receiving mental health care had appointments only with their primary care physicians, the study found. 26 percent saw only psychiatrists, and 15 percent saw only psychologists or social workers. The results of the study indicate that most parents are turning to their child\u2019s pediatrician to offer help when it comes to mental health issues like attention deficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or anxiety disorders \u2014 and this is why the pediatrician\u2019s role is so important.\n\nThe researchers examined data from 43,000 children in the U.S. aged 2-21 years between 2008 and 2011. Some 1,800 of these kids had a mental health problem, and out of that number, the majority were diagnosed with ADHD or anxiety disorders. About one in 10 kids in the U.S. have a mental health condition, and there simply aren\u2019t enough child psychiatrists to treat them all, the researchers found.\n\n\u201cThere just aren\u2019t enough child psychiatrists in the United States to treat every child with a mental health condition,\u201d Van Cleave told HealthDay. \u201cGiven that, any efforts to improve the quality of mental health care for children would be wise or appropriate to focus on improvements in primary health care, since that is where a lot of that care is happening.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s especially true for kids with ADHD. The study found that 42 percent of children with ADHD were treated by their primary care providers, rather than psychiatrists or mental health providers.\n\n\u201cThis finding likely reflects the fact that the American Academy of Pediatrics has urged primary care pediatricians to take an active role in the treatment of ADHD, and that clinical guidelines for pediatricians recommend that medication should be considered a first-line treatment for all youth with ADHD that are 6 years of age and older,\u201d Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center of New York, told HealthDay.\n\nWhile it may not seem as though primary care physicians are best suited for mental health needs, the reality is if they certainly can be. The American Academy of Pediatrics lists guidelines for ADHD, teen depression, and anxiety, and many pediatricians feel comfortable handling them.\n\n\u201cPrimary care physicians provide a good home for children\u2019s mental health conditions,\u201d Van Cleave told LiveScience.\n\nOn a larger level, primary care physicians for adults should also feel more comfortable tending to patients\u2019 mental health needs \u2014 at least initially \u2014 as many physical conditions are impacted by stress, depression, and anxiety. Integrating preventive care into the healthcare system will also require focusing more on patients' mental health when they visit their primary care doctors, rather than waving them away to be prescribed medications by psychiatrists.\n\nSource: Van Cleave J, Wolraich M, et al.
