Two of his favorite political topics are President Barack Obama and a presidential bid for The Celebrity Apprentice host himself. He shared an assessment of the last presidential election.\n\n\u201cI would have won the race against Obama.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Des Moines Register, Trump said frontrunners Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney will lose.\n\nTrump said he regrets his decision not to run in 2012.\n\n\u201cI was leading in every poll\u2026 I regret that I didn\u2019t stay in. I would\u2019ve won the race against [President Barack] Obama. He would\u2019ve been easy. Hillary [Clinton] is tougher to beat than Obama, but Hillary is very beatable.\u201d\n\nHe was frank in sharing thoughts on Romney, and told a crowd of Midwest realtors and farmers.\n\n\u201cHe choked. It\u2019s like a golfer who can\u2019t seek the three foot put on the last hole.\u201d\n\nTrump added that Romney should be disqualified from running, and the \u201c47 percent\u201d comment was a \u201cbad comment that\u2019s not going away.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t go any easier on Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\u201cFrankly, we\u2019ve had enough of the Bushes. We\u2019re bushed out.\u201d\n\nBush is trying to raise $15 million before he runs, but Trump has the solution.\n\n\u201cIf I do it, I\u2019ll be self-funding so that solves the problem, which is nice.\u201d\n\nTrump said he likes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, but acknowledged as a candidate, Christie has some challenges.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got some difficulties. I like him\u2026 but we\u2019ve going to have to see whether or not he runs.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump said he\u2019ll make a decision on whether he should run in 2016 soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early for me to say. I may make a decision to run before June. But I\u2019m strongly inclined to do so.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has talked about a bid for the White House, but he\u2019s never become a candidate. He considered running as an Independent in 2000. He also alluded to running in 2008 and 2012.\n\nTwo reasons he gave for not running last time were development projects and his reality TV show, The Celebrity Apprentice. But he said the 2011 contract ends after this season, and he hasn\u2019t and won\u2019t renew it.\n\nTrump is one of the many Republicans who participated in the Iowa Freedom Summit, organized by Iowa Rep. Steve King. He allowed an interviewer to pull his famous hair.\n\n\u201cIt is my hair. If it wasn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t be on right.\u201d\n\nTrump explained the desire to run for president to a crowd of over 500.\n\n\u201cI basically want to see America be great again.\u201d\n\n[Image: Inquisitr]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump is talking politics once again.
