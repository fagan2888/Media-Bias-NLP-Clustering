But not all uses of technology, which then go on to receive publication in open-access journals, are necessarily novel. Recently, scientists from Harvard earned many an onlooker\u2019s accolades for their apparent success with telepathy, though \u201cearned\u201d and \u201ctelepathy may both be questionable.\n\nThe meat of the story is that researchers hooked up one set of subjects in India with a brain-reading EEG and another in France with a cap that emitted transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a technique for probing the brain, which has been used in mostly its final form since 1985. While the specific robot used in the experiment, one which the researchers disclose they have a financial interest in promoting, may be elaborate, the findings aren\u2019t all that exciting.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: Researchers used EEG over the sender\u2019s motor cortex to read his brain activity as he imagined moving his feet and hands. Movement of the hands indicated a \u201c1\u201d and the feet a \u201c0,\u201d and the team used these digits to encode the messages they wanted to send \u2014 in this case, \u201chola\u201d and \u201cciao.\u201d The user spelled out the word using his thoughts, a method currently in use at several labs, and the computer then sent the message over email to the recipients in France.\n\nEach recipient in France was outfitted with a cap that emitted TMS, which the researchers used to produce phosphenes in the subjects\u2019 field of vision. Phosphenes are those \u201cstars\u201d you see when you rub your closed eyes. The presence or absence of each phosphene determined whether the subjects reported a \u201c1\u201d or a \u201c0.\u201d After each digit was in place, the message translated back into regular text. Telepathy had been achieved. But not really.\n\nThe sender's system on the left is shown transferring a packet of ones and zeroes to the recipient on the right, who decodes it with transcranial magnetic stimulation. PLOS ONE. PLOS ONE\n\nAs a proof of concept for the utility of the TMS arm, the study may hit its mark. But the overall clinical significance is mostly absent. Consider the EEG\u2019s ability to pick up the sender\u2019s motor imagery and relay it to a computer. In order for the technique to merit use in a lab, let alone a doctors\u2019 office, the EEG needs to have speed on its side. This means a fast transfer rate between the time the subject thinks about moving his hands and feet to the time a message is produced. In prior research, scientists have achieved 84.7 bits per minute. The latest study topped out at three bits per minute.\n\nMuch of the same technology was used last year in a University of Washington study that used two players working together to solve a task, which, in this case, was a computer game. \"Unlike our original system, which is a synchronous brain-to-brain interface where each person is interacting live with the other,\" UW researcher Dr. Andrea Stocco told Medical Daily, \"their system is asynchronous and one-way \u2014 it uses email to send EEG signals.\"\n\nIf anything can be gleaned from the study, it won\u2019t be a future of mind-controled messages relayed around the globe. Being a buzzkill is unpopular, but the science of sending mind-controled messages still resides in the realm of fiction. In the meantime, the study may be a solid lesson in the incentives that lead to the curation of technology, rather than the creation of it.\n\n\u201cAuthors affiliated to Starlab or Neuroelectrics have a commercial interest in promoting the EEG/brain-stimulation system described in the paper (Starstim),\u201d the paper reads. \u201cAuthors affiliated to Axilum Robotics have an interest in promoting their robot to automate the positioning of a transcranial magnetic stimulation coil.\u201d\n\nSource: Grau C, Ginhoux R, Riera A, et al.
