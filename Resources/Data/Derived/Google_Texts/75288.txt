NORRISTOWN, Pa. (CBS) — With less than a week to go before the deadline to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, volunteers fanned out today across Norristown, knocking on doors, reminding people to get registered.

More than four million people have already signed up through healthcare.gov, including more than 150,000 in Pennsylvania. But officials with Organizing For Action say there are plenty more out there who are eligible.

Anna Cordella, 64, of Norristown, says she’s a happy customer, securing what she says is an affordable policy after losing her job and then seeing her “COBRA” insurance run out.

“Thanks to the Affordable Care Act I can buy insurance,” she said today, “and this insurance is my freedom for the next six months until I start Medicare at 65.”

Holding up her Blue Cross insurance card (top photo), she said this is the first time she didn’t have to rely on someone else for her health insurance.

The Congressional Budget Office had projected six million signups by the March 31st deadline.
