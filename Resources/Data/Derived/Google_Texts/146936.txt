Sioux Falls, SD

Larry Pressler plans to work with a group that endorsed him in his unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate.



He accepted an invitation to join the founder's circle of the Centrist Project, which supports politically moderate candidates and ideas. He'll be a volunteer part-time council member.



Pressler served as a Republican for two terms in the House followed by three Senate terms from 1975 to 1997. He ran this year as an independent but lost to Republican Mike Rounds.



He's living in Sioux Falls and says he's chipping away at the $250,000 in debt he acquired in the Senate race.



Pressler says he'll also continue teaching at South Dakota colleges and serving on the board of the Jericho Project Veterans Advisory Council for homeless veterans.
