(Photo: Kenny Read/For the Enquirer)\n\nKALAMAZOO \u2014 U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz hit all the conservative talking points during a campaign rally Monday, and the crowd loved it.\n\nFrom lofty promises of repealing the Affordable Care Act to taking on the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency, Cruz slammed the Obama Administration and said there would be change on his first day in office.\n\nThe 44-year-old Texan \u2014 who walked out to \u201cWhere the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly\u201d by Aaron Tippin \u2014 got standing ovations from some 800 supporters throughout his speech during a rally at Wings Event Center in Kalamazoo.\n\n\u201cThe single biggest difference between me and the other very fine men and women standing on that debate stage,\u201d Cruz said, \u201cis that with me, when I tell you I\u2019m going to do something, I\u2019m going to do exactly what I say.\u201d\n\nCruz said as president he would rescind President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cillegal and unconstitutional\u201d executive orders, instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and \u201crip to shreds\u201d Obama\u2019s deal with Iran on nuclear weapons.\n\nIran having nuclear weapons is \u201cthe single biggest threat facing America today,\u201d Cruz said, and would make the Obama Administration \u201cquite literally, the world\u2019s leading financier of radical Islamic terrorists.\u201d\n\nCruz called for the end of sanctuary cities and securing U.S. borders. He used a joke he previously tried while speaking at the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference last month \u2014 that he would abolish the Internal Revenue Service, and send its 90,000 employees to protect the border.\n\nCruz also said bringing Syrian refugees to the U.S. is \u201cnothing short of crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a reason the director of national intelligence says among those refugees are no doubt a significant number of ISIS terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be the height of foolishness to bring in tens of thousands of people, including jihadists, that are coming here to murder innocent Americans.\u201d\n\nCruz announced his presidential run in March. He was first elected to the Senate in 2012 and led a 21-hour filibuster on the Senate floor in 2013 in an attempt to block the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAt the rally, Cruz touted his campaign fundraising despite the lack of support from what he called \u201cWashington elites.\u201d He said he raised the most \u201chard money\u201d among the candidates, according to recent filings. Cruz\u2019s campaign raised more than $14.3 million in a three-month period.\n\nPolls show Cruz in the middle of the pack of 14 Republican presidential candidates. The most recent Pew Research poll gave Cruz 6 percent of the vote, compared to 25 percent for Donald Trump and 16 percent for Ben Carson.\n\nWith the help of free tickets, Belding residents Brian and Tami McNee traveled to Kalamazoo to help narrow down their favorites from the large pool of Republican candidates. They\u2019re already fans of Cruz, saying he\u2019s a \u201cChristian family man,\u201d but wanted to learn more.\n\n\u201cStrange things don\u2019t come out of his mouth like some of the other people, if you know what I mean,\u201d Brian McNee said with a wink.\n\nThe rally was held in The Cube, a secondary ice rink at the three-rink Wings Event Center.\n\nAbout 30 students from Kalamazoo Central High School attended the rally on a field trip for their comparative government class. Many of them are underage, they said, but will be able to vote by the primary election.\n\nChristopher Tyson, 17, said Cruz was clearly gearing his message toward those who already supported him. But he had doubts Cruz could get the support of Congress to achieve some of his plans.\n\nTyson and his classmates took photos with Cruz after the rally, smiling and holding posters they received for attending.\n\nWhen asked if they would vote for Cruz, they were less enthusiastic. With slight smirks, they shyly shook their heads and said, \u201cno.\u201d\n\nContact Jennifer Bowman at 269-966-0589 or jbowman@battlecreekenquirer.com.
