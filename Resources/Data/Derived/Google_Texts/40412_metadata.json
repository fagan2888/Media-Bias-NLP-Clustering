Pressed on the administration\u2019s tortured effort to avoid the I-word when talking about attacks by Islamist militants, Earnest offered a long disquisition as to why. But the core reason seemed to be that since the Islamists\u2019 conduct did not comport with Islamic values, the militants did not qualify for membership: As Earnest put it, it stems for a desire for \u201caccuracy.\u201d This hearkens to President Obama\u2019s claim this summer that the Islamic State is not Islamic because its conduct doesn\u2019t reflect the values of the faith and not really a state, either. Okay. Or, reaching back to the beginning of what was then known as the Arab Spring, when a top administration official claimed the Muslim Brotherhood was \u201ca largely secular\u201d organization. Or the claim this week from a State Department spokeswoman who said that talking about Islamist extremism might improperly minimize the threat from other forms of violent ideological extremism. Like which ones? Well\u2026\n\n\n\nThe president and his team seem to have lashed themselves to the idea that somehow non-Muslim politicians in the West have some say in defining the Pillars of Islam. Facing increasing press criticism for tortured and obfuscatory language, however, the armchair theologians of the White House are spending a lot of time explaining their view of the faith. This stubbornness is interfering with the effort to explain the administration\u2019s policy to a skeptical public and rally support for the president\u2019s plan (whatever that may be).\n\n\n\nSekulow: Legal semantics blunt sane strategy - Fox News Opinion: Pointing to the deadly threat posed by Western jihadists carrying out attacks on the homeland, Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice writes that it\u2019s time to strip U.S. citizenship from those who enlist in militant groups: \u201cThe law currently provides that Americans can lose citizenship when they enter or serve in the armed forces of an enemy foreign state. But ISIS and al Qaeda are not \u201cforeign states,\u201d so the law doesn\u2019t apply\u2026.stripping citizenship and revoking passports represent just two small steps \u2013 but critical ones \u2013 towards a sane national security strategy. However, it\u2019s difficult to take even these small steps with the Obama Administration steadfastly refuses to name our enemies (Mr. President, our enemies are Islamic radicals, not generic \u201cextremists\u201d), accurately describe their ideology (no, they are not \u201cnihilists\u201d), or even to acknowledge their obvious, widespread appeal in the Muslim world.\u201d\n\nHOUSE VOTE TO BLOCK OBAMA IMMIGRATION MOVES EXPECTED TODAY\n\nThe House is poised to vote today to block President Obama\u2019s immigration executive actions granting temporary amnesty to illegal immigrants, despite a White House veto threat. Fox News: \u201cThe House began debate Tuesday night on a Department of Homeland Security spending bill which Republicans want to use to defund and undo the president\u2019s immigration plans\u2026. \u2018We\u2019re voting to block the president\u2019s overreach, his executive overreach, which I believe is beyond his constitutional duty and frankly violates the Constitution itself,\u2019 House Speaker John Boehner said. \u2018This is not about the issue of immigration. What it is about is the president acting lawlessly.\u2019\u2026But House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md.,\u2026called Republicans\u2019 approach \u2018indefensible\u2019 and \u2018irresponsible.\u2019 Democrats, and even some Republicans, warn that the effort to wage the immigration fight during debate over a DHS spending bill risks vital security funding \u2013 at a time when the department is ramping up security measures in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Current DHS funding expires at the end of February\u201d\n\n\n\nKeep it simple - WashEx\u2019s Byron York wrote recently that unless Republicans lawmakers bill to block President Obama\u2019s immigration actions is simple and direct they risk failure: \u201cRepublicans have two basic options, and as the time to act nears, it appears they are preparing to choose the one more likely to fail. The first option is to pass a brief, simple bill that denies funding for the implementation of Obama\u2019s action\u2026Such a move would be direct, unambiguous, and would focus specifically on Obama's action, which is what the controversy is about in the first place. The second option is to begin with a defunding measure but then add other provisions, targeting not just Obama\u2019s executive action but also a large chunk of the president\u2019s immigration policy going back five years\u2026.In answering the president's overreach on immigration, Capitol Hill Republicans are engaging in some overreach of their own.\u201d\n\nOBAMA TO USE PEN TO IMPOSE NEW METHANE REGS\n\nNYT: \u201cIn President Obama\u2019s latest move using executive authority to tackle climate change, administration officials will announce plans this week to impose new regulations on the oil and gas industry\u2019s emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, according to a person familiar with Mr. Obama\u2019s plans. The administration\u2019s goal is to cut methane emissions from oil and gas production by up to 45 percent by 2025 from the levels recorded in 2012. The Environmental Protection Agency will issue the proposed regulations this summer, and final regulations by 2016, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the administration had asked the person not to speak about the plan\u2026.Environmental advocates have long urged the Obama administration to target methane emissions, and the rules would be the first to do so\u2026.The oil and gas industry has pushed back against methane regulations, insisting that new rules could stymie a booming industry and that voluntary industrywide standards are sufficient to prevent methane leaks\u2026.The new rules are part of Mr. Obama\u2019s push for regulations designed to cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases from different sectors of the economy. The White House says it can make the moves under the Clean Air Act, rather than by trying to push legislation through the Republican-controlled congress.\u201d\n\n\n\nIs climate change real? Senate to put it to a vote - The Hill: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday he will allow the Senate to vote on an amendment asking if they agree that climate change is impacting the planet. At his weekly press briefing, McConnell said \u2018nobody is blocking any amendments\u2019 to legislation that would approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline\u2026.But a measure proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had raised questions about whether he would stick to that commitment. The Sanders measure asks whether lawmakers agree with the overwhelming consensus of scientists who say climate change is impacting the planet and is worsened by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Democrats believe the measure could be a tough vote for some Republicans, particularly GOP senators running for reelection in 2016 in states carried by President Obama in 2012\u2026.Sanders's amendment is one of many Democrats are looking to tack on to the controversial bill, which Republicans are eager to send to President Obama\u2019s desk. The White House has threatened to veto the Keystone legislation.\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nLudwig van Beethoven relied in part on the beats of his heart to continue to compose masterpieces after he lost his hearing. Now, some researchers argue that some of the irregularities in his music may directly correspond with cardiac arrhythmia. Co-author Joel Howell, M.D., Ph.D, says, \u201cWhen your heart beats irregularly from heart disease, it does so in some predictable patterns. We think we hear some of those same patterns in his music.\u201d Cardiologist Dr. Zachary Goldberger says that while Beethoven was linked to a variety of illnesses nothing could be diagnostically proven at the time, \u201cHowever, the symptoms and common association of an abnormal heartbeat with so many diseases makes it a reasonable assumption that Beethoven experienced arrhythmia \u2013 and the works we describe may be \u2018musical electrocardiograms,\u2019\u2026While these musical arrhythmias may simply manifest Beethoven\u2019s genius, there is a possibility that in certain pieces his beating heart could literally be at the heart of some of the greatest masterpieces of all time.\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

VISIT\n\nLouisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: \u201cAbout to embark on a three-state trip that includes multiple stops in New Hampshire, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is criticizing Mitt Romney as too liberal for the Republican Party in 2016. Romney, the 2012 GOP standard-bearer whom Paul endorsed, has signaled a sudden interest in making a third bid for the White House. But Paul, a likely 2016 rival, told [Fox News Radio host John Gibson] that Romney's promise to be a \u2018conservative alternative\u2019 to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush won't wash and the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s time has passed\u2026\u2018Look, I like Governor Romney, I like him personally, I think he is a good person, I think he was a great businessman,\u2019 Paul said. \u2018But you know that\u2019s yesterday\u2019s news.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s tried twice - I don\u2019t really think that there is a third time out there,\u2019 the Kentucky lawmaker said. \u2018I think he did a lot of things right, but in the end you got to have a bigger constituency, you got to get new people, you got to attract new people to win and I think it\u2019s time that probably the party is going to be looking for something fresh and new.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nTo Nevada this week - KNPR: \u201cKentucky Sen. Rand Paul is scheduled to visit Nevada this week as he gears up for a possible presidential bid in 2016. The Republican lawmaker is planning to visit Las Vegas on Friday evening and Saturday morning, although campaign staffers haven't provided his itinerary for that stop.\u201d\n\n\n\nPicks campaign manager - WaPo: \u201cSen. Rand Paul on Tuesday announced the hiring of a campaign manager for his likely 2016 presidential bid, part of an aggressive effort to build a national political team as the race for the White House heats up. The hiring of strategist Chip Englander, who recently guided a gubernatorial candidate to victory in Illinois, marks a clear step forward for the Kentucky Republican as he prepares to transform his cadre of loyalists into a full-scale campaign.\u201d\n\n\n\nMITT BOOSTER CHAFFETZ ON JEB: \u2018BEEN THERE, DONE THAT\u2019\n\nWaPo: \u201c\u2018Regardless of what Mitt Romney does, I don\u2019t know how excited anybody could be with Jeb Bush\u2019s candidacy,\u2019 said [Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah], the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. \u2018I\u2019ll support the nominee, and if Bush gets the nomination I\u2019ll support him. But I want to win the White House and I don\u2019t like the idea of another Bush-Clinton race. Been there, done that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n[In a Gravis/Townhall poll, Mitt Romney leads in Iowa with 21 percent, former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., follows at 14 percent.]\n\n\n\nJeb sets March speech in Ohio - Columbus [Ohio] Dispatch: \u201cFormer Florida Gov. and possible 2016 presidential candidate Jeb Bush will be the keynote speaker at the Ohio Chamber of Commerce's 2015 annual meeting\u2026\n\n\n\nWALKER LOOKS TO BENEFIT FROM MITT-JEB SHOWDOWN\n\nDavid Drucker reports: \u201cPerhaps no one is smiling more about Mitt Romney\u2019s entrance into the presidential sweepstakes than Gov. Scott Walker [R-Wis.]. The Wisconsin Republican plans to enter the 2016 contest by mid summer, and Team Walker calculates that a competition between Romney and Jeb Bush for cash and endorsements slows the former Florida governor\u2019s momentum, providing Walker with more room to maneuver. Walker\u2019s supporters also believe that he holds a key advantage over other Republican candidates, particularly the governors.\u201d\n\n\n\nRUBIO: \u2018WE\u2019RE GETTING CLOSE\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat I need to decide and it\u2019s the last decision I need to make is at this time in my life and at this time in my career where is the best place for me to achieve it. Is it in the Republican majority in the Senate or running for president and if I decide it\u2019s running for president, then that\u2019s what I'll do\u2026We need to do it soon enough so we can mount a credible campaign and so we\u2019re getting close.\u201d --Sen.

TODAY\n\nThe Charleston [S.C.] Post and Courier: \u201cPresidential contender and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will take part in Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s inauguration today\u2026Christie will also take part in a private meet-and-greet tied to his potential run for president, to be held in the office of Columbia attorney Leighton Lord of the firm Nexsen Pruet\u2026Lord said he was inviting a number of people interested in meeting Christie ahead of a possible run for the White House.\u201d\n\n\n\nHILLARY HIRES BUT STILL DUCKS DECLARATION\n\nWaPo: \u201cHillary Rodham Clinton is building out the senior leadership team for her likely 2016 presidential campaign, enlisting Joel Benenson as her chief strategist and pollster and Jim Margolis as her media adviser, Democrats familiar with the moves said Tuesday\u2026Benenson, who is based in New York, served as the lead pollster on [President Obama\u2019s] campaigns, but is poised to take on a broader portfolio for Clinton as her chief strategist, the role David Axelrod played for Obama\u2026Margolis is a longtime political adviser to Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid [D-Nev.] and has worked on the campaigns of many Senate Democrats.\u201d\n\n\n\nPodesta timeline - WSJ:\u201cJohn Podesta, a top White House adviser, will take on a senior advisory role in Hillary Clinton\u2019s emerging presidential bid after he leaves the administration in February, three people familiar with the matter said. The move is one of the most definitive signs yet that Mrs. Clinton is building the apparatus to launch a 2016 campaign.\u201d\n\n\n\nWARREN GIVES DEFINITIVE \u2018NO\u2019 ON PRESIDENTIAL RUN\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., gave what may have been her most categorical rejection of a 2016 run in an interview with former FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair for Fortune. Warren, who has previously favored a present-tense evasion, saying she is \u201cnot running\u201d for president, was direct with her former colleague. Blair asked, \u201cSo are you going to run for President?\u201d Warren offered a one-word answer: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut draft effort kicks into higher gear - AP: \u201c[Liberal] activists hoping to draft Sen.

Ben Sasse came to the senate with a unique resume on the number one issue for many in his party: A way to replace ObamaCare. Sasse, a former top Bush administration health insurance official, tells Power Play host Chris Stirewalt about the plan to replace the law and how Washington can restore enough trust with voters to tackle the topic. WATCH HERE.\n\n\n\nSTEYER \u2018WILL DECIDE SOON\u2019 ON SENATE RUN\n\nThe Hill: \u201cBillionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer said Tuesday that he is close to deciding on whether to run for Senate in 2016. Steyer did not say whether he would run for the seat Sen. Barbara Boxer [D-Calif.] is leaving, nor which way he is leaning. \u2018Holding office is a sacred trust in our society, and I am honored that so many colleagues and friends have encouraged me to consider entering this race,\u2019 Steyer wrote Tuesday in the Huffington Post. \u2018California Democrats are blessed to have a deep bench of talent, and I will decide soon based on what I think is the best way to continue the hard work we have already started together to prevent climate disaster and preserve American prosperity.\u2019 Shortly after Boxer announced her intention to retire from the Senate in two years, a close ally of Steyer said he was considering running, and was reaching out to fellow Democrats in an effort to gauge their interest.\u201d\n\n\n\nDELICIOUS BOOTLEGGING SURE TO ENSUE\n\nReuters reports that frugal Swiss residents will have to look for other ways to keep their cheap pizza delivery. The strong Swiss franc has residents crossing the border into Germany and France looking for deals. Swiss customs officials removed an exception that allowed food delivery including pizza to cross the border without having to pass through customs. That rule previously prompted businesses to offer deals targeted at the Swiss customers. The Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Hochrhein-Bodensee, a region of Germany that shares a Swiss border, had been lobbying for the exception to be reinstated for pizza deliveries. Officials have ruled against granting such waiver for now. \u201cIHK Hochrhein-Bodensee is disappointed with this information and will, in the interests of our member companies, continue to work to find a solution,\u201d the industry body\u2019s Chief Executive Uwe Boehm said.\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
