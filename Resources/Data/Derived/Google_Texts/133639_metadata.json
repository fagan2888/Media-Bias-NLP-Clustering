ACAP estimates that, between 1993 and 2012, inpatient hospital stays tied to opioid use increased by about 150 percent across the nation. And one 2011 study estimated a cost of about $25 billion to the health care system in 2007 stemming from opioid abuse.\n\nAs such, ACAP \u2014 which represents about 60 safety-net health plans in 24 states \u2014 gathered a handful of its members to come up with ways that payers can help the delivery system trim those costs and cut down on unneeded ED visits. CEO Margaret Murray says it\u2019s critical that hospitals work closely with their payers to help get a full picture of patients\u2019 treatment.\n\n\u201cHospitals have just one slice of the view of the beneficiary, but they don\u2019t know what drugs the person is getting from other providers,\u201d Murray says. \u201cThey might know that they\u2019re in their emergency room because of overdoses or because of drug-seeking behavior, but they won\u2019t know what\u2019s happening down the street when the person is going to the other hospital or other providers, and that\u2019s where the plan comes in because they\u2019re able to see across the spectrum.\u201d\n\nSolutions identified by the ACAP members were gathered in an April 2015 report, and included everything from locking patients into one pharmacy provider to keep them from bouncing between locations looking for drugs, to having plan-employed health navigators reach out to primary care doctors when their patients visits an unaffiliated ED.\n\nOne ACAP member, Children\u2019s Community Health Plan, in Wisconsin, has had ongoing issues with mothers getting hooked on opioids while pregnant, and then giving birth to babies with neonatal abstinence syndrome, in which the baby is also addicted. Kenneth Schellhase, M.D., medical director of the health plan, estimates that his staff sees about 10 to 15 such cases a month \u2014 out of about 4,000 births covered. The issue is a sensitive one, with mothers hesitant to admit their addiction for fear they might lose custody of their babies.\n\nChildren\u2019s Community Health Plan, which has 135,000 members and is owned by Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin, has sifted through the data for pregnant women looking for any addiction red flags. Then, if the timing is right in a pregnancy, it has discreetly reached out to the pregnant women and their providers to make sure the doctor is aware of the addiction, and that the baby will need to be weaned off opiates when born.\n\n\u201cIt can be surprisingly easy for the other doctors not to be aware of what\u2019s going on in somebody\u2019s medical world,\u201d Schellhase says. \u201cIt\u2019s really just to sort of to let providers know that this is happening and kind of leave it in their hands, but give them some tools to help deal with it.\u201d\n\nTexas Children\u2019s Health Plan \u2014 a 390,000-member insurer also owned by a kids\u2019 hospital \u2014 was seeing problems with adolescents showing up in the ED for opioid poisoning. Digging into claims data, they found that many were obtaining drugs through dentists or orthopedists, rather than primary care, and often without using their benefits. So, the plan has worked to train family physicians on how to screen, spot and refer teens who are abusing drugs to behavioral health services. The approach has shown promise, and independent doctors have proven eager to learn more, says Rose Calhoun, director of quality and outcomes management for the health plan.\n\n\u201cIf you think about a physician who\u2019s out in practice in a small town or rural area, it\u2019s challenging to get away from their office to learn,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when the hospital has someone who can go out and work with doctors in the community, they\u2019re very receptive and they appreciate it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While some insurers may have dug their heels in and fought against payment for addressing addiction, others are pushing in a different direction.
