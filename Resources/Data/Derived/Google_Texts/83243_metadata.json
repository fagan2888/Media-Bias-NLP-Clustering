The issue came up at the governor's monthly news conference this morning.\n\nA Florida-based issue group, the Foundation for Government Accountability, has been placing ads on social media in Utah, asking residents to oppose Governor Gary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah plan. Links in the ad go to a website called \u201cUnhealthy Utah,\u201d which calls the plan an expansion of Obamacare. Herbert told his monthly news conference on KUED that\u2019s just not true \u2013 that his plan is significantly different from the expansion of Medicaid originally proposed under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHerbert told reporters, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t mind having discussion and debate about the issue. I think that\u2019s healthy. I just want it to be truthful. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for somebody from outside of Utah to come in and try to direct, for whatever their political purposes are, and distort what we\u2019re trying to present to the legislature and the people of Utah.\u201d\n\nMembers of the policy team for FGA posted an op-ed piece on the Forbes magazine website last month, criticizing the Healthy Utah plan. They say few details of the plan have been released to the public.\n\nThe governor responded with a point-by-point defense on his own website. He says many of the details have already been discussed extensively in public, and he\u2019s promised to provide a printed summary for a legislative task force early next month.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "Utah\u2019s governor says a conservative group working against his alternative to expanding Medicaid isn\u2019t telling the truth.
