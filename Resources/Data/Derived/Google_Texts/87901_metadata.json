The Donald rarely if ever mentions the land of Lego, though Ted Cruz did once accuse him of being crazy enough to bomb it. Denmark is Bernie Sanders\u2019s utopia \u2014 a Scandinavian social democracy with free health care and college, whose enlightened rulers have \u201cgone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that come with economic insecurity,\u201d as Sanders once put it.\n\nWell, actually, the package Trump offers \u2014 \u201csave Social Security without cuts,\u201d a vaguely pro-single-payer position on health care, plus temporarily banning Muslims and walling off Mexico \u2014 bears an eerie resemblance to the Danish government\u2019s current policy mix.\n\nHis astonishing success selling it to the Republican base may portend ideological convergence between the U.S. right and Europe\u2019s.\n\nLike many American admirers of Scandinavian welfare states, Sanders lacks detailed knowledge of how those systems work, or an appreciation for certain cultural peculiarities that make cradle-to-grave welfarism politically sustainable there but not, so far, here.\n\nAs Hugh Eakin explains in a New York Review of Books article with the provocative title \u201cLiberal, Harsh Denmark,\u201d generous social benefits belong to a wide array of institutions designed \u201cto reinforce a strong sense of folke, the Danish people.\u201d That reflects Denmark\u2019s history: a small state, defined by ethnic and (Protestant) religious identity, which has, over centuries, been both a proud Baltic power and a victim of foreign threat and invasion.\n\nHence today\u2019s paradox: Denmark, tolerant and generous toward the Danes among its 5.6 million people, is deeply anxious about its 260,000 Muslims \u2014 so much so that a left-right parliamentary coalition recently authorized police to seize cash and valuables from refugees, ostensibly to help pay for their accommodation but also to deter them from coming at all.\n\nYou probably won\u2019t hear Sanders urging imitation of that Danish policy at his next college-town rally, but Trump would surely approve of it. The Danish law reflects the rise of the anti-immigrant Danish People\u2019s Party, whose clout as the second-largest bloc in Parliament obliges traditional conservative and socialist parties to tilt against immigration as well.\n\nThe Danish People\u2019s Party preaches against not only immigration but also the European Union, a parallel to Trump\u2019s suspicion of free-trade deals, alliances and other manifestations of U.S. internationalism.\n\nHowever, Eakin writes, what makes the Danish People\u2019s Party \u201cparticularly potent,\u201d i.e., palatable to voters, is its \u201crobust defense of wealth redistribution and advanced welfare benefits for all Danes.\u201d\n\nTrump, too. Not surprisingly, the recent Rand Corp. Presidential Election Panel Survey of Republican primary voters found that Trump supporters are more likely than others to feel threatened by immigrants and resent demands for equality by African Americans and women.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the whole story. Trump also led among the 51 percent of GOP voters who support tax increases for those with incomes over $200,000; the 47 percent who favor a higher minimum wage; the 32 percent who favor \u201cgovernment paying necessary medical costs for every American citizen\u201d; and the 38 percent who like labor unions.\n\nYes, Trump feeds on anger at \u201cthe establishment.\u201d Republican voters who told Rand \u201cpeople like me don\u2019t have any say about what the government does\u201d were 86 percent more likely to prefer the Donald.\n\nBut if this voter revolt were only about sticking it to the man, in some general sense, the obstreperous Ted Cruz should be doing better than he is, perhaps beating Trump.\n\nThe fact that it\u2019s the other way around shows that many GOP voters aren\u2019t that moved by Cruz\u2019s free-market attack on Obamacare and \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d\n\nReviewing the Rand data, one is struck by the utter disconnect between a large portion of rank-and-file Republicans \u2014 who appear to want a big government to protect them from old-age poverty and high medical costs, as well as from immigrants and terrorists \u2014 and the small-government, tax-cutting plans, coupled with ambivalence on immigration, that many other GOP candidates serve up.\n\nThose of us pundits who dismissed Trump-for-President as a passing bout of political entertainment were out of touch, too.\n\n\u201cTrump supporters form a powerful populist coalition uniting concerns about immigrants and other groups with support for economically progressive policies,\u201d Rand sociologists Michael Pollard and Joshua Mendelsohn conclude.\n\nThat description also fits France\u2019s National Front and the Sweden Democrats, two of the Danish People\u2019s Party\u2019s many cousin parties across Europe.\n\nIn a world of economic stagnation, unstable geopolitics and unpredictable human migration, a significant portion of Western citizenries define conservatism in its most primitive sense: hunker down, protect what you have and keep outsiders out.\n\nNow Donald Trump has brought reactionary economic populism to the United States, with possibly lasting consequences, whether he wins the White House or not.\n\nRead more from Charles Lane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Charles Lane, donald trump, super tuesday, trump voters", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "His policy mix of entitlements and nativism is eerily similar to that of the Scandanavian welfare state.", "title": "Trump wants to make America more like Denmark", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-wants-to-make-america-more-like-denmark/2016/03/02/6bfc935e-dfd9-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/02/Editorial-Opinion/Images/GOP_2016_Trump_-04d9b-1367.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ChuckLane1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-wants-to-make-america-more-like-denmark/2016/03/02/6bfc935e-dfd9-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Charles Lane, donald trump, super tuesday, trump voters", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "6bfc935e-dfd9-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "His policy mix of entitlements and nativism is eerily similar to that of the Scandanavian welfare state."}, "article_summary": "As the Donald Trump campaign rolls on, the secret to his success is becoming clear: his promise to make America more like Denmark.\nThat description also fits France\u2019s National Front and the Sweden Democrats, two of the Danish People\u2019s Party\u2019s many cousin parties across Europe.\nThe Danish People\u2019s Party preaches against not only immigration but also the European Union, a parallel to Trump\u2019s suspicion of free-trade deals, alliances and other manifestations of U.S. internationalism.\nThe Danish law reflects the rise of the anti-immigrant Danish People\u2019s Party, whose clout as the second-largest bloc in Parliament obliges traditional conservative and socialist parties to tilt against immigration as well.\nYou probably won\u2019t hear Sanders urging imitation of that Danish policy at his next college-town rally, but Trump would surely approve of it."}
