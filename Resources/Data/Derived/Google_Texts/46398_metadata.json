Loretta Sanchez, Duf Sundheim, Tom Del Beccaro and Ron Unz will answer questions on the economy, immigration, health care, crime and policing.\n\nWe'll also be incorporating one question from you, our listeners. We asked you to submit questions last week. And now it's time to vote. We've tallied up the submissions. Here's your chance to vote on which question we should pose the night of the debate.\n\nWhich of these questions should we ask California's U.S. Senate candidates?\n\nThe poll will close May 2.\n\nHarris is the California Democratic Party's pick to fill the seat that will be vacated when Boxer retires. Boxer has held the seat for 24 years. Harris favors national climate change legislation, backs immigration reform and supports President Barack Obama's plan for free tuition at community colleges. Orange County Congresswoman Sanchez is also a Democrat. Sanchez describes her platform for the Senate as pro-environment, pro-labor and pro-civil rights.\n\nSundheim, a former state GOP chairman and lawyer, backs gay rights, abortion rights and immigration reform. Del Beccaro is also a former state GOP chairman and lawyer. He has said his campaign is focused on California's water issues and prosperity. Ron Unz is a Republican entrepreneur, writer and publisher based in the Bay Area. He said his main issue will be preserving Proposition 227, the ban on bilingual education that he sponsored in 1998.\n\nThe debate is part of California Counts, an election coverage initiative by the state\u2019s leading public media newsrooms: KPBS in San Diego, KPCC in Los Angeles, KQED in San Francisco and Capital Public Radio in Sacramento.\n\nThe debate will air live at 7 p.m. May 10 on KPBS TV and KPBS 89.5/97.7 FM and stream on KPBS.org.
