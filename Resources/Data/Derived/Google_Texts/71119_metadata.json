Sarah Palin wrote on Facebook, \u201cThe America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama\u2019s \u2018death panel\u2019 so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their \u2018level of productivity in society,\u2019 whether they are worthy of health care.\u201d\n\nThus, the \u201cdeath panels\u201d lie was born, and seven years later it still remains potent. According to a new poll from Public Policy Polling, 60% of Americans\u2014including 74% of Republicans and even 51% of Democrats\u2014still either believe in or are unsure about the existence of death panels.\n\nWhy are so many Americans still clinging to 2009\u2019s \u201cLie of the Year?\u201d Tens of millions of people are receiving health care thanks to the Affordable Care Act, with no evidence of seniors or disabled citizens being forced to end their lives early due to a panel of government bureaucrats.\n\nI commissioned this poll to clarify a key point in my new book, Lies, Incorporated: The World of Post-Truth Politics. Discussions about corruption of our political processes often center around money and lobbying. Yet a third element, lies, specifically those lies that are strategically designed to distort the policy-making process, are ignored. There is in fact a group of individuals who have intentionally used falsehoods to hack our democracy for both financial and ideological gain, thus the title. In Lies, Incorporated, I chronicle a series of these lies, profile the people who created them and assess the damage they have caused.\n\nI could never have imagined a figure like Donald Trump would emerge a leader in the primary, even though I was familiar with his type. Like Trump in 2016, Betsy McCaughey in 2009 combined brazen falsehoods with a shamelessness that meant she never has to apologize for them.\n\nBetsy McCaughey also shared Trump\u2019s thirst for the spotlight. A former staffer from her time as lieutenant governor of New York said, \u201cA lot of politicians are out for the limelight, but Betsy\u2019s constant need twenty-four hours a day was something I\u2019d never seen.\u201d\n\nAlthough a mini fact-checking industry immediately sprang up to correct the record on death panels, the story\u2014like many of Trump\u2019s claims today\u2014proved stubborn. Even before Sarah Palin coined the term \u201cdeath panels,\u201d Politifact already declared the theory a \u201cridiculous falsehood\u201d rating it \u201cpants on fire.\u201d And McCaughey\u2019s death-panel lie was debunked within days by groups as diverse as the AARP and Media Matters for America, as well as by more than 40 major media outlets including the New York Times, USA Today, Associated Press, the Washington Post, CBS and MSNBC.\n\nIn the Washington Post, Ezra Klein explained why Betsy McCaughey\u2019s lie caught fire in the media, a reason extremely familiar to those of us watching Trump in 2016: \u201cShe\u2019s among the best in the business at the Big Lie: not the dull claim that health-care reform will slightly increase the deficit or trim Medicare Advantage benefits, but the claim that it will result in Death Panels that decide the fate of the elderly, or a new model of medical ethics in which the lives of the old are sacrificed for the good of the young, or a government agency that will review the actions of every doctor,\u201d Klein wrote. \u201cMcCaughey isn\u2019t just a liar. She\u2019s an excitingliar.\u201d\n\nBeing an exciting liar led to media attention and numerous bookings not only with the conservative media, but also with ostensibly liberal venues like \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d It forced progressive organizations and news outlets like MSNBC to devote countless segments to debunking her falsehoods. Yet this seemed to instead perpetuate the lie, keeping it active.\n\nA further similarity between Trump and McCaughey is that she was already known as someone who played fast and loose with the truth about a Democratic president\u2019s health-care policies.\n\nIn 1994 as a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, McCaughey excoriated the Clinton White House health-care proposal in an article in the New Republic titled \u201cNo Exit.\u201d\n\nNewt Gingrich said McCaughey\u2019s New Republic piece was \u201cthe first decisive break point\u201d that led to the defeat of what conservatives derided as \u201cHillarycare.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf these facts surprise you, it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t been given a straight story about the Clinton health bill,\u201d she wrote. But it was McCaughey who wasn\u2019t telling it straight.\n\nJames Fallows of the Atlantic later declared that New Republic piece the \u201cmost destructive effect on public discourse by a single person\u201d in the 1990s.\n\nDespite this performance, the following decade saw Betsy McCaughey welcomed back into the media fold to continue spreading her lies, now about Obamacare. Her quotable and stirring attacks made her a welcome guest. Republicans loved her talking points, which confirmed their worst fears about President Obama\u2019s true intent, and Democrats loved to hate her because she was one of many conservative boogeymen who could easily be attacked for their outrageous lies.\n\nAs we\u2019re seeing now with the Trump campaign, 2009\u2019s part media frenzy, part goat rodeo was compelling content for liberals and conservatives alike. But it was not beneficial to our public discourse.\n\nAs I note in Lies, Incorporated, instead of discussing how to help the millions of uninsured or debating the merits or feasibility of proposed solutions, endless months were devoted to an irrelevant debate over whether President Barack Obama secretly wanted to kill grandmothers. Members of Congress were begging the White House for a response\u2014their constituents were calling in droves, fearful of death panels. Whether they were enticed by the ratings potential of this manufactured drama or they were simply unwilling to truthfully confront the issue, mainstream reporters who lacked any understanding of health-care policy flooded the White House and pro-health-care-policy groups with questions.\n\nToday, instead of discussing the actual problems with U.S. immigration policy, Donald Trump shifts debate to whether or not Mexicans who wish to enter the U.S. are rapists, how tall his wall is going to be and whether the federal government should ban all Muslim immigrants.\n\nBy loudly and unapologetically lying to a friendly audience of partisans in the media, at think tanks, on Capitol Hill, and to the public at large, Donald Trump has created bedlam within the Republican party\u2014the same way that Betsy McCaughey successfully threw health-care reform into chaos.\n\nThe death panel lie helped to rile up the conservative base in such a way that it became impossible for Democrats and Republicans to reach any sort of compromise on health-care reform. It confirmed for conservatives their worst fears about Barack Obama and what his presidency would mean for their lives, leaving no space for a public discussion on how to fix America\u2019s health-care system.\n\nThe post-truth landscape that Trump, McCaughey and others take advantage of is fueled by a bifurcated media structure, which allows misinformation to rapidly spread in ideological echo chambers. Because it is simply impossible for individuals to track down the primary source for every piece of information they consume, we by necessity rely on aggregators to report the news to us. No longer limited to anchors on the big three networks to tell us what we need to know, we flock to the outlets that best conform to our own worldview.\n\nThus the lies of Donald Trump and the lies of Betsy McCaughey become truth in different communities. This means that even after the existence of \u201cdeath panels\u201d had been thoroughly debunked it may never fully leave the public consciousness. Zombie lies continue to rise from the dead again and again, influencing political debate and swaying people\u2019s opinions on a variety of issues\u2014particularly emotionally resonant lies like the \u201cdeath panels.\u201d\n\nThe lesson of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is, if you are going to lie, lie big, lie often and never acknowledge your lies. Repeat them enough and certain segments of the population will accept them in such a way that they will stick.\n\nThe lesson for the rest of us (and the media) is we cannot give these liars their undeserved public platforms. It is too late to undo the damage of Donald Trump\u2019s lies, just as there will always be a segment of the people who believe in death panels.\n\nAfter her lies about health-care reform in the 1990s, Betsy McCaughey should not have been granted any platform to participate in the debate during the Obama years. Likewise once Donald Trump began his quest to discover Barack Obama\u2019s true birthplace, he should have been laughed out of public discourse, relegated to his reality show boardroom. Yes, both McCaughey and Trump were ratings boons for television news seeking an audience, but that came at a cost to our public discourse.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Misinformation spreads rapidly\u2014and intentionally\u2014in right-wing echo chambers.
