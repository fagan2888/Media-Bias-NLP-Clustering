Chinese banks reported 982.5 billion yuan ($154 billion) in problems loans as of March 31, up from CNY646.1 billion a year earlier and the highest level since the third quarter of 2008, according to official statistics from the China Banking Regulatory Commission.\n\nThe problem-loan ratio\u2013or the percentage of total outstanding loans that are nonperforming\u2013also has increased steadily since the first quarter of 2012 to 1.39% as of March 31, even as overall bank lending has expanded during that period, according to the official statistics.\n\nThe actual ratio of problem loans could be much higher than that, if one includes loans that are technically performing but may become problematic if the economy continues to slow down, analysts and investors say.\n\nQiang Liao, a Beijing-based analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services, estimates that 5% to 6% of total outstanding bank loans in China are either nonperforming or possibly problematic.\n\nOnly a sliver of those loans will be available to investors, said Ben Fanger, co-founder and partner of Shoreline, citing high barriers to entry, limited conduits for deals, and the complexity of China\u2019s bankruptcy laws among challenges firms face.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of how big the market is,\u201d said Robert Petty, co-founder and managing partner of Clearwater. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of buying good portfolios at the right price.\u201d\n\nPrivate Equity Analyst is a monthly magazine published by Dow Jones & Co. focused on noteworthy trends in the private equity industry.
