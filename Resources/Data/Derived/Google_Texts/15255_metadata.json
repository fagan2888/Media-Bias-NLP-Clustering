Then again, it\u2019s encouraging to see how ready they seem to take on the challenges passed on by older generations. What emerged from interviews about kids\u2019 varied concerns, Shatz said, was one consistent message: \u201cThe adults clearly aren\u2019t doing enough to stop this,\u201d as one child puts it, \u201cso we have to take it into our own hands.\u201d\n\nThe two-part special premieres Dec. 15 at 7 pm ET. Check out the trailer below; a conversation with Schatz follows.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was hoping that first you could tell me a little bit about how this project came about.\n\nFor many years I\u2019ve been working with Sheila Nevins at HBO on family specials that explore complex issues. Our children\u2019s shows have featured kids speaking from the heart about some of life\u2019s big questions: kids thinking out loud about subjects like poetry, dreams, God, the meaning of life. The environment seemed so deeply relevant today, and we wanted to explore it with kids: What do they know, what do they wonder about, what concerns do they have?\n\n\n\nAfter thinking about this subject, we realized that there would be no better partner for this endeavor than the American Museum of Natural History, that concerns itself with the natural world \u2014 its past and its future. We\u2019re so lucky to have access to them and their scientists and their incredible collections.\n\nI\u2019m interested in how you approached tailoring a climate change message to kids. What are some of the issues that come up when you\u2019re thinking about how to present the issue to that audience?\n\nWell, I have to say that my role in this \u2026 you know, I\u2019m a filmmaker, but I\u2019m also a messenger for what the kids tell me. And my approach is always to start with the kids, and to listen to them, and to see what they know and what it is they want to tell me. Where I began was, I sent a call out to kids around the world to send me video messages, to hear what was on their minds not only necessarily about climate change, specifically, but about the environment. I asked what they loved about the nature around them and their tips for taking care of the earth.\n\n\n\nAnd what came back was maybe 2,000 videos from kids from around the world \u2014 from Bali, India, Canada, Australia, London and across the U.S. \u2014 with what kids were thinking about. For me, rather than have my own script that I\u2019m following, I take their lead. And one of the things that emerged in listening to all these video messages was that it was an amazing collection of voices, but there was an overwhelmingly uniform message, which is that we are the kids, we\u2019re going to take care of this planet, we care about the species on Earth and we need to do what we can to protect it before it\u2019s too late. They were concerned about pollution, they were concerned about littering, they were concerned about burning fossil fuels, they were concerned about climate change. They knew a lot about the issues in their own backyard; not only about polar bears but some of the things that hit closer to home.\n\nWere you surprised by the range of issues that came up? Some of the things the documentary covers, like oil trains, you might not expect to be on children\u2019s minds.\n\nI learned a lot from them about these issues. I actually didn\u2019t know a lot about some of the things that they brought to my attention.\n\nI was surprised at the scary content that these kids knew about. My feeling about childhood is that it should be a worry-free period, and my concern was that I didn\u2019t want to introduce stress into kids\u2019 lives. I guess for me, when I saw the amount of information that the kids had, and the concerns that they had, which were really for the survival not only for certain species of fish or the whales, but they were concerned about their children; several of the kids talked about the future generations. So they weren\u2019t only thinking about themselves \u2014 which, when you think about children you think that they\u2019re very rooted in the moment of their lives, but they were actually thinking ahead to what their future role would be. And I found that very heartbreaking, that they were worried about what the environment would look like for their children and their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The director of a new HBO series talks to Salon about talking to children about environmental issues VIDEO", "title": "How do you tell your kids the world is falling apart?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The director of a new HBO series talks to Salon about talking to children about environmental issues VIDEO", "title": "How do you tell your kids the world is falling apart?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/14/how_do_you_tell_your_kids_the_world_is_falling_apart/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/savingmytomorrow02-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The director of a new HBO series talks to Salon about talking to children about environmental issues VIDEO", "title": "How do you tell your kids the world is falling apart?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/savingmytomorrow02-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, american museum of natural history, Children's television, Climate Change, Documentaries, Environmentalism, HBO, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a43\"", "article_summary": "Our children\u2019s shows have featured kids speaking from the heart about some of life\u2019s big questions: kids thinking out loud about subjects like poetry, dreams, God, the meaning of life.\nThey were concerned about pollution, they were concerned about littering, they were concerned about burning fossil fuels, they were concerned about climate change.\nI\u2019m interested in how you approached tailoring a climate change message to kids.\nAnd what came back was maybe 2,000 videos from kids from around the world \u2014 from Bali, India, Canada, Australia, London and across the U.S. \u2014 with what kids were thinking about.\nWell, I have to say that my role in this \u2026 you know, I\u2019m a filmmaker, but I\u2019m also a messenger for what the kids tell me."}
