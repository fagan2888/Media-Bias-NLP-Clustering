Owners who rely on it are disappointed that the city has rejected a request to replace the dog park in nearby City Park.\n\nSupporters circulated petitions asking the city to replace the facility in City Park and garnered more than 3,000 signatures, said Linda Meunier, 61, who regularly brings her cattle dog mix, Mick Dundee, to the dog park.\n\n\u201cWe are not asking them to keep this, we just want somewhere for the dogs to play,\u201d Meunier said.\n\nDenver Parks and Recreation has rejected the idea of providing a replacement in City Park, citing neighborhood opposition and an ongoing effort to have the park designated a landmark.\n\nA smaller dog-play area is planned for the recreation center, but at a quarter of the size of the current dog park.\n\nFuller Dog Park, at 29th Avenue and Franklin Street, is the closest off-leash park to Josephine Gardens.\n\nMany residents who live near Josephine Gardens don\u2019t have vehicles and can\u2019t easily take their animals out of the neighborhood, said Meunier.\n\nLaura Geiser, 67, lives at 16th Avenue and Steele Street, and brings her gray standard poodle to the Josephine Gardens park. Her home has a very small yard, she said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t walk him because I have back and foot problems,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the future, she said, she will probably take Hanky to Fuller. \u201cI want the recreation center but I would like to have a closer park. There are a lot of people here that have dogs,\u201d she said.\n\nDawn Richardson, 43, has been bringing her 1-year-old Labrador mix, Saki, to the park three to four times a week. She was upset when she saw signs on the park fence informing users that it would soon close.\n\n\u201cSo many dogs here live in apartments. There is a real need for this, it is one of the densest neighborhoods in the city,\u201d she said.\n\nLocal dogs need the park, where they can interact with others, and become socialized with both dogs and people, Meunier said.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to go renegade and they are going to start letting their dogs off leash in (City) park,\u201d she added.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dogs spend one last day at Denver\u2019s Josephine Gardens dog park", "title": "Dogs spend one last day at Denver\u2019s Josephine Gardens dog park", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/25/dogs-spend-one-last-day-at-denvers-josephine-gardens-dog-park/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151026__CD26DOGPARK__1AO9531xxp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151026__CD26DOGPARK__1AO9531xxp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-25T14:02:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T04:27:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Animals"}, "article_summary": "Owners who rely on it are disappointed that the city has rejected a request to replace the dog park in nearby City Park.\nFuller Dog Park, at 29th Avenue and Franklin Street, is the closest off-leash park to Josephine Gardens.\nKarly Clews figures that once the Josephine Gardens dog park closes, she will have to get creative to exercise her 8-year-old, mixed-breed named Missy.\n\u201cI will probably resort to off-leash, at night, throwing the ball\u201d in nearby City Park Golf Course, said Clews, 33.\n\u201cPeople are going to go renegade and they are going to start letting their dogs off leash in (City) park,\u201d she added."}
