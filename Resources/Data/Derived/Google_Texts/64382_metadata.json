Ted Cruz (R-TX) during an awkward speech to the International Association of Firefighters in Washington D.C. [MSNBC]\n\nSen. Ted Cruz\u2019s (R-TX) attempt to win over a firefighters union went over like a lead balloon, the Dallas Morning News reported.\n\nThe International Association of Firefighters (IAFF) gave Cruz the silent treatment during his 30-minute speech at their conference in Dallas on Tuesday, during which he criticized the Internal Revenue Service and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cFive years ago reasonable minds could have differed on whether this was a good idea,\u201d Cruz said of the healthcare law, commonly known as Obamacare. \u201cBut today, seeing millions of American who\u2019ve lost their jobs, who\u2019ve been forced into part time work, who\u2019ve lost their heatlh care, who\u2019ve lost their doctor \u2014 it is the essence of reasonableness, it is the essence of pragmatism to acknowledge this thing isn\u2019t working. We need to repeal it and start over.\u201d\n\nWhat was supposed to be an applause-getting line ended up bombing, since the association supported the law. An IAFF spokesperson told the News that, while the union has tried to change a part of the statute affecting union members with more expensive insurance policies, \u201cthe whole idea of repealing the entire program is not something this organization supports.\u201d\n\nMSNBC posted footage of Cruz visibly straining for applause that never came after saying he wanted to \u201cpadlock the IRS building and put all those IRS agents on our southern border.\u201d\n\nWhile IAFF members reportedly gave Cruz \u201cpolite\u201d applause before and after his speech, the senator was also knocked \u2014 though not by name \u2014 by another conference guest, Rep. Peter King (R-NY).\n\n\u201cI find it really hypocritical to have people come before you, say, \u2018I stand with the firefighters, We have to be with you,\u2019 and then they don\u2019t vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d King said.\n\nCruz is no stranger to awkward interactions with crowds. He was booed offstage last September during an appearance in front of a group of Middle Eastern Christians, saying, \u201cIf you will not stand with Israel and the Jews, then I will not stand with you.\u201d\n\nWatch footage of Cruz\u2019s IAFF appearance, as posted by MSNBC, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Sen.-Ted-Cruz-R-TX-during-an-awkward-speech-to-the-International-Association-of-Firefighters-in-Washington-D.C.-MSNBC-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Watch Ted Cruz\u2019s super-awkward straining for applause from a firefighters\u2019 union"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd434\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut today, seeing millions of American who\u2019ve lost their jobs, who\u2019ve been forced into part time work, who\u2019ve lost their heatlh care, who\u2019ve lost their doctor \u2014 it is the essence of reasonableness, it is the essence of pragmatism to acknowledge this thing isn\u2019t working.\nSen.
