He noted that in his work, he has spent \u201ca lot of time crisscrossing the country chatting with leading healthcare providers and insurers about their technology needs - by far the area they are most interested in is telemedicine.\u201d According to Fleshman, Andrew Watson, the Chief Medical Director of Telemedicine at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center has this to say: \u201cTelemedicine is moving like lightning. We\u2019re able to do so much more than before.\u201d\n\nSusan D. Hall of FierceHealthIT, based on Fleshman\u2019s article, picked out four reasons why telemedicine will trend in 2015. Namely, they are:\n\nFaster Internet connections and better software provide a better video chat experience than in the past\n\nWith mobile devices, people can consult a doctor from anywhere\n\nThe adoption of electronic health records makes it easier for doctors to access patient records\n\nPatients are comfortable with asynchronous messaging, which can be more time-efficient for doctors\n\nFleshman noted that in the beginning, it was thought that the convenience brought on by telemedicine and technology \u201cwould appeal mostly to younger patients, who expect to be able to access services on the Internet, and it does.\u201d However, he points out that \u201cthe area where it will have the most impact may well be with older populations.\u201d\n\nIn his report, Fleshman noted that Dr. Steve Ommen, the Associate Dean at the Center for Connected Care at the Mayo Clinic expects older patients to be enthusiastic adopters. \u201cThe fastest-growing demographic for social media is the 60+ group. They are not technology-averse and they have the greatest mobility challenge in terms of getting to a doctor. A telemedicine solution may be exactly what they need,\u201d Dr. Ommen said.\n\nStephanie Ocano of Healthcare Global notes the key role technology will play in connecting doctors with their patients. \u201cThanks to startups like Doctors on Demand, Medicast and Twine Health, consumers are already being allowed direct access to doctors through their smartphones. In the future, providers may partner with platforms such as these to connect their doctors with patients,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAdditionally, these apps could be offered through employers or insurance companies to help reduce costs or improve the quality of care. Telemedicine has the capability to not only become an investment opportunity, but a trend that can improve the doctor-patient relationship as well.\u201d\n\nAs for the cost, since providers are now \u201cincreasingly being paid for outcomes rather than procedures, they are incentivized to provide care in the most efficient way possible and telemedicine is cheaper than in-person care,\u201d noted Fleshman. \u201cAnd, with Medicare and Medicaid beginning to cover not-in-person consultations, reimbursement for telemedicine is also becoming more mainstream.\u201d Indeed, Richard A. Kimball Jr., CEO of HEXL, concurs, stating: \u201cThe era of preventive medicine and home healthcare monitoring is on the rise. The full integration of telemedicine in our healthcare delivery system is not far off as developments in technology continue along with the improvements in reimbursement.\u201d\n\n\u201cTelemedicine is becoming a hugely popular health care product, and a great way to connect doctors and medical facilities with patients. Although many people are still not familiar with its application or availability, the medical community is acutely aware of the cost savings and efficacy of providing direct access between the healer and the sick,\u201d Greg Donahue of benefitspro pointed out. \"As a matter of fact, according to a report from the Healthcare Performance Management Institute in 2013, and attributed to \u201cNational Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 2006 (August 2008)\", 70 percent of physician visits and 40 percent of hospital ER visits can be handled by a phone call.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more individuals obtain health insurance due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the debate about how to provide greater access to care at a reasonable cost becomes ever more relevant,\u201d wrote Donahue. \u201cNow, telemedicine is emerging as a crucial building block in the delivery of care, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. Telemedicine also allows individuals to take greater control of their ailments, which is a way for patients to \u201cself-manage\u201d their condition.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New technologies will help the field of telemedicine drastically grow this year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Bioscience Technology", "description": "New technologies will help the field of telemedicine drastically grow this year.", "title": "Telemedicine Set to Bloom in 2015", "url": "http://www.biosciencetechnology.com/articles/2015/02/telemedicine-set-bloom-2015", "image": "http://www.biosciencetechnology.com/sites/biosciencetechnology.com/files/bt1502_telemedicine_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "abstract": "New technologies will help the field of telemedicine drastically grow this year.", "fb": {"admins": 198437450904}, "keywords": "bioscience; technology; telemedicine; mobile health; electronic health records"}, "article_summary": "\u201cTelemedicine may just be the biggest trend in digital health in 2015,\u201d wrote Skip Fleshman, partner at Asset Management Ventures, in an article for Forbes.\nWe\u2019re able to do so much more than before.\u201dSusan D.
