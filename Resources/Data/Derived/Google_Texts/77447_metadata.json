It went pretty much as you might expect: evidence, evidence, evidence versus Reagan, Reagan, Reagan. But in a way the most interesting thing was the audience reaction when I described Obamacare as a major success story so far: boos and hissing.\n\nWhat\u2019s amazing about this is that the good news about Obamacare isn\u2019t really debatable. It\u2019s a simple fact that there has been a stunningly rapid drop in the number of uninsured, coming from multiple independent sources. It\u2019s also a simple fact that outlays on Medicaid and exchange subsidies are coming in well below projections.\n\nYou can argue that this is all temporary \u2014 that premiums will eventually skyrocket even though they haven\u2019t yet, that the predicted death spiral will come back from the er, dead. But Obamacare is, by any measure, doing better so far than even its supporters expected.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t supposed to happen \u2014 and therefore, given the epistemology of the modern American right, it didn\u2019t.
