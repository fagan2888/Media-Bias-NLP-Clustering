The group outlined their hopes for the ideal D.C. where they want the show set.\n\nHall said they want to give people a behind-the-scenes look at what goes on at the State Department and \u201cto invite people into the discussion of politics once again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the time that the ways we consume politics is to take a stance and take a position and ignore the process,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIf we let people in on the process, to show how difficult and strategic these issues then we can stop simplifying and talking about them in a polarizing way.\u201d\n\nHall said there is always a \u201clove-hate\u201d relationship with Washington and the rest of the country, but people are always \u201cfascinated\u201d by it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more true believer-ism and a lot more true idealism in Washington than we give it credit for,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI\u2019m always encouraged and inspired by talking to these people because they believe in what they\u2019re doing and you can agree or disagree with their approach.\u201d\n\nLeoni added that she was \u201cdistressed\u201d about the negative way most people view Washington.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking at our government with such cynicism and such a negative idea. I do think I see a lot of \u2018We\u2019re right and they\u2019re crazy\u2019 and I think if anything, we\u2019re approaching this from a different perspective,\u201d she said.\n\nMcCreary also told POLITICO that she hopes the show can help people view the government more positively.\n\n\u201cWe can understand them from behind-the-scenes so that it doesn\u2019t become this soundbite from one side or the other and that we, as the American public, can really start to understand them and start to make decisions to help them,\u201d McCreary said. \u201cI think our particular view is more aspirational, government running the way we\u2019d love it to run.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadam Secretary\u201d premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. EST. The CBS show stars T\u00e9a Leoni as Elizabeth McCord, a former CIA analyst turned secretary of State.
