Government overreaches.\n\nAnd the Barack Obama Administration has the longest, most overactive arms ever. With many, many, MANY power-grabbing hands.\n\nObama\u2019s Legacy of Overreach\n\nObama Amnesty \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 Threat to Constitution\n\nObama Is Breaking The Law By Repeatedly Making Changes To ObamaCare Without Going Through Congress\n\nNet Neutrality Power Grab Is Worse than ObamaCare\n\nThe Coming Climate Onslaught\n\nPresident Obama readies a sweeping list of executive actions.\n\nAnd on, and on, and\u2026.\n\nGlaringly absent in all of this power-grabbing \u2013 has been actual, tangible Congressional opposition to any of it. Which is yet another Constitutional problem.\n\nThe Founding Fathers created a limited, delimited federal government. It is only supposed to do what the Document expressly grants it the authority to do.\n\nA fundamental component of this limiting is the balance of powers. The three Branches \u2013 Executive, Legislative and Judiciary \u2013 are supposed to respectively do what each is expressly told to do. And nothing else.\n\nThe Founders envisioned each Branch jealously, vociferously defending its turf \u2013 and thus its power. That inter-branch tension would serve as a check on them all.\n\nThat protection has been eroding for decades. The Legislative \u2013 Congress, the only elected representatives of We the People \u2013 has for at least a century been ceding more and more of its power.\n\nTo the Judiciary\n\nThe Senate has been way too lax in its Advise and Consent authority over the Executive\u2019s appointments of judges and Justices. Far too often the President\u2019s nominees are given a cursory glance \u2013 and thoughtless approval.\n\nThose in robes have thus felt increasingly free to perversely find more and more emanations from penumbras in existing statute. They write law \u2013 Congress\u2019 job \u2013 rather than merely interpret and enforce it.\n\nIn response to which Congress has done\u2026nothing. The Senate also has the responsibility of impeaching rogue judges \u2013 they almost never do it.\n\nTo the Executive\n\nAs we noted above, the Obama Administration has been in unprecedentedly huge fashion over-using the overly huge regulatory apparatus. But this, too, precedes this President by decades.\n\nThe countless Executive Branch Departments, Commissions, Agencies and Boards are supposed to enforce existing law. They are instead incessantly going well beyond these bounds \u2013 writing new law with no Congressional tether.\n\nPresident Obama placidly asserted that he would do this on steroids \u2013 unilaterally use his pen and his phone to write law to end-run the Congresses we elected to stop him.\n\nBecause he knew the Congresses we elected to stop him \u2013 wouldn\u2019t.\n\nCongressional Republicans have only paid lip service to opposition. They talk a big game \u2013 and then do nothing.\n\nAnd Congressional Democrats?\n\nSheila Jackson Lee: Writing Executive Orders for Obama to Sign \u2018Our Number One Agenda\u2019\n\nWell that sort of defeats the purpose of being in Congress, does it not?\n\nWell, there might be an Executive overreach so egregious, its implications so damaging \u2013 that Congress in bipartisan fashion might actually, finally do its Constitutional duty.\n\nFarmers, Congress Take Aim at EPA Water Rule\n\nRepublicans and some rural Democrats are sharpening their attacks against a forthcoming Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation that they say could vastly extend the agency\u2019s reach over waterways and agriculture.\n\nGOP lawmakers and Democrats from agriculture-heavy districts contend the Waters of the United States rule amounts to executive overreach\u2026.\n\nWhat is the EPA doing?\n\nIn March, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed new rules that would expand the agency\u2019s regulatory authority on streams and wetlands that feed into major rivers and lakes.\n\n\n\nThe EPA says 60 percent of the nation\u2019s streams and wetlands are not protected from pollution.\n\nThat actually means 60% of the nation\u2019s streams and wetlands are protected from government. The EPA won\u2019t stand for that.\n\nThis is actually an instance where the Judiciary has done its duty in reining in the Executive. In fact, it\u2019s done it twice.\n\n(There have been) two U.S. Supreme Court decisions that limited what waterways the government can regulate and the proposed rule is meant to clarify which smaller ones they include.\n\nWhy would that stop the EPA? Clearly, it won\u2019t. So Congress must.\n\nCongress will play host Tuesday to three hearings that will touch on the rule, including one on Senate legislation that would require the EPA to submit a different regulation that follows certain principles and specifically includes some bodies of water, groundwater and soil water.\n\nThe federal government is out of control. One of the fundamental problems is the Branches are failing to stay in their respective lanes.\n\nIt is WAY past time for the respective Branches to get back in them. Or be forced therein.\n\nCongress must reclaim its Constitutional lawmaking authority. Starting now.\n\n[Originally published at Red State]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/05/will-congress-finally-defend-its-constitutional-turf-to-stop-the-epas-assault-on-water/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/puddles.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Will Congress Finally Defend Its Constitutional Turf \u2013 to Stop the EPA\u2019s Assault on Water?"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "They write law \u2013 Congress\u2019 job \u2013 rather than merely interpret and enforce it.\nWell, there might be an Executive overreach so egregious, its implications so damaging \u2013 that Congress in bipartisan fashion might actually, finally do its Constitutional duty.\nThe three Branches \u2013 Executive, Legislative and Judiciary \u2013 are supposed to respectively do what each is expressly told to do.\nThe EPA says 60 percent of the nation\u2019s streams and wetlands are not protected from pollution.\nIt is only supposed to do what the Document expressly grants it the authority to do."}
