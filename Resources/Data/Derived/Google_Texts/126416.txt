After host Anderson Cooper said that he thinks other candidates will accuse Trump of flip-flopping, Trump said, “Well, you know who else flip-flopped? A man named, my favorite, Ronald Reagan. He was a Democrat. He became a Republican.”

Cooper then stated that Trump was “pro-choice.” Trump maintained that he stated he hated “the concept of abortion.” He continued, “I’m a businessman. They’re talking to me as a businessman about things like abortion. Nobody ever even asked me questions like that. But, if you look at that clip, and let it run, I talk about how I hate the concept. I went on forever about it. But nobody would ask me questions. You know, it’s sort of like a question you don’t ask a guy. I build buildings, they’re not asking me about am I pro-choice am I pro-life, what am I? But, yeah, I don’t use the word flip, I’ve evolved on a lot of different things.”
