News 9 got a glimpse Tuesday at the House of Representatives solution.\n\nA lot of work is being done behind closed doors to bridge the state\u2019s $1.3 billion budget gap.\n\nNews 9 got a glimpse Tuesday at the House of Representatives solution.\n\nMembers of the House said they\u2019ve identified $2 billion that can be used towards the budget.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is taxpayers will have to pay more for less.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s ever been a year when we gotta lead this is the year we gotta lead,\u201d said House Appropriations and Budget Committee Chair Earl Sears (R).\n\nSears said leading means making hard decisions.\n\nUnder the House plan here will be additional cuts in services; there will be cuts in tax breaks; and there will be an increase in taxes.\n\n\u201cSome of them are initiatives that would take an increase in taxes,\u201d Sears explained. \u201cSome of them are eliminations in appropriations. Some of them is reform of tax credits. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at.\"\n\nSears has a stack of proposals. Specifically, an increase in the tobacco tax of a $1.50 and reductions in health care costs by moving people off Medicaid. Sears said that would save $182 million.\n\nSears also backs a sales tax for certain services like haircuts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can get it off the floor, frankly. It will have to go to a vote of the people. With a two-thirds majority to pass a tax that just won\u2019t happen. There\u2019s no question. There\u2019s members that just absolutely won\u2019t vote for a tax increase,\u201d he said.\n\nMembers discussed a gas tax increase. That could bring in $28 million for every penny increased.\n\n\"I\u2019m just being brutally honest with you. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s one that we will seriously consider,\u201d Sears said.\n\nSears said they could also dip more into the rainy day fund, the unclaimed property fund, and several revolving funds.\n\nRepresentatives also plan to borrow money, in the form of bonds, to pay for infrastructure repairs.\n\n\u201cThat will absolutely be considered,\u201d Sears said.\n\nBut when asked if that isn\u2019t just kicking the can down the road, Sears said \u201cgood point, good point,\" then added that if some of these other initiatives pass the state will be in a better position to pay down that debt.\n\nSources say the governor has also made some modifications in her budget and plans to release more details Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A lot of work is being done behind closed doors to bridge the state\u2019s $1.3 billion budget gap.\u00a0 News 9\u00a0got a glimpse Tuesday at the House of Representatives solution.", "author": "Aaron Brilbeck", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31708231/house-of-representatives-plan-means-taxpayers-would-pay-more-for-less", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10315971_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A lot of work is being done behind closed doors to bridge the state\u2019s $1.3 billion budget gap.\u00a0 News 9\u00a0got a glimpse Tuesday at the House of Representatives solution.", "title": "House Of Representatives' Plan Means Taxpayers Would Pay More For Less"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10315971_G.jpg", "description": "A lot of work is being done behind closed doors to bridge the state\u2019s $1.3 billion budget gap.\u00a0 News 9\u00a0got a glimpse Tuesday at the House of Representatives solution.", "card": "summary", "title": "House Of Representatives' Plan Means Taxpayers Would Pay More For Less"}, "wnreadableurl": "house-of-representatives-plan-means-taxpayers-would-pay-more-for-less", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/04/12", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Budget Failure, rainy day fund, crisis, taxes,", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS19", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Budget Failure, rainy day fund, crisis, taxes,"}, "article_summary": "A lot of work is being done behind closed doors to bridge the state\u2019s $1.3 billion budget gap.\nMembers discussed a gas tax increase.\nThere\u2019s members that just absolutely won\u2019t vote for a tax increase,\u201d he said.\nMembers of the House said they\u2019ve identified $2 billion that can be used towards the budget.\nRepresentatives also plan to borrow money, in the form of bonds, to pay for infrastructure repairs."}
