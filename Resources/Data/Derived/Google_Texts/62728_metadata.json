Since the floodgates weren't designed to have water cascade over them, they had to be raised, releasing a massive flow into the Savannah River.\n\n\n\nThe gates were initially raised by one foot on Thursday, putting residents around the Savannah River on alert.\n\nAt 2 o'clock Friday morning, the walls inched up another half a foot, sending water spewing out of the gates and on to dry land.\n\n\n\nRussell Wicke, spokesman for the Savannah District of the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, said, \"We saw that the rate of rise for Thurmond was continuing to climb for longer than we expected. Because of that, we realized we had to raise the gates just a little bit higher.\"\n\n\n\nJust a little bit is an understatement.\n\nThe lake is now releasing 40,000 cubic feet of water per second.\n\nTo give a visual, imagine a new Olympic-sized swimming pool being filled every 2.5 seconds the flood gates are raised.\n\n\n\n\"We will maintain the releases that we are releasing right now and over the next 4 to 5 days, we should see the levels start to come down,\" Wicke.\n\n\n\nEven though most residents aren't in any immediate danger, Wicke said when dealing with Mother Nature, it's always important to be safe, than sorry.\n\n\n\n\"Although the dams are doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing, the water levels are high, the ground is really wet and the river is full. The velocity is pretty quick, so keep safety in mind if you have to be around those areas,\" said Wicke.\n\nEven though there are historic water levels to report, this type of release isn't unprecedented.\n\nIt's happened two times before in the last 45 years-once in 1998 and the first time, in 1971.\n\nCopyright 2016 WFXG.
