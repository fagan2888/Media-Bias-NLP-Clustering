Ross Douthat believes that \u201cReaganite conservatives\u201d who support Donald Trump \u201cwould be sleepwalking toward a kind of ideological suicide.\u201d\n\nBut Trumpism is the antithesis of Reaganism only if you\u2019re one of those pointy heads who judges the latter to be, as Douthat puts it, \u201ca fusion of social conservatism, free-market economics, and a hawkish internationalism.\u201d The essence of Reaganism, which has sustained the Republican Party for four decades, is not ideology.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019ve forgotten this line from Reagan\u2019s nomination acceptance speech in 1980: \u201cFor those who have abandoned hope, we\u2019ll restore hope and we\u2019ll welcome them into a great national crusade to make America great again!\u201d\n\n\n\nMaking America great again was Ronald Reagan\u2019s message to a people tired of thinking about the Asian war they had lost, upset at the hostages held in Tehran, and sick of high oil prices, racing inflation, and a pious president lecturing them on their malaise. What Reagan offered was the Myth of Restoration.\n\nClassical Antiquity had its Golden Age, whose restoration by a powerful leader like Caesar Augustus would be dreamed of during troubled times. In 19th-century America, it was the Golden Age of the Primitive Church that fired imaginations, leading to restorationist denominations like the Disciples of Christ and new traditions like Mormonism.\n\nRaised as a devout Disciple, Ronald Reagan had religious restorationism in his bones. His genius was to make it the engine of secular politics, persuading voters that Morning in America could be achieved via traditional mores, bigger military budgets, and the magic of the market.\n\nThat recipe was in big trouble at the end of George W. Bush\u2019s time in office, what with military quagmire in the Middle East, the Great Recession, and the advance of same-sex marriage. Nevertheless, during Barack Obama\u2019s first term Republicans clutched restorationism like a security blanket. What was the Tea Party but a colonial costume party?\n\nIn 2012, Ron Paul\u2019s campaign slogan was \u201cRestore America Now; his prescription, the \u201cRestore America Plan.\u201d \u201cI ask you to join us in this effort to restore America as a nation like no other,\u201d wrote presidential wannabe Newt Gingrich. The GOP platform used \u201crestore\u201d and its cognates no fewer than 21 times, beginning with two sections titled \u201cRestoring the American Dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cRestore Our Future\u201d was the name of the eventual nominee\u2019s Super-PAC. As Mitt Romney put it in accepting the nomination, \u201cIf I am elected President of these United States, I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America, to lift our eyes to a better future.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s policy agenda may or may not represent a wholesale rejection of latter-day Republican orthodoxy. But what he\u2019s selling, purloined slogan and all, is the same old Reaganite promise of a Golden Age restored.
