A Philadelphia Flyers’ hockey player is being sued over a 2-year-old auto accident.

Claude Giroux, who plays center and is the team captain for the Philadelphia Flyers, was named as a defendant in a civil action related to a fender bender that occurred on Dec. 10, 2011, where he is said to have rear-ended the driver in front of him, according to a report from the legal journal, The Pennsylvania Record.

Lafayette Hill, Pa., attorney John I. Gordon filed suit on behalf of Lincroft, N.J.-based Palisades Safety and Insurance Association, which says Giroux is responsible for more than $3,000 in damages he caused to a vehicle owned by the plaintiff’s insured, Nicole Ransom.

Ransom’s insurer maintains that it has since reimbursed her for the damages and is subrogated to the rights of Ransom against Giroux.
