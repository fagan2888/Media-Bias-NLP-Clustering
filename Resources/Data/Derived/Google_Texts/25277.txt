New Zealand Prime Minister John Key's National Party has won a third term in office with an unprecedented govern-alone victory.

It's the first time since the MMP voting system was introduced in 1996 that any party has held an outright majority in parliament.

Mr Key will again sign up ACT and United Future, his allies since 2008, but their votes won't be vital to his ability to hold office.

With 48 per cent of the party vote in Saturday's general election, National will hold 61 or 62 seats in the 121-member parliament.

The centre-left parties suffered crushing defeats.

Labour, which had hoped to oust National and lead a coalition government, crashed to its worst-ever result with 24.6 per cent of the vote.

Labour leader David Cunliffe conceceded defeat before the polls after preliminary results indicated the outcome.

"I've called on John Key and I have congratulated him and I have acknowledged that he will continue to be the prime minister of New Zealand," Cunliffe told supporters in Auckland.

The Greens, who had been confident of achieving 15 per cent and 20 MPs, managed only 10 per cent and have lost one of their 14 seats.

NZ First was the only opposition party celebrating.

A surge of support - some of it coming from former Labour voters - pushed NZ First up to 8.9 per cent and it will have 11 MPs, three more than in the last parliament.

In another blow to the opposition, Mana's leader Hone Harawira was defeated in Te Tai Tokerau by Labour's Kelvin Davis.

That knocked Internet Mana out the race.

The Internet Party, founded by Kim Dotcom, forged an election alliance with Mana to avoid having to reach the five per cent threshold - but that didn't work.

The Maori Party managed to retain only one of its three seats, with co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell retaining Waiairiki.
