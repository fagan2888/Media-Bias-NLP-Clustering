A new study claims that obese workers are less productive, more likely to get injured somehow, and need longer rest breaks than employees of normal weight.\n\nThe study was completed at Virginia Tech and the University of Buffalo and examined how people of different weights accomplished work tasks. Obese people had about 40 percent shorter endurance times, the researchers found.\n\nOf the 32 people studied, several were young and non-obese, some young and obese, and others either old and obese or old and non-obese. The participants were required to complete three tasks: hand gripping, elevating their shoulders, and a stimulated assembly operation. Every task involved both work and rest times. Obese women performed the worst, though overall, those in the overweight group struggled the most. \u201cOur findings indicated that on average, approximately 40 percent shorter endurance times were found in the obese group, with the largest differences in the hand grip and simulated assembly tasks,\u201d Lora Cavuoto, an assistant professor in the department of industrial and systems engineering at the University of Buffalo, said in the press release.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean companies will start getting rid of obese workers; instead, they \u201cwill make adjustments to the extent that [the workers] have a skill which is necessary, useful and in demand,\u201d Michael Berman, a lobbyist in Washington, D.C. who also struggled with obesity, told NPR. America has been feeling the weight of the obesity epidemic for years; one in three Americans are obese, and researchers estimate that the impact on businesses is up to $1,000 to $6,000 in costs for each overweight employee. That\u2019s because companies have to provide specially-designed, bigger chairs that can cost over $1,000. They also have to consider buying stronger toilets and larger desk spaces. Not to mention the loss of productivity.\n\n\u201cWorkers who are obese may need longer rest breaks to return to their initial state of muscle function,\u201d Cavuoto said. \u201cBased on the increased fatigue found among workers who are obese, workplace designers may need to consider adding fixtures and supports to minimize the amount of time that body mass segments need to be supported. We believe our results will help to develop more inclusive ergonomic guidelines.\u201d\n\nBut companies should be dealing with this problem not by buying bigger desks \u2014 but instead by providing free access to gyms and wellness programs, and encouraging their employees to live healthier.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obese workers, obesity", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Obese employees face serious issues at work due to their weight, such as less efficacy and more risk of injury.", "title": "Workplace Productivity Suffers When Obese People Are Around", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/obesity-workplace-overweight-employees-are-less-productive-need-longer-breaks-rest-295160", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/26/obese-worker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obese employees face serious issues at work due to their weight, such as less efficacy and more risk of injury.", "title": "Workplace Productivity Suffers When Obese People Are Around", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/obesity-workplace-overweight-employees-are-less-productive-need-longer-breaks-rest-295160", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/26/obese-worker.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/26/obese-worker.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-26T17:58:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-26T18:01:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Obese employees face serious issues at work due to their weight, such as less efficacy and more risk of injury."}, "article_summary": "A new study claims that obese workers are less productive, more likely to get injured somehow, and need longer rest breaks than employees of normal weight.\n\u201cWorkers who are obese may need longer rest breaks to return to their initial state of muscle function,\u201d Cavuoto said.\nEvery task involved both work and rest times.\n\u201cBased on the increased fatigue found among workers who are obese, workplace designers may need to consider adding fixtures and supports to minimize the amount of time that body mass segments need to be supported.\nObesity plays a role in workplace productivity, according to a new study, which states that overweight employees are less efficient in accomplishing tasks than people of regular weight and health."}
