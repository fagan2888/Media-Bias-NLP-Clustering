ECTOR, Texas -- If you blink while driving along State Highway 56, you just might miss Ector.

"I think of Ector like Mayberry," said Fannin County resident, Vonda Hamilton. "There's good things, oh yes there's bad here too, but there's a lot of good."

Now the little town is hoping to do a lot of good for all of Fannin County with a free medical clinic.

"I think Fannin County still is an underserved county," said Deloris Clemons, the clinic's board president.

Clemons is a Fannin County native, who worked at Bonham's VA hospital for years.

She says this project, although challenging, was the perfect opportunity to give back.

"I hope we can certainly make a difference in the community and serving those who need healthcare," Clemons said.

Once a week, the Fannin Health Clinic will open its doors for outpatient services and counseling.

Residents say they know many people will benefit from these services.

"There's a lot of people in Fannin County who can't afford the proper healthcare they need," said Dan Henke. " Even the world famous Obamacare isn't doing them any good. I think it's a great idea."

Others are excited for the location, because many have to travel to Sherman or the metroplex for care.

"It's really important because we have a lot of rural farmers so that they can get to a place quickly to just get some care, I think that's important," Hamilton said.

Just days from opening, leaders and residents are both excited for what lies ahead.

"I hope we can keep up with those that need the services and that we can grow as the need grows," Clemons said.

"I'm so proud of our community for having this come to Ector Texas--one of my favorite places," Hamilton concluded.

The Fannin Health clinic is located at the corner of North Main Street and North Red Bud in Ector.

The clinic will welcome its first patients this Thursday, April 14, and they will be open from 6 to 9 every Thursday evening afterwards.
