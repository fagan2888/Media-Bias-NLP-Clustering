What will it be after internet gambling goes live?\n\n\n\nBy Carl Zeitz\n\nOn Nov. 26, New Jersey will unleash full-scale internet betting, expanding the boundaries of gambling in a way likely to have some of the most profound social and economic impacts yet caused by the new online world.\n\nTo take part, you will have to be within the state and at least 21 years old.\n\nAmericans today owe about $850 billion on credit cards, with New Jersey at $5,484 per borrower \u2014 ranked second after only Alaska for average credit card debt. What will the figure be a year after internet gambling goes live? Will tens of thousands of people who don\u2019t gamble be gambling, mesmerized as they play slot machines, craps, blackjack and roulette on tablets and phones? The answers are probably yes.\n\nWith the inevitable spread to many other states \u2014 and potentially all states when, one assumes, federal interstate gambling restrictions are lifted \u2014 will a resulting consumer debt explosion be the next bubble in the American economy, with the potential to damage the economic stability of many and create new problem gamblers?\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to travel to Atlantic City or to a nearby convenience casino such as Parx in Pennsylvania or Resorts World Casino at Aqueduct Racetrack. It\u2019s going to be quite another thing to carry a casino in your pocket or sit at home gambling on a laptop.\n\nWhen he conditionally vetoed the internet gambling act and sent it to the Legislature for amendment before signing it, Gov. Chris Christie acknowledged the perils by declaring: \u201cThe bill should be revised to do more to prevent the documented harms that can accompany excessive gambling. Our state cannot carelessly create a new generation of addicted gamers, sitting in their homes, using laptops or iPads, gambling away their salaries and their futures.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s recommendation, adopted in the final law, increased an annual social assessment from each internet gambling licensee to $250,000 for the New Jersey Council on Compulsive Gambling and the Department of Human Services for compulsive gambling prevention.\n\nIs this a real solution for the havoc to come if havoc it turns out to be, or a gesture to salve the conscience? While the potential societal risk cannot be calculated in dollars, at least not yet, individual risk can be.\n\nUnder the internet gambling regulations, it is at least conceivable a gambler could open betting accounts to the initial allowed limit of $2,500 with each of the 12 Atlantic City casinos and quickly gamble into $30,000 worth of debt. Likely? No, not necessarily. Possible? Yes. But how many such accounts will it take to cause personal financial distress even to the point of ruin?\n\nIf you choose to use the internet to gamble in New Jersey, will anyone know if you are really in New Jersey and not gambling from outside its boundaries? They\u2019ll know because, as the National Security Agency can attest, satellites, cell towers and technology tell servers where we are or at least where our devices are every minute they are on.\n\nOf course you have to be 21 years old to bet in a casino or soon online. If you are skeptical that computers and casinos taking remote applications can really stop a 16-year-old from creating an identity and getting access to credit cards to gamble online, well, so am I.\n\nUnder the law, internet gambling can be offered by Atlantic City casinos alone or with operating partners, provided all such gambling operates from within a casino in Atlantic City.\n\nThe policy impetus for the law is to give the Atlantic City casinos a big competitive boost after seven years of getting hammered by competition from casinos and slot operations in Delaware, Pennsylvania and New York \u2014 especially Pennsylvania\u2019s neighborhood casinos \u2014 a period in which annual New Jersey casino revenue dropped from $5.2 billion to a barely $3 billion pace this year.\n\nAnd with polls pointing to approval Tuesday of a New York state ballot question to allow up to seven commercial casinos in the Catskills and other upstate areas, there is likely to be still more competition for Atlantic City in the near future.\n\nIMPACT ON JOBS\n\nThere are a couple of very big ifs. First, will the ability to gamble online seriously depress real visits to actual casinos to the point of stranding a lot of invested capital in a capital-intensive industry? Will it cause the loss of more jobs after 15,000 Atlantic City jobs have already disappeared? Amazon, after all, has not exactly been helpful to bookstores, and online shopping has seriously cut into big retailers.\n\nThe other big \u201cif\u201d is the idea that New Jersey will have an internet gambling lock by going all in early. Currently it\u2019s legal in Nevada, but only for poker, and in a small way in Delaware. New Jersey will allow every game permitted in Atlantic City casinos to be offered, plus any other games the Division of Gaming Enforcement allows. (There will be a \u201csoft\u201d opening Nov. 21, by invitation only, to make sure all the systems work properly).\n\nAtlantic City had a nearly 15-year monopoly on legal casinos east of the Mississippi River. Not this time. If New Jersey succeeds, bordering states and probably most if not every state with casinos will legalize it within 18 months, while tribes will press to have Indian casino compacts amended. It may take even less time to proliferate because other states can adapt and adopt the New Jersey law and regulations.\n\nThe DGE is to control this immense expansion of gambling with regulations that seem to leave many unanswered questions.\n\nHow big will this be? No one can know. One knowledgeable industry analysis in September predicted $400 million annually immediately, leveling to $350 million a year as other states with legal gambling get into it. The same analysis estimated an $8.5 billion U.S. internet gambling market in 18 states within five years. Christie\u2019s budget projects a state tax share of $160 million in the first seven months, which translates into internet gambling revenue of $1 billion in that same period \u2014 given that the internet gambling tax is set at 15 percent, almost twice the 8 percent rate levied on on-site casino revenue.\n\nThose figures may seriously underestimate the result because between commercial casinos and casinos owned by Native American tribes, there are legal casinos today in 43 states generating more than $60 billion a year in gross gambling revenue \u2014 the amount gamblers lose.\n\nBIG-TIME LOSSES\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize it \u2014 perhaps including politicians who legalize more and more of it \u2014 but measured by losses, Americans spend more money gambling legally than they do on virtually all other leisure activities taken separately or possibly even combined.\n\nThis year Americans will lose nearly $130 billion in casinos and to state lotteries \u2014 about 12 times as much as they spend on all in-theater movie tickets and more than six times the combined 2012 revenues of the NFL, Major League Baseball and the NBA.\n\nAbout 70 percent of the casino losses are in slot machine games you will soon be able to play online in New Jersey. It\u2019s all a lot of money, but for some added perspective, consider that China allows casinos only in Macau \u2014 like nearby Hong Kong, it\u2019s a special administrative region. There last year, some two dozen casinos generated more than $38 billion in gambling revenue, 10 times that in Atlantic City.\n\nThree giants of the U.S. casino industry \u2014 Wynn Resorts (Steve Wynn), MGM Resorts International and Las Vegas Sands Corporation (Sheldon Adelson), which are heavily invested in Macau \u2014 will be really interested to see what internet gambling begets in New Jersey, focused not only on the United States but also on a potential Chinese internet gambling market of 1 billion customers.\n\nCASINO IN A PURSE\n\nWhether it happens in China someday or maybe Pennsylvania next year, it is about to happen in New Jersey, where every person 21 or older with a cell phone will be able to carry a casino, in fact up to 12 casinos (the number in Atlantic City), in his pocket or her purse.\n\nBanks should be really interested because two of the ways \u2014 and they will probably become the main ways \u2014 that gamblers will be able to fund their internet casino accounts will be through credit and debit cards.\n\nTraditional credit gamblers get their credit directly from a casino and repay the casino knowing casinos don\u2019t charge interest. But much of internet gambling debt will run up on credit and debit cards, so the banks that issue those cards are about to go into the gambling business, and they charge interest.\n\nSo for banks, there may be many new cards and customers, a lot of new interest-bearing credit and lots of overdraft fee revenue on debit cards. But banks may also have a greater exposure to bad debt because effectively they, not the casinos, will be extending and collecting gambling credit.\n\nIt is going to change the world for a lot of people. How much and for how many people? We and all the other casino states and the gambling industry are going to find out soon enough throughout New Jersey.\n\nCarl Zeitz is a former member of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Star-Ledger Guest Columnist", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "atlantic-city, atlantic-city-casinos, opedSL, opinion", "title": "Internet gambling: Atlantic City's next big thing, or next train wreck?: Opinion", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Internet gambling: Atlantic City\\u0027s next big thing, or next train wreck?: Opinion\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/njvoices/index.ssf/2013/11/internet_gambling_atlanti_city.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/njv_impact/photo/13694976-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11556446\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-03T04:01:58Z\", \"author\": \"Star-Ledger Guest Columnist\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@njvoices\",\"@perspective\",\"@river\",\"atlantic-city\",\"atlantic-city-casinos\",\"opedSL\"] }", "twitter": {"description": "Americans today owe about $850 billion on credit cards, with New Jersey ranked second, after only Alaska.
