Documents released after the grand jury announcement Monday have also led to scrutiny over the actions officials took at the crime scene.\n\n\"The process is broken,\" said Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Brown family, in a press conference Tuesday. \"The process should be indicted.\"\n\nThe information grand juries receive about a case is at the discretion of prosecutor, and usually a specific charge is laid out for them to consider. In Wilson\u2019s case, the grand jury was given so much evidence, witness testimony and context to consider that it stretched into 25 separate meetings over the course of three months -- usually grand juries take only a matter of a few days. Furthermore, McCulloch did not point the secret, 12-person panel to a charge preferred by the prosecution, but rather laid out five charges for them to consider, leaving the decision about whether to prosecute up to them.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "race", "title": "Ferguson Authorities Face Criticism Over Handling of Mike Brown Case", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Troubling details in grand jury documents renew longstanding skepticism of police brutality investigations.", "title": "Ferguson Authorities Face Criticism Over Handling of Mike Brown Case", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/11/26/ferguson-authorities-face-criticism-over-handling-of-mike-brown-case", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/67/91/bd45fc7e4f509ea41e03516dbd42/141126-mccolloch-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Ferguson Authorities Face Criticism Over Handling of Mike Brown Case", "description": "Troubling details in grand jury documents renew longstanding skepticism of police brutality investigations.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Nov. 26, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Tierney Sneed,Pulse,Ferguson, Missouri,race", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Troubling details in grand jury documents renew longstanding skepticism of police brutality investigations."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf239\"", "article_summary": "Documents released after the grand jury announcement Monday have also led to scrutiny over the actions officials took at the crime scene.\nSt. Louis prosecutor Robert McCulloch is facing criticism over his handling of the grand jury investigation into the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which resulted in Brown\u2019s shooter, Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson, not being indicted.\nThe information grand juries receive about a case is at the discretion of prosecutor, and usually a specific charge is laid out for them to consider.\n\"The process is broken,\" said Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Brown family, in a press conference Tuesday.\nIn Wilson\u2019s case, the grand jury was given so much evidence, witness testimony and context to consider that it stretched into 25 separate meetings over the course of three months -- usually grand juries take only a matter of a few days."}
