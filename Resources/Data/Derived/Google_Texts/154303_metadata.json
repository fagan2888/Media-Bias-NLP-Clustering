Atrius Health was among the eleven Pioneer ACOs to receive a shared savings payment in program year 2014. The system saved Medicare close to $4.5 million, resulting in a $2.8 million return. \u201cWe have had year over year improvements on the financial side, as well as consistently very high quality scores, so we're happy with that.\u201d\n\nNot every Pioneer ACO has been so fortunate, however. Of the nineteen organizations remaining in the program, six received no shared savings payment, while Beacon Health, Dartmouth-Hitchcock ACO, and Heritage California ACO owed Medicare millions in losses.\n\nThis does not necessarily reflect on those organizations\u2019 quality or clinical performance, Brower notes. One of the problems with the ACO structure is that participants can post consistently high patient safety and care quality metrics, yet fail to meet financial benchmarks that may or may not accurately reflect their performance.\n\n\u201cThere are some unusual features of the Pioneer ACO model, which are built into the way that performance is measured,\u201d Brower explains. \u201cThe Medicare fee schedule differs based on your geographical region. The difference between the prices in that region and the national average can help or hurt an ACO regardless of how it\u2019s changing care. That does lead to some disappointing results for some participants.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is also a threshold of savings that an ACO has to achieve before it shares in savings, and there are different options you can choose,\u201d she added. \u201cAn organization that's very risk-averse might choose a higher threshold because that will protect them on the downside, and so they could generate savings but not return those savings to the ACO. Those are some of the issues that have shaped what we\u2019ve seen this year and in past years.\u201d\n\nThe difficulty in achieving return on investment has already led to a number of providers fleeing the program. Some, like Dartmouth-Hitchcock, are considering seeking their fortunes in more flexible accountable care frameworks, like the newly introduced Next Generation ACO program from Medicare.\n\n\u201cDartmouth-Hitchcock would be a good example of a system that has been more historically efficient, relative to the national Medicare average, but some of those features that I mentioned create barriers for them,\u201d Brower remarked.\n\nThe New Hampshire-based health system incurred $3.6 million in losses during the latest program year, even though the system added more than 20,000 patients and scored above average on quality metrics, noted Dr. Robert A. Greene, executive vice president and chief population health management officer, to Healthcare Finance News. The organization is considering a switch to the Next Generation program, which requires more financial risk, but also promises greater rewards.\n\n\u201cIn the Next Generation ACO framework, there are some improvements to the model that might work better for them,\u201d Brower said. \u201cSo I wasn't surprised to see that they might want to move into the Next Generation ACO model instead of staying with the Pioneer ACO program.\u201d\n\nAtrius Health is happy to keep pursuing the Pioneer path, however, which ties in well with its long-term efforts to bring more value into a lower-cost healthcare environment. \u201cOne of the things that has helped most has been our experience with value-based reimbursement and accountable payment models, which we have been doing with our commercial payers for decades,\u201d said Brower.\n\n\u201cFor our systems, Medicare was actually one of the last holdouts sticking with a traditional fee-for-service payment model. So once we were able to bring those patients and those dollars into a value-based model, it worked very well for us.\u201d\n\nMedicare patients present a slightly different challenge than commercially insured populations, Brower acknowledged, that requires a strong focus on building a continuum of care within their local communities.\n\n\u201cMedicare beneficiaries tend to use a lot more services outside of primary care than commercially insured patients,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we really did have to extend our ability to coordinate care across settings.\u201d\n\n\u201cAtrius Health is a physician practice-based delivery system. We don't own or operate acute or post-acute care facilities,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo we have to do a really good job partnering with hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in our area to better coordinate the care that our patients receive, and make sure that when they go home, they have all the services in place that they need. That has really been the focus of our work.\u201d\n\nHealth IT plays a crucial role in the community\u2019s ability to communicate effectively while managing patients across different care settings. A robust EHR infrastructure and advanced use of health information exchange ensure that patient data is available to as many providers as possible, said Brower.\n\n\u201cWe have the benefit of being on one instance of Epic, which means that all of our primary care practices and our specialists are all on one common electronic health record,\u201d she said. \u201cThat enables us to exchange and coordinate data within the Atrius Health system of care. We have also built ways to exchange information with our partnering hospitals, and are working in a similar way to try to exchange health information with our partnering skilled nursing facilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had built our own home-grown electronic health record system way back before those were commercially available, and have always pushed as much as we can around health information exchange across settings, using everything from alerts and notifications to bi-directional viewing of records between our resources and hospital systems,\u201d she added. \u201cWe will use pretty much whatever tools we can to improve the flow of health information across care settings.\u201d\n\nCommitting wholly to the accountable care way of life has been one of Atrius Health\u2019s critical factors for success, says Brower. Instead of straddling the line between fee-for-service and value-based care, which may strain healthcare organizations facing competing financial demands, Brower suggests that providers move as quickly and comprehensively into accountable care as they can.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very difficult to operate in both the fee-for-service and the global payment or value-based payment world, because those incentives are not aligned,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more payers in your market that embrace value-based payment, the easier it will be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can seem somewhat paradoxical, because it can feel that it's very risky to move so fast, especially for systems that haven\u2019t done much value-based work before, but I think it's actually less risky. I think it's harder to get results if you've only got one set of patients or one program in that model, and it actually becomes easier and less risky if you put all your eggs in one basket.\u201d\n\nWorking well with other members of the care community is also an important skill to cultivate. \u201cYou also have to have the ability to be a good partner,\u201d she stated. \u201cThat's particularly important for us, since as I mentioned, we don't own or operate hospitals or skilled nursing facilities. We have to be good partners because we need those facilities to work well with us in return.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to have a shared clinical goal and shared vision if we are to see success as an accountable care organization. So aligning and partnering with other components of the delivery system, developing common goals, and creating shared health care management programs is really important.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would also say that providers don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel,\u201d she added. \u201cThere's a lot of literature and a lot of systems like Atrius Health that have been doing this for a while, and they are very open to sharing what they've learned.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's this wonderful moment right now in healthcare with a lot of transparency and a lot of willingness to share best practices, so folks should take advantage of that and not think that they have to figure it out all on their own.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Atrius Health VP of Population Health Emily Brower shares its recipe for success with value-based reimbursement within the Pioneer Accountable Care Program.", "author": "HealthITAnalytics", "og": {"url": "http://healthitanalytics.com/news/how-to-succeed-as-a-pioneer-accountable-care-organization", "site_name": "HealthITAnalytics", "image": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/AtriusHealthTwitter.png", "type": "article", "title": "How to Succeed as a Pioneer Accountable Care Organization"}, "twitter": {"description": "Atrius Health VP of Population Health Emily Brower shares its recipe for success with value-based reimbursement within the Pioneer Accountable Care Program.", "creator": "@HITAnalytics", "image": {"src": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/AtriusHealthTwitter.png"}, "title": "How to Succeed as a Pioneer Accountable Care Organization", "site": "@HITAnalytics", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7223\"", "article_summary": "The Medicare Pioneer Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program has had its ups and downs during its first three years of life, as intrepid healthcare organizations lead the rest of the industry towards value-based reimbursement and data-driven, coordinated care.\nAt Atrius Health, however, the Pioneer ACO program is playing an important role in furthering the system\u2019s efforts to bring coordinated, high-value care to more than 675,000 patients.\nSome, like Dartmouth-Hitchcock, are considering seeking their fortunes in more flexible accountable care frameworks, like the newly introduced Next Generation ACO program from Medicare.\nAtrius Health was among the eleven Pioneer ACOs to receive a shared savings payment in program year 2014.\n\u201cThere are some unusual features of the Pioneer ACO model, which are built into the way that performance is measured,\u201d Brower explains."}
