“What we're seeing now is an unbelievable rise in the violent reaction of these criminals. Now they're getting out of their car, and they're shooting at our officers,” said Mazzeo.

Mazzeo is angry and frustrated with the these horrible crimes happening in Rochester and blames city hall for not giving the police enough resources to fight crime.

“There's been nothing more than a shell game going on in the city by moving police officers around and given the appearance that we have enough cops in the street. We don't have enough cops on the street,” said Mazzeo.

Aside from this, he emphasized that the city should help police fight violence and calling for a bigger budget.

“We can’t just listen to city hall about the public coming forward and helping. If we don't have enough cops to follow up on information that the public's giving us, it's not gonna do us any good,” said Mazzeo. “We're gonna do the best job we can but we need help. And it's not just them coming forward with information but we gotta make sure we have enough people on the street all the time.”

Mazzeo also mentioned that because they are understaffed, police officers are getting burnt out easily and that many of them don't feel safe on the job anymore.
