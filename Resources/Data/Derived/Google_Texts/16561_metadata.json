Apple will have one hell of an HQ when the Apple Campus 2 opens for business.\n\nRecently, YouTuber Matthew Roberts took everyone on an aerial tour of the construction progress at the site.\n\nSomeone was taking a liberal view of CA\u2019s marijuana laws when selecting the song for the video. What in the hell? But, that\u2019s why there are mute buttons. Turn your sound off and enjoy the view of Apple\u2019s future home.\n\nMatt eventually agreed, publishing a version with more sedate music.\n\nI feel for the person that forgets something in their car and happens to be on the other side of the building. Better pack for an overnight stay at the halfway point. In total, the campus will encompass 176 acres. Does that mean we are getting something other than a phone?\n\nJokes aside, the building is coming together. Glass with more glass and a side of glass. I\u2019m half-expecting Elon Musk to attach rockets to the thing for when Skynet goes live.\n\nYou can get an idea of the sense of scale at the 1:38 mark. A Jeep crests a hill overlooking the entire campus. Damn\u2026\n\nA few of the creature comforts at the campus will include a 100,000 square foot fitness center. Wonder what Apple would think if you showed up decked out in Android wearables?\n\nTwo parking structures will fit a combined 11,000 cars. 1,000 bikes will be available to employees on the grounds. Biking and jogging trails will be scattered throughout the grounds.\n\nWhen will it open? During the \u2018Loop Us In\u2019 event for the iPhone SE, Tim Cook mentioned 2016 would mark the last year of product launch keynotes in San Francisco. 2017 will be the grand unveiling of the Apple Campus 2 auditorium.\n\nMatthew is compiling monthly construction updates on his channel. You can compare February\u2019s progress (video titled March) with the video(s) above.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "apple campus 2, matthew roberts, construction of apple campus 2, drone video of apple campus 2, apple, drone", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "News Ledge", "description": "Apple Campus 2 is getting closer by the month.
