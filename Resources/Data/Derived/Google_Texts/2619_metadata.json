It's time for the people to take the government back.\"\n\nCarson proposed his own plan to reform health care, using health savings accounts. Each person would have their own account, and each family would act like a private insurance group, he said.

His plan includes a six-month hiatus on corporate taxes as a form of fiscal stimulus. He proposed that 10 percent of it would be used to create jobs for the unemployed and people on welfare\n\nJust ten days days after Charleston shooting, Carson reaffirmed his support of the Second Amendment, stating that the right to bear arms is essential for the people to protect themselves from the government.\n\n\"The Charleston attack has nothing to do with guns being accessible, it has to do with people having evil in their hearts,\" Carson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER\u2014No political experience?
