Asa Hutchinson said Friday.\n\nThe governor made the comments during an appearance at Politico\u2019s sixth annual State Solutions Conference in Washington, D.C., that was streamed live on the Internet. Other topics he addressed included health-care reform and medical marijuana.\n\nAn audience member asked Hutchinson why many Republican politicians dislike Trump despite his popularity with Republican voters.\n\n\u201cI believe words still mean something,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cI\u2019m held accountable for what I say \u2014 I will be held accountable for what I say today \u2014 and there shouldn\u2019t be a separate standard for Mr. Trump or anyone else.\u201d\n\nThe person who is elected president will \u201ctry to do what they\u2019ve said, so I think words have serious consequences,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think that it is a concern if any candidate shows a lack of tolerance, if any candidate demonstrates a temperament that\u2019s not going to help us elevate civil discourse in this nation,\u201d Hutchinson said.\n\nTrump has been criticized \u2014 and cheered \u2014 on the campaign trail for comments about Mexican illegal immigrants, Muslims and other groups, as well as his use of four-letter words in speeches and verbal attacks on specific individuals. Hutchinson has criticized Trump publicly for his comments about Mexicans and for saying, in reference to Arizona Sen. and former POW John McCain, \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks at the conference, Hutchinson said Trump\u2019s domination of voters\u2019 and the media\u2019s attention and the public\u2019s frustrations with Washington and the establishment have created an unprecedented dynamic.\n\n\u201cAll of the criteria that we\u2019ve used to evaluate candidates probably can be thrown out the window this year,\u201d he said.\n\nHutchinson previously supported former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and has not endorsed another candidate since Huckabee dropped out of the race.\n\n\u201cI may or may not announce any commitment in the presidential race,\u201d he said.\n\nHutchinson predicted that former Arkansas and U.S. first lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will win Arkansas\u2019 March 1 Democratic primary but will not carry Arkansas in the general election.\n\nThe governor also discussed his plans to modify the Medicaid expansion program that was established in Arkansas under the Affordable Care Act before he took office. He said he wants to change it from an entitlement program into \u201ca program that is moving people up the economic ladder and that is not a permanent state but a matter of assistance to people to have work opportunities, to get trained \u2014and to encourage employer-sponsored insurance.\u201d\n\nAsked what he would like to see a Republican president do with the Affordable Care Act, Hutchinson answered, \u201cScrap it,\u201d but then clarified that what he objects to most are the mandates on individuals and businesses.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the federal government make sure that you have the types of reform in there that allow for (requiring insurers to cover people with) pre-existing conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the exchanges \u2026 that are perhaps opportunities for individuals and businesses to access more affordable insurance. But at the same time you\u2019ve got to take away those mandates that are part of it and then give the Medicaid budget to the states in terms of flexibility, in terms of a block grant.\u201d\n\nAs an example of the flexibility he wants, Hutchinson said, \u201cI want to have work requirements, but I can\u2019t. I can have a work-training referral in place.\u201d\n\nAn audience member asked Hutchinson where he stands on a proposed ballot measure to legalize medical marijuana. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge recently approved the wording of the proposal, clearing the way for supporters to begin collecting signatures.\n\n\u201cI look to the American Medical Association and see what they say is what is needed and what is good medical practice and what patients need. Thus far, they have not said that smoking marijuana is necessary for patients\u2019 health,\u201d Hutchinson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, should be held accountable if they say things that are intolerant, Gov.
