The visit came just days after Abbott had filed his latest lawsuit against the administration, arguing the president\u2019s executive action on immigration was an unconstitutional bypass of Congress.\n\nAfter the meeting, Abbott told reporters it was neither the time nor place to bring up the legal challenge. But that doesn\u2019t mean Abbott didn\u2019t return to Austin with a few stories about holding court with his longtime political foil.\n\nSpeaking at a three-day conference for the Texas Public Policy Foundation on Thursday in Austin, Abbott took his audience inside the West Wing. Here\u2019s how it went, according to the incoming governor:\n\nAfter a day of meeting with administration officials and Cabinet members, the governor headed to the Oval Office, where Obama was waiting to shake their hands in the doorway. Abbott was last in line to greet the president, and \u201cyou have to know,\u201d Abbott told his audience, \u201che was not wanting to shake my hand.\u201d\n\nStill, they shook hands and Abbott took note of how Obama\u2019s grip was \u201ca little stiff and a little cold.\u201d A family member had suggested a zinger for Abbott to use on Obama, but the incoming governor instead went with this line: \u201cMr. President, you need to understand you\u2019re giving me trouble back.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe tightened up and you can tell, \u2018Well, you know, we\u2019ve got another smart-alec governor from Texas down here,\u201d Abbott recalled. \u201d\n\nBut Abbott didn\u2019t want his first face-to-face encounter with the president to end on that note, so he switched gears to a more personal topic.\n\n\u201cI said, you know, \u2018I have a teenage daughter one year older than your teenage daughter, and she thinks you are a whole lot funnier than I am,'\u201d Abbott recalled. \u201cYou can tell he loosened up all of a sudden. He patted me on the back and said, \u2018Oh, Greg, you know those teenage girls. They\u2019ll break your heart, but once they turn 25, they\u2019ll come right back to you.'\u201d\n\nWith things loosening up, Abbott finally headed into the Oval Office, where the six other newly elected governors were sitting on couches. Abbott settled into a position across from Obama, who suddenly made a special request.\n\n\u201cAs I go to lock down my wheels, the president pulls out the chair next to him and says, \u2018Greg\u2019 \u2014 he\u2019s loosening up now, we\u2019re kind of on a first-name basis \u2014 \u2018Greg, why don\u2019t you come sit right here by me?'\u201d Abbott recalled.\n\nRespecting the president\u2019s request, Abbott rolled over to the president and positioned himself a short distance from Obama. It was at that moment that dozens of journalists rushed in and started taking pictures of the formation \u2014 a \u201cpool spray\u201d in White House parlance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking, \u2018Man, my political career is over,'\u201d Abbott recalled.\n\nOnce the cameras left, Obama asked each guest to say a few words about how things are going in their state. First up was Rhode Island Gov.-elect Gina Raimondo, whom Abbott recalled breaking out in \u201calmost incomprehensible language\u201d as she excitedly thanked Obama for campaigning for her.\n\n\u201cAnd without skipping a beat, I immediately injected myself, spreading my arms so that my left arm was extending into the lap of the president himself, saying, \u2018What? You didn\u2019t come to Texas to campaign?'\u201d Abbott said. \u201cHe reached over and touched my arm and said, \u2018Greg, I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve helped.\u2019 I bit my tongue because I was thinking, \u2018Oh, Mr. President, it would\u2019ve helped.'\u201d\n\nWith the small talk out of the way, the president turned to a more serious topic: regulations that the governors and governors-elect believed were stifling economic growth in their states. Abbott recalled having to bite his tongue again, feeling the urge to list three easy targets: the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHowever, mindful of the outgoing Texas governor\u2019s favorite talking points, Abbott kept the suggestions to himself. After all, Abbott recalled, \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to think I was the second coming of Rick Perry.\u201d\n\nAs he finished his account of the meeting at the TPPF conference, he told the audience his office plans to submit a more extensive answer to Obama\u2019s question. He tasked members of the conservative think-tank with coming up with three federal regulations that could be repealed or reform to create jobs. He made sure he emphasized the word \u201cfederal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"vf": {"unique_id": "wp_chron_blog_chron_com_texaspolitics_1931_blogEntryId25254"}, "title": "How Abbott's meeting with Obama went, according to Abbott", "og": {"site_name": "Texas Politics", "description": "AUSTIN \u2014 Gov.-elect Greg Abbott on Thursday morning offered a lengthy account of perhaps his most unlikely meeting since being elected in November: coming face-to-face with his favorite litig\u2026", "title": "How Abbott\u2019s meeting with Obama went, according to Abbott", "url": "http://blog.chron.com/texaspolitics/2015/01/how-abbotts-meeting-with-obama-went-according-to-abbott/", "image": {"width": 920, "identifier": "http://blog.chron.com/texaspolitics/files/2015/01/abbottobama.jpg", "height": 613}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://blog.chron.com/texaspolitics/files/2015/01/abbottobama.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "NextGEN": "1.7.5", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-08T18:03:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-08T21:34:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc932\"", "article_summary": "After the meeting, Abbott told reporters it was neither the time nor place to bring up the legal challenge.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Abbott didn\u2019t return to Austin with a few stories about holding court with his longtime political foil.\n'\u201d Abbott recalled.\nHowever, mindful of the outgoing Texas governor\u2019s favorite talking points, Abbott kept the suggestions to himself.\nFirst up was Rhode Island Gov.-elect Gina Raimondo, whom Abbott recalled breaking out in \u201calmost incomprehensible language\u201d as she excitedly thanked Obama for campaigning for her."}
