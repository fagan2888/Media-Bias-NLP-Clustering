He stresses, with passion and authenticity, a commitment to addressing poverty and income inequality more than the social issues that have dominated much of the Catholic debate in America.\n\nJohn Carr, a former top official of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, notes that Francis\u2019 message on abortion is \u201cno obsession, no retreat.\u201d The pope helped broker the recent thaw in American-Cuban relations, to the consternation of conservatives such as the Florida senator Marco Rubio. Francis now is determined to make addressing climate change a moral imperative for the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Catholics.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that Francis is the poster pope for liberal Democrats: \u201cHe\u2019s challenging everybody,\u201d said Mr. Carr, now director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University. \u201cMost Democrats haven\u2019t been talking about poverty.\u201d He suggested that Francis\u2019 impact is starting to change the conversation among Democrats, along with some conservative Republicans, such as the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.\n\nStill, Francis\u2019 message is unsettling to more than a few conservatives, particularly his focus on climate change and his initiatives to influence the United Nations\u2019 conference in Paris this year. Some prominent Republicans, such as the Senate Environment Committee chairman, James Inhofe, are climate-change deniers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome Catholic business leaders have complained about Francis\u2019 emphasis on income inequality and the defects of capitalism. Kenneth G. Langone, the billionaire co-founder of the Home Depot and a major Republican donor, warned Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York that if the pope kept up the drumbeat, some wealthy Catholics might stop giving to church causes. (\u201cLiberals say popes don\u2019t know anything about sex, conservatives say they don\u2019t know anything about economics,\u201d Mr. Carr observed.) And Francis has rattled the United States church hierarchy, notably the bishops.\n\nAmerican church leaders have long been advocates for the poor and for immigrants. But these are edicts many conservatives felt could be ignored; the focus and priorities were the social issues, led by hard-line prelates such as Cardinal Raymond Burke, the former archbishop of St. Louis, who refused communion to any Catholic politicians who weren\u2019t on the right side of the abortion issue.\n\nFrancis removed Cardinal Burke as head of the Vatican\u2019s high court. The cardinal, a Francis critic, recently asserted that a \u201cfeminized\u201d church, which permits altar girls, is responsible for a shortage of priests and some of the pedophilia crimes. Equally important, the pope chose Blase J. Cupich, the progressive bishop of Spokane, Wash., to be the archbishop of Chicago, the third-largest American diocese. He succeeds Cardinal Francis George, a conservative cultural warrior.\n\nGarry Wills, a renowned historian and Catholic scholar, said the pope has sent a strong message to entrenched interests, such as those that oppose \u201cObamacare\u201d for offering contraception coverage, even though the vast majority of American Catholics practice birth control.\n\n\u201cFrancis has condemned careerism, which will make the bishops pay more attention to Catholic lives,\u201d Mr. Wills said.\n\nThe pope is set to visit the United States in September. He\u2019ll go to Philadelphia and New York and probably Washington. If so, look for a visit to the White House, as well as to a soup kitchen or some other venue that serves the poor, and he might accept Speaker John Boehner\u2019s invitation to be the first pontiff to address a joint session of Congress.\n\nPrivately, some right-wing Republicans have grumbled about this invitation, but they can\u2019t block it. It\u2019s not hard to envision an exceptional moment in the Capitol as pro-choice Democrats squirm when the pontiff celebrates the sanctity of life and Republicans wriggle when the Holy Father talks about social justice, income inequality and the moral imperative of addressing climate change.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150111120109, "twitter": {"description": "Pope Francis\u2019 commitment to addressing poverty and income inequality is changing the conversation in Washington.", "title": "A Pope That Makes Democrats Squirm and Republicans Wriggle", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/us/politics/a-pope-that-makes-democrats-squirm-and-republicans-wriggle.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003442546"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/us/politics/a-pope-that-makes-democrats-squirm-and-republicans-wriggle.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003442546", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/us/politics/a-pope-that-makes-democrats-squirm-and-republicans-wriggle.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "A Pope That Makes Democrats Squirm and Republicans Wriggle", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 11, 2015", "edt": "Global", "org": "Democratic Party", "keywords": "Popes,Francis,Roman Catholic Church,Republican Party,Democratic Party,United States Politics and Government,Income Inequality", "news_keywords": "Pope,Pope Francis", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Albert R.
