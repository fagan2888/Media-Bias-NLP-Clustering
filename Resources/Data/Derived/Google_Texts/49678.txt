Sioux Falls, SD

If you're a winter sport enthusiast it's time to grab your skates and hockey puck and hit the ice in Sioux Falls.

The Tuthill Park Outdoor Ice Rink officially opens for the season this weekend and cold temperatures did keep skaters away. Many came out for a friendly game of hockey or just to enjoy a round on the fresh ice. Even several young skaters got in some practice time.

Tuthill's Ice Rink is open 1 to 9pm during the Christmas break but closed Christmas day and 4-8 p.m. when school starts back up in January.
