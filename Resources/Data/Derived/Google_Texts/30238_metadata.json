As the Food and Drug Administration reviews thousands of public comments that were due on Aug. 1, experts weigh in on how to communicate sugar content, which has been vilified as the cause of America\u2019s ongoing obesity epidemic.\n\n\"There's been an increasing drum beat on the part of public health advocates to give consumers that information,\" Michael Jacobson, the head of nonprofit food advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest, told Reuters.\n\nThe public also demands their food be labeled properly in order to know what\u2019s been genetically modified or the welfare of the animals they\u2019re consuming. But it\u2019s sugar that has taken on the forefront of the controversial overhaul because of the push back from various food and sweetener companies along with a slew of lobbyists. \"Sugar is sugar, regardless of the source,\" Campbell Soup Company wrote in a letter to the FDA.\n\nWhat Are Added Sugars?\n\nAdded sugars are anything that doesn\u2019t sweeten from natural sources and are literally added to foods and beverages during processing or preparation. Naturally occurring sugars are found in fruits (fructose), vegetables, and certain dairy (lactose) products. Added sugar also contains white sugar, brown sugar, agave syrup, and honey.\n\nThe current laws make it easy for companies to sneak by with labels such as \u201cNo sugar added,\u201d which means there\u2019s no sugar in it but there can be artificial sugar or sugar alcohols. When you see a label that says \u201cunsweetened,\u201d it means the sugar is natural or a sugar alcohol but does not contain artificial sugars.\n\nYou know what artificial sugars are; you see them all the time by the coffee maker: Splenda, Equal, NutraSweet. They all contain aspartame, sucralose, and saccharin, which are 200 to 8,000 times sweeter than natural sugar because they\u2019re chemically manipulated.\n\nSugar alcohols are labeled as sorbitol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, and come from chemically altered plant products such as fruits and berries.\n\nThen there\u2019s the infamous high fructose corn syrup, which is processed syrup from corn and contains fructose and glucose. It\u2019s cheaper than sucrose and gives products longer shelf life, which means the United States has made it ubiquitous throughout sodas, cereals, and even whole wheat breads, and yogurts.\n\nThe amount of added sugars there are today makes the market competitive and if there\u2019s a section for \u201cadded sugars,\u201d it\u2019ll be clear who\u2019s just adding chemical copies of sugar into the food we eat. If the FDA doesn\u2019t add this new section to the back of everything we consume, remember to look for any word ending in \u201cose\u201d on the ingredients list, it\u2019s the sugar molecules' distinguishable key three letters. Watch out for dextrose, fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, and sucrose, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable why Campbell\u2019s is concerned about the label changes because as the maker of Pepperidge Farm and Prego products, added sugars would rack up quickly on the back of their packages and cans. Current label laws only require them to list the total sugar content, which clumps natural sugars and added sugars together.\n\n\"Giving consumers a false impression that reducing added sugars without reducing calories may actually delay finding a real solution the problem\" of obesity, said Lisa J. Thorsten, Campbell\u2019s director of regulatory affairs and nutrition. The World Health Organization updated their guidelines for the first time in over a decade, which recommended people cut out half of the added sugars they\u2019re eating.\n\n\"The big difference between now and then [is] we have a system to provide the guidelines,\" said Francesco Branca, the WHO's nutrition department director. \"We have credibility from the scientific point of view that make these guidelines easier to defend.\" Why do you want to watch your added sugar intake? Considering two out of three adults and one out of three children in the United States are overweight or obese, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a caloric imbalance and gap in nutrition and exercise education.\n\nA 22-year-old study published in the journal JAMA found 75 percent of the 80,000 women they analyzed had gout if they drank just one sugary drink a day. It\u2019s just one of many studies that connect sugar intake with weight gain, which is why making nutrition labels transparent is an opportunity to educate and create a healthier future for America\u2019s children. Albeit, not everyone will agree, which is what makes the sugar label a pinnacle movement for the FDA, suppliers, and consumers alike.\n\n\"The people who read labels are the people who are already watching their health and their weight. This isn't going to cause a dramatic change,\" said Baylen Linnekin, head of nonprofit Keep Food Legal and a critic of the labeling measure as well as other government involvement in the food sector, including subsidies.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nutrition, label, overhaul, fda, weighs, public, comments, about, added, sugar", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The nutrition label overhaul has gotten serious over the added sugars label dilemma.", "title": "Do You Know What 'Added Sugar' Means On Your Food Label?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nutrition-label-overhaul-fda-weighs-public-comments-about-added-sugar-296400", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/04/fda-cfda-contemplates-placing-added-sugar-their-nutrition-labels.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The nutrition label overhaul has gotten serious over the added sugars label dilemma.", "title": "Do You Know What 'Added Sugar' Means On Your Food Label?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nutrition-label-overhaul-fda-weighs-public-comments-about-added-sugar-296400", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/04/fda-cfda-contemplates-placing-added-sugar-their-nutrition-labels.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/04/fda-cfda-contemplates-placing-added-sugar-their-nutrition-labels.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-08-04T16:31:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-04T16:31:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The nutrition label overhaul has gotten serious over the added sugars label dilemma."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda12e\"", "article_summary": "Added sugar also contains white sugar, brown sugar, agave syrup, and honey.\nCurrent label laws only require them to list the total sugar content, which clumps natural sugars and added sugars together.\nThe current laws make it easy for companies to sneak by with labels such as \u201cNo sugar added,\u201d which means there\u2019s no sugar in it but there can be artificial sugar or sugar alcohols.\n\"Sugar is sugar, regardless of the source,\" Campbell Soup Company wrote in a letter to the FDA.\nAdded sugars are anything that doesn\u2019t sweeten from natural sources and are literally added to foods and beverages during processing or preparation."}
