Medicine is different. Hospitals know what they are paid by insurers, but it bears little relationship to their costs. Until now.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2014\n\nOnly in the world of medicine would Dr. Vivian Lee\u2019s question have seemed radical. She wanted to know: What do the goods and services provided by the hospital system where she is chief executive actually cost?\n\nMost businesses know the cost of everything that goes into producing what they sell \u2014 essential information for setting prices. Medicine is different. Hospitals know what they are paid by insurers, but it bears little relationship to their costs.\n\nNo one on Lee\u2019s staff at the University of Utah Health Care could say what a minute in an MRI machine or an hour in the operating room actually costs. They chuckled when she asked.\n\nBut now, thanks to a project Lee set in motion after that initial query several years ago, the hospital is getting answers, information that is not only saving money but also improving care.\n\nThe effort is attracting the attention of institutions from Harvard to the Mayo Clinic. The secretary of health and human services, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, visited last month to see the results.\n\nWhile costs at other academic medical centers in the area have increased an average of 2.9 percent a year over the past few years, the University of Utah\u2019s have declined by 0.5 percent a year. \u201cWe have bent the cost curve,\u201d Lee said.\n\nInpatient hospital costs account for nearly 30 percent of health-care spending in the United States and are increasing by a little less than 2 percent a year, adjusted for inflation, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n\nThe cost issue has taken on new urgency as the Affordable Care Act accelerates the move from fee-for-service medicine toward a system where hospitals will get one payment for the entire course of a treatment, like hospitalization for pneumonia. Medicare, too, is setting payment goals based on the value of care.\n\nUnder such a system, if a hospital does additional tests and procedures or if patients get infections or are readmitted, the hospital bears the cost. To make money, medical centers have to figure out what it actually costs to provide care and how to spend less while maintaining or improving outcomes.\n\nThe linchpin of this effort at the University of Utah Health Care is a computer program \u2014 still a work in progress \u2014 with 200 million rows of costs for items like drugs, medical devices, a doctor\u2019s time in the operating room, and each member of the staff\u2019s time. The software also tracks such outcomes as days in the hospital and readmissions. A pulldown menu compares each doctor\u2019s costs and outcomes with others\u2019 in the department.\n\nThe hospital figured, for instance, the cost per minute in the emergency room (82 cents), the surgical intensive-care unit ($1.43), and the operating room for an orthopedic-surgery case ($12).\n\nWith such information, as well as data on the cost of labor, supplies and labs, the hospital has pared back excess expenses and revised numerous practices for more efficient and effective care.\n\nMichael Porter, an economist and professor at Harvard Business School, called the accomplishments \u201cepic progress.\u201d Recently, Porter and Michael Kaplan visited Utah and concluded that the hospital group was one of the few to properly measure the costs of health care. Elsewhere, with a very few exceptions, Porter said, \u201cit\u2019s a total mess.\u201d\n\nOther institutions, including MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the Mayo Clinic, based in Rochester, Minn., are also trying to get a handle on costs.\n\n\u201cI can give you an unambiguous endorsement\u201d of the Utah system, said Dr. Russell Howerton, chief medical officer at Wake Forest Baptist Health system.\n\nIt is not easy, said Dr. Thomas Feeley, who is leading the effort at MD Anderson. His group decided to go through every single process a patient experiences and figure out what the hospital paid for each person caring for the patient.\n\nAt the Utah hospital, the group began by looking at how much supplies cost \u2014 bandages, sutures, medications. Then they started tracing use of those items to individual patients.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say I need a hip replacement,\u201d said Dr. Robert Pendleton, Utah\u2019s chief quality officer. \u201cWell, how many bandages did you use for me and how many did you use for the guy in the bed next to me and the lady in the next room who also had hip replacements?\n\n\u201cThen you can start to say, \u2018Well, wait a minute, patients who have their hips replaced by Dr. Jones are using twice as many bandages.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey added in labor costs. To figure those out, Kaplan and Porter of Harvard tell hospitals to go in to hospital rooms with a stopwatch and time how long each staff member spends on each procedure and with each patient.\n\nAt the Mayo Clinic, the stopwatch is changing practices. Instead of having doctors in the emergency department type in notes on each patient, for example, the clinic started a pilot project in using lower cost scribes.\n\nWith their new computer program, executives at the Utah hospital also are finding some simple ways to improve outcomes and reduce costs.\n\nWhen internal-medicine doctors looked at their costs per day, they were stunned to see how much they were spending on lab tests. Studies have found that 20 to 50 percent of hospital lab tests were completely unnecessary. The Utah doctors decided to require residents to justify each lab test. Orders plummeted. The hospital saved $200,000 a year.\n\nChanges also involved bypass surgery in a project led by Dr. David Bull, chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Utah. He and his colleagues asked what variables made a difference in costs and outcomes.\n\nThat led them to nine measures they called \u201cperfect care,\u201d the primary determinants of how long a patient stays in the hospital after surgery, which is a major contributor to costs and a harbinger of outcomes.\n\nThe variables included such practices as keeping blood sugar under control \u2014 75 percent of their bypass patients had diabetes \u2014 and giving oxygen to patients who are having trouble breathing when they are taken off the ventilator.\n\nThe group standardized the care after surgery with those nine items in mind, and nurses were permitted to give medications or oxygen without having to contact a doctor first.\n\nSome were skeptical the program would make a difference, Bull said. But costs fell by 30 percent because patients spent less time in the hospital and had fewer complications. Letting nurses initiate treatment meant patients got needed medications quicker, and the emphasis on \u201cperfect care\u201d meant the most important things got done.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started working in health care, like everybody I thought: \u2018Oh my God. It\u2019s such a tough problem,\u2019\u201d Porter, the Harvard economist, said. Now he has changed his mind. \u201cI have no doubt we can solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know exactly what we have to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most businesses know the cost of everything that goes into producing what they sell \u2014 essential information for setting prices.
