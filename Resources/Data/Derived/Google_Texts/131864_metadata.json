He argued that Republicans had actually hurt the economy by blocking student loan reform and hikes in the minimum wage.\n\n\"We've done well with the economy. Is it perfect? Not a chance. We have ways to go,\" Reid added.\n\nReid said that his doctors were \"very hopeful\" of being able to restore sight to his right eye, but there was a chance they might not succeed due to large blood accumulation sustained when an exercise band snapped and struck him in the face.\n\n\"As long as blood is in the eye, it's hard to see,\" Reid said, noting that he was under orders \"not to be reading a bunch of emails.\"\n\nThe recovery process will keep him from attending the Democratic retreat next week, Reid said, but the incident has not changed his mind from running for re-election in 2016.\n\nReid, who is 75, boasted that he could do 250 push-ups before his injury, and that his routine also included 250 sit-ups three days a week. \"No one has to question my physical ability,\" he said.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Harry Reid Harry Reid\n\n1 of 25 Harry Reid WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 11: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), speaks to reporters after attending the weekly Democrat policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on March 11, 2014 in Washington, DC.
