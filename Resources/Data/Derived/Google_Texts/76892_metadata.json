I am frustrated, and you have every right to be frustrated, because Congress doesn\u2019t work the way it should,\u201d Obama said, asserting that many political leaders were \u201cmore interested in scoring political points than getting things done.\u201d\n\nObama admitted his critics were right, that Washington D.C. was still broken, and he hadn\u2019t been able to fix it.\n\n\u201cI told him, you\u2019re right. It still is broken,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I reminded him that when I ran in 2008, I, in fact, did not say I would fix it; I said we could fix it. I didn\u2019t say, yes, I can; I said \u2026 \u2018Yes We Can.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe encouraged all of his wealthy supporters to get involved in their communities to promote his policies and push for policy goals that they wanted to see \u2014 such as gun control and climate change.\n\n\u201cI hope what you leave with is that sense that the unfinished business we\u2019ve got does not just depend on me, does not just depend on the next President we elect, does not just depend on any particular member of Congress \u2014 it depends on you,\u201d he concluded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama Defends Presidency: \u2018I Didn\u2019t Say Yes I Can ...
