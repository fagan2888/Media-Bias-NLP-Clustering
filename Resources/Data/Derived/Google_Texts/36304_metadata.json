In an interview in Esquire magazine, Weiner said that \u201cthe road has been paved for a mixed review, no matter what.\u201d\n\nFrom Esquire:\n\nThe road has been paved for a mixed review, no matter what. I do what I\u2019ve always done on the show and rely on the people around me. The actors, the writers, and my wife all liked it, so that\u2019s all I can go on at this point. I hate to say this \u2014 obviously ending the entire series is significantly more pressure \u2014 but it\u2019s been that way every year. I never knew if the show was coming back for most of the series, so we treated every episode 13 like it was the end. It\u2019s very bittersweet and high pressure. \u201cDid we stick the landing?\u201d\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nWeiner, like other creators of hit shows, is probably trying to manage our expectations while simultaneously assuaging our concerns over its ending. But his warning suggests that something dramatic and messy is likely to happen, and we\u2019ll still be processing it days afterward.\n\nOf course, Weiner extended Season 7 across two calendar years, airing the first half in 2014 and the second half in spring 2015. He calls this break \u201ca safety net\u201d that has dissipated some of the pressure. \u201cThe people at \u2018Breaking Bad,\u2019 \u2018Lost,\u2019 everybody told us this, too, what a safety net it is to not be off the air yet,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe all know that, whatever splitting the season meant, the true ending of the show hasn\u2019t happened yet. So yes, it will be a reunion and then after the last episode airs, that\u2019s going to be interesting.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The year separating the seasons has been \"a safety net,\" he told Esquire, but the pressure is on", "title": "Matthew Weiner on \u201cMad Men\u201d finale: \u201cThe road has been paved for a mixed review, no matter what\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The year separating the seasons has been \"a safety net,\" he told Esquire, but the pressure is on", "title": "Matthew Weiner on \u201cMad Men\u201d finale: \u201cThe road has been paved for a mixed review, no matter what\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/19/matthew_weiner_on_mad_men_finale_the_road_has_been_paved_for_a_mixed_review_no_matter_what/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/don_draper-1280x900.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The year separating the seasons has been \"a safety net,\" he told Esquire, but the pressure is on", "title": "Matthew Weiner on \u201cMad Men\u201d finale: \u201cThe road has been paved for a mixed review, no matter what\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/don_draper-1280x900.jpg", "creator": "@prachigu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Prachi Gupta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, amc, Drama, Mad Men, matthew weiner, Television", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc133\"", "article_summary": "In an interview in Esquire magazine, Weiner said that \u201cthe road has been paved for a mixed review, no matter what.\u201dFrom Esquire:The road has been paved for a mixed review, no matter what.\n\u201cMad Men\u201d creator Matthew Weiner remains tight-lipped about the ending of his critically acclaimed show about intense, chain-smoking admen, but he has revealed that the Season 7 finale will not please everyone.\nOf course, Weiner extended Season 7 across two calendar years, airing the first half in 2014 and the second half in spring 2015.\nI hate to say this \u2014 obviously ending the entire series is significantly more pressure \u2014 but it\u2019s been that way every year.\n\u201cWe all know that, whatever splitting the season meant, the true ending of the show hasn\u2019t happened yet."}
