Photographer: Craig Warga/Bloomberg\n\nBy many indicators, the recent job market is clearly improving. It still has a long way to go, but the pace of employment growth is up and unemployment has fallen sharply in recent months. Importantly, the recent decline in the jobless rate has been for the right reason: people getting jobs as opposed to people leaving the labor market (since only jobseekers are counted as unemployed, if they give up the job search, the unemployment rate is artificially lowered).\n\nStill, those in the business of disparaging the \u201cObama recovery\u201d latched onto the spike in part-time work in the last jobs report as an indicator that the silver lining has a dark cloud around it. Based on the rise in part-time jobs in June, a Wall Street Journal opinion piece complained about the \u201cdistinctive odor of hype\u201d around the widely-greeted-as-strong jobs report. The author went on to blame Obamacare for the increase in part-time jobs. Writing in the Washington Post, Robert Samuelson, while acknowledging that such data are noisy, worried that the improving labor market is really just undergoing a \u201cpart-time boom.\u201d\n\nTwo things to keep in mind when you hear such talk. First, there are two very different flavors of part-time work, voluntary and involuntary, with the latter referring to part-timers who\u2019d rather have full-time jobs. There\u2019s nothing wrong, and a lot right, with voluntary part-time work. There\u2019s not even anything wrong with affordable health care coverage allowing involuntary full-time workers to work less and still maintain coverage. That\u2019s unequivocally good!\n\nOn the other hand, there\u2019s a lot wrong with not being able to work as many hours as you\u2019d like due to the lack of gainful opportunities. So the focus on what\u2019s truly problematic in this space should be on involuntary part-time work (let\u2019s call these IPT vs. VPT). IPT rose sharply in the downturn to historically high levels\u2014at its peak in March of 2010, there were 9.2 million IPTers. As the job market has improved, that number is down 1.7 million to a still elevated 7.5 million workers.\n\nThe second thing to remember is never to make a big deal over monthly changes in the household survey data from which these part-time statistics are drawn. As Dean Baker points out around this recent part-time dust up, \u201cIf Robert Samuelson had written this piece last month, before the release of the June data, he could have been decrying the disappearance of part-time work, since the economy had lost 318,000 part-time jobs in the prior two months.\u201d According to White House economists, \u201cIn the recovery itself 88 percent of the jobs added have been full time, and that number is 99 percent in the last year.\u201d\n\nSo, if we want to get the actual skinny on what\u2019s going on here we need to a) switch to quarterly data to average out some of the monthly bips and bops, and b) compare, over the course of the recovery, the path of IPT and VPT. And that\u2019s just what I\u2019ve done!\n\nThe figure indexes both series to 100 starting in the last quarter of the recession, 2009q2. Thus, the lines tell you the cumulative percent change in both series.\n\n\n\nSource: BLS\n\nOver the five years of the recovery thus far, VPT is essentially unchanged while IPT is down almost 20 percent. That\u2019s certainly the pattern you\u2019d expect in recoveries, as the IPTs try to increase their hours compared to the VPTs who want to work part-time.\n\nThe White House Council of Economic Advisers just published this (pretty messy) graph showing how this recession/recovery compares with others for IPTs (\u201cNBER-defined trough\u201d means the end of the recession/beginning of the recovery). While the IPT increased more in this recession, as you\u2019d expect given its depth relative to past downturns, its trajectory since then has been about average.\n\nIPT OVER PREVIOUS RECESSIONS/RECOVERIES\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s just not that much to see here, folks. We had a wicked bad downturn wherein millions couldn\u2019t find the hours of work they sought. The recovery is slowly\u2014too slowly\u2014helping to repair some of that damage. Though we may ultimately see some impact of the employer health care mandate on part\u2013time work, that mandate isn\u2019t even in place yet, and the data are not showing anything to that effect at this point.\n\nIf those facts don\u2019t fit your ideology, I\u2019m sorry, but while you\u2019ve certainly got a right to your own opinion, you don\u2019t have a right to your own facts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's still a way to go in this jobs recovery, but it's misleading to argue that all the new jobs are part-time.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "There's still a way to go in this jobs recovery, but it's misleading to argue that all the new jobs are part-time.", "title": "Yes, some people are working part-time.
