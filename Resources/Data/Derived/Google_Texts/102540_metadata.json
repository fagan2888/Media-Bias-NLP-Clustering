The paper describes previous findings and reiterates the harmful effects that prolonged smoking has on teens.\n\n\u201cIt is important to alert the public that using marijuana in the teen years brings health, social, and academic risk,\u201d said lead author and NIDA Director Dr. Nora D. Volkow. \u201cPhysicians in particular can play a role in conveying to families that early marijuana use can interfere with crucial social and developmental milestones and can impair cognitive development.\u201d\n\nThe research also suggests that since a teen brain is growing rapidly during this stage of life, marijuana use effects teens more. Critical thinking skills and memory functions are also impaired and their deficits will continue to show even a few days after use. According to a news release, a NIDA-supported 2013 Monitoring the Future Survey found that 6.5 percent of 12th graders reported daily or near-daily marijuana use. And 60 percent of teens don\u2019t think that regular marijuana use can be harmful.\n\nThe news release stated that the authors of this review looked into areas where little research had been previously conducted. Those areas included the consequences of secondhand marijuana smoke, the long-term impact of prenatal marijuana exposure, the therapeutic potential of the individual chemicals found in the marijuana plant, and the effects of marijuana legalization policies on public health. The review emphasizes that marijuana is likely to become more widely used for medical and recreational purposes as more states push for its legalization. With this push, the researchers said, will also be an increase in teens suffering from negative health consequences of marijuana use.\n\nMarijuana is the most commonly abused illegal drug in the United States. Some advocates argue that legalizing it would increase revenue and decrease crimes associated with it. However, those opposing argue that the legalization would open doors to other illegal drugs. In a CNBC roundup as to why marijuana should not be legalized the author points out that \u201cmarijuana is currently the leading cause of substance dependence other than alcohol in the U.S,\u201d leading to other abuse issues and dependence.\n\nThe review also points out that NIDA watches legislative decisions closely to monitor the changes they will need to make regarding drug policy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nida, marijuana, nih", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Prolonged marijuana use has been lined to negative health consequences in teens \u2014 a new NIDA review describes previous findings.", "title": "Marijuana Use Now Linked To Low IQ In Teens", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/marijuana-use-linked-low-iq-teens-new-research-published-says-smoking-pot-impairs-critical-thinking", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/shutterstock156421694.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Prolonged marijuana use has been lined to negative health consequences in teens \u2014 a new NIDA review describes previous findings.", "title": "Marijuana Use Now Linked To Low IQ In Teens", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/marijuana-use-linked-low-iq-teens-new-research-published-says-smoking-pot-impairs-critical-thinking", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/shutterstock156421694.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/shutterstock156421694.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-06-05T16:06:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-05T16:06:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Prolonged marijuana use has been lined to negative health consequences in teens \u2014 a new NIDA review describes previous findings."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe246d\"", "article_summary": "Critical thinking skills and memory functions are also impaired and their deficits will continue to show even a few days after use.\nThe paper describes previous findings and reiterates the harmful effects that prolonged smoking has on teens.\nThe news release stated that the authors of this review looked into areas where little research had been previously conducted.\nWith this push, the researchers said, will also be an increase in teens suffering from negative health consequences of marijuana use.\nThe review also points out that NIDA watches legislative decisions closely to monitor the changes they will need to make regarding drug policy."}
