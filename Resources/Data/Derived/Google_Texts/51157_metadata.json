As in, whenever a hacker decides to crack the government\u2019s security code, the information of everyone who has ever signed up for (or considered using) healthcare through healthcare.gov will be there for the taking.\n\nThe Associated Press reported on Monday that the Multidimensional Insurance Data Analytics System (MIDAS) used by the government to store patient information doesn\u2019t follow best practices\u2014which is, as one expert told the AP, to delete sensitive information once it\u2019s no longer needed.\n\nMIDAS is holding onto names and birthdays, passport numbers, social security numbers, and more. So a breach would be devastating to users. The AP notes that the government hasn\u2019t disclosed how many people would be affected by a MIDAS data breach, but that the number is likely very high:\n\nIn a section that asks how many individuals have personal data in the system, the administration\u2019s privacy assessment says \u201c1 million or more.\u201d It\u2019s probably a lot more. In addition to the 10 million currently enrolled, MIDAS also keeps information on former customers, on consumers who started applications but never finished them and on people determined eligible for Medicaid. The administration says \u201c1 million or more\u201d is a standard category \u2014 but won\u2019t specify the number.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised by problems with the Obamacare website.\n\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report on healthcare.gov back in September 2014 looking at the \u201cActions Need to Address Weakness in Information Security and Privacy Controls.\u201d That document notes some of MIDAS\u2019s shortcomings, explaining that a review of MIDAS doesn\u2019t look closely enough at the security of users\u2019 private information. Because of that, said the report authors, \u201cIt will be difficult for [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] to demonstrate that it has assessed the potential for [personally identifiable information] to be displayed to users, among other risks, and taken steps to ensure that the privacy of that data is protected.\u201d\n\nMIDAS has seen even harsher criticism from outside the Administration, notably from former Social Security Administration Commissioner Michael Astrue, who has written repeatedly about the privacy implications of the government healthcare site. He wrote in the Weekly Standard about how frustrating it\u2019s been for him to talk to officials about the system:\n\nWhile HHS has been secretive about MIDAS, this central repository contains more than just the names, addresses, incomes, and Social Security numbers of millions of Americans. It also includes data of great value to cybercriminals, such as telephone numbers and email addresses. Moreover, according to a publicly available draft document of the National Archives and Records Administration, MIDAS includes notes on conversations between teleservice employees and callers to HealthCare.gov\u2019s toll-free number.\n\nThe government, however, is denying the AP\u2019s claims. In an email to Fusion, Aaron Albright of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said that \u201cthe privacy and security of consumers\u2019 information is a top priority,\u201d adding:\n\nOperational and analytical databases are a part of any operation, and Marketplace data is protected by stringent security measures that adhere to industry best practices and meet or exceed federal standards\u2026 a data retention policy drafted by the National Archives Records Administration is currently undergoing public comment; as proposed, the policy would not retain records permanently, but destroy this data after ten years.\n\nAlbright mentioned that \u201cthe current proposal from NARA calls for inactive Marketplace records to be deleted after ten years,\u201d and that \u201conce the comment period closes\u2026 CMS will destroy MIDA records consistent with that schedule.\u201d\n\nBut, as Rusty Foster pointed out in the New Yorker last year, the government is generally terrible at the Internet\u2014for example, the FBI spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade a terrible computer system, but ultimately abandoned the project before it was ever used. In 2013, Reuters\u2019 Scot J. Paltrow and Kelly Carr noted in detail the Pentagon\u2019s ineffective bookkeeping tactics. From Reuters:\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s record-keeping tangle not only increases the potential for errors; it also forces [the Defense Finance and Accounting Service] to depend heavily on \u201cmanual workarounds,\u201d another source of errors\u2026 staff often must transcribe information from one system onto paper, carry it to another office, and hand it off to other workers who then manually enter it into other systems.\n\nErrors from this system meant veterans were often shortchanged on wages. And, most recently, a hack into the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) exposed the personal information of millions of government employees who don\u2019t even know what information was stolen.\n\nTo be fair, some private companies (like Sony) aren\u2019t any better at keeping documents secure.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "Healthcare.gov, the famously\u00a0ill-executed\u00a0web portal for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health care exchange, is once again under fire, this time for apparently using a database that stores user information indefinitely\u2014as in, forever.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "Healthcare.gov, the famously\u00a0ill-executed\u00a0web portal for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health care exchange, is once again under fire, this time for apparently using a database that stores user information indefinitely\u2014as in, forever.", "title": "How Insecure Is the Medical Database Used by Healthcare.gov?", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/150714/how-insecure-is-the-medical-database-used-by-healthcare-gov/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i2.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-15-at-3-03-42-pm.png?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Healthcare.gov, the famously\u00a0ill-executed\u00a0web portal for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health care exchange, is once again under fire, this time for apparently using a database that stores user", "title": "How insecure is the medical database used by Healthcare.gov?", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/150714/how-insecure-is-the-medical-database-used-by-healthcare-gov/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-15-at-3-03-42-pm.png?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Health,Tech,Terrorism,Internet,USA"}, "article_summary": "MIDAS is holding onto names and birthdays, passport numbers, social security numbers, and more.\nMoreover, according to a publicly available draft document of the National Archives and Records Administration, MIDAS includes notes on conversations between teleservice employees and callers to HealthCare.gov\u2019s toll-free number.\nHealthcare.gov, the famously ill-executed web portal for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health care exchange, is once again under fire, this time for apparently using a database that stores user information indefinitely\u2014as in, forever.\nThe Associated Press reported on Monday that the Multidimensional Insurance Data Analytics System (MIDAS) used by the government to store patient information doesn\u2019t follow best practices\u2014which is, as one expert told the AP, to delete sensitive information once it\u2019s no longer needed.\nIt also includes data of great value to cybercriminals, such as telephone numbers and email addresses."}
