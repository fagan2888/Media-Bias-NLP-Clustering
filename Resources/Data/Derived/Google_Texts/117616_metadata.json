A nationwide survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found the unexpected contraceptive approach of female sterilization is almost as frequently used as birth control pills.\n\nOpting for surgery seems extreme \u201cuntil you start to peel back the layers and intricacies around forming a family,\u201d Dr. Vanessa Cullins, vice president of external medical affairs at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, who was not involved in the study, told Time. \u201cConsider the fact that the majority of women in this country have had the number of children they want to have by [their] mid-20s to 30, or so \u2014 and they still have the capacity to get pregnant until they are 50 years old.\u201d\n\nThe dangers of becoming pregnant continue to increase significantly after the age of 30, when many women have already given birth to the amount of kids they want. There are roughly 20 years between that time and when she physically can\u2019t anymore because of menopause. According to Cullins, the majority of women who ask about sterilization don\u2019t want to deal with other contraceptive methods, especially those that require maintenance.\n\nNearly 62 percent of women in the U.S. between the ages of 15 and 44 use some form of contraceptive. The survey found that between 2011 and 2013, 16 percent of women were using birth control pills while 15.5 percent were choosing female fertilization. Male condoms came in third place with 9.4 percent of couples using them during sex, and long-acting reversible contraceptives such as intrauterine devices (IUD) came in last at 7.2 percent. Experts are expecting IUDs to become more popular as the industry makes them more affordable, although younger sexually active women between the ages of 15 and 24 were less likely to use them.\n\nFemale fertilization appeals more to middle-aged women because of its reassuring statistics. Less than one out of every 100 women who are sterilized become pregnant, meaning it provides a lifetime of reliability. It\u2019s commonly known as a woman getting her \"tubes tied\" because her fallopian tubes are literally cut or blocked. The tubes lead to the woman\u2019s ovaries, and into the uterus or womb. If the sperm can\u2019t cross the tubes, it\u2019s not possible for them to fertilize the egg and conceive a pregnancy.\n\nSource: Daniels K, Daugherty J, Jones J.
