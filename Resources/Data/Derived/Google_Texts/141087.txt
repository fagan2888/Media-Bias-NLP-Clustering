Michelle Nunn — the Democrat running in the very close U.S. Senate contest in Georgia — has a problem on her hands now that an exhaustive campaign plan drafted by aides has leaked in the media.

The document, revealed online Monday by the National Review, describes the candidate’s liabilities likely to be exploited by opponents. It also specifically describes the necessity of raising money from Jews, Asians and gays while working to increase turnout of African-Americans and Latinos.

Speaking of the Jewish community, the document notes: “There is tremendous financial opportunity.”

“Michelle’s position on Israel will largely determine the level of support here,” the document states, with a goal of raising $250,000.

The campaign document also calls for staffers to produce “pushback documents” on “each identified vulnerability in Michelle’s record, as well as common attacks frequently leveled against Democratic Senate candidates.”

Topics the campaign expects could be used against her: the activities of Points of Light, the non-profit she leads, and the salary she earns; the notion that she is “too liberal,” a “rubber stamp for Democrats,” “Obama’s/Harry Reid/Nancy Pelosi Best Friend,” “not a ‘real’ Georgian,” and is “a lightweight.”

Problematic issues the campaign should be ready for, the document notes, include Obamacare, gay marriage and guns.

The 144-page memo appears to have been written by Democratic strategist Diane Feldman.

Nunn is running against Republican David Perdue. The Real Clear Politics Average has Purdue leading 43.7 percent to 42 percent.
