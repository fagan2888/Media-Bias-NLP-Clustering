On Saturday, as part of the Y\u2019s Dig Dance series, Helena Franzen, Ir\u00e9ne Hultman, My Lindblad and SU-EN Butoh Company gathered for a 10 p.m. performance \u2014 not exactly midnight, but close enough \u2014 celebrating Swedish culture.\n\nLeading off was Ms. Hultman, a veteran of the Trisha Brown Dance Company, in \u201cUntitled 3: Indulgent Dance 1,\u201d in which she paid homage to Ms. Brown and to her own devotion to dance. (The previous two \u201cUntitled\u201d solos were created in 1988 and the late \u201990s.) Sweeping across the stage, Ms. Hultman, at once loose and taut as she dropped into soft pli\u00e9s with rounded arms only to snap her spine straight into a composed fourth position, brought spellbinding contrasts to the foreground. Both vigorous and detailed, embellishing her silky torso with ornate hands and fingers, she performed to Scarlatti and Kurt Elling\u2019s \u201cNature Boy\u201d and spoke, explaining that she wanted to \u201cdance like you sing in the shower.\u201d\n\nThe next offerings were just as intimate and full of precise dancing, of which the most elegantly embroidered was Ms. Lindblad\u2019s \u201cWhere the Magic Happens,\u201d a duet for herself \u2014 six months pregnant \u2014 and Stuart Shugg, another Trisha Brown dancer. Starting in near darkness, the light grew increasingly radiant as the performers, using their natural momentum in an array of seamless undulations of tilts and dips, mirrored each other and drew apart. It was spine-tingling: understated, yet grippingly full of sensation.\n\n\u201cZOWA ZOWA,\u201d by the Swedish choreographer and Butoh artist SU-EN, is named after a Japanese onomatopoeic expression that refers to shuddering or trembling. Wearing a red dress while making gurgling and fluttering sounds with her mouth, SU-EN took on the mannerisms of a bird with quivering legs and hands held in loose fists. Intermittently compelling and rambling, this improvised solo fought for its shape, just as Ms. Franzen\u2019s overlong \u201cTremolo,\u201d set to a score by Jukka Rintamaki, also struggled to sustain itself.\n\nMs. Franzen, hovering close to the floor, demonstrated her strength and tenacity while balancing on the balls of her feet, knees bent, as her articulate spine guided her into an ongoing chain of precarious shapes. Vaguely alien with translucent skin blending into her pale hair, Ms. Franzen was, hauntingly, the human visualization of a tremolo: wavering, unsteady, yet never falling off course.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20150511164615, "twitter": {"description": "Four dancers celebrate Swedish culture with offerings of elegance, strength and tenacity.", "title": "Review: \u2018The Nordic Body\u2019 Moves at 92nd Street Y", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/arts/dance/review-the-nordic-body-moves-at-92nd-street-y.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003677151"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/arts/dance/review-the-nordic-body-moves-at-92nd-street-y.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003677151", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/arts/dance/review-the-nordic-body-moves-at-92nd-street-y.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "arts/dance", "hdl_p": "A Sweeping Tour of Sweden Onstage", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/dance/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 11, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "SU-EN Butoh Co", "keywords": "Dancing,92nd Street Y,SU-EN Butoh Co,Shugg  Stuart,Lindblad  My (1980- ),Hultman  Irene,Franzen  Helena,Lindblad  My,SU-EN Butoh Company", "news_keywords": "Dance", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Gia Kourlas", "SCG": "dance", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Franzen, Helena", "byl": "By GIA KOURLAS", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Four dancers celebrate Swedish culture with offerings of elegance, strength and tenacity.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Four dancers celebrate Swedish culture with offerings of elegance, strength and tenacity.", "CG": "arts", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 11, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "Dance", "modified": "2015-05-14", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/dance/index.jsonp", "tag": "Franzen, Helena", "published": "2015-05-11", "section-taxonomy-id": "C5BFA7D5-359C-427B-90E6-6B7245A6CDD8"}, "slug": "12nordicsdance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150514115108, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/arts/dance/review-the-nordic-body-moves-at-92nd-street-y.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Four dancers celebrate Swedish culture with offerings of elegance, strength and tenacity.", "title": "Review: \u2018The Nordic Body\u2019 Moves at 92nd Street Y"}, "pdate": 20150511, "des": "Dancing", "articleid": 100000003677151, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Review: \u2018The Nordic Body\u2019 Moves at 92nd Street Y", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Leading off was Ms. Hultman, a veteran of the Trisha Brown Dance Company, in \u201cUntitled 3: Indulgent Dance 1,\u201d in which she paid homage to Ms. Brown and to her own devotion to dance.\nVaguely alien with translucent skin blending into her pale hair, Ms. Franzen was, hauntingly, the human visualization of a tremolo: wavering, unsteady, yet never falling off course.\nMs. Franzen, hovering close to the floor, demonstrated her strength and tenacity while balancing on the balls of her feet, knees bent, as her articulate spine guided her into an ongoing chain of precarious shapes.\n\u201cThe Nordic Body: Choreographers From the Land of the Midnight Sun\u201d was one of the 92nd Street Y\u2019s more unusual evenings and not merely because of the free cocktails provided by the Consulate General of Sweden.\nSweeping across the stage, Ms. Hultman, at once loose and taut as she dropped into soft pli\u00e9s with rounded arms only to snap her spine straight into a composed fourth position, brought spellbinding contrasts to the foreground."}
