The investigation revealed that tens of thousands of dollars regularly flowed between the foundation bank account, Willis\u2019s personal account, and his campaign account, with over 40,000 staying in his personal account.\n\nThe investigation also confirmed reporting by the Atlanta Journal Constitution that exposed the fact that the foundation did not have tax exempt status, even as it collected donations under that pretense.\n\nAtlanta Progressive News also revealed that Willis had thousands of dollars in unpaid liens during his time as a Council Member. The liens resulted from his failure to pay federal income taxes, property taxes, corporate taxes, garbage bills, and legal fines.\n\nhttp://atlantaprogressivenews.com/2013/06/20/councilman-willis-failed-to-disclose-donations-has-numerous-liens-faces-new-state-ethics-complaint/\n\nDuring his tenure on the City Council, Willis was fined repeatedly for failing to report campaign donations properly and on time.\n\nBut none of this came up at a June 09, 2015 meeting of the Community Development and Human Resources Committee, which approved the appointment, sending it to a full council vote.\n\n\u201cPeople said they expected fireworks at that meeting,\u201d William Perry, director of Common Cause Georgia, a government watchdog organization, told APN.\n\n\u201cThis Mayor uses this office as a bully pulpit. He\u2019s admitted that. Everybody down there [on the City Council] picks their battles,\u201d Perry said.\n\nIn an appalling display, not only did every Council Member on the Committee, with the exception of Dickens, support the appointment; they veritably fawned over Willis as he sat before them.\n\nCouncilwoman Cleta Winslow (District 4), who is currently under investigation for a vrtiery of apparent ethics violations herself, talked at length about a jazz band performance in which Willis\u2019s daughter played, gushing over the quality of the music, before abruptly making a motion to approve his appointment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you here and glad that you are willing to serve. Although Councilman Dickens is doing a fine job I wish there were space for both of you here because your voice and presence are truly missed,\u201d Keisha Lance Bottoms (District 11), also a close ally of Mayor Reed who recently was appointed head of the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority, told Willis.\n\n\u201cMany people in your position would ride off into the sunset and make bags of money. But you have ardently, perhaps somewhat foolishly, decided to come back and fulfill your heart\u2019s desire yet again and serve the public,\u201d Michael Bond, who recently settled with Atlanta\u2019s Ethics Office for various ethical violation, quipped before telling Willis that he looked happier and slimmer.\n\nDickens, who chairs the committee, was the only one to strike a different tone.\n\n\u201cRight now is a critical time with the Land Bank Authority, as you know, as all of us know. And the work that is being done there and that will be done there as it relates to affordable housing, to redevelop and make the future happen that we want to see in these areas, it\u2019s going to be critical that we do that right,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt this time I will not support the nomination. Just because of the same thoughts I had eighteen months ago that were expressed by myself and the public. It\u2019s still, it\u2019s been a short time for me,\u201d Dickens concluded.\n\nThen the committee voted 6-1 to approve the appointment of Lamar Willis to the Atlanta Land Bank Authority. Voting yea were Kwanza Hall (District 2), Ivory Young (District 3), Winslow, Bottoms, Joyce Sheperd (District 12), and Bond.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s an endgame to this appointment. What it is, I don\u2019t know. But you can bet it will benefit Kasim Reed and his allies,\u201d Perry said.\n\nPerry does not support appointing \u201csomeone riddled with ethics violations. That\u2019s not someone you put in a position of public trust, especially after the voters have rejected him. So you have to figure there is some advantage being gained.\u201d\n\nBetter Georgia, a progressive advocacy organization, has circulated a petition calling on the mayor to withdraw Willis\u2019s appointment. As of press time, 462 people had signed.\n\nhttp://act.bettergeorgia.org/sign/mayor-reeds-new-appointment-former-attorney-who-was-disbarred-taking-30000-injured-child/\n\nCommon Cause Georgia is not tackling this issue directly, but Perry said he encourages members of the public to speak out.\n\n\u201cPublic pressure is the one thing that can overcome fear of political consequence. I think at the end of the day if enough Council Members hear from their real constituents, actual people who are sickened by this appointment, it will make a difference,\u201d Perry said.\n\nThe City Council will vote on the appointment at the Full Council Meeting on Monday, June 12, 2015.\n\n(END/2015)", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.8"}, "article_summary": "(APN) ATLANTA \u2014 Disgraced former Atlanta City Councilman Lamar Willis (Post 3-at-large) could soon assume a public leadership position once again.\nhttp://atlantaprogressivenews.com/2013/06/20/councilman-willis-failed-to-disclose-donations-has-numerous-liens-faces-new-state-ethics-complaint/During his tenure on the City Council, Willis was fined repeatedly for failing to report campaign donations properly and on time.\nThen the committee voted 6-1 to approve the appointment of Lamar Willis to the Atlanta Land Bank Authority.\nThe City Council will vote on the appointment at the Full Council Meeting on Monday, June 12, 2015.\nThe appointment must be approved by City Council before taking effect."}
