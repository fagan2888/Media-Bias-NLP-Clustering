That is well-chronicled.\n\nThe tabloids have splashed headlines about torrid affairs, including one with a lobbyist.\n\nAnd, of course, he cries in public.\n\nBut is there more to the personal story of House Speaker John Boehner that would explain his funding of Obamacare and the president\u2019s executive action providing amnesty for millions of illegal aliens in his budget accommodation with Democrats?\n\nEnter the ubiquitous Matt Drudge who tweeted Friday: \u201cObama got EVERYTHING. NSA dirt on Boehner must be incredible. Chicago wins.\u201d\n\nMatt Drudge is not some blogger. He\u2019s the man who told the world about the \u201cblue dress\u201d that ultimately got Bill Clinton impeached.\n\nEarlier this year, Boehner hinted about retirement, saying: \u201cListen, I can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019m going to be 65 years old in November. I never thought I\u2019d live to be 60 so I\u2019m living on borrowed time.\u201d\n\nWND EXCLUSIVE: Boehner and McConnell must go: Joseph Farah asks, \u2018Are you ready to start the Republican revolution?\u2019\n\nSome members of his caucus predicted with near-certainty he would not seek to remain as speaker in 2015. In February he bought a condo in Florida, adding to the speculation about leaving office.\n\nBut Boehner doesn\u2019t appear to be going anywhere soon \u2013 not willingly anyway.\n\nMore to the point, why is Boehner enabling Obama after Republicans won more seats in the House and took control of the Senate?\n\nIs it blackmail, as Drudge suggests?\n\nRepublican officeholders are especially vulnerable to moral lapses, while it seems to have little effect on Democrats unless, like Anthony Weiner, they become a political distraction and embarrassment.\n\nIs Boehner being blackmailed? Sound off in the WND Poll.\n\nIn September 2010, the Huffington Post promised the New York Times was preparing a bombshell expos\u00e9 on a reported Boehner affair with Lisbeth Lyons, the lobbyist for the American Printing Association.\n\n\u201cInsiders on Capitol Hill are buzzing about an upcoming New York Times expos\u00e9 that will detail an alleged Boehner affair,\u201d the HuffPost story said. \u201cSources say the Times is looking for the right time to drop the story in October to sway the election, similar to how the Times reported during the 2008 presidential campaign on an alleged John McCain affair that supposedly had taken place many years before and that was flatly denied by the woman in question.\u201d\n\nWhen a blogger asked Boehner about the story, he ignored it. Lyons, too, was tight-lipped, saying: \u201cAs you can imagine, I was stunned by such a question. I found it to be highly insulting, particularly as a female political professional, as well as unfounded. Beyond that, I have no further comment on the matter.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 He drinks a bit.
