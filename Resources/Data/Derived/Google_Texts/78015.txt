Health insurance options are fewer in North Central Washington with the announcement that Premera Blue Cross and its subsidiary, LifeWise Health Plan of Washington are dropping out of the market. The decision will affect Chelan, Douglas, Kittitas and Grant Counties as well as several others around the State. The change affects about 17,000 people, and leaves two counties with a single insurer in the exchange Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Yakima, along with Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Dave Reichert and Jaime Herrera Beutler sent a letter to the state Office of the Insurance Commissioner raising concerns about the insurance companies’ decision as well as the Affordable Care Act. They raised concerns about proposed increases in insurance costs. The state is reporting the rates are increasing between 7.4 percent and 20 percent depending on the insurer. “Cancelled plans, fewer choices and rising insurance premiums were not the promises the Affordable Care Act made to Americans,” Newhouse stated. “The news of insurers exiting the Washington exchange is the inevitable result of the disastrous government-centered health law.”
