That\u2019s the debate surrounding one of the five ballot measures Missouri voters will decide next month. Supporters and opponents are campaigning and spending money on efforts to both pass and kill the proposal that could limit regulations on farming and ranching.\n\nRadio version of \"Right to Farm\" ballot measure feature\n\nOrigins and journey of 'Right to Farm'\n\nIn November 2010, Missouri voters narrowly approved a statute called the Puppy Mill Cruelty Prevention Act, known at the time as \u201cProposition B,\u201d with the bulk of the \u201cyes\u201d votes coming from the St. Louis and Kansas City areas and most of the \u201cno\u201d votes from rural Missouri. Many dog breeders in Missouri are primarily farmers who took breeding up as a side business, or who transitioned to doing it full-time because it proved more lucrative.\n\nFive months later, during the 2011 legislative session, Republican lawmakers and Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon agreed on a bill that dropped the phrase \"puppy mills\" and undid most of the new rules in the voter-approved law, including a 50-dog limit per breeder.\n\nThat led to a broader push by GOP leaders and various agriculture interests to install the right to farm and ranch within the Missouri Constitution. They voiced numerous concerns, one being that following the example of the 50 dog-per-breeder rule, animal rights and environmental groups might go to court to try and limit the number of farm animals a person could own. Several variations of the proposal were floated in the Missouri House and Senate until one was finally passed by both chambers last year \u2013 House Joint Resolutions 11 and 7, now known as Constitutional Amendment 1. Veterinarian Dr. Alan Wessler is vice president of Missouri Farmers Care, an alliance of several agricultural interests that\u2019s backing the Right-to-Farm amendment. He says it\u2019s needed to combat activist groups with \u201cdeep pockets and zeal,\u201d but who don\u2019t understand animal agriculture or crop production.\n\n\u201cA lot of our producers, whether they\u2019re Farm Bureau or Cattlemen, Pork producers (or) Corn, are such size that they can\u2019t handle lawsuits that take a lot of money,\u201d Wessler said. \u201c(The) farming rights amendment will help prevent that.\u201d\n\nConstitutional Amendment 1 states in part that the right to farm and ranch cannot be infringed upon and shall be \u201cforever guaranteed.\u201d It was originally sponsored in the Missouri House by state Rep. Bill Reiboldt, R-Neosho.\n\n\u201cIt gives Missouri farm families the constitutional guarantee that they\u2019ll be able to continue what they\u2019ve always done all their lives,\u201d Reiboldt said, \u201cand that is to humanely raise their livestock, (raise crops), and to farm without the interference of out-of-state groups who might come in and try to, in some way, disrupt our agricultural farming practices.\u201d\n\nOpposition to 'Right to Farm'\n\nOpponents of Constitutional Amendment 1 strongly disagree. At a rally last month at the state capitol, approximately 50 people argued that the \u201cright to farm\u201d amendment is a smokescreen designed to benefit large corporations that engage in large-scale farming and animal-producing operations. Wes Shoemyer is a former Democratic state senator who\u2019s treasurer for the main opposition group, Missouri\u2019s Food for America. He says the right-to-farm amendment would primarily benefit one corporation \u2013 Smithfield, a pork producer formerly based in Virginia that was purchased last year by Hong Kong-based Shuanghui International Holdings Limited, now known as W.H. Group Limited.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very basic,\u201d Shoemyer said. \u201cDo we want family farmers and our consumers in control of our food source, or do we want to rely on foreign corporations to be controlling our food supply, (one in particular) who answer to a communist government, or do we want family farmers? You\u2019re gonna vote \u2018no\u2019 if you want family farmers.\u201d\n\nShoemyer says Smithfield\u2019s parent company already owns 27 percent of the pork produced in the United States, and that it has plans to build more concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs in Missouri.\n\nRepresentatives for Smithfield and its parent company have so far not responded to requests for a comment.\n\nIn addition, former Missouri Lt. Gov. Joe Maxwell, who\u2019s with the Humane Society of the United States, contends that the proposal would benefit St. Louis-based Monsanto and make it harder for small family farms to avoid using genetically modified organisms. Charla Lord, a spokesperson for Monsanto, says, though, that they are neutral on the proposed amendment and are not donating any money to its supporters.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolyn Amparan of the Missouri Chapter of the Sierra Club, Osage Group, says the ballot measure could give agribusinesses the right to challenge state and local pollution laws in court.\n\n\u201cMissouri has had clean water laws for over 40 years, and other anti-pollution laws as well, and farming in Missouri has continued to grow and prosper,\u201d Amparan told the amendment\u2019s opponents at last month\u2019s rally. \u201cLet\u2019s not let agribusiness or puppy mill owners control our state \u2026 we want the freedom for our voters to decide what is right for the state of Missouri and when it comes to the safety of our food, our water, our air, and our soil.\u201d\n\nBut Reiboldt disagrees. He says the proposed amendment is not about protecting corporate farms, CAFOs, genetically engineered crops or losing local control.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar to the right to bear arms, and that\u2019s what this amendment does,\u201d Reiboldt said. \u201cConstitutionally it gives us that right to continue our farming operations without being disrupted from the outside; and then if, it\u2019s ever challenged in the courts, we have that constitutional guarantee that will work in our favor, and we believe that that is huge.\u201d\n\nErin Morrow Hawley, an associate professor at the University of Missouri School of Law, teaches courses in both agricultural and environmental law. She says it would be up to the courts to determine the scope of the amendment if it\u2019s passed, but she also doesn\u2019t think passage would lead to a \u201cfloodgate\u201d of lawsuits.\n\n\u201cSome of the local zoning laws might be subject to challenge under the constitutional amendment, but I don\u2019t see a \u2018floodgates\u2019 argument, in that you would have courts construing those,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cIn certain counties, depending on how they\u2019re set up in the state Constitution, you may get some challenges, but again, anything based on federal regulation would stand.\u201d\n\nBack in May, Gov. Nixon placed the Right-to-Farm amendment on the August primary ballot, giving supporters and opponents only 10 \u00bd weeks to sway voters to their respective sides. Campaign commercials have yet to begin, but both sides have been raising money. The Missouri Farm Bureau\u2019s Fund to Protect Farming & Ranching had raised $118,765.03 as of June 30. The opposition, Missouri\u2019s Food for America, has yet to file a full disclosure report for the current year, but it did receive a $25,000 contribution in late May.\n\nFollow Marshall Griffin on Twitter: @MarshallGReport", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "Do Missouri\u2019s farmers and ranchers need a constitutional amendment to continue their way of life, or does current law offer enough protection?
