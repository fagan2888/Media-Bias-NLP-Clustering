He even acknowledged the health system\u2019s telephone and billing systems should work better.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Cosgrove, who has been with the Clinic since 1975 and its CEO since 2004, released his first book, \u201cThe Cleveland Clinic Way,\u201d which argues why the Clinic\u2019s model of care should be the model of the nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cEverybody talks about crisis and how things are broken, and I thought we had a model that had been very successful and held up as a model where we might be going in the world,\u201d Cosgrove said during his discussion with City Club CEO Dan Moulthrop. \u201cI thought we were doing things that could benefit some other organizations, so I wanted to get it out there for people in health care and anybody else who was having trouble sleeping.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Clinic\u2019s business model is anchored in making its doctors salaried employees instead of being paid based on how many procedures they conduct or patients they see. That\u2019s the Clinic\u2019s \u201csecret sauce,\u201d as Cosgrove characterized it. It\u2019s a fairly unusual model in health care \u2014 one only replicated by a handful of health systems in the country. When Cosgrove joined the Clinic in 1975, it employed 140 docs. Today, that number is around 3,200.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo one questions whether you\u2019re doing something just to generate return,\u201d Cosgrove said about the Clinic\u2019s group practice model.As for the economics of health care reform, Cosgrove said the Affordable Care Act and other pressures are pushing health systems to be more efficient. Over the next decade, for instance, $415 billion will be taken out of Medicare payments. Also, payments from insurance companies remain flat or are decreasing, and patients have to foot more of their bills. As such, Cosgrove said the Clinic \u2014 a roughly $6.5 billion operation \u2014 will have to take $1.5 billion in costs out of the system over the next several years to remain in sound financial condition. That equates to about $300 million in cuts a year.Late last year, the Clinic announced plans to trim $330 million from its budget \u2014 an effort that resulted in 700 employees taking early retirement offers. During his City Club address, Cosgrove noted a series of cost-cutting measures the Clinic has taken to cut back, including an effort to save on soap and saline solution that resulted in $300,000 in savings.\u201cJust like at home, you find ways to trim fat,\u201d he said.As for the billing system, when Cosgrove took the helm at the Clinic in 2004, then-U.S. Sen. George Voinovich paid him a visit asking him to explain his Clinic bill. Cosgrove couldn\u2019t explain it. Neither could a finance staffer.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t explain it either, so yes, we do have an issue,\u201d said Cosgrove, adding that the Clinic has since consolidated all of its charges on a single bill.He added, \u201cWe are a long ways from being the most efficient billing system. I would take that criticism, and I\u2019ve heard it more than once.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "In a wide-ranging discussion at the City Club of Cleveland, Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove talked about what he believes is the health system's 'secret sauce.'", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Cleveland Business", "description": "In a wide-ranging discussion at the City Club of Cleveland, Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove talked about what he believes is the health system's 'secret sauce.'", "title": "Cosgrove: Cleveland Clinic offers a way forward in improving U.S. health care", "url": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20140725/FREE/140729871/cosgrove-cleveland-clinic-offers-a-way-forward-in-improving-u-s", "image": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/assets/cc/CCLB_Iconv2.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainscleveland", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#a91d38", "fb": {"app_id": 730748806957003}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "FREE", "published_time": "2014-07-25T08:32:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-29T08:40:00-04:00", "author": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/staff/11"}, "verify-v1": "Q00KiEdlx7oJ8JL4E1sfoHDh6tgQLZQyOh8A1oVCsIs=", "theme-color": "#a91d38"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc32f\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s a fairly unusual model in health care \u2014 one only replicated by a handful of health systems in the country.\nHe even acknowledged the health system\u2019s telephone and billing systems should work better.\nEarlier this year, Cosgrove, who has been with the Clinic since 1975 and its CEO since 2004, released his first book, \u201cThe Cleveland Clinic Way,\u201d which argues why the Clinic\u2019s model of care should be the model of the nation.\nCleveland Clinic CEO Dr. Toby Cosgrove on Thursday evening, July 24, visited the City Club of Cleveland and in a frank discussion touched on topics including the future of health care and the importance of big data.\n\u201cNo one questions whether you\u2019re doing something just to generate return,\u201d Cosgrove said about the Clinic\u2019s group practice model.As for the economics of health care reform, Cosgrove said the Affordable Care Act and other pressures are pushing health systems to be more efficient."}
