That\u2019s over a period of 1,935 days, only slightly longer than the current 1,822-day biotech rally.\n\nThere\u2019s at least one more bubble to examine, the note says. The housing runup of the early 2000s brought with it an 835% gain for homebuilders in the S&P 1,500, Bespoke points out. That rally was similar in length to the dot-com bubble, lasting 1,954 days.\n\nThat brings with it one disconcerting fact, the note says.\n\n\u201cBubbles certainly come in all shapes and sizes, and while the biotech group\u2019s rally since March 2009 has been much less than the rally we saw during the dot-com and housing bubbles, the length of time the current rally has lasted for biotech is getting close to the time the prior two bubbles lasted,\u201d the note says. \u201cIf biotech\u2019s rally lasted as long as the dot-com bubble lasted, it would come to an end in late June. If it lasted as long as the housing bubble, it would come to an end in late July.\u201d\n\nYet if a hard rain is about to fall for biotech, the same could be said for internet stocks, as the Nasdaq Internet group is up 493% since March 2009, the paper says.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw.\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog.\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nCross Country shares tumble on earnings, outlook\n\nLatest Obamacare wrinkle brings swift, widespread criticism\n\nNon-Obamacare plans get an extra two-year reprieve", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-03-06T12:49:00-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "If you're getting skittish about the tear that biotechnology stocks have been on lately, at least one brokerage says it may not be at the bubble stage just yet.", "title": "Biotech stocks may not have reached the bubble stage just yet", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/03/06/biotech-stocks-may-not-have-reached-the-bubble-stage-just-yet/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BW087_bubble_MG_20140306115427.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "biotechnology,bubble,health care,stock outlook", "article.headline": "Biotech stocks may not have reached the bubble stage just yet", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "biotechnology,bubble,health care,stock outlook", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "If you're getting skittish about the tear that biotechnology stocks have been on lately, at least one brokerage says it may not be at the bubble stage just yet.", "article.published": "2014-03-06T12:49:00-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/03/06/biotech-stocks-may-not-have-reached-the-bubble-stage-just-yet/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "If you're getting skittish about the tear that biotechnology stocks have been on lately, at least one brokerage says it may not be at the bubble stage just yet.", "title": "Biotech stocks may not have reached the bubble stage just yet", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/03/06/biotech-stocks-may-not-have-reached-the-bubble-stage-just-yet/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BW087_bubble_MG_20140306115427.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2192", "article.updated": "2014-03-06T12:49:00-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb7e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf biotech\u2019s rally lasted as long as the dot-com bubble lasted, it would come to an end in late June.\nThat\u2019s over a period of 1,935 days, only slightly longer than the current 1,822-day biotech rally.\nFor one, the Nasdaq 100 made a leap of 1,118% during the period from December 1994 to March 2000 that included the dot-com bubble.\nThat rally was similar in length to the dot-com bubble, lasting 1,954 days.\nIf you\u2019re getting skittish about the tear that biotechnology stocks have been on lately, at least one brokerage says it may not be at the bubble stage just yet."}
