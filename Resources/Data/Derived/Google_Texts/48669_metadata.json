A dispatcher was able to contact Deleon inside. He then came outside, where he was arrested, said Thornton Officer Matt Barnes, a department spokesman.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver cop arrested on child abuse, domestic violence charges", "title": "Denver cop arrested on child abuse, domestic violence charges", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/09/denver-cop-arrested-on-child-abuse-domestic-violence-charges/", "image": {"width": 384, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140609__diaz-deleonp1-1.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140609__diaz-deleonp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-09T15:39:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:49:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd399\"", "article_summary": "A Denver police officer has been jailed on nine charges \u2014 including child abuse, domestic violence and a weapons charge \u2014 filed by the Thornton Police Department, officials said Monday.\nHe then came outside, where he was arrested, said Thornton Officer Matt Barnes, a department spokesman.\nThornton police were dispatched at 11:53 p.m. Saturday to a domestic violence in progress call on the 900 block of Thorncreek Court.\nA dispatcher was able to contact Deleon inside.\nDaniel Diaz Deleon, 42, was arrested for harassment, obstructing a peace officer, resisting arrest, domestic violence, child abuse, criminal mischief, false imprisonment, reckless endangerment and prohibited use of weapons, according to Adams County Jail records."}
