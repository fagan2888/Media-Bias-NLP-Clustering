The March 20 news article “Indiana’s experiment makes the poor pay for Medicaid” reported that “there is no proof” that Indiana Republicans’ way of implementing Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion “is making participants healthier.”

Since when does that matter?

There is no proof that Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion itself makes participants healthier. A randomized, controlled study found no discernible improvements in physical health when Oregon extended Medicaid to the same target population that the Affordable Care Act later targeted.

Does The Post hold Republican proposals to a different standard than Democratic proposals?
