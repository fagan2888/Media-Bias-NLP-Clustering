Yet contained in the movement and its triumphs were the seeds of destruction, evident now in the party\u2019s fracture over presidential front-runner Donald Trump.\n\nObama\u2019s policies, from the ambitious 2010 law overhauling the health care system to moving unilaterally on immigration, roiled conservatives who decried his activist agenda and argued about constitutional overreach. \u201cQuasi-socialist,\u201d says Tea Party Express.\n\nRepublicans rode that anger to majority control of the House in 2010 and an eye-popping net gain of 63 seats as voters elected tea partyers and political outsiders. Four years later, the GOP claimed the Senate, too.\n\nFor all the numbers, though, Republicans were unable to roll back Obama administration policies or defeat the Democratic president in 2012, further infuriating the GOP base.\n\nNow the party of Abraham Lincoln is engaged in a civil war, pitting establishment Republicans frightened about a election rout in November against the unpredictable Trump, who has capitalized on voter animosity toward Washington and politicians.\n\n\u201cThere would be no Donald Trump without Barack Obama,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. No fan of Trump, Graham argued that resentment of Obama plus his own party\u2019s attitude toward immigrants are responsible for the deep divide and the billionaire businessman\u2019s surge.\n\nMainstream Republicans are hard-pressed to figure out a way forward with Trump, who has pledged to build a wall on the Mexican border, bar Muslims from entering the United States and equivocated over former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke\u2019s support. The candidate has assembled a growing coalition of blue-collar workers, high-school educated and those craving a no-nonsense candidate.\n\n\u201cI think they are at a loss to try to reconcile this nihilist wing of the Republican Party with conservative principles,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate.\n\nThe health care fight proves illustrative.\n\nThe disaffected Americans embracing Trump echo the angry voices that filled town halls in the summer of 2009 as fearful voters taunted lawmakers over efforts to overhaul health care. Obama and Democrats were undaunted, pushing ahead on a remake of the system despite unified Republican opposition.\n\nIn January 2010, thanks to tea party backing and conservative outrage, Republican Scott Brown won a special election in Massachusetts, claiming the seat that liberal Sen. Ted Kennedy had held for 47 years.\n\nThat sent people a message that \u201cif you could win in blue Massachusetts, we could win in my state,\u201d said Sal Russo, co-founder and chief strategist of Tea Party Express. \u201cThat changed the movement from a protest movement to a political movement.\u201d\n\nThree months later, in March 2010, Democrats rammed Obama\u2019s health reform through Congress as mobs of protesters chanted outside the Capitol. Not a single Republican backed it.\n\n\u201cCompletely partisan,\u201d said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.\n\nThat November, the tea party propelled Republicans shouting repeal health care to victory, among them Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky. They defeated establishment GOP candidates more likely to compromise in Washington. Dozens of other tea party candidates captured House seats; many were making their first foray in politics.\n\nLosers in 2010 were some of the moderate and conservative Democrats who had backed the health care law.\n\nAlong with Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012 came another group of congressional tea partyers, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. The movement\u2019s strength ran headlong into Washington reality: Obama was president and Democrats still controlled the Senate. Efforts by Cruz and House conservatives to torpedo the health care law led to a partial, 16-day government shutdown in 2013.\n\nRepublicans triumphed a year later, capturing control of the Senate and knocking out some of the more moderate Democrats such as Louisiana\u2019s Mary Landrieu and Arkansas\u2019 Mark Pryor. In the House last year, they toppled House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, a victim of his pragmatism.\n\nExpectations among uncompromising conservatives were sky-high. So was the disappointment. Obama\u2019s health care plan remained the law of the land.\n\n\u201cIt definitely led to a wave in 2010 that gave us the majority, and then, what have we done since then,\u201d said Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Fla. \u201cThat\u2019s our responsibility to show what we have done since then, in spite of this president.\u201d\n\nTrump has tapped into voter frustration even though he\u2019s not considered tea party. At the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, made clear that their man was Cruz.\n\nStill, Republicans recognize the power of his candidacy and the ramifications.\n\n\u201cThe American people are fed up,\u201d said Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pa., one of a handful of Trump backers in Congress, \u201cand if elected officials don\u2019t realize it, we\u2019ll be out of jobs.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writers Alan Fram, Matthew Daly and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives' gut-level resistance to all things Obama - the man, his authority, his policies - gave birth to the tea party movement that powered the GOP to political success in multiple states and historic congressional majorities.
