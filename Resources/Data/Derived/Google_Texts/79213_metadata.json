(WPRI) \u2014 If you\u2019re uninsured and become pregnant outside of an open enrollment period, you won\u2019t be able to obtain health insurance in Rhode Island. Now, one state lawmaker is working to change that.\n\nIn 2014, 99 mothers gave birth in Rhode Island without health insurance.\n\n\u201cThe earlier a pregnant woman can get access to high-quality prenatal care, the better chance she has to have a healthy, well-developed baby,\u201d said Elizabeth Burke Bryant from Rhode Island Kids Count.\n\nRhode Island Kids Count is supporting legislation that would make pregnancy a \u201cqualifying life event,\u201d meaning soon-to-be moms who are uninsured would be able to sign up for health insurance outside of open enrollment periods. The nonprofit says it could improve children\u2019s\u2019 health and cut down on long-term medical costs.\n\nOther common qualifying life events include marriage, divorce, and the birth of a baby.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a loophole that needs to be closed so that pregnant women can get early access to prenatal care,\u201d said Rep. Edith Ajello, D-Providence.\n\nAjello said the bill is modeled after similar legislation that was passed last year in New York.\n\n\u201cNot only is it the right thing to do,\u201d she added. \u201cWe think it\u2019s cost effective because if we can even prevent one pregnancy from requiring a stay at a neonatal intensive care unit after the baby is born, that saves so much money in the long run.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island argued against the bill in committee. Spokesperson Stacy Paterno pointed out that under the Affordable Care Act, all Rhode Islanders are already required by law to be insured.\n\nIn a statement, Paterno said \u201cBlue Cross is enormously committed to maternal health and has a number of innovative programs to support pre-natal care.\u201d\n\nThe legislation is currently being held for further study. Rep. Ajello said she\u2019s optimistic that it will be passed this session.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A local nonprofit supports the legislation, saying it could improve children's' health and cut down on long-term medical costs.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488539287", "og": {"site_name": "WPRI 12 Eyewitness News", "description": "A local nonprofit supports the legislation, saying it could improve children\u2019s\u2019 health and cut down on long-term medical costs.", "title": "Lawmaker seeks to close pregnancy insurance loophole", "url": "http://wpri.com/2016/03/22/lawmaker-seeks-to-close-pregnancy-insurance-loophole/", "image": {"width": 656, "identifier": "https://lintvwpri.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/pregnancy-care.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "WPRI.com", "description": "A local nonprofit supports the legislation, saying it could improve children\u2019s\u2019 health and cut down on long-term medical costs.", "title": "Lawmaker seeks to close pregnancy insurance loophole", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwpri.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/pregnancy-care.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wpri12", "site": "wpri12", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Call 12 for Action, Health, Local News, News, Providence, Top Video  Shaun Towne; Reporting by Susan Campbell WPRI 12 Eyewitness News", "msapplication-tooltip": "WPRI 12 Eyewitness News | WPRI.com: Rhode Island news, weather, information", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wpri", "fb": {"pages": 20074438201}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wpri.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1b04de707c0e872b43e051b6f92f59c6?s=16", "application-name": "WPRI 12 Eyewitness News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WPRI12", "published_time": "2016-03-23T03:18:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-23T03:18:17+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "UWpZtk5XlRP8hEHWWrNPNVI8BulxVr0d1aFCNQQIY9U", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": ",Call 12 for Action, Health, Local News, News, Providence, Top Video"}, "article_summary": "In 2014, 99 mothers gave birth in Rhode Island without health insurance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a loophole that needs to be closed so that pregnant women can get early access to prenatal care,\u201d said Rep.
