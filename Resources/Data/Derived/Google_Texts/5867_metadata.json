He\u2019s gone so far as to have the DOJ attack reporters, the IRS has attacked conservative groups, the EPA has attempted to destroy the coal industry,\u201d said Rick Manning, who is president of Americans for Limited Government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a wholesale assault on our country. \u2026 We\u2019re demanding that Congress put sand in the gears of this system.\u201d\n\nManning and a long list of other leaders recently announced their \u201cCitizens\u2019 Mandate\u201d calling on Congress to take action. The group said the 2014 election was a \u201crepudiation of the complicity of the United States Congress in President Obama\u2019s dramatic and unconstitutional expansion of government,\u201d and their document tells lawmakers they need to:\n\nStop the president\u2019s promised \u201cFundamental Transformation\u201d of the country,\n\nEnd executive branch overreach,\n\nRestore constitutional balance of power among the three branches of government,\n\nBring an end to the perennially unpopular Affordable Care Act,\n\nHold the executive branch accountable for its myriad abuses of power and its national security failures both foreign and domestic, and\n\nPut the interests of the United States of America first among nations.\n\nManning pointed out that Obama has two more years in office, but the American message from the 2014 midterms was clear.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t elect this Congress to enable Obama,\u201d Manning said.\n\nJOIN THE DON\u2019T BE YELLOW, DUMP BOEHNER NOW CAMPAIGN.\n\nHe said one example of Obama\u2019s outrageous actions was that the administration wrote Federal Election Commission \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules, and when they were thrown out by a court, simply rewrote them and announced them again.\n\nIf Congress won\u2019t do its job, then in America, \u201cThe only thing that matters is what the president says,\u201d he warned.\n\n\u201cThis is a unique time in history. We\u2019ve never had a time when the president said, \u2018I don\u2019t care what the Constitution says, I\u2019m going to do what I want do to.'\u201d\n\nAnother headache would be Congress giving Obama more power, such as through a plan to fast-track a international trade treaty.\n\nHe said unless Congress gets to work now, America will be looking in two years at a nation where the Internet is run by the government, the First Amendment is in jeopardy and other problems will appear that people don\u2019t expect.\n\nPreventing that, he said, is \u201cour job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want our kids to have a future better than the one we have.\u201d\n\nThe Citizen\u2019s Mandate has been endorsed by more than 50 national conservative leaders, including Richard Viguerie, Phyllis Schlafly, Frank Gaffney, Tim Wildmon, James Dobson, Joseph Farah and others.\n\nIt is the result of a collaboration over the holidays to identify the concerns of voters and to craft their message to Congress and the Republican leadership, in particular.\n\nAnd it dovetails with a new JOIN THE DON\u2019T BE YELLOW, DUMP BOEHNER NOW campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s a campaign to allow constituents to reach out to all 246 GOP members of the U.S. House, telling them to look for a new speaker, to replace John Boehner.\n\nIt\u2019s because Boehner, shortly before Christmas, agreed to Obama\u2019s demands to continue funding for Obamacare and for amnesty \u2013 even though the GOP expanded its House majority and took control of the U.S. Senate as a result of the 2014 elections.\n\nCalls accompanying the campaign to lawmakers opposing Boehner rattled the House leadership, reported the Washington Examiner.\n\n\u201cThere were hundreds of them, jamming the phone lines of the district and Capitol offices of dozens of House GOP lawmakers,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe callers were not angry about legislation. Nor were they asking for help with a local matter. They were demanding their representative vote against Boehner \u2026 in his bid to win election to a third term as speaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been lobbied quite like that,\u201d House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, R-Texas, told the Examiner.\n\nThe Examiner, citing people in the room at the time, said Boehner was so agitated by the phone calls that he raised the issue to his rank and file in a private meeting. Boehner was defensive, according to witnesses, telling GOP lawmakers he has long espoused the tea party principles that the callers accused him of abandoning.\n\nThe Dump Boehner campaign already has generated 565,000 letters to the GOP members of the U.S. House \u2013 a stack closing in on 20 stories tall.\n\nJoseph Farah, WND founder and campaign organizer, said the opposition is largely because of two issues \u2013 Obamacare and amnesty. Republicans in the U.S. House before Christmas, under Boehner\u2019s leadership, allowed funding for both programs to continue into 2015.\n\nThe campaign has earned the support of the founder of Tea Party Nation, one of the organizations that helped rouse the American electorate in 2010 and give the GOP control of the U.S. House.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Judson Phillips told WND. \u201cI want people storming the halls of Congress. Melting the phone lines and anything else.\n\nThe Citizens\u2019 Mandate campaign has the potential to rattle the Capitol again, focusing as it does on the GOP\u2019s legislative agenda and not just its leadership.\n\nSupporters said the 2014 election message was clear: Stop President Obama and his leftist/socialist/anti-Constitution/big government philosophy in its tracks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "One of the key leaders who signed a recent \u201cCitizens\u2019 Mandate\u201d says Congress\u2019 responsibility right now is \u201cto put sand in the gears\u2019 of the president\u2019s plans for further \u201ctransformation\u201d of America. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a president who has been abusing his authority for six years.
