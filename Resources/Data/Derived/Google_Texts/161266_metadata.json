He was a major part of it. None of us have forgotten his contribution. I\u2019ll look back on it with incredible pride and perspective that I coached one of the all-time greats.\u201d\n\nNo, Miami isn\u2019t happy he left.\n\nAlso, no, Miami hasn\u2019t forgotten what he meant to the Heat.\n\n\u201cI gave everything and more to this city when I was here,\u201d James said before the game, his first time back at the arena since leaving Miami for Cleveland this past summer. \u201cNever disrespected this city or the franchise, or any of my teammates. Everything is professional. I gave it all. That\u2019s all I can do.\u201d\n\nJames took a seat on the scorers\u2019 table near midcourt for the last 30 seconds or so of that video, watching it on the giant overhead screen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of memories here, man,\u201d James said.\n\nIt was predictably an emotional return for James, who acknowledged feeling butterflies when he walked in and headed toward the visitors\u2019 locker room for the first time in nearly five years. He scored 30 points, but his Cavaliers lost to the Heat 101-91.\n\nMany from the nearest seats took pictures when James did his traditional powder toss before taking the court, and he exchanged huge hugs with several Heat players moments later.\n\nHe also pointed toward the Heat bench and tapped his heart.\n\n\u201cWhat me and my teammates created here while we were here, it\u2019s going to last forever,\u201d James said. \u201cYou can never take that out of the books. You can never take that from anything. Whatever else that comes with it, we\u2019ll deal with it then.\u201d\n\nWhatever negativity James heard on Thursday, it was nothing like his last such \u201chomecoming\u201d game \u2014 the one when he returned to Cleveland in 2010 for the first time since joining the Heat.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t \u201ccircle\u201d Thursday\u2019s game on his calendar, saying he\u2019s long past things like that.\n\n\u201cLeBron was an enormous figure here,\u201d Cavaliers coach David Blatt said. \u201cHe was part of a great run. Obviously, there\u2019s going to be emotion and a lot of feeling and a lot of excitement. You just can\u2019t look past that because you want to. That\u2019s going to happen. You just have to try to roll with it. I thought he handled it well.\u201d\n\nJames has remained friends with several Heat players, and interacted with some members of the team\u2019s front office at Dwyane Wade\u2019s wedding this offseason.\n\nAnd many Heat players said in the days leading up to this showdown that they expected James to be greeted with at least some measure of appreciation.\n\nIn turn, James said he appreciated those sentiments, and the bonds that remain.\n\n\u201cIt shows what we were able to do in that locker room,\u201d James said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "LeBron James hears plenty of cheers in return to Miami", "title": "LeBron James hears plenty of cheers in return to Miami", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/25/lebron-james-hears-plenty-of-cheers-in-return-to-miami/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141225_053341_lebron-james.jpg", "height": 416}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141225_053341_lebron-james.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-25T17:28:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:31:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "So did the Miami Heat fans who were seeing him again.\nMIAMI \u2014 LeBron James was running the gamut of emotions Thursday when he arrived at the arena that he called home for the past four seasons.\nI thought he handled it well.\u201dJames has remained friends with several Heat players, and interacted with some members of the team\u2019s front office at Dwyane Wade\u2019s wedding this offseason.\nAnd many Heat players said in the days leading up to this showdown that they expected James to be greeted with at least some measure of appreciation.\nYou just can\u2019t look past that because you want to."}
