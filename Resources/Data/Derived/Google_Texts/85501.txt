On Wednesday's Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel got Donald Trump to agree to a debate with Democratic contender Bernie Sanders. On Thursday's show, Kimmel asked Sanders if he saw what he did for the Vermont senator. "You made it possible for us to have a very interesting debate about two guys who look at the world very, very differently," Sanders said. The Trump camp has gone back and forth on the debate, asking for payment that would go toward some charity. But if it happens, "that would be some debate," Kimmel said. "I mean, I really think it might be one of the highest-rated events in televisions history." Sanders nodded and said "the goal would be to have it in some big stadium here in California"

Kimmel noted that Hillary Clinton had decided not to debate Sanders, and asked him if he understood the political logic of Clinton's decision. Sanders said no. Then Kimmel played a clip of Clinton telling CNN's Chris Cuomo that she was going to be the nominee, and Sanders got a little animated, saying, "Just a pinch of arrogance there, I think." He acknowledged that he has to win really big in California and the other five states voting June 7 to catch Clinton in pledged delegates, then criticized superdelegates and pointed to polls showing him doing better against Trump than Clinton.
