Facebook\n\nBy now, the internet is pretty familiar with Maria Kang, the self-described \u201cno excuse mom,\u201d whose entire movement is about pushing mothers to reach their potential in fitness and health \u2014 without using any excuses.\n\nKang originally set fire to the internet after posting a photo of herself minimally dressed, with her children surrounding her, touting her achievements in working off the belly fat post-kids. While she claims her image was meant to be inspirational, she received enormous backlash for being a \u201cbraggart\u201d who is self-promoting while simultaneously putting others down. She was even branded a \"fat-shamer.\"\n\nNow she\u2019s back at it: facing the controversy, Kang isn't letting any haters stop her. In her most recent full-body photo, posted on March 4, Kang stands with her arms crossed and her muscular thighs apart, staring straight at the camera. Arrows point to different parts of her body, leading to words like, \u201cno nanny or chef,\u201d or \u201cnot a trainer, athlete, or fitness model,\u201d apparently to emphasize the fact that the mother of three young children doesn\u2019t use such excuses to stop herself from working out. According to AdWeek, this new photo is part of a promotional push for her movement, which aims to inspire realistic women of all shapes and sizes to live a healthier lifestyle while in the midst of careers and families.\n\n\"Fit Mom\" is at it again, asking \"What's your excuse?\" Facebook\n\nHer website, NoExcuseMom.com, features an image of herself in a workout bikini, holding one child in one arm, with two toddlers hugging each of her legs. The quote, \u201cMotherhood CAN make you Better!\u201d is stretched across the top.\n\nDespite plenty of internet hatred directed at Kang for making people feel inferior, her website features mothers of all shapes and sizes who are simply trying to live a healthy lifestyle while raising children \u2014 something that can be a challenging feat after pregnancy, when our bodies change and make it harder to lose those extra pounds. The website also offers different recipes, fitness training tips, and female role models.\n\nLate last year, after the controversy over Kang\u2019s Facebook photos, she even wrote an Op-Ed piece for Time titled, \u201cFit Pride Isn\u2019t \u2018Hate Speech,\u2019\u201d in which she described how the fat acceptance movement could actually be harmful. \u201cHave we really created a society so sensitive and weak that we cry \u2018hate speech\u2019 whenever someone points out the fine line we\u2019re walking as a nation by promoting a healthy body image above actual health?\u201d Kang writes. \u201cHas the growing movement promoting \u2018fat acceptance\u2019 and even \u2018fat pride\u2019 gone so far that now we need a countervailing movement promoting \u2018fit pride?'\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly one-third of American adults are obese, and the cost of obesity in the U.S. was $147 billion in 2008.\n\nHowever, in order for Kang's movement to be successful, it may be important for Kang to switch the focus from herself, and concentrate on highlighting the achievements of other ordinary women more often. Regardless, take her updates with a grain of salt: working out and eating healthy certainly isn't negative advice. One commenter on Kang\u2019s Facebook writes, \u201cYou women absolutely love to tear apart a woman who takes care of herself. Here\u2019s a thought \u2014 try actually exercising something other than your tired excuses and get moving.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fit mom, maria kang, hot facebook mom, no excuse mom, fitness, fat shaming, fat pride, healthy living after pregnancy, dieting and exercise after pregnancy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The \"no excuse mom\" is at it again, pushing a new photo of her toned body in workout bikini wear, asking moms why they're not doing the same.", "title": "\u2018Fit Mom,\u2019 Maria Kang, Still Wants To Know What Your Excuse Is", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fit-mom-maria-kang-still-wants-know-what-your-excuse-her-new-movement-targets-mothers-pushes-271302", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/15/fit-mom.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"no excuse mom\" is at it again, pushing a new photo of her toned body in workout bikini wear, asking moms why they're not doing the same.", "title": "\u2018Fit Mom,\u2019 Maria Kang, Still Wants To Know What Your Excuse Is", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fit-mom-maria-kang-still-wants-know-what-your-excuse-her-new-movement-targets-mothers-pushes-271302", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/15/fit-mom.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/15/fit-mom.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-03-15T13:54:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-15T14:51:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The \"no excuse mom\" is at it again, pushing a new photo of her toned body in workout bikini wear, asking moms why they're not doing the same."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde23d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHas the growing movement promoting \u2018fat acceptance\u2019 and even \u2018fat pride\u2019 gone so far that now we need a countervailing movement promoting \u2018fit pride?\nFacebookBy now, the internet is pretty familiar with Maria Kang, the self-described \u201cno excuse mom,\u201d whose entire movement is about pushing mothers to reach their potential in fitness and health \u2014 without using any excuses.\nMaria Kang's most recent photo, part of a promotional push for her new \"movement,\" features her toned body with several examples of common excuses that she believes lazy moms use.\nOne commenter on Kang\u2019s Facebook writes, \u201cYou women absolutely love to tear apart a woman who takes care of herself.\nHowever, in order for Kang's movement to be successful, it may be important for Kang to switch the focus from herself, and concentrate on highlighting the achievements of other ordinary women more often."}
