The diagnosis, as always, is government dependency, and the magic elixir is lower spending on anti-poverty programs.\n\n\u201cWith Baltimore\u2019s troubles as a backdrop,\u201d writes Politico\u2019s David Rogers, \u201cHouse Republicans are proposing new cuts from urban programs this week even as their budget would add tens of billions of dollars for the Pentagon to get around strict spending caps.\u201d\n\nAt breakfast roundtable for reporters hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, Representative Paul Ryan called for \u201canother round of welfare reform.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, 11 Republican-controlled states are deflecting criticism over their opposition to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion by insisting that new beneficiaries meet new work requirements. The political innovation here\u2014treating health insurance for the poor as if it were similar to cash welfare, to weaken support for unconditional expansion\u2014is fairly conniving. As a poison pill, it advances the conservative goal of preventing the expansion altogether, while simultaneously providing the poisoners with an alibi. People should work for what they have, after all!\n\nThis represents a step backward for conservatives, many of whom have accepted the premise that medical insurance shouldn\u2019t, as a rule, be a source of leverage for employers. It also ignores the fact that most potential Medicaid expansion beneficiaries already work, and those that lack jobs don\u2019t generally deserve this kind of condescension.\n\nThe Medicaid gambit isn\u2019t a direct response to the unrest in Baltimore, but all these ideas share a common origin. A conviction, as National Review editor Rich Lowry put it, that cities like Baltimore are Great Society relics, \u201cthat bought into the big-government vision of the 1960s \u2026 and the bitter fruit has been corruption, violence and despair.\u201d\n\nThis is a plausible story, and useful if you don\u2019t have Clinton\u2019s supposed appetite for burrowing more deeply into the problem, as Slate\u2019s Jamelle Bouie did, or if you believe urban riots present an opportunity to make progress on prior ideological commitments.\n\nSenator Rand Paul has gone about folding the problems of police abuse and civil unrest into a critique of big government in a subtler way, but in the end they are all straining to squeeze complex social maladies into low-tax, upwardly distributive frameworks, because that is what\u2019s most convenient.\n\nIn remarks at the White House this week, President Barack Obama proposed an alternative framework\u2014one which conservatives immediately pilloried\u2014but he did so with extreme pessimism. \u201cI\u2019m under no illusion that out of this Congress we're going to get massive investments in urban communities,\u201d he said, \u201cand so we\u2019ll try to find areas where we can make a difference around school reform and around job training, and around some investments in infrastructure in these communities trying to attract new businesses in.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think Hillary Clinton will have to work very hard to convince the majority of Americans that bleeding resources out of impoverished communities isn\u2019t going to solve many problems, let alone every problem. But to fully turn the Republican critique on its head she\u2019s going to need to fill in the blanks in her speech.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The civil unrest in Baltimore, Maryland served as a tragic but fitting backdrop for Hillary Clinton\u2019s latest speech, which outlined ideas that states and the federal government could use to reduce inequities in the country\u2019s justice system.It was a call for remedies well beyond the confines of policing and sentencing, but it was also only a sketch, and admittedly so. \u201cI don\u2019t know all the answers,...", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "She needs to fill in the holes in her plan to reform the criminal justice system.", "title": "Republicans Say Baltimore Proves Social Welfare Doesn't Work.
