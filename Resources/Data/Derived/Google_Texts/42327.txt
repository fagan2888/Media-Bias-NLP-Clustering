The Affordable Care Act has forced benefit brokerages to reinvent the way they do business over the past six years. But one brokerage, Brookfield, Wis.-based The Benefit Companies Inc., has been preparing for this moment since it opened its doors in 1974.

The brokerage is a group of companies, each one providing services related to employee benefits or HR needs, such as payroll and time and attendance. While these services typically operated independent of each other pre-ACA, the employer shared responsibility rule and ACA reporting requirements now call for an unprecedented amount of integration between these systems.
