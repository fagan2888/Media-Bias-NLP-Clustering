Sam Brownback has defiantly refused to rethink his massive, budget-busting income tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy. Instead, the Republican is resorting to a spate of other measures: slashing education, raiding the state\u2019s highway fund, diminishing pension contributions, and proposing new sales taxes, which disproportionately hit low-income people. Still, these drastic steps won\u2019t suffice, a harsh reality that has forced Brownback and his Republican allies in the legislature to contemplate the previously unthinkable: turning to a socialist program, Medicaid, to rescue the state from the disastrous consequences of their right-wing economic experiment.\n\nSome background: While President Obama\u2019s signature health care reform law is hardly the socialist monster its critics depict \u2014 it compels most adults to purchase private health insurance plans, and doesn\u2019t include a public option, let alone establish a single-payer system \u2014 it did provide for the expansion of Medicaid, a public (i.e., socialist) health insurance program for low-income people jointly funded by the states and the federal government. Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government pays states for expanding Medicaid to those with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $33,000 per year for a family of four. While \u201csocialism\u201d in the abstract doesn\u2019t typically poll well in the U.S., the expansion of this particular socialist program is one of the more popular aspects of Obamacare; even in the reliably Republican Deep South, 60 percent of Americans support it.\n\nBut most Republican governors oppose Medicaid expansion, and under the Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 Obamacare ruling, states have the right to refuse to expand the program. Kansas has exercised that right, to the detriment of its poor residents. But amid the state\u2019s fiscal mess, that may soon change, Talking Points Memo\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports:\n\nGov. Sam Brownback (R) and the Republican-controlled legislature in Kansas is inching ever so slowly toward expanding Medicaid under Obamacare. If Kansas did expand Medicaid, it would be the latest in a list of deep-red states\u2014including Arkansas, Utah, and Indiana\u2014to actually take federal dollars through Obamacare, despite having conservative legislatures and fire-breathing, anti-ACA Republican governors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Governor's conservative economic experiment may end in Kansas acquiescing to Obamacare's Medicaid expansion", "title": "Sam Brownback may turn to socialism to save Kansas from his supply-side budget fiasco", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Governor's conservative economic experiment may end in Kansas acquiescing to Obamacare's Medicaid expansion", "title": "Sam Brownback may turn to socialism to save Kansas from his supply-side budget fiasco", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/05/sam_brownback_may_turn_to_socialism_to_save_kansas_from_his_supply_side_budget_fiasco/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/sam_brownback.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Governor's conservative economic experiment may end in Kansas acquiescing to Obamacare's Medicaid expansion", "title": "Sam Brownback may turn to socialism to save Kansas from his supply-side budget fiasco", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/sam_brownback.jpg", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Daniel Strauss, Kansas, Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, R-Kan., Republicans, Sam Brownback, Supply-side economics, Talking Points Memo, Tax cuts", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Affordable Care Act, Daniel Strauss, Kansas, Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, R-Kan., Republicans, Sam Brownback, Supply-side economics, Talking Points Memo, Tax cuts, Politics NewsConfronted with a $344 million revenue shortfall that must be filled by June 30, Kansas Gov.\nSam Brownback (R) and the Republican-controlled legislature in Kansas is inching ever so slowly toward expanding Medicaid under Obamacare.\nSam Brownback has defiantly refused to rethink his massive, budget-busting income tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy.\nBut most Republican governors oppose Medicaid expansion, and under the Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 Obamacare ruling, states have the right to refuse to expand the program.\nBut amid the state\u2019s fiscal mess, that may soon change, Talking Points Memo\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports:Gov."}
