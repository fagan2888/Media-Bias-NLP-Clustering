It did that because it, like various other local and state governments, thought it would be the proper public policy for the District of Columbia. And it thought it would be the proper public policy for the District of Columbia because applying criminal penalties to the possession of marijuana is rapidly being recognized as an obviously insane thing to do.\n\nBut there are still some insane people out there, specifically in \u2026 oh what\u2019s it called \u2026 the \u201cUnited States House of Representatives.\u201d And because Congress, technically, has to appropriate the District\u2019s budget \u2014 a budget based on money that the local government itself raises \u2014 all it takes is one of these insane people looking for a good ol\u2019 culture-war headline to clip for the old folks back home during election season to make a fuss and block the District from enforcing its laws.\n\nLate last month during an appropriations subcommittee markup, Republican Rep. Andy Harris, representing Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore, introduced and successfully passed an amendment depriving the District of funds to enforce the new marijuana decriminalization law. Harris, appealing to his credentials as a physician, cited the detrimental effects of marijuana on teenagers\u2019 brains. (He did not take into question the effect of teenagers or parents of teenagers being locked up for possessing marijuana on teenagers\u2019 brains.) Most District politicians rolled their eyes and heckled Harris.\n\nThe appropriations bill covering the District\u2019s budget, and a whole host of other things, is being considered by the full House this week. The White House issued a veto threat against it yesterday, outlining its complaints in a seven-page statement. Among the White House\u2019s concerns are cuts to the IRS, SEC and other agencies; it also objects to language that would subject the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s budget to the appropriations process (i.e., allow financial services lobbyists to obliterate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau).\n\nBut tucked away on Page 5 is a whole section on the District of Columbia. First, the White House supports so-called budget autonomy, allowing the District to manage its budget without congressional approval, and to eliminate the congressional review period for new laws. The administration also opposes the usual Republican attempts to block the District \u201cfrom using its local funds for abortion services\u201d or from funding its needle exchange program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a good sign for reformers, Obama has come out against the House GOP's ploy to block DC pot decriminalization", "author": "Jim Newell", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In a good sign for reformers, Obama has come out against the House GOP's ploy to block DC pot decriminalization", "title": "GOP\u2019s pot stunt earns a White House veto threat: Another sign of Dems\u2019 evolution on marijuana", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/15/gops_pot_stunt_earns_a_white_house_veto_threat_another_sign_of_dems_evolution_on_marijuana/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/obama_pot2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a good sign for reformers, Obama has come out against the House GOP's ploy to block DC pot decriminalization", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/obama_pot2.jpg", "title": "GOP\u2019s pot stunt earns a White House veto threat: Another sign of Dems\u2019 evolution on marijuana", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "GOP\u2019s pot stunt earns a White House veto threat: Another sign of Dems\u2019 evolution on marijuana", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Andy Harris, appropriations, Barack Obama, DC, District of Columbia, drug war, Drugs, House, marijuana, veto threats", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1999\"", "article_summary": "The White House issued a veto threat against it yesterday, outlining its complaints in a seven-page statement.\nTopics: Andy Harris, appropriations, Barack Obama, DC, District of Columbia, drug war, Drugs, House, marijuana, veto threats, Politics NewsThis spring, the government of the District of Columbia decided to decriminalize marijuana possession.\nFirst, the White House supports so-called budget autonomy, allowing the District to manage its budget without congressional approval, and to eliminate the congressional review period for new laws.\n(He did not take into question the effect of teenagers or parents of teenagers being locked up for possessing marijuana on teenagers\u2019 brains.)\nHarris, appealing to his credentials as a physician, cited the detrimental effects of marijuana on teenagers\u2019 brains."}
