He remained in Colorado to recover from a concussion, and his return to the lineup is up in the air.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s better but not ready to practice with the team,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said from MTS Centre.\n\nBigras, 21, was called up from the minors Jan. 13, made his debut the following night and played in 23 consecutive games before absorbing a hit to the head last week against Nashville. He wasn\u2019t immediately diagnosed with a concussion, because his symptoms were delayed.\n\nZach Redmond has replaced Bigras. Redmond and Andrew Bodnarchuk both took warm-ups Saturday, but Roy again settled on Redmond to partner with Eric Gelinas on the third pairing.\n\nDanger. The Avs on Sunday began a stretch of four road games against Canadian teams with little or no chance of making the playoffs. Roy was asked if that spells \u201cdanger\u201d for a team in a tight fight with Minnesota for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot.\n\n\u201cNot really. They\u2019re all dangerous games,\u201d Roy said. \u201cIn today\u2019s hockey, nobody is missing much. Even if you\u2019re out of the race and you can say you\u2019re fighting for jobs, we\u2019re fighting for a playoff spot and we know they\u2019re going to come to play. We were in that position last year. We did everything we could to remain focused and finish the year strong and build around it for the following year.\u201d\n\nThe Avs play at Vancouver on Wednesday before visiting Calgary on Friday and Edmonton on Sunday.\n\nEntering Saturday\u2019s games, the Jets (59), Canucks (64), Flames (61) and Oilers (61) were the four teams with the fewest points in the Western Conference.\n\nFootnote. The Avs are expected to take Sunday off and return to practice Monday. They will depart for Vancouver after Tuesday\u2019s practice.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche\u2019s Chris Bigras misses third straight game after concussion", "title": "Avalanche\u2019s Chris Bigras misses third straight game after concussion", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/12/avalanches-chris-bigras-misses-third-straight-game-after-concussion/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-12T20:50:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-12T20:50:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "They\u2019re all dangerous games,\u201d Roy said.\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba \u2014 Avalanche rookie defenseman Chris Bigras missed his third consecutive game with the Avalanche.\nHe remained in Colorado to recover from a concussion, and his return to the lineup is up in the air.\n\u201cHe\u2019s better but not ready to practice with the team,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said from MTS Centre.\nRedmond and Andrew Bodnarchuk both took warm-ups Saturday, but Roy again settled on Redmond to partner with Eric Gelinas on the third pairing."}
