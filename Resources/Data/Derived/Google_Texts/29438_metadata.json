We were very attracted to that because energy is almost a prerequisite for the job.\u201d\n\nHolt, 56, a Duke University-trained chemist and once a competitive swimmer, will need to stay powered up. Proto Labs \u2014 an injection-molding and milling manufacturer that caters to medical, auto and consumer industries \u2014 is on a mission to become a $1 billion company.\n\nAlready, Cleveland had lifted Proto Labs from a $1 million private firm to a publicly traded company with $163 million in sales. But \u201cwe had no clue how to get it to $1 billion. And that is where we are headed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the fact that Vicki had run companies of that scale is what really won the day for her.\u201d\n\nHolt, talking with silicon rubber injection mold specialist Rick Bigaouette, is known for seeking input from all corners. Under her leadership Proto Labs added new rubber and steel injection molding lines.\n\nWhen her hire was announced in February, Proto Labs\u2019 stock jumped 3.4 percent to $80.50 per share.\n\nToday, Holt may still be unpacking at her new Twin Cities home, but she is raring to go at work.\n\n\u201cDo I believe that we can be a $1 billion company? Yes I do,\u201d Holt said during a recent interview in her Maple Plain office. \u201cThis is a very strong company. \u2026 It\u2019s just a beautiful financial model.\u201d\n\nIn stalking the $1 billion prize, Holt won\u2019t say when she\u2019ll get there. But she will rely on growth strategies such as adding new manufacturing processes, customers and products. In her short time on the job, she\u2019s already tackled each.\n\nIn April, she led Proto Labs into the steel and rubber injection molding business by adding two new production lines in Maple Plain. The company, best known for plastic injection molded products, also entered the fast-growing 3-D printing industry by buying Raleigh-based FineLine Prototyping Inc.\n\n\u201cI was impressed,\u201d Cleveland said. \u201cWhen she came on board, we had not negotiated a purchase agreement with FineLine in Raleigh. It was very competitive. But she got that deal done very efficiently. \u2026 And that is how you grow.\u201d\n\nBut Holt insists that growth can\u2019t rely solely on acquisitions. \u201cAcquisitions are a tactic. Not a strategy,\u201d she said.\n\nTested at Spartech\n\nThe job offer from Proto Labs came at a good time. Holt had just finished tackling her hardest job, turning around Spartech Corp., a $1.3 billion plastics sheeting and polymer maker that was sinking fast in 2010.\n\nAt the time, Holt was serving on Spartech\u2019s board while also being the senior vice president of PPG Industries\u2019 $1.7 billion glass and fiberglass division in Pittsburgh. There, she and her team had transformed PPG\u2019s fiberglass supply chain, cut $50 million in costs and launched joint ventures in China and in Taiwan. But while PPG hummed along, things were falling apart at Spartech.\n\n\u201cWe were close to violating bank covenants, and we had lost some key customers. So as a board member, you are sitting there looking at all this and saying, \u2018Oh [expletive]!\u2019 \u201d Holt recalled.\n\n\u201cThe board offered me the CEO job [at Spartech]. \u2026 So I jumped in and took the job.\u201d\n\nToday, that memory causes her to pinch her fingertips and shut her eyes. \u201cIt was the most difficult role I have had in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to change out 30 percent of my team\u201d and focus on operating margins.\n\nFormer Spartech board member Pam Lenehan said Holt was a logical choice for the difficult job because of her vast manufacturing expertise. \u201cWe all knew it was a challenge. We just didn\u2019t know how much of a challenge it was going to be.\u201d\n\nAs Spartech CEO, Holt \u201cwas very transparent with the board,\u201d Lenehan said. \u201cOftentimes you have these command-and-control CEOs and you are used to having them provide you with a final solution. Vicki would get input from a variety of people.\u201d\n\nHolt brought in new managers, shifted Spartech into high-profit products, adopted recycled materials and improved on-time delivery rates from 80 to 95 percent. Soon profits increased, and Ohio-based PolyOne came calling in late 2012. PolyOne bought Spartech for $393 million in March 2013. The final share price was a 104 percent premium over the closing price on the day the transaction was first announced, Holt said.\n\nCEO Vicki Holt looked over equipment in Proto Labs\u2019 injection molding area with specialist Rick Bigaouette.\n\nWith her job done, Holt left Spartech in April 2013. But Holt\u2019s \u201csabbatical\u201d didn\u2019t last. She had joined the boards of Waste Management and Watlow. But it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cI think I would have driven my CEOs crazy if I didn\u2019t get another job,\u201d she said. \u201cI missed being part of a team. I missed taking a business from point A to point B.\u201d\n\nConstantly on the move\n\nHolt is used to dizzying change. Born in Madison, Wis., as the second of four kids, she moved a lot as her father, an engineer, rose up the corporate ladder. Holt lived in Wisconsin, New Jersey, Connecticut, Michigan and finally South Bend, Ind., where she finished high school. She attended North Carolina\u2019s Duke University, went to New York for more school and then was off to St. Louis, San Diego, St. Louis again, Pittsburgh and St. Louis yet again for chemical and leadership posts at Monsanto, PPG and Spartech.\n\nHeadhunters called Holt every week when she left Spartech in April 2013. She ignored offers until late 2013. \u201cMost of what came across my desk at home were [offers to run] growth stories and turnarounds,\u201d she said. She considered CEO roles at a graphene sheet manufacturer, a $3 billion packaging company, a biotech start-up and Proto Labs.\n\n\u201cAt first, I wasn\u2019t going to even respond to the inquiry because [Proto Labs] was small.\u201d But the more she learned about its market potential, the more she thought the job could be fun.\n\nCurtis, her husband of 35 years, could not dissuade her, despite his daily reports: \u201c \u2018It\u2019s January and it\u2019s 22 degrees below zero in Minneapolis,\u2019 he\u2019d say. And I\u2019d say: \u2018But Curt, it\u2019s such a cool company.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With successful turnaround behind her, Vicki Holt's new challenge is growth.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "With successful turnaround behind her, Vicki Holt's new challenge is growth.", "title": "New CEO wants to turn Proto Labs into a $1 billion company", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/new-ceo-wants-to-turn-proto-labs-into-a-1-billion-company/266810161/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140511463258534.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140511463258534.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With successful turnaround behind her, Vicki Holt's new challenge is growth.", "title": "New CEO wants to turn Proto Labs into a $1 billion company", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/new-ceo-wants-to-turn-proto-labs-into-a-1-billion-company/266810161/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140511463258534.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140511463258534.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "article": {"tag": "CEO Vicki Holt"}, "news_keywords": "Proto Labs Inc.,CEO Vicki Holt"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4594\"", "article_summary": "She considered CEO roles at a graphene sheet manufacturer, a $3 billion packaging company, a biotech start-up and Proto Labs.\nProto Labs \u2014 an injection-molding and milling manufacturer that caters to medical, auto and consumer industries \u2014 is on a mission to become a $1 billion company.\nProto Labs CEO Vicki Holt doesn\u2019t sit still.\nWhen her hire was announced in February, Proto Labs\u2019 stock jumped 3.4 percent to $80.50 per share.\nAlready, Cleveland had lifted Proto Labs from a $1 million private firm to a publicly traded company with $163 million in sales."}
