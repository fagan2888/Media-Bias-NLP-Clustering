It means the state will not receive 120-million dollars in federal funds a year to address some 17 thousand people who do not have health care coverage and it will also not help address the millions of dollars of uncompensated care faced by hospitals who are forced to treat those without insurance. The Legislature\u2019s Joint Health and Labor committee will spend the next several months trying to find a Wyoming solution to these issues without federal dollars.\n\nWyoming Governor Matt Mead remains upset that the legislature ignored his plea to expand Medicaid. He says turning away 120 million dollars doesn\u2019t make sense. The governor says now trying to spend state dollars to address health care needs makes even less sense. He notes that health care is expensive.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t see us doing it as a state for $50-million or $60-million and I don\u2019t see where we are going to get $50 or $60 million dollars in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nSenator Charles Scott of Casper agrees with him.\n\n\u201cYeah and it will have even a tougher time now that the price oil has collapsed. You know our state revenues are down and you can\u2019t do a large expensive program the way you could a few years ago.\u201d\n\nScott co-chairs the committee that will look into the issue and he says a state plan is best for one simple reason. The legislature has made it clear that it doesn\u2019t support Medicaid expansion. So his committee will spend the next several months studying everything from what to do with people who can\u2019t get health insurance to the impacts that lack of insurance has on hospitals.\n\nLovell Representative Elaine Harvey is the other committee co-chairman. As she sits outside the House chambers at the close of the legislative session she admits that Medicaid Expansion would have helped low income people in the state, but now it\u2019s up to the committee to find ways to make health care available and affordable.\n\n\u201cWe do have the highest Medical Costs in the nation, so why is that and what can we do about it.\u201d\n\nHarvey is a fan of what are known as Wyoming Health Centers. They are essentially clinics that provide health care coverage to low income people on a sliding fee scale. They provide primary care and can act as a regular health care provider or what is called a medical home to low income people. The problem is that there are only a handful of these facilities in the state and there are lots of people that don\u2019t have access to them. Harvey wants to see if they can fix that.\n\n\u201cSo we are going to identify some of those gaps and see what we can do to bring health care back to primary care.\u201d\n\nWyoming Primary Care Association Director Jan Cartwright oversees the centers in the state. Obviously she believes that expanding the centers would help provide health care to more people. But she says they are costly. And it\u2019s surprising that some in the state would look to pay for Health Centers themselves.\n\n\u201cWell I do think it\u2019s ironic that we would put forth state dollars to do all of that while it\u2019s an easy and affordable move to just expand Medicaid and bring in all those federal dollars.\u201d\n\nCartwright says Medicaid expansion would have brought more money into the state\u2019s health care system reducing health care costs, for a simple reason.\n\n\u201cMedicaid is health insurance and it does provide them the opportunity to go seek care at any provider they want to see.\u201d\n\nHealth insurance generally keeps people out of the emergency room too. Many hospitals are like the Cheyenne Regional Medical Center and are required to provide free charity care to low income people, it\u2019s part of what is known as uncompensated care. Phyllis Sherard is the Vice President of Population Health at CMC. Part of her job is to find a solution to this problem and she says Medicaid expansion would have done a great deal, because it would have gotten people out of the emergency room and into cheaper health facilities. A few years ago her own hospital convincing people to use a local health care center instead of the emergency room and it worked.\n\n\u201cWe started to see a great a deal of improvement in the numbers of folks coming through our emergency room a second time, because we were connecting them with a medical home.\u201d\n\nSherard admits she was surprised when she heard the legislature is now trying to solve these issues without the federal Medicaid dollars.\n\nLaramie Senator Chris Rothfuss, a strong supporter of Medicaid expansion, agrees.\n\n\u201cThe concept of studying something that we\u2019ve already studied to death is a little bit frustrating and it provides the opportunity to say that you are doing something when you are actually not.\u201d\n\nRothfuss says had the legislature voted to accept the federal dollars, it could have solved the problems the committee is studying and allowed Wyoming to do some innovative things on top of that.\n\nSenator Charles Scott is confident the committee work will help. But he admits they will only go so far.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t achieve the objective of many of the Medicaid expansion proponents of increasing the number of people that are dependent on government health care, but many of us are not in sympathy with that objective.\u201d\n\nThe committee will begin its work soon and plans to present some ideas to the legislature next February.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Open Spaces", "description": "Despite a heavy push by hospitals and businesses the Wyoming legislature once again voted down Medicaid Expansion this year.
