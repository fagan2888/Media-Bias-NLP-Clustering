In the end, he got more than 7 minutes.\n\n\u201cThere are people who think it is unforgivable that you did this. What\u2019s your message to them?\u201d Ross asked the president.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like me to say to yourself, \u2018It makes sense to see if this is a good deal for me,'\u201d President Obama responded. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many letters I\u2019ve gotten from people that say, \u2018I disagree with you on just about everything. But I got to tell ya, I went ahead and signed up anyway. It turned out you saved my life.'\u201d\n\nBut Ross found a few points in the conversation to divert from the topic he had been called to Washington D.C. for, and got in some unexpected questions.\n\n\u201cYou know if you really screw it up &#8212 because it\u2019s being taped and fed to everybody &#8212 it\u2019s going to be some kind of YouTube joke,\u201d Ross told Ron and Don.\n\nAt one point, Ross asked the president about the mysterious Russian airplane crash in Egypt. There has been speculation as to what caused the tragedy, but no one knows the exact cause. Ross learned that the president feels it is possible there was a bomb on board. Obama\u2019s comment to Ross quickly went viral and was carried on multiple news outlets.\n\n\u201cI knew the question about the airplane was legitimate, but certainly not on topic,\u201d Ross said, noting he was there only to discuses the Affordable Care Act. \u201cBut he had no trouble &#8212 he knew the answer. He didn\u2019t give me a funny look or anything. He answered the question and steered it back towards healthcare.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t have asked it, someone else would have,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the guy who happened to hold the microphone when the question was asked.\u201d\n\nRoss\u2019 full interview with President Obama will be aired on KIRO Radio during Seattle\u2019s Morning News at 7:15 a.m.", "article_metadata": {"description": "News junkies have to wait until Friday morning to hear Dave Ross' interview with President Obama, but the Ron and Don Show got a quick preview Thursday evening, and the story behind Ross' big scoop of the day.", "og": {"site_name": "MyNorthwest.com", "description": "News junkies have to wait until Friday morning to hear Dave Ross' interview with President Obama, but the Ron and Don Show got a quick preview Thursday evening, and the story behind Ross' big scoop of the day.", "title": "Dave Ross on his trip to DC and interviewing President Obama", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/15/1516/151674.jpg", "height": 370}, "updated_time": "2015-11-05T22:04:13-07:00", "url": "http://mynorthwest.com/142199/dave-ross-on-his-trip-to-dc-and-interviewing-president-obama/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/15/1516/151674.jpg", "creator": "@DyerOxley", "description": "News junkies have to wait until Friday morning to hear Dave Ross' interview with President Obama, but the Ron and Don Show got a quick preview Thursday evening, and the story behind Ross' big scoop of the day.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dave Ross on his trip to DC and interviewing President Obama"}, "robots": "noodp", "keywords": "MyNorthwest.com - Seattle news, sports, weather, traffic, talk and community., Home,MyNorthwest.com", "article": {"section": "Dave Ross", "published_time": "2015-11-05T18:44:29-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-05T22:04:13-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mynorthwest"}, "verify-v1": "XrJiQDsWmPaoqGKN0EHKs7ult0rBB0W9zj4cWkAPRVI=", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "At one point, Ross asked the president about the mysterious Russian airplane crash in Egypt.\nRelated: President Obama: \u2018Possible there was a bomb on board\u2019 Russian planeRoss was treated to a tour of the White House before getting to interview the president in the Oval Office.\nWhat\u2019s your message to them?\u201d Ross asked the president.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like me to say to yourself, \u2018It makes sense to see if this is a good deal for me,'\u201d President Obama responded.\n\u201cI\u2019m the guy who happened to hold the microphone when the question was asked.\u201dRoss\u2019 full interview with President Obama will be aired on KIRO Radio during Seattle\u2019s Morning News at 7:15 a.m."}
