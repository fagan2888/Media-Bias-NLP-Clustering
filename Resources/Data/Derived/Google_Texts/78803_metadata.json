More than 1,200 allies signed a petition at lettoddwork.org calling on Darrell Issa, the Republican committee chairman, to postpone Park's testimony.\n\n\"No matter what side of the aisle you sit on, Todd is one of the good guys. Let him do his job,\" the petition said.\n\nPark, 40, helped build the original HealthCare.gov website in 2010 when he was chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services. At the time, the website provided information about public and private insurance programs, sorted by zip code.\n\nAlso slated to testify are Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer at the White House budget office, Henry Chao, the deputy chief information officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Frank Baitman, chief information officer for HHS.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History\n\n1 of 17 1912 Former President Theodore Roosevelt champions national health insurance as he unsuccessfully tries to ride his progressive Bull Moose Party back to the White House.
