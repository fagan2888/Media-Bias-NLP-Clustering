Brian Holmes was swept out of sight in the Fatwa area, the news release says.\n\nWhen Alex Holmes initially tried to ski down to search for his brother, he triggered a second avalanche. Feeling it wasn\u2019t safe to continue, he skied back to Trout Lake and called for help.\n\nBrian Holmes said he was able to dig himself out of the snow after being carried about 1,000 feet down the slide and landing on his back, mostly buried in snow.\n\nHis entire body except for his face and one arm were under the snow. It took him about 15 minutes to dig out. He then began searching for his brother, who he thought was dead.\n\nDeputies were dispatched about 1 p.m.\n\nDuring the ongoing mission, dispatchers received calls from a cellphone belonging to Brian Holmes. They heard someone breathing, but no further communication was established.\n\nBrian Holmes made his way to the town of Ophir. He was taken to the Telluride Medical Center, where he was treated for injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nRector said it was not surprising that an avalanche was triggered. \u201cThe San Juans in general can represent some of the most tenuous snow conditions on the continent,\u201d Rector said.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or @kirkmitchell or denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado brothers survive avalanches near Ophir after each thought the other was dead", "title": "Colorado brothers survive avalanches near Ophir after each thought the other was dead", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/26/colorado-brothers-survive-avalanches-near-ophir-after-each-thought-the-other-was-dead/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151126__2851116_ophirp1.jpg", "height": 401}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151126__2851116_ophirp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-26T10:34:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T07:05:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Deputies were dispatched about 1 p.m.During the ongoing mission, dispatchers received calls from a cellphone belonging to Brian Holmes.\nAlex Holmes was watching his brother begin to ski down the slope when Brian Holmes triggered an avalanche.\nBrian Holmes was swept out of sight in the Fatwa area, the news release says.\nBrian Holmes made his way to the town of Ophir.\nTwo brothers from Ophir survived a massive avalanche Wednesday in the San Miguel County backcountry after one of them was swept away and buried."}
