Greg Abbott was railing against it.\n\n\u201cNow is not the time to double down on the welfare state,\u201d Abbott wrote in an op-ed piece in the National Review. The headline read: \u201cCongress and Governors: Just Say No to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAbbott was anticipating the law would be rejected, but the court voted the other way, 6-3. And that\u2019s not the only way he was wide of the mark.\n\nAfter the ruling, Abbott wrote, \u201cEmployers won\u2019t face the job-killing Obamacare penalties\u201d in states that refuse to buy into the law, such as Texas. And he urged them to move here.\n\n\u201cI proudly welcome more by doing everything I can to end Obamacare in Texas,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat may play to his base, but it\u2019s just flat wrong. His rhetoric won\u2019t move Texas ahead on health care, and it\u2019s not a clarion call to business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confused by his remarks,\u201d said Bill Hammond, CEO of the Texas Association of Business. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nWhile states have latitude in how they approach the health law, it\u2019s a national program. No one can escape the mandate for coverage by simply moving to a state that opposes the ACA. Taxpayers, employers and providers also can\u2019t avoid paying their share by living somewhere that doesn\u2019t embrace it.\n\nEverybody\u2019s paying for health reform. But Texas is lagging big-time in what it gets back.\n\nIt has the highest uninsured rate in the country, roughly 1 in 4 residents. And it trails the U.S. average in enrollment on Healthcare.gov, the exchange that provides federal subsidies for most of its customers.\n\nIn theory, no state has more to gain from affordable coverage for all. But Texas leaders are constantly dissing the law and forgoing billions in federal dollars. Money is the main reason business groups, including Hammond\u2019s, want to expand Medicaid.\n\nTexas\u2019 sign-ups lag\n\nIf Texas extended the program to low-income adults, as have 29 states and Washington, over 1 million residents would get coverage \u2014 with federal money paying for nearly all of it.\n\nBut even more Texans, over 3 million in total, are eligible to buy insurance on the exchange. Yet just 32 percent of them enrolled this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nWhile that\u2019s an improvement from 2014, the national average is 36 percent. Many large states enrolled over 40 percent, and Florida hit 57 percent. Florida enrolled almost half a million more than much-larger Texas.\n\nTop lawmakers in Florida often criticize Obamacare. But the state has exceptional outreach efforts among nonprofits and community groups, especially around Miami and the central part of the state.\n\nIn Texas, large metro areas benefited from the work of consumer groups, local leaders and insurers. But the response has varied widely. In the College Station area, as few as 12 percent of those who were eligible signed up for coverage, Kaiser said. The share topped 81 percent in some Houston suburbs.\n\nIn northeast Dallas County, including parts of Richardson and Garland, 71 percent of those eligible signed up, Kaiser said. Several other areas \u2014 including Coppell, north Irving, Duncanville and DeSoto \u2014 topped 50 percent.\n\nBut there were no statewide initiatives to boost sign-ups, and a consumer program ended a few years ago. The governor\u2019s office, insurance department and health department haven\u2019t launched efforts to increase participation. And leaders required extra training, background checks and fingerprinting for navigators.\n\nResearchers from Harvard compared the impact of state policies in three Southern states \u2014 Arkansas, Kentucky and Texas. Kentucky expanded Medicaid, branded its own program and had extensive outreach. That paid off in the highest application rates, enrollment and positive experiences.\n\nCaught up in rhetoric\n\nTexas performed the worst.\n\n\u201cOur study suggests that state policy decisions are likely having a critical impact not only on eligibility but also on who chooses to apply for coverage and whether they successfully enroll,\u201d the researchers wrote in Health Affairs magazine last month.\n\nThe finding seems predictable: More residents enroll if a state promotes the program and provides more help. So what are we waiting for?\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t we tone down the rhetoric and try to work collaboratively for the citizens of Texas?\u201d said Steve Love, CEO of the Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council.\n\nAs a starting point, he suggested Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 majority opinion: \u201cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,\u201d Roberts wrote.\n\nEmployers still have many concerns about the health law, including mandates and filing regulations. But they\u2019re relieved the court upheld it, said Marianne Fazen, executive director of the Dallas-Fort Worth Business Group on Health. She wants the focus to shift to improving the law, not repealing it.\n\n\u201cEmployers want health care to work better,\u201d Fazen said.\n\nCan Texas\u2019 leaders even agree on that?\n\nFollow Mitchell Schnurman on Twitter at @mitchschnurman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While Texas leaders resist the health law, other large states are enrolling a higher share of residents.", "og": {"description": "While Texas leaders resist the health law, other large states are enrolling a higher share of residents.", "title": "Schnurman: Texas still slamming reform and trailing in health care", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20150704-schnurman-texas-still-slamming-reform-and-trailing-in-health-care.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-07-05T01:29:21Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-07-04T23:16:38Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Schnurman: Texas still slamming reform and trailing in health care\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20150704-schnurman-texas-still-slamming-reform-and-trailing-in-health-care.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2354522\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-07-04T23:16:38Z\", \"section\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"author\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-07-04T23:16:38Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae7e\"", "article_summary": "Employers still have many concerns about the health law, including mandates and filing regulations.\nHis rhetoric won\u2019t move Texas ahead on health care, and it\u2019s not a clarion call to business.\nCan Texas\u2019 leaders even agree on that?\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201dWhile states have latitude in how they approach the health law, it\u2019s a national program.\nBut Texas leaders are constantly dissing the law and forgoing billions in federal dollars."}
