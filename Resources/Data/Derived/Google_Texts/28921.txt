Aquiline Picks up Regulatory Software Maker Fenergo

The PE firm is investing in the financial services software developer, which boasts clients including Lloyds Banking

New York financial services-focused private equity firm Aquiline Capital Partners LLC is making an undisclosed investment in Fenergo. Insight Venture Partners is also investing in the deal.

Dublin, Ireland-based Fenergo makes software that help banks and financial services providers deal with regulations. Some of Fenergos clients include BMO Capital Markets (NYSE: BMO) and Lloyds Banking Group plc (LON: LLOY).

Evolving regulatory pressures on financial instituitions have demonstrated a clear need for more advanced compliance solutions, says Aquiline CEO Jeff Greenberg.

I am truly excited for the growth opportunities that are now possible with the help of our new investors, adds Fenergo CEO Marc Murphy.

As part of the deal, Aquilines head of financial technology, Vincenzo La Ruffa, will join the targets board.

Marlin & Associates and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP are advising Aquiline.

Increasing regulatory pressure on banks has created a need for software makers in the space, making these companies attractive targets. For example, another recent deal includes Markit (Nasdaq: MRKT) buying CoreOne Technologies from Symphony Technology Group in a $200 million cash deal.
