An estimated 1 million in Texas could lose their health insurance if the high court strikes down a provision in the Affordable Care Act that allows people to get tax subsidies that make their premiums more affordable through the federal insurance exchange, according to a study commissioned by the Texas Association of Community Health Centers and the Texas Academy of Family Physicians.  The pain is especially acute in Texas, the report says, because state leaders chose not to expand Medicaid, which left another 1.5 million people who were eligible without coverage.  In 2012 the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate provision requiring nearly all to obtain health insurance.  Currently, 87 percent of people nationwide who have signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act qualify for a subsidy in the form of a tax credit.  The plaintiffs in the case, four Virginia residents, contend those words show that Congress intended to limit to subsidies only to states with state exchanges.  Studies have shown 237,000 new jobs could be created nationwide without the burden of the employer mandate and health insurance prices could go down if insurance companies were unshackled from requirement of coverage currently part of the law, Troy said.
