It said it will first recruit consultant firms that can best identify companies interested in being registered as managers of Japan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves.\n\nThe registered fund managers selected will then advise the government on what types of investments are most prudent.\n\nIn the fiscal year ended in March 2013, Japan\u2019s annual return on its investment in its foreign exchange reserves was a modest 2.5%. But this doesn\u2019t reflect changes to the value of the reserves brought on by the changes in the FX rates. In that fiscal year, the dollar appreciated more than 10% against the yen, giving an extra boost to the value of its holdings.\n\nBut FX rates don\u2019t always move in Japan\u2019s favor.\n\nIn the preceding four years, for instance, the yen rose more than 30% versus the dollar, wiping out any coupon income earned on its FX investments at the time. Japan\u2019s investments are believed to have yielded very little over the years once the impact of foreign exchange is taken into account, prompting calls that its strategy on reserve management be revamped.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "While Japan is set to allow private fund managers to look after a small portion of its extremely-cautiously managed official foreign reserves starting next April, the jury is still out over where the project is heading.", "title": "Direction of Japan Foreign Reserve Management Plan Unclear", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/01/10/direction-of-japan-foreign-reserve-management-plan-unclear/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BB059_jasso_P_20140110010208.jpg"}, "site": "wsjasia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Direction of Japan Foreign Reserve Management Plan Unclear", "description": "While Japan is set to allow private fund managers to look after a small portion of its extremely-cautiously managed official foreign reserves starting next April, the jury is still out over where the project is heading.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Mitsuru Obe", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Japan Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Japan Real Time", "article.summary": "While Japan is set to allow private fund managers to look after a small portion of its extremely-cautiously managed official foreign reserves starting next April, the jury is still out over where the project is heading.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-01-10T09:30:48-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/01/10/direction-of-japan-foreign-reserve-management-plan-unclear/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-JRTB-15817", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "While Japan is set to allow private fund managers to look after a small portion of its extremely-cautiously managed official foreign reserves starting next April, the jury is still out over where the project is heading.", "title": "Direction of Japan Foreign Reserve Management Plan Unclear", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/01/10/direction-of-japan-foreign-reserve-management-plan-unclear/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BB059_jasso_P_20140110010208.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Japan Real Time", "article.id": "BL-JRTB-15817", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-01-10T09:30:48-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd82f3\"", "article_summary": "It said it will first recruit consultant firms that can best identify companies interested in being registered as managers of Japan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves.\nJapan\u2019s investments are believed to have yielded very little over the years once the impact of foreign exchange is taken into account, prompting calls that its strategy on reserve management be revamped.\nIn the fiscal year ended in March 2013, Japan\u2019s annual return on its investment in its foreign exchange reserves was a modest 2.5%.\nThe government passed a bill in November to allow private fund managers to manage some of the $1.267 trillion it holds in reserves\u2013the world\u2019s second largest after China.\nThe registered fund managers selected will then advise the government on what types of investments are most prudent."}
