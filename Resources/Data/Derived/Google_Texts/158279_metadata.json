His decision comes amid acourt review of Partners\u2019 controversial expansion plans and questions about Gottlieb\u2019s ability to manage political dynamics outside the hospital network.\n\nHis supporters point out that Gottlieb has just begun his second five-year contract, and they say Partners board members urged Gottlieb to stay. But some current and former Partners leaders say dissatisfaction with Gottlieb\u2019s leadership has been building for months and that the Partners in Health job offers Gottlieb a graceful way out.\n\nHe will take a dramatic pay cut, from more than $2 million a year to $200,000 a year at Partners in Health.\n\nGottlieb serves on the board at Partners in Health, has visited the group\u2019s projects in Haiti and Rwanda, and calls it the most important global health initiative in the world.\n\n\u201cThis is a singular opportunity to lead that organization at a time when it is clear that improving sustainable health care throughout the world is critical to all of us,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nGottlieb says he began thinking seriously about moving to Partners in Health this summer, and decided to make the change earlier in the fall after hearing Partners in Health co-founder Paul Farmer describe what was happening in West Africa.\n\n\u201cWith Ebola, maternal deaths had increased because there was no place for people to deliver babies,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cMalaria deaths had increased because there was no way to provide the appropriate care for what is a more ordinary terrible disease. The notion that building sustainable health care was essential for real social justice and real change had become even more obvious.\u201d\n\nAt Partners in Health, Gottlieb will be the first CEO and the first person to run the organization who is not one of its co-founders. He will replace Ophelia Dahl, who is the current director. She will chair the Partners in Health board.\n\n\u201cGary is a dream come true,\u201d said Farmer in a statement. \u201cHe weds deep affection for PIH\u2026 with the sort of management and clinical skills needed to bring PIH to the next level. There\u2019s no place from which to see this more clearly than West Africa right now.\u201d\n\nGottlieb says his pending departure will not interfere with plans to fold South Shore Hospital and Hallmark Health into the Partners network.\n\n\u201cWe have a very strong leadership team and very strong board and very strong institutions,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThe momentum in the work that we\u2019re doing will continue to move it forward. I don\u2019t believe that my departure will adversely affect those events.\u201d\n\nSeveral internal candidates are being suggested to succeed Gottlieb including Mass. General CEO Dr. Peter Slavin, Brigham and Women\u2019s President Dr. Betsy Nabel and Dr. David Torchiana, CEO of the Mass General Physician\u2019s Organization. Dr. Tom Lee, who left Partners last year, and Dr. Mike Jellinek, who moved from Partners to Lahey Health earlier this year, have also been mentioned as possible candidates.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to watch whether this resignation will lead to new strategic directions within the Partners organization,\u201d said Ellen Lutch Bender, president and CEO at Bender Strategies. \u201cLeadership changes on this level often reset corporate direction.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, some at Partners question whether Gottlieb should make the transition sooner, and avoid an eight-month period of limbo for the 10-hospital network.\n\nThis post was updated at 3:20 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Partners HealthCare CEO Dr. Gary Gottlieb will leave next summer to lead Partners in Health, the global health organization founded by Dr. Paul Farmer and now active in the battle against Ebola.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Partners HealthCare CEO Dr. Gary Gottlieb will leave next summer to lead Partners in Health, the global health organization founded by Dr. Paul Farmer and now active in the battle against Ebola.", "title": "Gottlieb Leaving Partners HealthCare For Partners In Health", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/10/gottlieb-leaving-partners-healthcare-for-partners-in-health", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2011/10/GaryGottlieb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/10/gottlieb-leaving-partners-healthcare-for-partners-in-health", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2011/10/GaryGottlieb.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Gottlieb Leaving Partners HealthCare For Partners In Health"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-25", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Sat, 25 Oct 2014 00:31:23 -0400"}, "article_summary": "Gottlieb Leaving Partners HealthCare For Partners In HealthThe CEO at Partners HealthCare, the state\u2019s largest private employer, plans to step down.\nDr. Gary Gottlieb agreed Friday to become the CEO at Partners in Health, a global health organization whose latest project is an Ebola response effort in West Africa.\n\u201cWe have a very strong leadership team and very strong board and very strong institutions,\u201d Gottlieb said.\nHis supporters point out that Gottlieb has just begun his second five-year contract, and they say Partners board members urged Gottlieb to stay.\nBut some current and former Partners leaders say dissatisfaction with Gottlieb\u2019s leadership has been building for months and that the Partners in Health job offers Gottlieb a graceful way out."}
