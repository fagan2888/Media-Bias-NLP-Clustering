(Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg)\n\nWelcome to Health Reform Watch, Jason Millman's regular look at how the Affordable Care Act is changing the American health-care system \u2014 and being changed by it.

That story was followed by news this week that the District of Columbia's largest insurer is asking for premium hikes much larger than the ones sought by its competitors.\n\nThe big takeaway from the Journal's story was this: \"With dominant market share now, analysts say, carriers feel they have room to raise rates.\"\n\nNow for the caveats. Even if an insurer is proposing a larger rate hike, it doesn't necessarily mean it would wind up with the most expensive plans \u2014 their plans this year may have been priced lower compared to the rest of the market and are coming more in line with their competition. Also, 2015 is still a big adjustment year, as insurers are starting to get a better picture of their enrollment mix. Finally, we're still dealing with proposed rates, which will undergo varying degrees of review before they're finalized, depending on the state.\n\nEither way, it got me wondering: Just how much will people buying their own coverage shop around for a better deal on health insurance year-to-year? By creating a marketplace where plans have to compete for business under the same rules, Obamacare is supposed to facilitate the shopping experience. Some recent studies throw cold water on that idea, though.\n\nJust 13 percent of seniors enrolled in Medicare's prescription drug program changed plans during the annual enrollment period, according to an October 2013 Kaiser Family Foundation survey that reviewed the first five years of program enrollment. Those facing the highest premium increases were the most likely to switch plans \u2014 anywhere between two and four times of the average rate of all enrollees who switched plans. Still more than two-thirds of enrollees who faced the highest premium increases stuck with their plans.\n\nAnd less than 2.5 percent of people enrolled in employer-sponsored insurance in 2010 had changed health plans that year in search of a cheaper or better-quality option, according to a survey released last year by the Center for Studying Health System Change. That was pretty similar to the rate in 2003, the center said.\n\nSo, can we expect similar activity \u2014 or non-activity, rather \u2014 in the individual market in the Obamacare era?\n\nLynn Quincy, associate director of health reform policy at Consumers Union, said the experience of the employer-sponsored insurance market could be indicative of the new individual market. The employer market shows that people would rather just stick in the same plan each year if they could help it, she said.\n\n\"They have lives to lead, and they'll ignore these things \u2014 just like how we don't mess around with our 401ks,\" Quincy said.\n\nRobert Laszewski, a consultant who's worked closely with the health insurance industry in the Affordable Care Act rollout, said last week's Kaiser Family Foundation survey on Obamacare's first enrollment period indicates that people in the individual market could be more active shoppers. In particular, the survey found that cost was the most important factor for people choosing a new ACA-compliant health plan this year.\n\nThere's also a very active policy debate taking place around the process for renewing health plans. The administration is expected to issue guidelines that could determine how easy it will be for people to stay in their existing individual health plans.\n\nAnd then there's the technical question of how easily enrollment systems can re-verify an existing enrollee's income, which is essential for determining eligibility for federal subsidies. Laszewski said people who received financial assistance \u2014 which was about 85 percent of exchange customers this year \u2014 will likely have to go through the eligibility process again next year.\n\n\"That opens the door to people reconsidering who their carrier is and might lead to more switching \u2014 particularly based upon priced,\" he said.\n\nTop health policy reads from around the Web:\n\nActually, health spending fell in the first quarter. \"The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter by the most since the depths of the last recession as consumer spending cooled. ... Outlays for health spending actually slowed in the first quarter, subtracting 0.16 percentage point from GDP. The Commerce Department previously estimated those outlays added 1 percentage point to GDP.\" Jeanne Smialek for Bloomberg.\n\nMaybe we're not in as much pain as we thought? \"When faced with intense criticism for her agency's approval of the powerful narcotic painkiller Zohydro, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret Hamburg turned to a sobering statistic:100 million Americans are suffering from severe chronic pain, she said. The 100 million figure has become a central part of the debate over the use of narcotic painkillers. ... That number \u2014 the equivalent of more than 40% of the U.S. adult population \u2014 is exaggerated and misleading, according to pain experts familiar with how it was derived.\" John Fauber of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nVirginia GOP hires a SCOTUS heavyweight to fight the Medicaid expansion. Virginia House Republicans on Wednesday launched their opening salvo in an anticipated legal battle over Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s plan to unilaterally expand Medicaid against the wishes of the General Assembly. In a conference call with reporters, House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) trumpeted an analysis by former U.S. solicitor general Paul D. Clement, whom House Republicans hired to offer his legal opinion on a fight that has bitterly divided the Capitol. ... Clement, a partner at the Washington law firm Bancroft PLLC, served as U.S. solicitor general from 2005 to 2008 under President George W. Bush, and he has argued more than 70 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.\" Jenna Portnoy and Laura Vozzell in the Washington Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even if it means a better deal, people are resistant to changing health plans.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Even if it means a better deal, people are resistant to changing health plans.", "title": "People hate shopping for health insurance.
