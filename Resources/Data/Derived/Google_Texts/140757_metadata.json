Over-the-counter birth control has support from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a point that several Republican candidates have pointed out when their motives were questioned. Yet the same medical association is quite clear that women still need insurance coverage for contraception. Not all women can or want to take the pill, and other forms of birth control like the IUD are expensive and require a doctor\u2019s appointment. In June, ACOG warned politicians against using calls for over-the-counter contraception \u201cas a political tool.\u201d\n\nThat Republicans need such a tool to alter their reputation among women is obvious. Young women are the key demographic in many midterm battlegrounds, and according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted in July and August, they prefer a Democrat-controlled Congress by a fourteen-point margin. (Men, on the other hand, favor Republicans by seventeen points.)\n\nBut why over-the-counter birth control, specifically? It\u2019s a win-win-win for Republicans trying to appeal to female voters, while bashing Obamacare and boosting their free-market street cred. Candidates can say they support access to contraption while celebrating a \u201cmarket-based approach to medicine,\u201d as the editorial board of National Review described it recently. The editors commended Republicans for \u201crunning\u2026to get government out of the birth-control business as much as possible, and to free up access to it for the women who want it.\u201d\n\nTo understand why this sudden embrace of \u201caccess\u201d is a racket, and a dangerous one, consider Kevin Williamson, National Review\u2019s self-described \u201croving correspondent.\u201d In a recent post titled \u201cFive Reasons Why You\u2019re Too Dumb to Vote,\u201d Williamson characterizes women who care about preserving access to abortion or the birth control mandate as \u201cwomen who cannot figure out how to walk into Walgreens, lay down the price of a latte, and walk out with her own birth-control pills, no federal intervention necessary.\u201d He goes on to applaud the editorial board\u2019s endorsement of the over-the-counter birth control fad.\n\nA few days later, Williamson declared that women who have abortions should be hanged. \u201cI\u2019m torn on capital punishment generally; but treating abortion as homicide means what it means,\u201d he said on Twitter. To be clear: what \u201cpro-life\u201d Williamson is arguing for is putting one in every three women in the United States to death.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are not resisting the GOP\u2019s suggestion because of any quibbles with its policy substance,\u201d National Review said in response to suggestions that the GOP\u2019s embrace of over-the-counter birth control smacks of opportunism. \u201cThey hem and haw because they want to continue to depict Republicans as intent on keeping contraceptives away from women.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what Republicans are or aren\u2019t intent on. The bottom line is that a variety of conservative positions, from opposition to the ACA to federal funding for women\u2019s clinics, have had or would have the very real effect of making it more difficult for women to access healthcare in general and contraceptives specifically.\n\nFurthermore, contraception is hardly the sum of women\u2019s medical needs. When conservatives fight to empower women to make decisions about their own bodies in all cases, regardless of income, then maybe we\u2019ll take them seriously. In the meantime, there\u2019s little of substance in an ideology that promotes birth control without a prescription for some women and hanging for others.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/prochoice_ap_img_1-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Zo\u00eb Carpenter", "description": "Calls for the pill to be available without a prescription are just naked attempts to woo female voters and mask opposition to the Obamacare birth control mandate.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Calls for the pill to be available without a prescription are just naked attempts to woo female voters and mask opposition to the Obamacare birth control mandate.", "title": "Don\u2019t Fall for the GOP\u2019s Over-the-Counter Contraception Racket", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/dont-fall-gops-over-counter-contraception-racket/", "image": {"width": 615, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/prochoice_ap_img_1.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 386}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T08:27:44+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Calls for the pill to be available without a prescription are just naked attempts to woo female voters and mask opposition to the Obamacare birth control mandate.", "title": "Don\u2019t Fall for the GOP\u2019s Over-the-Counter Contraception Racket", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/dont-fall-gops-over-counter-contraception-racket/", "image": {"height": 386, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/prochoice_ap_img_1.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/prochoice_ap_img_1.jpg", "width": 615}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "October 2nd, 2014", "sailthru.title": "Don\u2019t Fall for the GOP\u2019s Over-the-Counter Contraception Racket", "keywords": "Zo\u00eb Carpenter, The Nation, Reproductive Rights, Women\u2019s Rights, Republicans, Abortion, Over-the-Counter Contraception, Fraud,", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 112886, "sailthru.tags": "Elections,Feminism,Healthcare Policy,Reproductive Rights,The Right,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "Fraud", "published_time": "2014-10-02T17:59:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T08:27:44+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/"}, "sailthru.description": "Calls for the pill to be available without a prescription are just naked attempts to woo female voters and mask opposition to the Obamacare birth control mandate.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/prochoice_ap_img_1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Over-the-counter birth control has support from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a point that several Republican candidates have pointed out when their motives were questioned.\nBut why over-the-counter birth control, specifically?\n\u201cDemocrats are not resisting the GOP\u2019s suggestion because of any quibbles with its policy substance,\u201d National Review said in response to suggestions that the GOP\u2019s embrace of over-the-counter birth control smacks of opportunism.\nIn June, ACOG warned politicians against using calls for over-the-counter contraception \u201cas a political tool.\u201dThat Republicans need such a tool to alter their reputation among women is obvious.\nIn the meantime, there\u2019s little of substance in an ideology that promotes birth control without a prescription for some women and hanging for others."}
