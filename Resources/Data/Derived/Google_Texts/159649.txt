NightLight Pediatric Urgent Care fact sheet NightLight Pediatric Urgent Care's mission is to provide quality, affordable, compassionate service for infants, children and adolescents. NightLight exists to be the first-choice provider for pediatric urgent care when the primary pediatrician is not available. NightLight improves quality of healthcare by coordinating with the primary care physician to care for their patients after-hours, reducing the cost of such health care through an emergency room or other forms of urgent care. Services NightLight is focused exclusively on pediatric care and services, directly with the childs pediatrician, and is not a competitor or replacement, differentiating it from other urgent care practices. By intentionally not providing well-child checks or vaccinations and maintaining its4 commitment to hours of operation that do not overlap with primary physician offices, NightLight truly partners with the primary care provider in the community and strongly supports the medical home model. When parents visit NightLight, they know their child will be seen by a pediatric-trained practitioner. Always having a pediatric-trained physician on duty, and PCP call in priority are other important and key differences that make NightLight stand out from its competition. NightLight services are offered after hours, on weekends and evenings, when the primary care physicians office is closed. Once the child is seen at NightLight, a summary report of the visit is provided to the pediatrician as part of the coordination of care with the primary care physician. Services include x-rays, wound care and repair, splinting, management of mild-to-moderate dehydration, fever management and education, breathing treatments, prescriptions plus treatment and education, detailed coordination of care, and wart removal. Locations With the opening of the Webster clinic in September 2015, NightLight now covers each quadrant of the Houston metro area giving families easy access to after-hours pediatric urgent care in or near where they live.
