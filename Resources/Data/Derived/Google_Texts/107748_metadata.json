(AP) - The two killers who cut their way out of a maximum-security prison apparently used tools routinely stored there by contractors, taking care to return them to their toolboxes after each night\u2019s work so that no one would notice, a prosecutor said Sunday.\n\nDistrict Attorney Andrew Wylie also said that Joyce Mitchell, the prison tailoring shop instructor charged with helping the men escape, had agreed to pick them up in her car and drive off with them but backed out at the last minute because she still loved her husband and felt guilty for participating.\n\n\u201cBasically, when it was go-time and it was the actual day of the event, I do think she got cold feet and realized, \u2018What am I doing?\u2019\u201d Wylie said. \u201cReality struck. She realized that, really, the grass wasn\u2019t greener on the other side.\u201d\n\nWylie said there was no evidence the men had a \u201cPlan B\u201d once the getaway driver backed out, and no vehicles have been reported stolen in the area.\n\nThat has led searchers to believe the men are still near the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, where the manhunt was in its ninth day Sunday, with hundreds of law enforcement officers slogging through mosquito-infested woods, fields and swamps close to the Canadian border for Richard Matt and David Sweat.\n\nAt the same time, Gov. Andrew Cuomo cautioned that for all anyone knows, the convicts could be in Mexico by now.\n\nWylie said it apparently took a long time for the killers to complete their plan, working methodically between midnight and 5 a.m. over many nights.\n\n\u201cThey had access, from what we understand, to other tools left in the facility by contractors under policy and were able to open the toolboxes and use those tools and then put them back so nobody would notice,\u201d the prosecutor said.\n\nHe also said the men had been scouting out the tunnel system under the prison at night for the best way get out.\n\nThe convicts used power tools to cut through the back of their adjacent cells, broke through a brick wall, then cut into a steam pipe and slithered through it, finally emerging outside the prison walls through a manhole, authorities said.\n\nWorkers on Sunday welded shut a manhole at the base of a wall on the side of the prison where the two men escaped. They also sealed two other manholes on the street near prison, including the one the convicts climbed out of.\n\nMitchell, 51, was charged Friday with supplying hacksaw blades, chisels, a punch and a screwdriver. Her lawyer entered a not guilty plea on her behalf, and her son Tobey told NBC she would not have helped the inmates break out.\n\nWylie said Sunday the two inmates planned to have Mitchell drive them about seven hours away to an unknown destination.\n\nResidents were very much on edge, with some saying they were keeping guns handy. But there was also an outpouring of support for the search effort. A restaurant urged people to tie blue ribbons around trees and mailboxes.\n\n\u201cThe locals have been awesome,\u201d said Sgt. Barry Cartier of the Franklin County Sheriff\u2019s Department, part of a crew from a neighboring county working 12-hour shifts. \u201cThey come around with food all the time. We\u2019ve got too much to eat.\u201d\n\nSweat, 35, was serving a life sentence without parole for killing a sheriff\u2019s deputy. Matt, 48, was doing 25 years to life for the 1997 kidnap, torture and hacksaw dismemberment of his former boss.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Joseph B. Frederick in Cadyville, New York, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show David Sweat\u2019s age as 35.
