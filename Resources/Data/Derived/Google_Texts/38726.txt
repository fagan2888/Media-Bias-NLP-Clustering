Nestled between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial is the World War II Memorial, a 7.4-acre site in Washington, D.C., honoring the 16 million American men and women who served in the war.

Eleven years ago, on April 29, 2004, the memorial opened to the nation and since then, hundreds of thousands of visitors and veterans from across the world have come to pay their respects.

In honor of the heroic men and women of World War II, we take a look back at some touching moments captured at the memorial over the past 11 years.
