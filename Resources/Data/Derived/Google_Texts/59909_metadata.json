Just like Israelis and Palestinians, Crips and Bloods, Yankees and Red Sox, teachers unions and the charter movement simply don\u2019t like each other. That\u2019s just the way it is.\n\nBut according to a recent piece in the American Prospect by Rachel M. Cohen, the truth of how charters and unions relate to one another is more complicated. It turns out that there are some charter school teachers out there who\u2019ve started to think a union isn\u2019t such a bad idea after all; and their ranks are growing. Whether it\u2019s in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago or New York, Cohen shows, the future of education policy is very much in flux. In fact, the day when the financial backers of charters have to decide which they care about more \u2014 breaking unions or educating kids \u2014 may arrive sooner than you think.\n\nRecently, Salon spoke over the phone with Cohen to discuss her piece, the motivations of charter teachers who are seeking to unionize, and why their success may actually bring charters closer to their historical roots and original mission. Our conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nHow widespread are the efforts to unionize among charter teachers?\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not the majority. They say 7 percent of all charter school teachers are currently unionized, and half of those were because the state set that up when they created the charter law. For example, in Baltimore, which I didn\u2019t talk about in my piece, all charter school teachers are unionized, but not because they came together and started a union draft like they\u2019re doing in Philadelphia or Chicago, where the state said you have to follow your district\u2019s collective bargaining unit.\n\nBy no measure is it the majority, but what\u2019s interesting now is that there are fairly larger networks of charter schools starting to do it, and if alliance charter school teachers succeed in L.A. (which is the largest charter school network), then that would impact what other smaller schools do.\n\nWhat tend to be the pro-union teachers\u2019 complaints?\n\nMost charter school teachers work on year-to-year contracts, which does not provide great stability, especially if you\u2019re trying to create a family.\n\nOne of the things that I saw was that charter school teachers tended to be younger, and some of the teachers that I spoke with who were in their early 30s were like, \u201cI want to stay at this school, but if I want to get married and have kids there\u2019s no way that I can not know if I have a job in September once May rolls around. I need to either work in a district school or unionize this school, because this whole tenuous working model is not sustainable for the kind of middle-class life I\u2019m trying to build.\u201d So that\u2019s something all workers are trying to figure out how to get for themselves.\n\nThere\u2019s definitely also charter school teachers who want to form unions because they think that that\u2019s how they\u2019re going to best serve their kids. Charter school proponents on the political level will say, \u201cWe value the voices of teachers; we like having small schools where everybody can get a say.\u201d But, in reality, a lot of teachers don\u2019t feel like they have the voice that their administrators claim they have. Especially in some of the charter school chains that are very rapidly expanding, teachers said to me that all the decisions were coming from bureaucratic offices far away from the classroom, and that they don\u2019t really have a say and are scared to say anything because their positions are already fairly precarious.\n\nAre there any bedrock practices of the charter model that a unionized school couldn\u2019t do?\n\nOne of the interesting things about that is that charter schools want to innovate, and they worry that their innovations would be stilted by the creation of unions. I think that obscures what\u2019s actually going on, which is that the administrators want the freedom to create whatever policies they want without having to negotiate how they pay teachers.\n\nI spoke with someone, and he articulated the core of the tensions quite well. He said, \u201clook, if KIPP decides that teaching on a Saturday is what\u2019s best for the kids, and that\u2019s going to get the best result, then they should just be able do that without having to go through a teachers union and negotiate and/or pay them more to do so.\u201d I think that\u2019s the core of these issues, which is that you can do all these things, but should you have to actually engage with these workers to make these decisions?\n\nTo take a step back, what was the original vision of a charter school?\n\nThe original vision was first proposed by the president of the American Federation of Teachers, Albert Shanker, in 1988. He gave a speech in Washington, D.C., envisioning this new type of school. It would be independent, smaller, still part of the public school system, still unionized, but certain union regulations would be relaxed so that the school could try and test out new educational practices, and do more experimental things with the hopes that, if something proved effective, they could apply the practices to regular public schools.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A growing number of charter school teachers want to unionize, the American Prospect's Rachel M.
