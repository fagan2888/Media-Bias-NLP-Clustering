What does it mean to you?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUser interface is something that no one cares about \u2014 unless it\u2019s really bad, then everyone complains. UI designers think about form and function \u2014 how to make information accessible no matter who the user is.\n\nTouchscreen or mouse? What\u2019s your preferred method of input?\n\nIf I were working on a site or application aimed at younger folks under 18, I\u2019d make sure the interface was fully touch-enabled. This generation has grown up exposed to smartphones and now touch-enabled laptops. But older generations, like my own, grew up with a mouse and keyboard. While I am comfortable using tablets and such, I don\u2019t default to that kind of input.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act launch has been stymied by much-publicized website glitches. What is your reaction to the troubled website?\n\nMy gut tells me the site is hard to navigate and could be simplified. I spent 20 minutes reading about stuff only to find out in the end, \u201cSorry but you need to go here for Massachusetts.\u201d Immediately I\u2019m frustrated. The best tutorials casually guide you along the way, not bombard you with a bunch of steps.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite projects that you\u2019ve worked on?\n\n\u201cRock Band Blitz\u201d was definitely my baby. I looked at all the previous \u201cRock Band\u201d games. I didn\u2019t want to stray too far from the originals, but still [wanted to] make it easier and faster to access songs and other content. It was one of the rare instances where a reviewer wrote, \u201cThe interface was really good.\u201d That little blurb made my day.\n\n\n\nIs there a certain style that you\u2019re known for?\n\nI love doing neon \u2014 it\u2019s becoming my hallmark. It\u2019s fun to do apps with neon lights all over the place. I don\u2019t want to go to Vegas, but I want the lights of Vegas.\n\nWhen you\u2019re pushing pixels, what\u2019s your choice of music?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I was going to college, I\u2019d work 14 hours at a time. While everyone else had Spotify or Pandora on, I started putting on movies as background noise while I worked. I\u2019ve listened to the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d trilogy 13 times and the \u201cFirefly\u201d series 32 times.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.821119393", "eomportal-id": 1965480, "description": "Aaron Artessa, art director for the Boston interactive studio Infrared5, works at the intersection of technology and design, devising the so-called \u201cuser-interface\u201d that controls how friendly a gadget or its applications are to operate.
