(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nA group seeking to lead a broad national effort by consumers to make health care more affordable and available has formed in Washington, contending that even with more widespread insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, many people cannot obtain the care they need.\n\nPartners for Better Care claims it already represents 10 million patients through affiliations with other advocacy groups such as AIDS United, the Parkinson\u2019s Action Network and United Cerebral Palsy. The organization also is hoping to enlist larger health care advocacy groups.\n\nThe group plans to \u201cdevelop a campaign that\u2019s wide in scope to address these humongous needs,\u201d said Mary Richards, its executive director. Chief among those may be pushing back against cost-shifting by insurance companies to patients, who find themselves increasingly burdened by co-payments, higher deductibles and other costs for services that insurance companies decline to cover. The group\u2019s first move will be a \u201cpatient charter\u201d centered around availability, affordability and transparency in health care delivery.\n\nOne member is Elizabeth Page, 51, who has multiple sclerosis. The annual cost of her medications was about $8,000 to $9,000 when she was diagnosed in 1995. Today the same drugs cost about $67,000. Much of that cost is born by her insurance coverage, she said, but her deductible has risen to $3,800 each year. People with other diseases, especially cancer, are paying even more annually in out-of-pocket costs and some have been forced into bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cThere are 13 disease-modifying therapies today for multiple sclerosis,\u201d Page said. \u201cBut not all of them are [covered by insurance available] on each state\u2019s exchange or on the federal exchange.\u201d\n\nFunding for the group comes from Novo Nordisk, the Danish company known best for its diabetes care products. But Richards said that doesn\u2019t mean the coalition will be advocating for drug or other medical product companies in their frequent battles with insurance companies. Novo Nordisk has no role in setting coalition policy, she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Partners for Better Care claims it already represents 10 million patients through affiliations with other advocacy groups such as AIDS United, the Parkinson's Action Network and United Cerebral Palsy.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Partners for Better Care claims it already represents 10 million patients through affiliations with other advocacy groups such as AIDS United, the Parkinson's Action Network and United Cerebral Palsy.", "title": "New patient coalition aims to take on cost of health care, access to quality treatment", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/12/04/new-patient-coalition-aims-to-take-on-cost-of-health-care-access-to-quality-treatment/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/09/Editorial-Opinion/Images/495382804-1544.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LennyMBernstein"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, drugs, lobbying, health care, patients, cost, price, insurance, Affordable Care Act,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, drugs, lobbying, health care, patients, cost, price, insurance, Affordable Care Act,"}, "article_summary": "The group\u2019s first move will be a \u201cpatient charter\u201d centered around availability, affordability and transparency in health care delivery.\nChief among those may be pushing back against cost-shifting by insurance companies to patients, who find themselves increasingly burdened by co-payments, higher deductibles and other costs for services that insurance companies decline to cover.\nThe organization also is hoping to enlist larger health care advocacy groups.\nBut Richards said that doesn\u2019t mean the coalition will be advocating for drug or other medical product companies in their frequent battles with insurance companies.\nMuch of that cost is born by her insurance coverage, she said, but her deductible has risen to $3,800 each year."}
