Bridges are connections. They are those things that bond us. Bridges are usually constructed of strong materials â€” steel, concrete, stone or wood. Their strength may be compromised over time by forces of nature. The bridges between us are the common interests that we share. Our words and actions can be as damaging, and ultimately destructive, to our relationships as forces of nature can be to a physical structure.
