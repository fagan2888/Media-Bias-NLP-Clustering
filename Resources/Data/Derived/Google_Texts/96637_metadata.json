Jones and Blakney are Daniel\u2019s siblings and they will be her caregivers.\n\nLocal business owner Linda Edmonds is hosting a fundraiser to help a Coweta County resident raise money for a lung transplant.\n\n\n\nThe fundraiser involves voting on children\u2019s\u2019 photos through Edmonds' studio, Precious Memories Portraits.\n\nJil Daniel was diagnosed with Pulmonary Fibrosis in February 2015. The disease causes scarring of the lungs, which makes it difficult to breathe. There is no cure, but treatment can slow the scarring of the lungs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for a long time,\u201d said Edmonds. \u201cI wanted to do something to help her.\u201d\n\nDaniel said that she had been seeing the signs of the disease since 2010.\n\n\u201cI would be very tired just going up and down stairs,\u201d said Daniel. \u201cIn 2014, I insisted on a lung biopsy. When I received my diagnosis, I thought I had dodged the bullet because it wasn\u2019t cancer , but then I found out it was terminal. I am on oxygen all the time now.\n\nDaniel said that three months after her diagnosis, her local pulmonary specialist told her they would just keep her comfortable.\n\n\u201cI started doing some research on my own and called Duke University about a lung transplant,\u201d said Daniel. \u201cI\u2019m on the path to a transplant. My lungs are still good at the moment. \u201c\n\nDaniel said that the transplant could cost up to $1 million with insurance covering 80 percent of the costs. Daniel also said she is looking to travel to Duke University in North Carolina anytime between March until the end of August.\n\n\u201cThe doctors said I probably won\u2019t be up to doing anything for a month after surgery,\u201d said Daniel. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fabulous what Linda is doing. We will be hosting additional fundraisers to help with expenses as well. My brother Joe Jones is a retired RN and he will be my primary caregiver. My sister Jan Blakney is the executive assistant for a surgeon and she will be my secondary caregiver. I\u2019m so lucky they have altered their lives for me.\u201d\n\nThe rules for the 2016 Essence of Childhood Contest are as follows:\n\nThe entry fee is $25.\n\nContestants must use a photo of their child(ren) that has been taken by Precious Memories Photography.\n\nAnyone can vote on their favorite portrait(s) for $1 per vote. The top 20 portraits will be determined by the votes. Voting will last about three weeks.\n\nSix winning images will then be selected and judged by a panel of three to five judges based on how well the portrait displays the essence of childhood.\n\nThe grand prize winner will receive a 16 x 20 linen portrait of their winning image and $100 Baby Dimensions gift certificate.\n\nThe five runner-ups will receive a 11 x 14 linen portrait of their winning image and a $50 Baby Dimension gift certificate.\n\nAll entries must be submitted by March 4.\n\n\u201cAll of the proceeds from the voting will go to Jil,\u201d said Edmonds.\n\nFor more information, contact Edmonds at 770-254-9660.\n\nUncle Maddio\u2019s Pizza is also hosting a fundraiser on Thursday, Feb. 18 from 5-8 p.m. Customers must indicate they\u2019re there for Jil\u2019s event and 10 percent of the proceeds will be donated to her.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "The Newnan Times-Herald", "description": "Local business owner Linda Edmonds is hosting a fundraiser to help a Coweta County resident raise money for a lung transplant.", "title": "\u200bFundraiser planned for lung transplant patient", "url": "http://times-herald.com/news/2016/02/fundraiser-being-held-for-local-who-needs-lung-transplant", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://cdn.nthstatic.net/static/global/og-logo-default.jpg", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://times-herald.com/", "description": "Local business owner Linda Edmonds is hosting a fundraiser to help a Coweta County resident raise money for a lung transplant.", "title": "\u200bFundraiser planned for lung transplant patient", "url": "http://times-herald.com/news/2016/02/fundraiser-being-held-for-local-who-needs-lung-transplant", "image": "//cdn.nthstatic.net/assets/photos/2016/fundraiser-being-held-for-local-who-needs-lung-transplant/_articlePhotoFull/lung.jpg?mtime=20160212063945", "site": "@TimesHerald", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "fb": {"admins": "7027018, 100000783540613, 501100169, 100006595873641"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cdn.nthstatic.net/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "Local"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "Local business owner Linda Edmonds is hosting a fundraiser to help a Coweta County resident raise money for a lung transplant.\n\u201cI started doing some research on my own and called Duke University about a lung transplant,\u201d said Daniel.\n\u201cDaniel said that the transplant could cost up to $1 million with insurance covering 80 percent of the costs.\nThe fundraiser involves voting on children\u2019s\u2019 photos through Edmonds' studio, Precious Memories Portraits.\n\u201cI wanted to do something to help her.\u201dDaniel said that she had been seeing the signs of the disease since 2010."}
