It was a big enough breach of political etiquette to Yoho that he decided to address the radio spots on his campaign website, and he posted a response on his Facebook page Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAs a rule I do not respond to personal attacks. However, my opponent has chosen to make negative remarks in the media with regard to my son. Since I believe morally and ethically that family members should never become the target of such campaign attacks, I have agreed to publish my son\u2019s response below,\u201d Yoho said.\n\nYoho\u2019s campaign manager, Kat Cammack, said Yoho was upset about the nepotism charges. As a newly elected congressman he didn\u2019t have the pull to get his son an internship, she said.\n\n\u201cDragging family members in crosses the line,\u201d Cammack said.\n\nIn fact, Rush\u2019s attack on Yoho\u2019s son backfired, she said. Yoho\u2019s Facebook post about the attack has garnered 700 likes for the congressman and 200 comments of support, she said.\n\nYoho\u2019s son, Tyler Marlin Yoho, responded by setting the record straight about both his internship and his police record.\n\nThat \u201ccushy\u201d internship his father got him? Not so much, Tyler Yoho said. Tyler had an unpaid internship that he says he was offered after striking up a conversation with North Carolina Rep. Robert Pittenger during a train ride while in Washington last January for his father\u2019s swearing-in ceremony.\n\nTyler went on to say he got the internship after graduating from college and slept on his parents\u2019 couch for six weeks.\n\n\u201cI was in the office at 8 a.m. every morning, sorted hundreds of pieces of mail, listened to angry constituents on the phone, fetched coffee, worked on research projects for legislative staff and handled an assortment of administrative duties. I left the office late each night and tried my best to learn as much as I could,\u201d Tyler wrote.\n\nTyler chalked up his criminal record to poor decisions he made as a college student. He was arrested in 2009 and again in 2012 on charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest without violence. In the 2009 case, he pleaded no contest and was granted deferred prosecution. In the second case, he again pleaded no contest and had adjudication withheld.\n\nHe also said no one tried to scrub his record, which is available for anyone to see on the Alachua County Clerk of Courts website.\n\n\u201cNo attempt has been made to cover up my record, unlike your efforts to scrub your \u2018embarrassing\u2019 past, as quoted by the Gainesville Sun on April 2, 2014,\u201d Tyler said, taking a swipe at Rush\u2019s past as a live-action role-playing enthusiast.\n\nIn the Sun article, Rush admitted to deleting Web content regarding his role-playing past in an elaborate vampire game and some sexually threatening messages he allegedly sent to other players online.\n\nRush, also a former deputy for the Alachua County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said Yoho\u2019s camp used the role-playing past as a distraction from real issues.\n\n\u201cAfter their April 1 smear, the Yoho campaign\u2019s complaints about negative campaigning are further hypocrisy,\u201d Rush said.\n\nRush has characterized himself as a straight-shooting Christian conservative, and he has accused Yoho of not being conservative enough for North Central Florida, having voted to fund the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn a letter to Tyler, Rush encouraged the younger Yoho to take advantage of his dad\u2019s time in Congress. \u201cNot everyone is a congressman\u2019s son who gets a congressional internship and the State Attorney, Jeff Siegmeister, to represent them when they violate the law,\u201d Rush wrote.\n\nSiegmeister is the state attorney for the Third Judicial Circuit in Lake City, representing Columbia, Dixie, Suwannee and Taylor counties. He was not state attorney at the time he represented the younger Yoho, Cammack said.\n\n\u201cIf Ted Yoho sends anyone, including his son, to call this campaign a liar, they can expect a factual rebuttal backed by evidence,\u201d Rush said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bringing a candidate\u2019s family into a political campaign is an unwritten no-no, but that didn\u2019t stop Jake Rush from putting Congressman Ted Yoho\u2019s son into the fray.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-6C232568-4A1B-422D-985F-27AA60A32A8F-pubOS"}, "og": {"site_name": "Ocala.com", "description": "Bringing a candidate\u2019s family into a political campaign is an unwritten no-no, but that didn\u2019t stop Jake Rush from putting Congressman Ted Yoho\u2019s son into the fray.", "title": "Jake Rush heaps criticism on Yoho, takes Yoho's son to task", "url": "http://www.ocala.com/article/20140718/ARTICLES/140719691", "image": {"width": 160, "identifier": "http://www.gainesville.com/global/images/fb/OS.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 160}, "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20140718, "fb": {"admins": 100004135120432, "app_id": 162010827183725}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-140719691-pubOS"}}, "keywords": "OCALA (FL),  Politics,  Special Report,  Article"}, "article_summary": "Yoho\u2019s son, Tyler Marlin Yoho, responded by setting the record straight about both his internship and his police record.\nIn a letter to Tyler, Rush encouraged the younger Yoho to take advantage of his dad\u2019s time in Congress.\nBringing a candidate\u2019s family into a political campaign is an unwritten no-no, but that didn\u2019t stop Jake Rush from putting Congressman Ted Yoho\u2019s son into the fray.\nIn fact, Rush\u2019s attack on Yoho\u2019s son backfired, she said.\nYoho\u2019s campaign manager, Kat Cammack, said Yoho was upset about the nepotism charges."}
