(Photo: File/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo\n\nThe state Senate this week could vote on a bill that would make it easier to sell or lease public water and sewer utilities to private companies.\n\nThe Senate needs to defeat this bill.\n\nThe Assembly passed its version (Assembly Bill 554) by voice vote last month, while this past week a Senate committee approved it. So in just over two months from its introduction, a bill that would make it easier to sell public water and sewer utilities is poised to pass the Legislature.\n\nThe bill\u2019s fast track must certainly indicate there\u2019s a problem with these public utilities and residents\u2019 welfare is at stake.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t. No crisis here.\n\nThe quick action must be a result of the clamoring of municipalities and the public.\n\nNo, again. The League of Wisconsin Municipalities supports the bill because it says it would rather have elected officials make decisions instead of using referendums, however, it didn\u2019t request the change, nor apparently did any of its members.\n\nThe reason this bill is in the Legislature is because a company, Aqua America, sought the change.\n\nThe publicly traded water and wastewater utility is based in Pennsylvania and serves about 3 million people in eight states, including Illinois.\n\nIt wants to enter Wisconsin, not because our municipal water and sewer utilities are so bad that they need help. No, it wants to make money, just like any publicly traded company wants to make money.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that, except when it deals with such critical services as our water and sewer systems.\n\nWhen that\u2019s the case, we prefer to have an entity in charge that\u2019s answerable to the local government and residents for water rate and quality issues, that\u2019s controlled by people who would be affected by their decisions, and that must adhere to the state\u2019s Open Records and Open Meetings laws.\n\nWe want our water and sewer utilities run by people who act in the best interests of those they serve, not shareholders.\n\nLook at it this way, if a private company ran a city\u2019s water utility and you objected to the rate increases or the quality of the drinking water, you couldn\u2019t take your business elsewhere because there would be nowhere else to go. You\u2019d be stuck or have to move. The people you'd complain to wouldn't have to listen.\n\nIn Fort Wayne, Ind., the city paid $67 million to buy back a water utility that was run by Aqua America. The immediate results of that repurchase were a reduction in rates for those 12,600 customers and savings associated with using pre-softened water.\n\nWe understand that public utilities and governmental bodies aren\u2019t perfect. Bad governmental decisions are having a disastrous effect in Flint, Mich., where lead in the drinking water has set back the community for decades. However, those problems were due to the lack of local control and are easily traced to the governor\u2019s office where decisions were made to cut costs and use a different, albeit more polluted, water source.\n\nWe believe a municipality can exercise more control and influence over one of its departments than it can over a privately owned company that\u2019s handling those duties in order to make money from afar.\n\nThe bill itself is rigged to help the private utilities, not the taxpayers of Wisconsin. Consider these changes:\n\n\u00bb A referendum would not be required to approve the sale of a public utility. The law now says that after the state Public Service Commission approves the deal, the municipality must hold a referendum. Under the proposed changes, a referendum is held only if a petition is filed within 60 days.\n\n\u00bb Residents won\u2019t know what they\u2019re voting on. Under current law, the referendum is held after the PSC approves the sale and sets the price and terms of the sale or lease. Under the proposal, if there even is a referendum it would be held before the PSC action. That means voters won\u2019t have information on the cost or other terms of the deal.\n\nIf there\u2019s no referendum, the sale goes straight to the PSC.\n\nThose changes aren\u2019t being made to benefit taxpayers; they are being made to benefit privately run utilities.\n\nThink about it. Sen. Tyler August, R-Lake Geneva, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he introduced the bill after meeting with Aqua America representatives, not after talking with municipalities or residents who were worried about their water.\n\nLike so much that this Legislature has done, it has come up with a solution for a problem that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nThe Green Bay Press-Gazette is part of the USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin.\n\nCONTACT YOUR SENATOR\n\nWe encourage readers to call, email or write their senators and urge them to oppose this bill if it comes up for vote.\n\nIn Northeastern Wisconsin, state Sen. Frank Lasee, R-Ledgeview, is a co-sponsor of the bill, but Sen. David Hansen, D-Green Bay, held a news conference last week opposing it. Here are the Northeastern Wisconsin senators:\n\n\u00bb 1st District: Frank Lasee, R-Ledgeview, (608) 266-3512, Sen.Lasee@legis.wisconsin.gov\n\n\u00bb 2nd District: Rob Cowles, R-Allouez, (608) 266-0484, Sen.Cowles@legis.wisconsin.gov\n\n\u00bb 12th District: Thomas Tiffany, R-Hazelhurst, (608) 266-2509, Sen.Tiffany@legis.wi.gov\n\n\u00bb 30th District: Dave Hansen, D-Green Bay, (608) 266-5670, Sen.Hansen@legis.wisconsin.gov\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1T5IXtu", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Senate should reject bill that would make it easier to sell public water, sewer utilities.", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "Senate should reject bill that would make it easier to sell public water, sewer utilities.", "title": "Another solution in search of a problem", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/02/06/another-solution-search-problem/79894932/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senate should reject bill that would make it easier to sell public water, sewer utilities.", "title": "Another solution in search of a problem", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/53d6a68dc640a19025ded32de1d9396c424a6d7b/c=0-370-861-1231&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/05/WIGroup/GreenBay/635902885448524075-WATER-TOWER2.jpg", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "The bill\u2019s fast track must certainly indicate there\u2019s a problem with these public utilities and residents\u2019 welfare is at stake.\nLike so much that this Legislature has done, it has come up with a solution for a problem that doesn\u2019t exist.\nIn Fort Wayne, Ind., the city paid $67 million to buy back a water utility that was run by Aqua America.\nWe want our water and sewer utilities run by people who act in the best interests of those they serve, not shareholders.\nIt wants to enter Wisconsin, not because our municipal water and sewer utilities are so bad that they need help."}
