That felt good,\u201d Riel said.\n\nNearly 7,000 Michigan residents applied and selected health insurance plans since the federal marketplace debuted on Oct. 1, according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) figures released this month.\n\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services spokesman Richard A. Olague said on Thursday that countywide enrollment figures were not available.\n\nCitizens who want coverage to begin on Jan. 1 must enroll by Dec. 23 and pay their first month\u2019s premium on time. Federal officials extended the December deadline by a week in response to Healthcare.gov website failures.\n\n\n\nRiel, the Health Project\u2019s Community Benefit Operations manager, said the Mercy Health-affiliated nonprofit is among many groups that make up Enroll West Michigan, a new coalition made up of regional health and social services agencies.\n\nThe collective, which includes Muskegon Family Care, United Way of the Lakeshore and other entities, convened in August and has become a steering committee for reaching the area\u2019s vulnerable population, she said.\n\nIn the days leading up to October, community members canvassed Muskegon-area neighborhoods to tell residents where they could find in-person help.\n\nSome of those locations include the Health Project, Hackley Community Care Center and Hackley Public Library and come with the guidance of Certified Application Counselors, often known as CACs.\n\n\n\nThe aides can help with plan comparisons and with determining eligibility for government-funded subsidies that could reduce monthly premiums.\n\nAt the Health Project, clients often print out the plans from the Healthcare.gov website, review the material at home and then return to finish enrollment, Riel said. The portal allows consumers to compare and select private health insurance plans and gives them the opportunity to see if they find lower insurance costs before committing to a plan.\n\nAddressing concerns, misconceptions\n\nRiel said clients are most concerned about if their doctor and medications will be covered and if they will be able to afford the monthly premium.\n\nVirginia Graham, a specialist and Certified Application Counselor at Hackley Community Care Center, said in addition to those concerns, people are curious about the tax penalty for citizens who do not meet essential coverage requirements by March 31, 2014.\n\n\n\nAlso known as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d and \u201cindividual responsibility payment,\u201d the fee will cost citizens either $95 per adult or 1 percent of their annual income. Officials said the fees will be collected on federal tax returns and will increase annually.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern about it, but what I hope is that people understand there are many exemptions,\u201d Graham said.\n\nSome of those exemptions will be extended to people with extremely low income, federally recognized tribal membership and religious beliefs that oppose the government\u2019s programs.\n\nAfter the March deadline, individuals must have a qualifying life event to receive insurance through the federal exchange. Eligible circumstances could include moving to a new state or experiencing a major income and household changes, such as divorce.\n\nGraham, along with another Certified Application Counselor whose outreach and enrollment work is funded by an U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration grant, has traveled to libraries, churches, food trucks and other places to spread the word that help is available.\n\nGraham said the counselors perform a lot of education and assessments when offering enrollment assistance, including a client\u2019s understanding of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cMany, many people are not aware that \u2018Obamacare,\u2019 as it is called, is a law and not an insurance plan. Many components of the law are already in place,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThe health insurance marketplace is only one part.\u201d\n\nOne of those segments includes an optional Medicaid expansion provision, which Michigan lawmakers passed in September.\n\n\n\nDescribed as a key component of the Affordable Care Act, the Medicaid provision is expected to help low-income adults gain access to preventative care.\n\nBeth Scheel, patient advocate at Hackley Community Care Center, said people can visit Healthcare.gov on their own but they should know help is available.\n\n\u201cSometimes, two minds are better than one in some circumstances,\u201d Scheel said.\n\nThe federally certified counselors can help consumers navigate cancellation notices and find prescriptions not covered by their plans.\n\nFinding help\n\nGraham, who also works with Head Start and 21st Century After-School programs at Muskegon Public Schools, said the counselors can visit local churches and other community gathering places. This year they have visited Spring Street Baptist Church, New Hope Baptist Church and Zion Blue Lake Baptist Church, Graham said.\n\nRiel said about 30 certified counselors affiliated with Enroll West Michigan can help Muskegon County residents with their questions and applications.\n\n\u201cThere are many agencies working to get people the people information that they need,\u201d Riel said.\n\nMary Murphy, the assistant director at Hackley Public Library, said the downtown facility has become a partner in Enroll West Michigan by affirming its role as the \u201cgo-to\u201d place for consumer health information.\n\nThe library has set up two special computer workstations for use by patrons and Certified Application Counselors, Murphy said.\n\n\u201cWe already have computers. We have tech assistance. It\u2019s a natural place for people to get help to get enrolled,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe programs seems to be picking up some steam, but people aren\u2019t rushing in just yet.\u201d\n\nThe HHS on Thursday announced some steps federal officials are taking to ensure people will experience a smooth transition.\n\nThose steps include urging insurers to accept premium payments through Dec. 31 for plans set to begin on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\n\n\nThe HHS has also advised companies to refill prescriptions covered under previous plans during January and to treat out-of-network providers as in-network to ensure continuity of care for acute episodes or \u201cif the provider was listed in their plan\u2019s provider directory as of the date of an enrollee\u2019s enrollment.\"\n\nHHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius said officials will give people enrolled in the federally run Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan a chance to extend coverage through Jan. 31.\n\n\n\nMichigan lawmakers last week also initiated Affordable Care Act-related protections for citizens. The Michigan House approved several bills that could become effective in March, including laws on premium changes.\n\nHackley Public Library recommends registration by phone but some walk-in times may be available.
