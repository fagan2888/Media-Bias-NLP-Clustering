Dealmakers Closed 100 Fewer Transactions in October than the Same Month Last Year

Among the 154 transactions that managed to close were: Gerresheimers acquisition of rival Centor; Newell Rubbermaids purchase of Elmers glue and Krazy Glue brands; and ITTs addition of car brakes maker Wolverine

October, which is jammed with networking conferences hosted by the Association for Corporate Growth (ACG) and others, is typically a highly productive month for the middle market. In 2014, the tenth month of the year generated 258 closed deals, more than any other month. But while the volume of completed deals in October 2015 was essentially flat when compared with September, the harvest was paltry compared with the previous October. The month yielded just 154 completed mid-market deals -- 100 fewer deals than the same month in 2015. (See related chart).

The data continues the downward trend we’ve seen for several months. After a strong first quarter, deal flow has been dropping all year. In 2015, January -- which delivered 237 deals -- is still the month to beat. Mid-market M&A in the second quarter was lower than the first, and the third quarter was lower still. The gap in year-to-date totals between the two years is growing. Comparing the first 10 months of both years, 2015 produced 1,856 completed transactions; whereas 2014 produced 2,026 (difference of 170 deals).

One ray of hope came from Mergers & Acquisitions’ monthly survey, in which dealmakers reported a huge jump in leads for new deals. And, at Mergers & Acquisitions’ inaugural MM360 conference in early November, the mood was upbeat, with many dealmakers saying there are still lots of transaction opportunities, especially in the lower middle market.

Among the notable deals to close in October: German health care plastics products maker Gerresheimer AG (FRA: GXI) acquired U.S. rival Centor US Holding Inc. from Montagu Private Equity in a $725 million cash deal; Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) purchased Elmer’s Products Inc., best known for Elmer’s and Krazy Glue brands, from Berwind Corp., for $600 million in cash, as part of a broader effort to increase profits; and ITT Corp. (NYSE: ITT) bought automotive brakes manufacturer Wolverine Automotive Holdings Inc. for $300 million in cash, as car parts makers continue to attract buyers. Below are more mid-market deals completed in October.

Editor’s Note: To measure activity in the middle market, Mergers & Acquisitions looks at transactions that fulfill several requirements: Deals must have a value of roughly $1 billion or less; they must be completed (not just announced) within the timeframe designated; and they must include at least one U.S. company in the role of buyer and/or seller. Excluded from our charts are: recapitalizations; self-tenders; exchange offers; repurchases; stake purchases; and transactions with undisclosed values, buyers or sellers. Our data provider is Thomson Reuters, which updates its databases continuously.
