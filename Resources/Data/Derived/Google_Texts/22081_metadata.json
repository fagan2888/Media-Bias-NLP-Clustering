Greg Abbott (R-TX) in New York City's John F. Kennedy Airport Tuesday night after throwing verbal threats the conservative leader's way, according to Dallas News. The booted passenger was apparently not a fan of Abbott's views on marriage. Instead of engaging in an intellectual and fair debate about the issue after shaking Abbott's hand, the passenger had these lovely words for the governor of Texas, who, it's worth mentioning, uses a wheelchair:\n\n\u201cI hope you [expletive] go to hell because of your stance on gay marriage,\u201d the man told the governor, using an epithet for emphasis, according to Abbott communications director Matt Hirsch, who was with the governor. The man, identified only as a 32-year-old male by Port Authority police, was asked to step back by Texas state troopers traveling with the governor. As he walked away, Hirsch said the man, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, directed a parting shot at the governor: \u201cI\u2019m going to see you on the plane.\u201d\n\nCoexist, right?\n\nAbbott was a vocal opponent of the Supreme Court's pro-gay marriage ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges earlier this month. In addition to lambasting the justices' \"partisan\" decision, he insisted that religious liberty must be defended in its wake:\n\nThe government must never pressure a person to abandon or violate his or her sincerely held religious beliefs regarding a topic such as marriage. That sort of religious coercion will never be a \u2018compelling governmental interest,\u2019 and it will never be \u2018the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.\u2019\u201d\n\nSuch a statement was unacceptable to the belligerent JFK passenger. He was more interested in ending the discussion.\n\nSince no \"direct threats\" were made, according to Port Authority officers, the passenger was not arrested, but he also wasn't allowed anywhere near the governor. Authorities placed him on a different flight back to Austin.\n\nTraveling with Abbott at the time of the incident were his wife, Cecilia, and 18-year-old daughter, Audrey.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Coexist..05/26/2016 3:44:37AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Coexist.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Airline Passenger Tells Texas Gov to 'Go to Hell' for Opposing Gay Marriage", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/07/16/airline-passenger-tells-texas-gov-to-go-to-hell-for-opposing-gay-marriage-n2026302", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/342/2014-12-08T204325Z_1_LYNXMPEAB713F_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Coexist.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Airline Passenger Tells Texas Gov to 'Go to Hell' for Opposing Gay Marriage", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/07/16/airline-passenger-tells-texas-gov-to-go-to-hell-for-opposing-gay-marriage-n2026302", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/342/2014-12-08T204325Z_1_LYNXMPEAB713F_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Airline Passenger Tells Texas Gov to 'Go to Hell' for Opposing Gay Marriage, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb573\"", "article_summary": "The booted passenger was apparently not a fan of Abbott's views on marriage.\nAbbott was a vocal opponent of the Supreme Court's pro-gay marriage ruling in Obergefell v.
