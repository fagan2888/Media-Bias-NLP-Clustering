Muscogee Nation Business Enterprise announced it has purchased the rights to expand Rex's Chicken within the major eight counties of the Creek Nation tribal jurisdiction.

According to a news release, the Tulsa-based restaurant chain's design will be added to the tribe's existing and future travel plazas.

"Our plans are to create [sic] Rex's Chicken initially into our travel plazas," said Muscogee Nation Business Enterprise CEO Woody Anderson. "Right now we're doing some strategic planning and designing for new upgrades or new travel plazas and hopefully designing travel plazas for the future and we want to be able to add the Rex's Chicken to our operations there."

The chain was found in 1951. In 2007, David Rutkauskas obtained the rights to the brand. He says this agreement is good news for the future of Rex's Chicken.

"You know, we started Rex's in 2008 when the economy was tanking because of the Lehman Brothers collapse and people were less likely to take on any risks in business," said Rutkauskas. "Now, 5 years later, we're so excited to be experiencing this incredible breakthrough and the opportunity to partner with the skilled leadership of the Muscogee Creek Nation. It's a huge pleasure to work with them and grow Rex's into something we always knew it could be. This is what I love about being an entrepreneur, creating success from nothing."

Rutkauskas and his wife, Camille, founded the multi-national chain Camille's Sidewalk Cafe in 1996.
