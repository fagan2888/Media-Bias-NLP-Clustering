A group of nuns held a sale before they embark on the next phase of their journey. The Carmelite Sisters of the Villa Teresa Convent hosted the moving sale today and it continues through Monday at the convent they've called home since 1928.

The historical property is more than 44,000 square feet and includes three historic homes over three acres. They have been putting the sale together for eight weeks and all the money they make is going toward the new convent.

“So we're calling it a moving sale. It's better than a garage sale but not quite an estate sale,” said Carmelite Sister Patricia Ann Miller.

They are moving to a new location by the Pastoral Center at the St. Ann's retirement center.
