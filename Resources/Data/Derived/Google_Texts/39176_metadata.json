Now, the Los Angeles Times has reported on an audit of the huge nonprofit California health insurer that was used in part as the basis for denying tax-exempt status. Blue Shield is contesting the decision; having to pay state taxes back to 2009 could cost the company more than $100 million.\n\nIn a June 2014 letter to the company, tax board officials wrote that \u201cBlue Shield is not operating exclusively for the promotion of civic betterment or social welfare,\u201d according to the Times. And part of the reason was Blue Shield\u2019s massive cash reserves, which had swollen to more than $4 billion by last year. Consumer advocates have criticized the company, saying it should use those amassed profits to provide more free or reduced-cost health care to needy Californians. The company says it already caps profits and provides abundant charity to Californians, and that some of the accumulated cash is earmarked for a major acquisition to expand its business into the Medicaid area.\n\nMichael Sparer, chair of health policy and management at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, explains the characterizes nonprofit health insurers: \u201cThey\u2019re mission-driven, they\u2019re going to be reinvesting any surplus they have. They\u2019re not going to be sharing surpluses with shareholders or looking to make a large profit.\u201d\n\nBack in the Depression, when these statewide nonprofit health insurance plans were starting up, they achieved their social welfare mission in part by the practice of \"community rating,\" that is, setting the same health insurance premiums for everyone in a given geographical area, regardless of health status or other demographic characteristics, like age or gender.\n\nBut Tom Baker, of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, says being nonprofit didn\u2019t mean being a charity and operating solely for the benefit of insured policyholders.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve never been that kind of warm and friendly, small mutual-type health insurance,\u201d Baker says. \u201cThey were set up as nonprofits as a way of justifying their monopoly power, making doctors more comfortable with the idea that they might be deciding whether to pay for things or not.\u201d\n\nIn the current health insurance environment, nonprofits, for-profits and mutual insurers (owned by the policyholders) face financial volatility, public policy uncertainty and rapid change in business conditions. A wave of corporate consolidation is afoot, says Steve Zaharuk, senior vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, as insurers try to increase profits while reducing administrative and provider costs. He says nonprofits like Blue Shield of California may have to merge and acquire as well to increase and broaden their footprint, compete for more contracts with doctors and hospitals, and streamline operations.\n\n\u201cIt could become more difficult for the local Blue Cross Blue Shield plans and the local regional companies to compete with these national companies,\u201d Zaharuk says .\n\nJill Horwitz at UCLA School of Law says nonprofits like Blue Shield of California seem to be hoarding cash for business reasons that don\u2019t necessarily violate their nonprofit mission.\n\n\u201cI would have been more concerned if we saw a lot of spending on atriums and big bonuses and offices and things like that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut what we\u2019re seeing is cash in the bank being held, and that doesn\u2019t strike me, on its face, as such a bad thing.\u201d\n\nThose cash surpluses might be used to buy other health care companies, keep premiums on an even keel and have reserves for a rainy day.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Blue Shield of California lost its nonprofit status.
