More\n\nThe ideological divide between Democrats and Republicans runs deep. The split is reflected in Congress and in the race for the White House.\n\nPartisan rancor is nothing new, but a Pew Research poll finds the political gulf has been widening over the last 20 years. Republicans have become more conservative and Democrats more liberal. The center is shrinking.\n\n\n\nCan the next president be a unifying force?\n\n\n\n\"The notion that you can unite the country as a promise is more of an illusion than it is a reality,\" said Josh Karushaar of the National Journal\n\n\n\n\"Sure, there have been major bipartisan achievements in decades past but it's not always the case that the country makes progress simply when the parties and people of good will come together,\" answered Matthew Dallek, of George Washington University.\n\n\n\nSometimes big things can get done with one party in charge, though the other side doesn't like it. Examples include the Bush tax cuts, Wall Street reform, and Obamacare.\n\n\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center set up a 29-member commission to study polarization in America. It recommended that the president hold regular monthly meetings with congressional leaders.\n\n\n\nGallup, which tracks presidential approval ratings, has found increasingly partisan views of presidents and says while Presidents Obama and George W. Bush were both elected with hopes of unifying the country, the opposite has happened.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 18:08:05 EST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "og": {"site_name": "WCVB", "description": "The ideological divide between Democrats and Republicans runs deep.", "title": "Commitment 2016: Unify or divide?", "url": "http://www.wcvb.com/politics/commitment-2016-unify-or-divide/37879102", "image": "http://www.wcvb.com/image/view/-/38132580/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/5vmjku/-/img-Commitment-2016-Unify-or-divide.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wcvb.com/politics/commitment-2016-unify-or-divide/37879102", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wcvb://content/article/37879102", "iphone": "wcvb://content/article/37879102", "googleplay": "wcvb://content/article/37879102"}, "name": {"ipad": "wcvb", "iphone": "wcvb", "googleplay": "wcvb"}, "id": {"ipad": 501410335, "iphone": 501410335, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wcvb"}}, "site": "@WCVB", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wcvb://content/article/37879102", "app_name": "wcvb", "package": "com.hearst.android.wcvb"}, "ios": {"url": "wcvb://content/article/37879102", "app_store_id": 501410335, "app_name": "wcvb"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 100462519708}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wcvb.com/politics/commitment-2016-unify-or-divide/37879102"}, "keywords": "boston politics, boston political news, massachusetts politics, political news massachusetts, national political news", "google-site-verification": "TFEz5Ide9BhGKJn-YtiY6o2KM3eY4m52Oqv0sRYfD54", "news_keywords": "boston politics, boston political news, massachusetts politics, political news massachusetts, national political news", "description": "The ideological divide between Democrats and Republicans runs deep."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0685\"", "article_summary": "Commitment 2016: Where the candidates stand on the issues As part of our Commitment 2016 coverage, we are taking a closer look at where the candidates for president stand on the issues facing the United States.\nMoreThe ideological divide between Democrats and Republicans runs deep.\nCan the next president be a unifying force for the nation?\nPartisan rancor is nothing new, but a Pew Research poll finds the political gulf has been widening over the last 20 years.\nSometimes big things can get done with one party in charge, though the other side doesn't like it."}
