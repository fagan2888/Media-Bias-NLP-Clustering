Hill City, SD

Heavy storms have caused flash flooding conditions in Hill City, SD Saturday and Pennington County officials are urging people to be safe.

Palmer Gulch Road in Hill City is no longer passable and has been closed. There is also water on Highway 16 near the city's Volunteer Fire Department that is making travel difficult. While the storm has passed, running water can continue to make traveling difficult as it heads downstream. Officials are diverting traffic in and out of Hill City.

Officials remind drivers to never pass through water if you aren't sure how deep it is. Also, be careful traveling at night and walking through water on foot.

Be cautious when recreating near creeks and keep away from slippery bank edges.
