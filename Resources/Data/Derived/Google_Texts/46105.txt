Candidates used every last minute to try and win the support of voters Tuesday. Republican Ted Cruz held three events across northern Nevada.

"At this point, the election is 100-percent about turnout,” said Cruz at his Minden rally. "I am telling you right now, the men and women standing on this lawn can control the outcome of the Nevada caucuses."

Nevada is important for Republicans because it's the last stop ahead of Super Tuesday, March 1. Whoever wins Nevada will have momentum going into primaries and caucuses next week in more than a dozen states.

"I ask each of you not just to come out and caucus tonight, but to spend the next few hours picking up the phone and calling others, calling your friends, calling your families, calling your neighbors, calling your loved ones, and saying please come out with me," said Cruz.

Cruz mainly tried to get out the vote, but he also touched on why he wants to be president. He says he'll repeal Obama’s executive action, expand religious liberties, get rid of Obamacare and repeal the Iranian nuclear deal.

"We are standing at the edge of cliff staring down and if we keep going the same direction, we risk doing irreparable damage to the greatest country in the history of the world," said Cruz in regards to the importance of the election. "Every generation of Americans has given the next generation a brighter future, more opportunity, greater prosperity, and we are not about to become the first generation to do anything less for our kids and grandkids."
