The partnership lets Inovalon, which analyzes large volumes of data to automatically suggest tests or care options to healthcare providers, mine Allscript\u2019s millions of patient records in addition to existing databases.\n\nInovalon\u2019s algorithm pulls from various data sources including pharmaceutical companies, labs, and demographic statistics, chief executive Keith Dunleavy said. Its clients \u2014 primarily health plan providers, physicians and researchers \u2014 use the analysis to assess the effectiveness of health plans or identify where additional treatment is required. Inovalon currently supports 220,000 clinical facilities, and 550,000 health care providers covering 140 million Americans, Dunleavy said. Without an automated process, providers must manually recall information about the tests their patients may require as well as the documentation process, he explained.\n\nAllscripts \u201chas access to the data. Once we get the data, it becomes part of the Inovalon analytics engine, sponsored by payers. They can then crunch the data for payers, to see how care is being provided,\u201d Faisal Mushtaq, Allscripts\u2019 general manager for payer and life science business, said. He added that Allscripts will continue pursuing partnerships with other analytics firms.\n\nMushtaq said he thinks the Affordable Care Act \u2014 whose coverage is expected to begin in 2014 \u2014 could make healthcare analytics more valuable. \u201cThe government is looking to reduce the cost of care, but at the same time measure clinical outcomes. [Data] will influence some of the decision making process. If the Affordable Care Act had not come, the investment around these kinds of initiative would have been slower.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "onit, inovalon, health records, EHR, Allscripts", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The health records company\u2019s new partnership could signal a greater role for big data analysis in healthcare.", "title": "Health records company Allscripts partners with data analytics firm", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-it/health-records-company-allscripts-partners-with-data-analytics-firm/2013/09/17/34e7b2e4-1fb6-11e3-b7d1-7153ad47b549_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ravindranize"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-it/health-records-company-allscripts-partners-with-data-analytics-firm/2013/09/17/34e7b2e4-1fb6-11e3-b7d1-7153ad47b549_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "onit, inovalon, health records, EHR, Allscripts", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "34e7b2e4-1fb6-11e3-b7d1-7153ad47b549", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "The health records company\u2019s new partnership could signal a greater role for big data analysis in healthcare."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdea8\"", "article_summary": "Electronic health records provider Allscripts recently reached a multi-year agreement with Inovalon, a Bowie, Md.-based health data analytics firm.\nInovalon currently supports 220,000 clinical facilities, and 550,000 health care providers covering 140 million Americans, Dunleavy said.\nOnce we get the data, it becomes part of the Inovalon analytics engine, sponsored by payers.\nThe partnership lets Inovalon, which analyzes large volumes of data to automatically suggest tests or care options to healthcare providers, mine Allscript\u2019s millions of patient records in addition to existing databases.\nIts clients \u2014 primarily health plan providers, physicians and researchers \u2014 use the analysis to assess the effectiveness of health plans or identify where additional treatment is required."}
