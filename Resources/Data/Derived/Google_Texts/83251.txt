Firefighters on Sunday continued to attack a blaze that broke out Saturday on a firing range at Fort Carson.

The 1,200-acre fire was expected to be 65 percent contained by 6 p.m. Sunday, said Dani Johnson, post spokeswoman.

Chinook helicopters continued to drop water throughout the day, Johnson said, and firefighters from Fort Carson and other agencies are building fire breaks.

Bulldozers were used to cut a fire line to contain the blaze.

The blaze is contained on the post, no structures are involved and there is no threat to the surrounding community, Johnson said.

The fire started Saturday as Marines trained on the weapons range at the post, the Gazette reported. Fires on ranges are relatively common because gunfire sets of tinder-dry brush.
