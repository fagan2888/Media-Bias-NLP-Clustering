And a fair number of parents winced at some of the price tags.\n\nFAO Schwarz on Fifth Avenue, probably the best-known toy store in the world, is closing Wednesday night.\n\nOwner Toys R Us announced the decision in May, citing the high and rising costs of running the 45,000-square-foot retail space on the pricey avenue. Though the flagship store is closing its doors for good, it may reopen elsewhere in midtown Manhattan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of an era, it sucks. It\u2019s a great store so it should probably remain in its original home,\u201d said Flo Marinez, who, as a teenager, once had a sleepover inside the store.\n\nFAO Schwarz says it is the oldest toy store in the U.S., with a New York City location since 1870. Reported celeb sightings - Kim Kardashian and Kanye West before they were parents; Moms Angelina Jolie, Britney Spears and Victoria Beckham - have helped fuel the fantasy since the flagship store opened in 1986. Nick Jonas stopped by and hopped around The Big Piano in December while singing \u201cJealous.\u201d\n\nBut generations of ordinary families have also reveled in three levels of toys and candy.\n\nScott Wolfson from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, remembers coming to FAO Schwarz as a kid and today brought his own son to see the iconic store.\n\n\u201cTo see it through his eyes, from his perspective, it brought a whole new meaning to me,\u201d Wolfson said.\n\nThe Manhattan landmark included a candy store, personal shoppers and three levels of specialty toy departments.\n\n\u201cThe baby department at FAO Schwarz is the ultimate destination when luxury shopping for little ones,\u201d the store\u2019s online fact sheet advised.\n\nWhen those babies reached \u201ctweenhood,\u201d they\u2019d need specialty skin care products: \u201cIt\u2019s never too early to start protecting one\u2019s natural beauty!\u201d\n\nToys R Us of Wayne, New Jersey, has been privately held since 2005.
