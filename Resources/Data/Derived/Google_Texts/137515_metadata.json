Oss | March 9, 2015\n\nDecision support is like exercise. Everyone knows they should do more of it, but no one does. Despite calls like the one from JASON, the independent group of scientists that advises the U.S. government on science and technology that called for the U.S. to develop an \u201cagile, national-scale learning health system for sharing effective practices of care,\u201d (see Data For Individual Health and A Robust Health Data Infrastructure), the use of decision support tools is spotty at best (see Taking Decision Support From Concept To Practice and Clinical Decision Support: More Than Just \u2018Alerts\u2019 Tipsheet).\n\nI do think the use of tools to aid clinical decision making will grow \u2013 largely with the growth of value-based contracting. Executives of provider organizations will soon realize that a \u201cless than optimal\u201d decision about consumer care wastes precious resources \u2013 and will decrease the financial viability under these new arrangements. Simply put, these are the future tools for financial success \u2013 success in the face of increased value-based competition, and success at improving the performance necessary to reduce costs (see Survival Of The Smartest: Organizational Information Literacy As The Challenge & Opportunity and Performance Measures & Metrics-Based Management).\n\nWhile we wait for the science-to-service gap to shorten around decision support models, there are some great tools emerging in the market, and with substantiated proof of concept. One example \u2013 computer-aided assessment of consumers with behavioral health and substance abuse related conditions \u2013 was presented this year at the 2015 OPEN MINDS Performance Management Institute, How An Online, Consumer Administered Tool Can Improve Assessment, Recovery & Outcomes While Reducing Costs, by Al Villapiano, Vice President, Clinical Development of Inflexxion and Philip O. Toal, Ed.D., LMHC, CET, Sr. Vice President, Residential Services, Aspire Health Partners. The tools presented were the tech-enabled ASI-MV (Addiction Severity Index-Multimedia Version) and the BHI-MV (Behavioral Health Index \u2013 Multimedia Version). The ASI-MV is an automated, web-based version of the traditional paper-based Addiction Severity Index (ASI) \u2013 an assessment designed to address potential problem areas in substance-abusing patients: medical status, employment and support, drug use, alcohol use, legal status, family/social status, and psychiatric status. The BHI-MV is an interactive, online behavioral health assessment based on the ASI-MV, and designed to help behavioral health provider organizations improve clinical assessment effectiveness and consumer monitoring; and enhance treatment planning and clinical decision-making.\n\nThe advantages? The system provides users with access to research-based standardized assessment, which reduce staff time and provide cumulative data \u2013 leading to what Dr. Villapiano explained as, more reliable data, more candid consumers, more in-depth information, better data sets, and cost savings through staff efficiencies. The benefits of decision support in general, and ASI-MV/BHI-MV in particular, is the ability to assess addiction and mental health problems in a standardized way, allowing automated collection of data that is useful to the consumer in treatment, the clinical professional in planning treatment, and the administrative team in managing the assessment and treatment process. Another benefit is in the relationship with payers and auditors \u2013 who accept the use of a standardized process for diagnoses and treatment planning.\n\nMr. Toal provided some field-level experience with using a tech-enabled assessment tool. He discussed overcoming his initial skepticism of \u201cwhy have an online tool to gather this information when I already pay people to gain this information?\u201d And he added that part of the benefit that has been useful to the Aspire team is having data on their consumer population for both planning and advocacy \u2013 data that allows them to compare to national averages and track trends from year to year.\n\nThe ability to use technology for decision support is an integral piece of the information literacy needed for success in an increasingly performance-focused market.
