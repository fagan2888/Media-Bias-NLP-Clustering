With that signature, Brian Sandoval passed part of an education package derived from an enormous tax increase well north of a billion dollars, the largest tax hike in the 151-year history of Nevada.\n\nSince then, Sandoval has found himself somewhat lonely on the Republican stage\u2014which is ironic, perhaps, for a handsome, hugely popular Latino star in a party eager to showcase its Hispanic credentials, a man who has been leading a state that has been thoroughly combed for months by Republican presidential candidates ahead of the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday. Only a week ago in South Carolina, the endorsement of another high-wattage GOP star, Nikki Haley, was huge news and may well have turned the tide of the race\u2014or at least driven Jeb Bush out when Haley crushed his hopes by endorsing his rival Marco Rubio.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut the courting of Sandoval, if you can call it that, has been a far more subtle affair for the GOP presidential candidates. He is in the unenviable position of being seen as an ideological apostate who simultaneously boasts approval ratings in the high-to-mid 60s. When the general election comes, Sandoval\u2019s endorsement will be desperately needed; Democrats privately fear he could be a potent weapon to drive Latino and Hispanic turnout. But in an unpredictable and highly partisan GOP caucus, with many conservative Republicans alleging betrayal by Sandoval over his historic tax hike and threatening revolt, the endorsement of the Nevada governor is seen as more of a headache than a helpmate. And no one is quite sure what to do about him.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s way more opposition to the governor within the Republican legislative caucus than the Democratic one,\u201d says David Damore, a professor of political science at UNLV. \u201cHe\u2019s by far the most popular political figure in the state \u2026 yet it\u2019s this unspoken part of the caucuses on the Republican side\u201d that the presidential candidates need to keep their distance. Unspoken seems about right: In dozens of events in the 72-hour period leading up to the caucuses, hardly any candidate has mentioned Sandoval, a feat that would be difficult to imagine in South Carolina or Iowa, both primary states with (far less popular) Republican governors.\n\nSandoval\u2019s problems aren\u2019t exactly unique: John Kasich, a friend of the governor\u2019s, likes to tout his centrist agenda in Ohio. But even compared to Kasich, Sandoval\u2019s record wouldn't be easy to embrace if you're running for president. The tax increases Sandoval signed have since funded a landmark overhaul in public education\u2014likely to become his signature achievement and a bold gamble meant to turn around what is frequently ranked the worst state education system in the country. Yet education is simply the most recent of a long list of Sandoval\u2019s conservative heresies: The abortion rights governor has embraced Obamacare; lauded immigration reform and DREAMers; fiercely championed renewable energy; and taken lesser known actions on police body cameras, driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented aliens and multiple moves to squelch Republican-led tort reform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been this dramatic betrayal,\u201d says the staunchly anti-tax Republican Assemblyman Ira Hansen, a Ted Cruz supporter who has become a public face of conservative opposition to Sandoval. \u201cSandoval went totally moderate liberal on us. If there was a referendum tomorrow, you\u2019d find a dramatically different result among the Republican party base.\u201d\n\nLess than a year ago, Sandoval\u2019s endorsement was seen as one of the biggest gets in Republican politics, second only perhaps to Haley\u2019s. (Most still say it is\u2014at least in the general election.) And during that time, according to those in the governor\u2019s brain trust, nearly every candidate flew to Nevada to kiss Sandoval\u2019s ring (including Marco Rubio, who topped off his pitch by borrowing a pair of Sandoval\u2019s boots). The legislative session and the ensuing tax increases didn\u2019t change that dynamic\u2014it was the slow-marching dirge of the primary process, which has picked off most of the original governors whom Sandoval might have favored for president (his only statement regarding an endorsement has been to say that he prefers a candidate with \u201cexecutive experience\u201d). With Donald Trump and Cruz together registering at over 60 percent in a recent poll, Sandoval\u2019s broad minded record suddenly doesn't align well with the fire-and-brimstone message of the party\u2019s presidential front-runners.\n\nOperatives across Nevada suggest that the presidential campaigns have calibrated their approach to Sandoval accordingly. For candidates Rubio and Kasich, the Sandoval agenda has become a nontopic; they have kept the focus relentlessly on national security and the economy\u2014even while Mike Slanker, the political mind behind Sandoval\u2019s crushing 2014 reelection victory, now serves as Rubio\u2019s chief strategist in Nevada. For Trump and Cruz, however, the strategy toward Nevada amounts to a wink-and-nod message. They have kept their public statements about Sandoval polite while pushing relentlessly to drive out rural voters bent on punishing Republican turncoats like the governor. (On Monday in Reno, Cruz went a step further, publicly calling out Sandoval's tax increase package.)\n\nThe battle for Nevada is thus more evidence that the Republican Party is suffering an ongoing identity crisis\u2014one that Trump is successfully exploiting. It wasn\u2019t long ago that the party establishment publicly invested in the idea of Sandoval as a new kind of Republican\u2014and let it be known that his name was supposedly on a variety of vice presidential short lists. Yet Sandoval, like Kasich in some ways, is living proof that today\u2019s Republicanism looks very different depending on whether you are running for president or governing on the state level. For a party that makes frequent talk of allowing states to solve problems the government can\u2019t, the inability of GOP voters to embrace their own successful governors\u2014or former governors, Jeb Bush among them\u2014may be another indication of how divided the party is.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to say how slightly Sandoval\u2019s agenda might tip the scales. \u201cThe rural parts of the state don\u2019t have a lot of voters, but it\u2019s disproportionately Republican,\u201d says Eric Herzik, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Reno. \u201cSo in the caucus, they have a disproportionate voice, and it\u2019s very conservative. Someone with a good ground organization could do well there.\u201d Adds one Nevada presidential campaign director: \u201cThese caucuses are going to turn out an interesting group of conservatives, and most of these people are high-information voters, especially on taxes. It could be a referendum, for sure.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s campaign could prove the best test case. Sources within the Cruz campaign suggest that, without mentioning Sandoval specifically (until recently), the campaign has been mobilizing conservatives who have soured on the governor as a key part of their rural turnout strategy. The campaign has already utilized a corps of legislators and public officials targeting disaffected Republicans; leading the charge is Attorney General Adam Laxalt\u2014Sandoval\u2019s tea party foil\u2014whom operatives say remains enormously popular in rural counties. But even a cursory glance of Cruz\u2019s endorsements, nearly all of whom opposed Sandoval\u2019s agenda last session, leaves little to mystery.\n\n\u201cThat sense of betrayal is very strong in the Republican primary, among the average primary voter,\u201d adds Hansen, the Cruz supporter, who described the Cruz campaign\u2019s strategy. \u201cThat\u2019s what Trump and Cruz have tapped into nationally. I think it\u2019s stronger in Nevada because of this recent situation.\u201d Unsurprisingly, the Cruz campaign\u2019s core volunteers are \u201ctea party people,\u201d said one Cruz campaign staffer.\n\nNo one appears interested in tarnishing a relationship they will badly need in the general election. Asked whether Cruz would be receptive to Sandoval\u2019s endorsement, Robert Uithoven, Cruz\u2019s state director in Nevada, extended an olive branch. \u201cThis campaign would welcome the endorsement of any Republican who plans on caucusing and driving people out to support us,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t envision anybody declining the governor\u2019s endorsement. We wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPrivately, however, the campaign is more blunt. \u201cBrian Sandoval is a total piece of toxic waste. His endorsement would literally be wasted,\u201d said one Cruz adviser closely familiar with the campaign\u2019s strategy in Nevada. \u201cSandoval would be the kiss of death for any conservative.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s odd is that even among governors, usually you just embrace your fellow Republicans\u2014Reagan\u2019s 11th commandment,\u201d says John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who follows state policy and has been tracking the developments in the Sandoval administration. \u201cBut Sandoval is seen privately as toxic because of the tax increases. It says a lot more about the dysfunction of the Republican Party than it does about Brian Sandoval.\u201d\n\nThe Trump era has delivered the Sandoval paradox: The country\u2019s most successful Republican governor is one that a Republican presidential candidate can\u2019t afford to touch\u2014or at least not quite yet. \u201cIf somebody really wanted Sandoval\u2019s endorsement, I think they could probably get it,\u201d said one campaign director. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure those guys want it anymore.\u201d\n\n***\n\n\n\nSandoval knows what it\u2019s like to cater to the right-wing base in an election. He did it once himself. In 2010, Sandoval ran to the right of sitting Republican Gov. Jim Gibbons, trouncing him in the Republican primary by more than 28 points. Even then, Sandoval displayed early signs of independence from the state\u2019s dysfunctional party structure: The night of his victory, Sandoval held his victory party at one hotel while the Republican Party\u2019s victory bash was at another.\n\nBut Sandoval\u2019s first experience with taxes was to curtail them, or at least try, during his inaugural legislative session in 2011. A court ruling struck down (or complicated) his proposed budget. To his credit, Herzik adds, \u201cSandoval pivoted immediately.\u201d And having learned quickly the hard lessons of governance, Herzk says, Sandoval was never quite the same: In 2013, when the same taxes came up for renewal, he persuaded key anti-tax legislators to get on board with an extension.\n\nWhy did he reverse course? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to sit in my chair,\u201d Sandoval said, when I caught him after a meeting at the National Governors Association. I had asked which had moved first: Sandoval to the left, or national Republicans to the right. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to walk in my shoes,\u201d he continued. \u201cGoverning is very different. And being a chief executive who\u2019s accountable for every single decision is very different than being a candidate.\u201d Seated in a crisp, navy suit, he stretched in his chair to reveal charcoal leather boots with silver fringes (no spurs); Sandoval enjoys that most political of traits, a tendency to look even more handsome in person. With grayed temples and a broad, ceremonious jaw, he\u2019s often compared to a Hispanic Mitt Romney.\n\nSandoval spent part of the 2000s as a federal judge, a lifetime appointment he discarded to run for governor. Those close to him say that he still acts like he wears the robe\u2014loyalists, of whom Sandoval has many, consistently describe him as disciplined, dedicated, devoted. By all accounts, he loves his job, famously turning down a lucrative offer to challenge (and likely beat) Harry Reid for the U.S. Senate. \u201cDifferent governors have different motivations,\u201d Sandoval said, sitting up. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a national profile. I\u2019m focused on my job.\u201d\n\nBy most assessments, his job is one in which he\u2019s doing well. Sandoval\u2019s education overhaul is part of a broader agenda, that of economic diversification, in an attempt to free the state from matrimony to a single gaming economy. To that end, the state has made symbolic strides\u2014attracting the car company Tesla\u2014along with technical ones: Sixty months of consecutive job growth, 140 thousand returned jobs and an unemployment rate around 6 percent (compared to 14 percent, the worst in the country, when he won office).\n\nShortly after taking office, the governor\u2019s Office of Economic Development invited a team from the nonpartisan Brookings Institution to issue an advisory agenda for economic diversification. \u201cThey are piling on to the technology-based economy,\u201d said Mark Muro, a senior fellow and policy director who authored the ensuing report and gives the governor relatively high marks. \u201cWhat we believe is a nonideological center, a centrist economic development agenda. There are Republican governors and Democratic governors who are following the kind of pathway that Sandoval is leading.\u201d\n\nSandoval said he is preparing for his state\u2019s June primaries for which he plans to defend a phalanx of Republicans who support his tax increases as emphatically as he does. He didn\u2019t miss the opportunity to work on his spiel. \u201cWe had the worst K-through-12 system in the country,\u201d he said, leaning in. \u201cWe\u2019re still climbing out of the recession\u2014we have kids that are in poverty that need our help.\u201d He paused. \u201cIf you\u2019re pleasing everyone, you\u2019re lying to someone. And I am not going to apologize for believing in the kids of Nevada.\u201d Those education reforms, he chided, were part of a conservative mission to introduce school choice. \u201cIt\u2019s not conservative to have bad schools, to have overcrowded classrooms, or to be susceptible to another recession.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a compelling case, depending on the audience. But it can\u2019t free Sandoval from the paradox that could now limit his national appeal. The first is that the Republican Party has been hamstrung by its commitment to the idea of Sandoval as the future of the party. It might be more apt to say that he represents a part of its past: \u201cSandoval is an anomaly in 2016, because he\u2019s functioning in Nevada like a center-right Republican governor 15 or 20 years ago,\u201d notes Muro. \u201cThat means a heavy focus on economic development and education. So he really is an unusual persona.\u201d Approaching Year Two in the age of Trump, it\u2019s not clear whether Sandoval has stock that is rising or falling inside the party.\n\nBut the prevailing irony, maybe, runs deeper. Sandoval left a lifetime appointment on the bench, presumably swept up in dreams of turning around the state and receiving a hero\u2019s welcome. The problem appears to be that he succeeded, resurrecting good Republican governance on the state level. The Republican primary has killed off almost all of its GOP governors, with the last one standing, John Kasich, perhaps likely soon to fall. Like the others, Sandoval must be wondering if he can turn his state around, or he can run for president. But he can\u2019t do both. \"I don't agree,\" he said when presented with the notion, for the first time slightly annoyed. \"It's a big, fat hypothetical.\"\n\nThe strange stunting of Sandoval in his own state\u2019s primary, like the collapse of his peer governors\u2019 campaigns, might be part of the same nihilist undercurrent now infecting the GOP presidential stakes. Presidential candidates have leavened records otherwise bereft of substance since the invention of campaigns. But only in 2016 is accomplishing nothing no longer viewed as utility, but a commodity\u2014and a precious one. Trump\u2019s principle achievement in government is having had nothing to do with it; Rubio\u2019s accomplishment seems to be leading an effort to fix immigration, abandoning it, and then denying it. And for caucus-goers in Nevada, the shuttering of the federal government, a fight led by Cruz himself, isn\u2019t merely a negotiating ploy to get something in return for what they want. That is the thing that they want. Governors\u2014especially the ones who think like judges\u2014need not apply.\n\nPerhaps that is why one of the most popular Republican governors in the country can\u2019t run on his record as a candidate for president, let alone endorse one. And maybe why the Republican slate\u2019s chief executives\u2014Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, Scott Walker, and soon enough, Kasich\u2014continue to fall away. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t have strong records. As Sandoval must be wondering, while he watches his friends fall one by one, perhaps in 2016, they can\u2019t afford to have a record at all.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "He may be the most popular Republican in the country.
