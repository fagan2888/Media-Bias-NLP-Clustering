Riverside Expands Learning Seat With Add-On Acquisition

The private equity firm has made e-learning a sweet spot, counting Mintra Training Portal and Training Factor among its portfolio companies

The Riverside Co. has purchased another e-learning course developer as electronic training continues to spark M&A opportunities.

C-Learning Pty Ltd. has been added to Riverside's platform company Learning Seat. The investment is expected to bring new technical capabilities and content development expertise, as well as new customers to Learning Seat.

Learning Seat provides online courses, training tools and other resources geared toward compliance, professional development and accredited training.

C-Learning, a Melbourne, Australia-based developer of online courses, specializes in teaching content development. The deal follows Riverside's previous e-learning investment, Chilton Consulting Group, which it added to Alchemy Systems. Before that, it bought Mintra Trainingportal AS, headquartered in Oslo, Norway. Mintra is a learning-management system that specializes in training employees of oil and gas companies with both e-learning and classroom courses through a subsidiary in Aberdeen, Scotland.

Terms of each investment remain undisclosed. Riverside has completed more than 45 transactions in the education space. The Cleveland and New York-based firm is currently building up a real estate e-learning company called Grace Hill. Earlier in December, Riverside added the Training Factor, a real estate education company, to Grace Hill.
