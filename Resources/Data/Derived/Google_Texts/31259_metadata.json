These people are my family and this is our way,\u201d said Wadena, 58, in traditional Omaha Indian regalia Saturday at the Denver Art Museum\u2019s Friendship Powwow.\n\nWadena, who also wore deer hair, beaver and eagle plumes on his headdress, was one of a few hundred people from numerous tribes who danced, drummed and sang outside the museum to celebrate American Indian culture.\n\nLike many of the elders, Wadena grew up dancing in powwows and works to keep the tradition strong among younger generations. The water bird he beaded in royal blue on his dress represents the Omaha, including the reservation in Nebraska where Wadena grew up.\n\nKen Little, a 68-year-old Dakota Sioux, was there to drum. He grew up in Standing Rock, N.D., and was sent away each year to a Catholic boarding school in South Dakota, where the punishment for speaking his native language was whipping or getting his mouth washed out with soap.\n\nNow, he teaches Lakota at the Denver Center for International Studies.\n\nLittle sat with other men around a drum named \u201cBlack Tongue Dakota,\u201d keeping a steady beat for beaded and feathered dancers who circled the plaza with short, jaunty steps. With the drummers\u2019 crescendo, the dancing intensified.\n\nAt the end of a song, a woman\u2019s yodeling rang out. \u201cIt means I am honoring them. I\u2019m like an eagle,\u201d said Sue Kaulaity, a Denver resident in street clothes whose heritage is Kiowa and Lakota Sioux.\n\nEach tribe brings something unique to a powwow \u2014 the Blackfeet created the chicken dance, the Ojibwe the \u201cjingle dresses\u201d covered in cone-shaped bells traditionally made of Copenhagen cans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way for all of us to come together and share our traditions, like Christians from all denominations,\u201d said Paul Dearhouse, a drummer and an Ojibwe and Mohawk. \u201cThis is a great way to keep yourself grounded and to keep your kids involved in the culture.\u201d\n\nJennifer Brown: 303-954-1593, jenbrown@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jbrowndpost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Powwow keeps tradition alive for younger generations", "title": "Powwow keeps tradition alive for younger generations", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/06/powwow-keeps-tradition-alive-for-younger-generations/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140906__CD07_Powwow_BN_170p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140906__CD07_Powwow_BN_170p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-06T16:58:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:08:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2b7\"", "article_summary": "Like many of the elders, Wadena grew up dancing in powwows and works to keep the tradition strong among younger generations.\nThese people are my family and this is our way,\u201d said Wadena, 58, in traditional Omaha Indian regalia Saturday at the Denver Art Museum\u2019s Friendship Powwow.\nThe water bird he beaded in royal blue on his dress represents the Omaha, including the reservation in Nebraska where Wadena grew up.\nI\u2019m like an eagle,\u201d said Sue Kaulaity, a Denver resident in street clothes whose heritage is Kiowa and Lakota Sioux.\nNow, he teaches Lakota at the Denver Center for International Studies."}
