I was wearing a pink cowboy hat, temporarily inducted into the CODEPINK Posse, an effort organized by the local branch of the well-known national rabble rousers for peace. About 30 of us stood along the sidewalk outside the Ranch, watched by a half-dozen police officers looking bored, a chatty police detective and a pair of startled horses held by two men dressed as cowboys. Overhead, an airplane circled, towing a warning about corporate corruption.\n\nPowerful people in suits laughed at us and snapped smartphone photos as they disembarked from the chartered buses they rode to the Western-themed restaurant. It was July 31 and ALEC was in town for its 41st meeting. After the first of several days of corporate backroom deals at the Hilton Anatole, ALEC\u2019s members wanted to pretend they were cowboys while they ate.\n\nThe buses kept coming and out poured some of the world\u2019s most powerful: corporate executives, rich investors, state legislators and their families. Though they\u2019d normally disdain public transportation \u2014 when they aren\u2019t orchestrating cuts against it in the name of austerity \u2014 I imagined the atmosphere on the bus was jovial, as if the \u201c1%\u201d was on a field trip.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nCODEPINK are no strangers to using humor to fight evil. Duded up in pink Western-wear, with faux handcuffs and a \u201cRUN ALEC OUT OF TEXAS\u201d banner, they were aiming for laughter. As the suits\u2019 humor peaked, CODEPINK Dallas \u2014 mostly older women \u2014 began chanting, \u201cWE MAY BE FUNNY, BUT YOU ARE CORRUPT!\u201d\n\nSpeaking out is thirsty, thankless work in the Texas heat. After two hours, a Ranch worker dressed as a cowboy brought us all bottled water.\n\nALEC: Where the corporate sausage is made\n\nFor over 40 years, ALEC has had a corrupting influence on state politics. Its corporate sponsors and rich private investors write legislation, then their hand-picked, loyal legislators introduce those bills into law. The mainstream media rarely connects the dots, even when covering ALEC-related laws. And while many have heard of Stand Your Ground and its contribution to the death of Trayvon Martin and the acquittal of his killer, George Zimmerman, few are aware of ALEC\u2019s sponsorship of that law in multiple states.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, the Center for Media and Democracy unveiled ALECexposed.org, bringing ALEC widespread negative attention for the first time in its four-decade-long history. The site features over 800 model bills and dozens of corporate sponsors. The agenda revealed was startling in its breadth: to name just a few of its policies, ALEC seeks privatization of education and policing, aides the Koch brothers in undermining laws that support renewable energy, and attacks the rights of unions and the retired.\n\nOn July 30, Jim Hightower, a former Texas Commissioner of Agriculture and publisher of the popular newsletter The Hightower Lowdown, was on hand at the Community Brewery after a noon rally at the Hilton Anatole was attended by hundreds of activists, retirees and union members in honor of ALEC\u2019s 41st national conference. After a rousing speech to encourage the crowd, he told this reporter, \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to take power back for ordinary working people to become a self-governing people again is to confront the corporate interests and to expose them.\u201d\n\nAs much as protesters wanted to reach ALEC with their objections, another purpose of the week\u2019s events was to expose the Dallas public to ALEC\u2019s existence among them.\n\n\u201cMost people never heard of ALEC,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis big rally we had at the Anatole hotel today, that showed to a lot of people maybe just driving by that there\u2019s something out there called ALEC. [\u2026] If people see it, they will be disgusted by what\u2019s happened. This is the most visible, the most ostentatious merger of corporate power with right-wing legislative power and they meet in secret. [\u2026] If you want to see where the sausage is made, we were at that factory today.\u201d\n\nI spoke with Connor Gibson, a Greenpeace researcher who studies ALEC and similar groups, about how a newcomer to the movement can begin to unravel this complex network of corporate corruption. \u201cThe most important thing to do is learn about ALEC [. \u2026] It\u2019s actually a really complicated organization. It\u2019s state politicians, it\u2019s corporate lawyers and lobbyists and it\u2019s ALEC\u2019s staff. They convene and have a weird governance and the more people understand that, the more people know what to look out for.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWhat to look out for, specifically, is the state bills that are going through our statehouses that are going to privatize our education, make it harder for people to emigrate to this country safely, keep fracking chemicals secret in natural gas extraction \u2014 these are some of the things that ALEC does. When you learn what is on ALEC\u2019s roster of bills you also know what to look out for.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then when you see something that looks like ALEC, you can compare with their language. And then you can call out your legislator if you think they\u2019re doing ALEC\u2019s bidding and that of the corporations that pay ALEC instead of being accountable to the people that elected them,\u201d Gibson concluded.\n\nA year of protest and police repression\n\nFew of the thousands of Texans who came out last summer to loudly and passionately oppose the controversial anti-abortion law Senate Bill 5 would have identified it as a protest against ALEC, but the bill\u2019s sponsor was State Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, Texas State Chair for ALEC. Laubenberg became infamous for declaring during debates that emergency room doctors can use a rape kit to help victims \u201cget cleaned out.\u201d Just as with Stand Your Ground, remarkably similar laws attacking abortion have appeared all over the United States, tipping observers off to the right-wing coordination at their heart.\n\nThat\u2019s where I first joined the struggled against ALEC. As a member of Occupy Austin, I became one of the many activists whose grassroots organizing in the hallways of the Capitol laid the groundwork for the famous people\u2019s filibuster that kept the bill from passing in that session of the Texas Legislature. Of course, Governor Rick Perry spent tens of thousands of dollars on a second special legislative session to force the bill \u2014 renamed House Bill 2 \u2014 into law. We kept fighting, and it was here that I first realized how far police would go to protect ALEC\u2019s interests.\n\nThough State Troopers normally assigned to the Texas Capitol had initially seemed sympathetic to our cause \u2014 or at least respectful of our rights, after the first defeat dozens more were imported from around the state who lacked all such sympathies. As activists trying to raise our voices in democratic dissent, we were surveilled, harassed and arrested \u2014 some engaged in civil disobedience but others simply because State Troopers had identified them as leaders. When the bill finally passed, I participated in a symbolic sit-in that was violently disrupted. In addition to using pain techniques and humiliation \u2014 Troopers pulled down the pants of one woman in front of witnesses \u2014 activist Joshua Pineda was beaten until he bled onto the marble floors and required stitches in his head.\n\nLater that year, I followed ALEC\u2019s influence to Chicago, where they held their 40th annual meeting at the luxurious Palmer House Hilton. Activists caught ALEC\u2019s security off guard by performing a Moral Monday-inspired banner drop before the meeting formally began. But police were soon ready and more than willing to enforce the corporate power of the \u201c1%.\u201d Days later, after Jesse Jackson closed out a union-led rally of thousands by reminding the police that they were his union brothers, those same officers attacked the hundreds of activists that remained after the unions left. Surging across their own barricades, Chicago Police Department officers openly punched, kicked and threw nonviolent demonstrators.\n\nIn Dallas a year later, police response to activists varied similarly between accommodating and repressive. Rich Emberlin, a detective from Dallas\u2019 Criminal Intelligence division, followed activists throughout the four days of protest and established a firm but cordial relationship with the group, even helping them find a safe place to park at the Wednesday night protest at Eddie Deen\u2019s Ranch.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Whytney Blythe and Joshua Carmona, activists working with Blackland Prairie Rising Tide, dropped a banner in the atrium of the Hilton Anatole, then locked themselves to trees inside the glass-walled facility. Writing later on her Facebook wall, Blythe claimed that a conversation with a sympathetic police officer led to the pair\u2019s release without charges:\n\n[H]e asked me, \u201cWhat else do you protest?\u201d And I said \u201cPolice brutality.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhere?\u201d And I said \u201cEverywhere. My father was murdered by a cop when I was 14. I don\u2019t want what happened to us to happen to anyone else, anywhere.\u201d And he said, \u201cI have a 16 year old daughter. If she lost me, she\u2019d be devastated. I\u2019d be devastated if I lost her. If something like that happened to me, she probably would be in there chaining herself up too.\u201d\n\nThursday afternoon, CODEPINK Dallas gathered at Neiman Marcus\u2019 flagship store to protest a special fashion show held for ALEC attendees. Before the protest began, I found myself with a need to use the store\u2019s restroom, so I entered. I received permission and directions to the sixth floor toilets from a floor manager.\n\nA pair of police were waiting for me at the entrance to the restroom. Dallas Police Sergeant Stephen W. Toth followed me into the men\u2019s room, where he interrogated me as to my purpose as I attempted to use the facility under his watchful gaze. Despite my insistence that I was a journalist, there were five police officers and the store\u2019s stop-loss manager waiting outside when I emerged. One was Detective Emberlin, who assured me I was not under arrest, just temporarily detained until the store could issue me with a criminal trespass warning banning me from the premises.\n\nAfter giving these assurances, Emberlin left me alone with Sergeant Toth, another officer and the manager as I was led on a disorienting journey into the bowels of Neiman Marcus. As we descended an elevator to the basement, Toth told me bluntly that I had neither the right to remain silent, nor the right to refuse a search because my condition was now \u201clike being under arrest.\u201d With just one other officer and a manager as witnesses, I\u2019d have had little recourse if he\u2019d made good on those threats.\n\nIn the end, I was released with a 90-day ban from Neiman Marcus and all its subsidiaries worldwide.\n\nI doubt there are many freelance journalists who can afford to shop there, but still, the message was clear in that moment of interrogation in the basement: Resist ALEC and you have no rights.\n\nPolice: ALEC\u2019s victims and beneficiaries\n\nThough they are used to enforcing ALEC\u2019s secrecy and security, police officers are also victims of their policy, just like every other worker in the public sector. ALEC has coordinated nationwide attacks on public worker pensions through their model bills, from privatizing fund management to blocking pension managers from participating in socially responsible investment funds.\n\nBrian Austin, a police detective from Madison, Wisconsin, is an outspoken critic of both Stand Your Ground and ALEC\u2019s overall attack on the public sector.\n\n\u201c[ALEC] want us to get to the point where the moral component of taking a human life is out of the equation, the only question is whether it is legally justifiable,\u201d he wrote for PR Watch. \u201c[\u2026] The law treats the rapist/serial killer the same as the neighbor with Alzheimer\u2019s or the drunk college kid who mistakenly came to the wrong apartment.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s also a strong critic of ALEC\u2019s overall attack on the public sector: \u201cIn order to get people to continue to vote against their best interests, the ruling class has to make them believe the average guy next to them is the enemy. [\u2026] It is how they can demonize our teachers, firefighters and police officers while they siphon trillions from our collective bank accounts.\u201d\n\nAnother of the panelists at anti-ALEC events in Dallas, Shahid Buttar, executive director of the Bill of Rights Defense Committee, has a focus on police abuse of the Constitution. He said the Bill of Rights Defense Committee creates \u201cgrassroots organizing networks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe basically work around the country to build multi-ethnic and transpartisan grassroots coalitions that fight police department and intelligence agencies. We wrangle them through the rule of law into respecting constitutional rights, that\u2019s the goal,\u201d Buttar explained.\n\nLike ALEC, his group crafts model legislation \u201cfor state legislatures, for city councils and grassroots groups [\u2026] that, implemented at the local level, help build a mosaic for constitutional rights one city at a time.\u201d But ALEC\u2019s model bills work to undermine those same constitutional rights and the local independence that Buttar depends upon.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest bills that ALEC is pushing recently are measures that deny cities the opportunity or authority to decline participation in federal immigration enforcement. So the broken federal immigration system has led to essentially a human rights crisis along the southern border in particular, as well as human rights abuses within a hundred miles of any border including the northern border.\u201d\n\nHe noted: \u201cThis is particularly ironic because ALEC claims to promote local and state autonomy, yet at the same time it promotes federal authoritarianism with respect to immigration enforcement.\u201d Buttar\u2019s group, by contrast, has worked to provide alternatives for more humane treatment of immigrants.\n\nBut the attacks don\u2019t stop with immigration. Buttar cautions that ALEC is just one element of a larger attack on constitutional protections. Due to right-wing support for the proliferation of surveillance and military technologies from the federal to the local level, every city\u2019s police department has become \u201can enemy of the Constitution of the United States and We The People of it. [They\u2019re] our enemies too, no less than ALEC.\u201d\n\nScraps of a democracy\n\nOn the night that House Bill 2 passed and State Troopers violently ended our sit-in, the intersection between patriarchal police brutality and patriarchal state power over women seemed very clear to me.Greenpeace\u2019s Connor Gibson was willing to make the same comparison between House Bill 2 and ALEC\u2019s attacks on the environment. He described his admiration for ecofeminism, which \u201chas to do with patterns of dominance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe easy way to be introduced to the concept is the very visceral dominance we understand \u2014 male violence inflicted on women, something we\u2019re all too familiar with in this country and others \u2014 those patterns are also applied to other things that we depend on and love. Like the ecosystems that we rely upon to live,\u201d Gibson explained.\n\n\u201cI would say that that racism, that sexism \u2014 there\u2019s a similar disregard for well-being and a lack of compassion that comes with anti-environmental activity.\u201d\n\nOur legislators are owned by corporate investors, and have neither compassion for nor allegiance to the people who elect them. The government uses its militarized police to scatter resistance, then rewrites the law to make resistance harder. I asked Jim Hightower whether we still live in a democracy and his answer was unequivocal: \u201cNot at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, corporate money rules! The Supreme Court unleashed a plutocracy. The five-man majority who did Citizens United and McCutcheon, more recently, all of those steps allowed corporate money to become the de facto sovereign of America. It\u2019s now completely in charge,\u201d lamented Hightower.\n\n\u201cAnd then the lobbyists and front groups like ALEC on top of that, are funded by the Koch brothers and other right wing families for their own benefit. There\u2019s no altruism in this, it\u2019s done by corporate interests pursuing their own interests and the people be damned.\u201d\n\nI asked what we can do about this, to which Hightower replied: \u201cExactly what we are doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet in the face of power. Organize around issues like fracking, or a local environmental issues. Or for labor rights or consumer rights,\u201d he urged.\n\nBut we should also organize for a more central issue: \u201cthe rights of students, and old folks and people with disabilities to be able to get into the voting booth. They\u2019re even trying to shut us out of the voting booth \u2014 the most fundamental part of democracy is being denied to millions of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to change if we sit around and wait on Obama and Washington to do it for us. They\u2019re the ones doing it to us, really \u2014 passively if they\u2019re Democrats and aggressively if they\u2019re Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve got to do it ourselves, we\u2019ve got to do the heavy lifting,\u201d Hightower said, adding, \u201cThat has always been the truth of progress in America from the very start.\u201d\n\nUnless we keep speaking truth to the powerful like ALEC and its members, eventually we won\u2019t have the right to speak against them at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MintPress was there as activists gathered in Dallas to protest ALEC\u2019s persistent attacks on democracy.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Kit O'Connell", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "MintPress was there as activists gathered in Dallas to protest ALEC\u2019s persistent attacks on democracy.", "title": "First Hand Experience: Exposing ALEC\u2019s \u201cCorporate Sausage Factory\u201d In Dallas", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/first-hand-experience-exposing-alecs-corporate-sausage-factory-dallas/195134/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Code_Pink_July_4-795x596.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-11T08:31:55-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "MintPress was there as activists gathered in Dallas to protest ALEC\u2019s persistent attacks on democracy.", "title": "First Hand Experience: Exposing ALEC\u2019s \u201cCorporate Sausage Factory\u201d In Dallas", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Code_Pink_July_4-795x596.jpg", "creator": "@KitOConnell", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "published_time": "2014-08-09T05:00:09-05:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/kitoconnell", "section": "Front Page: National", "modified_time": "2014-08-11T08:31:55-05:00", "tag": "Dallas"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c84\"", "article_summary": "First Hand Experience: Exposing ALEC\u2019s \u201cCorporate Sausage Factory\u201d In DallasMintPress was there as activists gathered in Dallas to protest ALEC\u2019s persistent attacks on democracy.\nALEC: Where the corporate sausage is madeFor over 40 years, ALEC has had a corrupting influence on state politics.\nIts corporate sponsors and rich private investors write legislation, then their hand-picked, loyal legislators introduce those bills into law.\nActivists caught ALEC\u2019s security off guard by performing a Moral Monday-inspired banner drop before the meeting formally began.\nAfter the first of several days of corporate backroom deals at the Hilton Anatole, ALEC\u2019s members wanted to pretend they were cowboys while they ate."}
