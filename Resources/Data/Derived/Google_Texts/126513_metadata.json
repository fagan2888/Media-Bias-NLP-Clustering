(Photo credit: U.S. Air Force/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nWhat\u2019s Washington\u2019s gross political product? That is, how much, exactly, do corporations, trade groups and other special interests spend trying to influence the federal government? And who are the players involved in the process?\n\nUnfortunately, these are questions with no clear answer. Corporate influence in Washington extends far beyond PAC contributions and registered lobbyists. Influence peddlers, including those with prior, high-level government service, ply their trade while avoiding activities that would require them to register as lobbyists. An analysis of the most recent quarterly lobbying reports by the Center for Responsive Politics finds that registered lobbyists disclosed less spending than in prior quarters. That trend of waning spending has continued for several years. Sunlight and other political observers have noted that the slump coincides with a rise in \"shadow lobbying,\" or government advocacy that skirts the legal threshold that would require public disclosure.\n\nA realistic accounting of special interests' Washington footprint must cover methods of influence that aren't captured by regularly scheduled disclosures. To this end, over the next several months, Sunlight will be highlighting some of the subtler methods entrenched D.C. interests use to influence government.\n\nA prominent example of the myriad ways special interests affect government comes from the defense industry.\n\nNorthrop Grumman, a major defense contractor that employs more than 65,000 people, relied on the U.S. government for 85 percent of its sales in the past three years, according to its latest annual report. It's no surprise, then, that the corporations and its subsidiaries invest heavily in lobbying the federal government. In 2014, the company disclosed spending $10.2 million targeting an extensive range of legislation, including the National Defense Authorization Act and implementation of the Affordable Care Act, according to lobbying reports analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThis story relies on lobbying disclosure data from the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nIn addition to 40 registered lobbyists, however, Northrop Grumman's five sectors also employ a bevy of government marketing and sales professionals, many of whom boast long careers in the branch of military to which they now sell the defense contractor's products and services.\n\nA Sunlight Foundation review of contributors to Northrop Grumman's employee PAC from 2013 to March of 2015 finds 62 contributors whose job titles indicate interaction with government officials, either in a marketing or government affairs role. Of the individuals in that list, which is embedded below, 39 of those employees had experience in the federal government, nearly all of them in the military or intelligence spheres. Only 13 of them are registered as lobbyists.\n\nWhile lobbyists are known for banking on their government contacts and insider knowledge, a review of employee profiles on Northrop Grumman's website finds several examples of Northrop marketing specialists who have deep connections to the federal customers to whom they now market Northrop Grumman's products.\n\nRuss Anarde is the director of business development for Northrop Grumman\u2019s military systems unit of the space systems division. The 28-year Air Force veteran\u2019s final military assignment was as director of plans and programs for Air Force Space Command, according to his company biography.\n\nBill Bowling, Northrop\u2019s corporate director for U.S. Marine Corps programs, \u201cis directly responsible to develop and maintain a working relationship with senior members of the Marine Corps Marine Air Ground Task Force community,\u201d and joined Northrop after 30 years in the U.S. Marine Corps, retiring as a colonel.\n\nKevin Campbell spent 37 years in the U.S. Army, retiring as a lieutenant general in charge of the Army's Space and Missile Defense Command. He now contacts customers including the Missile Defense Agency \u2014 and the same Space and Missile Defense Command he once led \u2014 for Northrop Grumman.\n\nNot one of those three individuals is required to register to lobby.\n\nUnder the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA), individuals who earn money influencing federal policy \u2014 and spend more than 20 percent of their time on \"lobbying activity\" \u2014 must register with the House and Senate, disclose previous government employment and report which federal agencies and congressional offices were contacted on behalf of clients in quarterly disclosures.\n\nMost individuals who market products to the government, however, are not required to register as lobbyists. Public Citizen's Government Affairs Lobbyist Craig Holman explained to Sunlight that the law's definition of lobbying activity only applies to contacts with so-called \"covered\" government officials, and that many routine contacts about a product would not be considered lobbying as long as specific legislation or contracts aren't discussed. Responding to calls from government customers or offering general information about prices or products \"is not the same as trying to solicit a government contract,\" says Holman.\n\nAside from government marketers, there are even some government affairs specialists who may not fit in to the LDA\u2019s precise dimensions for lobbyists. Their names do not appear in lobbying reports and information about the individual\u2019s client, legislative goals and lobbying earnings go unreported.\n\nJeanine Esperne heads Washington Operations for Northrop Grumman\u2019s Information Systems division and previously served as the Pentagon's legislative affairs representative \u2014 or lobbyist \u2014 to the House. She describes her role as \u201coverseeing lobbying and consulting agreements\u201d and \u201ccoordinat[ing] advocacy on behalf of Northrop Grumman (IS) priority programs with customers in legislative and executive branches\u201d on her profile on the networking website LinkedIn. She is not a registered lobbyist.\n\nWhen asked about the corporation's political involvement and its internal protocols for tracking lobbying activity, Randy Belote, Northrop Grumman's vice president of Strategic Communications, told Sunlight in an email: \"Northrop Grumman feels it is essential to participate in the democratic process and its lobbying activities and political action committee provide the mechanism for that participation.\" He continued, \"The company diligently adheres to the government's regulations regarding reporting and disclosure of its lobbying activities.\"\n\nPAC to basics\n\nOf course, the company also leverages the traditional methods of Washington allegiance-building.\n\nAccording to the company's description of its employees' political action committee, \"Participation in ENGPAC [Employees of Northrop Grumman PAC] offers our employees the opportunity to pool their resources to support candidates for office who are supportive of national security. ENGPAC contributions are made on a bi-cameral and bipartisan basis.\"\n\nThe PAC's giving surged in March, according to its most recent campaign filing. That month the committee gave $575,150 to candidates on both sides of the aisle \u2014 the committee's largest monthly outlay in the 20 years since the PAC was established. The March total includes $15,000 contributions to the congressional and senatorial campaign arms of the Democratic party and $15,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. It's unclear what prompted the sharp uptick in donations, but one item on the corporation's agenda is a lucrative contract to build a stealth bomber for the U.S. Air Force. Politico reports Northrop is facing stiff competition from Boeing and Lockheed Martin as it contends for the job.\n\nIn addition to dishing out campaign contributions to party committees and friendly members of Congress, the employee PAC hosts fundraisers for friendly lawmakers. However, since most of the details about fundraising events aren't disclosed by campaigns, Sunlight and other outlets are dependent on invitees and news reports for much of the information we are able to aggregate for these events. (You can see our ever-growing database of political fundraisers at Political Party Time.)\n\nWhile it's not apparent which of its methods are most effective, it is clear that Northrop Grumman's full-court press approach to Washington influence has paid dividends. The group clocked in at No. 17 on Sunlight\u2019s list of the Fixed Fortunes 200 \u2014 the 200 companies that receive the most in revenue and subsidies from the federal government. From 2007 to 2012, the company earned more than $88 billion in federal business.\n\nGovernment affairs and government marketing professionals contributing to employee PAC\n\nNote: This analysis does not account for state lobbying registrations or state government experience.
