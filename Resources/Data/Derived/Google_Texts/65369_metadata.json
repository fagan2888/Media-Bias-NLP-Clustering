The \u201cnew born soul\u201d is supposedly my ideal mate. He is innovative and can provide me with inspiration. My quest is now refined.\n\nHaving a better idea how to identify most-compatible mates got me thinking about the off-Broadway musical comedy \u201cI Love You, You\u2019re Perfect, Now Change.\u201d The play looks at truths we don\u2019t want to admit about relationships and the mating game. The big truth is people don\u2019t change, or if they do change, they usually only experience minor shifts in personality and habits.\n\nA hard-earned lesson for most of us is the value of evaluating the compatibility of a potential mate after the initial infatuation of dating has passed and the surge of serotonin in the brain calms down. If you take off your rose-colored glasses to assess the good and less attractive traits of your potential mate, you\u2019re in a better state to decide whether you can not only live with but actually embrace the entire person, pimples and all.\n\nWith new knowledge from Soul Signs, I have a better understanding of the fundamental aspects of my personality \u2014 those that I can\u2019t change \u2014 and the understanding that the same is true for a possible mate. The key is to accurately identify these traits.\n\nThe thing is, my soul sign means I have rose-colored glasses super-glued to my face. Short of growing a new set of eyes in the back of my head, I might be doomed. Perhaps a seeing-eye dog could sniff out one good man for me. He need not be perfect, just beautifully imperfect.\n\nComing Aug. 20: Liar, Liar Pants on Fire\n\n*Names and identifying information have been changed to protect privacy and security.\n\nPhoto: adventtr/iStock\n\nAlso of Interest:\n\n\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "The book Soul Signs\u00a0by Rosemary Altea not only taught me about myself, it also taught me how to determine compatible mates for me.
