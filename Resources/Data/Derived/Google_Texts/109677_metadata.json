Milton Johnson said.\n\nU.S. hospitals have been reaping the benefits of the Affordable Care Act, with the increase in insurance coverage resulting in more medical bills being paid.\n\nSame facility admissions rose 5.1 percent in the quarter, same facility equivalent admissions rose 6.8 percent, and same facility emergency room visits rose 11.5 percent, the company said.\n\nHCA said it expected to report a first-quarter profit of about $1.35 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $1.14, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nThe company said it expected current-quarter revenue of about $9.68 billion, above the $9.59 billion analysts were expecting.\n\nHCA also raised its full-year profit forecast to $4.90-$5.30 per share from $4.55-$4.95. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $4.93 per share.\n\nThe company said it now expects full-year revenue of $39 billion-$40 billion, largely above the average estimate of $39.20 billion.\n\nThe company expects to report its first quarter results on or about May 5.\n\nHCA's shares were up 2.6 percent at $79.42 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nShares of other hospital operators, such as Tenet Healthcare Corp, Community Health Systems Inc and LifePoint Hospitals Inc, also rose.
