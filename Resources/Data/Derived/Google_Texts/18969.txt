DEADWOOD, SD

A longtime Main Street casino in the western South Dakota gambling town of Deadwood is shutting down, putting 24 full-time employees and another six part-timers out of work.



The owners of Miss Kitty's say the business will close on Saturday. The shutdown also affects two restaurants and bars. The Kenneth L. Keller Estate, which owns a number of Deadwood properties, says it isn't in a position to keep the businesses open through the winter season.



The estate says it will do what it can to help employees find other jobs.



Mayor Chuck Turbiville says he's shocked. He says he thought things were going well for the casino.



Turbiville says he hopes someone can take over the property. The estate says it has two prospective buyers.
