The uniform minimum definition should be set by the HHS, she said.Under a final rule issued by the HHS in 2013, states can choose from a list of options to designate \u201cbenchmark\u201d plans on which EHBs are based. In most states small group plans are the benchmark models. But Lilienfeld said that doesn\u2019t work for such categories as pediatric services. Small group plans typically \u201cwere created with adults in mind,\u201d she said.In November 2014 the HHS published a proposed rule for EHBs in 2016. The proposal generally would allow states to continue choosing benchmark plans, but they could update their benchmarks for 2017 with ACA-compliant plans from 2014.\n\nYour HR and Payroll compliance and policy solution!
