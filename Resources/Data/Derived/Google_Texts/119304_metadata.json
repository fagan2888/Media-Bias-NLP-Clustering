Jeanne Nicholson was cheery as she presided over her final caucus meeting Saturday, but there were some heavy hearts in the Capitol meeting room.\n\nThe Black Hawk Democrat lost her re-election bid to former Sen. Tim Neville, a Littleton Republican, in a vastly redrawn district than the one she carried four years ago. Neville beat Nicholson by 1,956 votes. In 2010, another GOP wave year, the former public health nurse and Gilpin County commissioner beat Republican Tim Leonard by 685 votes.\n\nAfter minority leadership elections, Sen. Jessie Ulibarri of Westminster, elected the new caucus chair, presented Nicholson with flowers, while Sen. Mike Johnston of Denver thanked her for her service.\n\n\u201cI just want to say that you have been an incredible force of wisdom and courage over the years I have gotten to serve with you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was amazing to come and walk with you during this campaign. In this last week when everybody was nervous and frantic and exhausted and short tempered, you were bubbly and you were thoughtful and you were courageous. That\u2019s the way you\u2019ve been at every step of this journey here.\n\n\u201cI just want to say a huge thank you for leading us.\u201d\n\nFor the first time since 2002, Democrats lost the majority in the general election. Republicans will have an 18-17 edge for the next two years. Also losing her seat was Sen.
