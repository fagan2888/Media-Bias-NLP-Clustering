Even the very name applied to our region \u2014 Hampton Roads \u2014 is taken from the confluence of the Elizabeth, James and Nansemond Rivers into the Chesapeake Bay on its way to the Atlantic.\n\nSo it is only fitting that an exceptional marine science lab would be located here. As the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) celebrates its 75th anniversary this year, it is worth noting its important role in the region over the decades.\n\nThe lab was established in 1940 as a small outpost with a humble mission to address issues related to local fisheries. But as the small staff of aquatic biologists began doing their research and educational work, it became apparent that such expertise could be put to increasingly significant work.\n\nToday VIMS, located at Gloucester Point on the York River, has more than 450 staff members and students. It has studied pollution, promoted conservation and performed critical work aimed at maintaining the fish, crab and oyster population that is such a big part of our region's heritage and economy.\n\nIf you swim or boat in the Hampton Roads area, if you catch or sell or eat locally produced seafood, if you enjoy our local waters in any way, you can give a little thanks to the folks at VIMS. And wish them a happy anniversary.\n\nHealth education\n\nIn this day and age, anything related to health, medicine and doctors can get confusing in a hurry. Throw insurance into the mix \u2014 before or after the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and it gets worse. Even if your original complaint was indigestion, you'd come away with a headache.\n\nSo it's so very beneficial that Bon Secours Mary Immaculate Hospital in Newport News is offering a free health education and literacy program that is designed to simplify the process of seeking and receiving treatment.\n\nThe eight-week program will cover such topics as appointments and medications, how to describe specific symptoms and complete medical forms, and what questions to ask doctors. To many patients, these subjects might seem too simple to even require explanation \u2014 but anyone who works in health care could give an in-depth seminar on the many ways these things get fouled up, and the amount of time and money that gets wasted trying to fix them.\n\nAnd it's not just about time and money. It's about health. The information in these programs will help ensure that people get the right medication and that they know how to take it properly. Again, something that seems simple but often isn't.\n\nThis type of program, offered to the public free of charge, is a tremendous service to the community.\n\nEditing Ebony\n\nA proud salute, journalists to journalist, to Hampton University graduate Kierna Mayo, who took over this summer as vice president and editor in chief of Ebony magazine.\n\nThis is obviously a major task and a high-profile title for a local woman. Ebony, which focuses on African-American culture, has been published continuously since 1940 and maintains a monthly circulation of more than 1.2 million readers.\n\nCurrent events make it clear that issues involving race are still front and center in the national dialogue. In a recent interview with the Daily Press, Ms. Mayo made it clear that she wants Ebony to consistently provide provocative and thought-provoking material that will be a part of that discussion.\n\nGood to see such impressive and relevant work being done by folks who took their education at our local universities.\n\nRoses and thorns\n\nEach week, the Daily Press Editorial Board offers a list of area citizens or institutions deserving of \"roses\" or \"thorns.\"\n\nThis week's roses go to:\n\n\u2022 Kecoughtan and HU grad Tory Smart, who will follow in his father's footsteps as the university's band director. If you have ever seen the HU marching band, pep band or concert band perform, you know the kind of talented and creative musicians he will be working with.\n\n\u2022 Everyone who has worked on the future USS John F. Kennedy, which will have its keel-laying ceremony on Saturday at Newport News Shipbuilding. It's a big milestone in the long process of constructing a Ford-class aircraft carrier.\n\nThis week's thorns go to:\n\n\u2022 The 14-year-old boy from James City County who went for a 2 a.m. \"joy ride\" that ended with some very reckless driving and a crash as he tried to elude police. Oh, yes, and he had two girls, ages 13 and 9, riding with him. He is lucky no one was hurt or killed.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Notes and notables: Birthday shout-out to VIMS, kudos to Bon Secours free health programs, Ebony magazine chief makes HU proud", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Daily Press", "author": "Daily Press", "og": {"site_name": "dailypress.com", "description": "Water works", "title": "Notes and notables: Birthday shout-out to VIMS, kudos to Bon Secours free health programs, Ebony magazine chief makes HU proud", "url": "http://www.dailypress.com/news/opinion/editorials/dp-edt-notes-notables-0821-20150820-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55d6a010/turbine/dp-edt-notes-notables-0821-20150820", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp07.15", "twitter": {"site": "@daily_press", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Virginia Institute of Marine Science, Ebony Magazine, health education", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=397500600, app-argument=http://www.dailypress.com/deeplinkid/84254981", "fb": {"page_id": 140388628320, "app_id": 515474311837346}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-08-20", "Description": "The Daily Press Editorial Board weighs in on the 75h anniversary of VIMS, a local health program, and the new editor of Ebony.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Virginia Institute of Marine Science, Ebony Magazine, health education"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8c5\"", "article_summary": "If you have ever seen the HU marching band, pep band or concert band perform, you know the kind of talented and creative musicians he will be working with.\nHealth educationIn this day and age, anything related to health, medicine and doctors can get confusing in a hurry.\nToday VIMS, located at Gloucester Point on the York River, has more than 450 staff members and students.\nThe lab was established in 1940 as a small outpost with a humble mission to address issues related to local fisheries.\nGood to see such impressive and relevant work being done by folks who took their education at our local universities."}
