Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has fallen below 50 percent support in the race for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination and has found herself in a neck-and-neck contest against GOP businessman Donald Trump among registered voters, according to a national survey out this week.

Mrs. Clinton had the support of 42 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in the Washington Post-ABC News poll, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 24 percent and Vice President Joseph R. Biden at 21 percent.

Mrs. Clinton’s support among Democrats fell 21 points since July, while Mr. Sanders’ support increased 10 points and support for Mr. Biden, who has not yet entered the race, increased 9 points.

In a potential head-to-head match-up, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Trump by 3 points among registered voters, 46 percent to 43 percent. Among all adults, she led by 12 points, 51 percent to 39 percent.

A majority of Americans said they disapprove of the way Mrs. Clinton has handled questions about her private e-mail account she chose to use as secretary of state, and 54 percent said she has tried to cover up facts.

A majority of Democrats — 55 percent — said they approve of how she has handled the controversy.

The survey of 1,003 adults was conducted Sept. 7-10, with an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. It included a sample of 356 registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, with a margin of error of 6 points for that group.
