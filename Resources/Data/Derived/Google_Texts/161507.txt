The pair made a joint cameo on Amy Poehler's NBC comedy "Parks and Recreation" to talk up bipartisanship — and their Polynesian folk band "Across the Isle" — on Tuesday. But the music may still be in the works.

"I cannot confirm nor deny whether we're having rehearsals tonight," Booker said with a laugh as he strolled to the Senate floor Wednesday.

Hatch ribbed Booker for luxuriating in the spotlight as he made his own way to the Senate a few minutes later.

"He's reveling in the publicity," he joked. "We have the band already. Of course, none of us know how to play any of the instruments."

Hatch is being modest — he's written hundreds of songs, including a few for motown diva Gladys Knight, and has a few albums of his own.

While the band may be fictional, both say the bipartisan friendship is real.

"I had a lot of fun, and Hatch was a great sport," said Booker.

"Oh my gosh. Yeah, it was fun," said Hatch. "He's a really nice guy... We've had a friendship before that."
