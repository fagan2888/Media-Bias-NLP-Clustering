The organizations are very much complementary to each other and we are seeing the value of the synergy\" they have created, said Fox, a proven leader at multiple executive stops that also included Clarian Health in Indianapolis where he worked with Sam Flanders, M.D., Beaumont's senior vice president and chief quality and safety officer.\n\nFox said a combined Beaumont will be much stronger for the future as the health care industry continues to face \"significant financial pressure that will drive more consolidation.\"\n\nBeaumont's top executives\n\nNew top executives include COO Carolyn Wilson, RN, from Fairview Health System in Minneapolis; chief compliance officer Dawn Geisert, an attorney who had a similar position with Henry Ford; and chief nursing officer Susan Grant from Emory where she worked with Fox.\n\nFox is still searching for a chief marketing officer. Long-time Beaumont CMO Mike Killian retired.\n\nOther top executives in place include former Botsford CEO Paul LaCasse, D.O., who now is executive vice president of post-acute and diversified business integration, a new position.\n\nThree top executives came from Oakwood: John Keuten, chief financial officer; Mary Zatina, senior vice president of government relations and community affairs; and J. Paul Conway, chief human resources officer.\n\nFour top executives came from Beaumont, including David Wood, M.D., chief medical officer; Gordon Walker, chief legal officer; Subra Sripada, chief transformation officer & system chief information officer; Margaret Cooney Casey, chief development officer\n\n\"We only had 11 leaders vice president or above leave (of 91 executives vice president or higher). That is not very many for an organization of 35,000 people,\" said Fox, noting that five executives retired. \"Our retention rate for our next level is 88 percent. We have stability, which is very important.\"\n\nBond issue, cost reductions?\n\nIn January 2015, Beaumont issued a consolidated bond for $398.4 million that saved the new system $23.5 million. The consolidation plan projected to save $134 million in the first three years of the new system and those savings are on schedule by 2017, Fox said.\n\nLast week, Beaumont issued a new $300 million bond through the Michigan Hospital Financing Authority to pay for or refinance several projects, including a new ER and proton therapy center at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, expansion and renovation of a Beaumont medical center in Farmington Hills and the renovation of the first floor operating room at Beaumont Hospital, Troy.\n\nBeaumont has recently announced several other major capital projects, including construction of a new patient tower in 2016 for Botsford Hospital.\n\nIT consolidation, medical group unification and clinical services study underway\n\nLast October, when Botsford Hospital went live with Epic Corp.'s electronic medical record system, Beaumont completed a common information technology platform for its eight hospitals and 1,532 participating physicians in 406 offices. Beaumont and Oakwood were already linked by Epic's EMR.\n\n\"This enables common quality safety and service standards a single set of dashboards that are the same for all hospitals,\" Fox said. \"Everybody is tracking same metrics. They see theirs and others.\"\n\nFox said the single medical record system creates opportunities for doctors and hospitals to improve quality, reduce duplication of services and share best clinical practices.\n\nMoreover, Beaumont's Epic EMR system is linked into at least two other larger health information exchanges. They are the Epic Users Group, which includes 11 systems in Michigan such as Henry Ford, the University of Michigan Health System, Hurley Medical Center and Spectrum Health; and a second data network managed by the Michigan Health Information Network, or MiHIN.\n\nAnother 250 employed and independent doctors have signed contracts to join Beaumont's Epic EMR with another 104 independent doctors going through the contract process.\n\nAnother milestone was reached when 897 employed doctors in the Beaumont system combined four separate organizations into the new multi-specialty Beaumont Medical Group.\n\nEach hospital and physician organization has a lead physician for the group and is governed by an 18-member management council, including 14 physicians representing primary care, specialty and hospital-based services, Beaumont said.\n\nUnder physician governance and a single management structure, fledgling Beaumont Medical Group now will be able to compete for contracts against other multi-specialty groups in Southeast Michigan that include Henry Ford Medical Group, Wayne State University Physicians Group and Michigan Healthcare Professionals.\n\nAnother physician organization, composed of independent physicians that represent about 3,700 of the 4,600 physicians affiliated with Beaumont hospitals, are in the process of forming a yet unnamed group.\n\nTo negotiate managed care contracts, lower costs and improve quality, Beaumont is launching Beaumont Care Partners, a clinically integrated network, that will link both the employed and the independent physician organizations. All Beaumont physicians are eligible to join if they agree to participation criteria.\n\nBeaumont plans to finalize BCP development by this fall and enter into insurance contracts effective Jan. 1, 2017, Beaumont said.\n\nFox said negotiating a single managed care contract for Beaumont hospitals - and in some cases its physicians - is a work in process.\n\nWhile each Beaumont hospital will maintain its own medical staff, physicians formed a clinical leadership council to develop common credentialing of specialties and common governance structures.\n\nFox said work is slowly progressing on integrating clinical service lines, including emergency medicine, heart and vascular services, radiation oncology and primary care.\n\n\"We have completed radiation oncology,\" he said. \"Beaumont radiation oncologists are working at Oakwood. It is part of an effort to get specialists to work together.\"\n\nWork also is nearly complete on unifying Beaumont's eight hospital emergency departments.\n\n\"We have half a million ER visits each year,\" Fox said. \"Leadership is working on common protocals, mental health disorders as they cascade into the ERs and people unable to find care.\"\n\nBut Fox said physicians are still talking about how to develop single leadership structures for each clinical service line across Beaumont.\n\n\"We have three open heart programs with all that are doing well,\" said Fox, adding: \"Discussions on consolidating service lines are underway. We haven\u2019t committed to single structure on any service line.\"\n\nHowever, he said Beaumont has consolidated its laboratory and pathology services into a single department\n\nOver the next three months, commuters also should begin to see phase two rolled out of Beaumont's common branding theme on billboards.\n\nFox said the general them will be \"more Beaumont in more places,\" which is communicating that Beaumont has 168 outpatient centers in addition to the eight hospital campuses.\n\n\"We are migrating away from the \"Botsford plus Beaumont plus Oakwood,\" Fox said. \"It will be just Beaumont Health going forward.\"\n\nAs part of the branding campaign, Beaumont Health ambulances are being repainted with new blue-and-white colors. Beaumont formerly used burgundy and Oakwood had green as system colors.\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Executive team is in place in a two-year process to combine health systems.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "Executive team is in place in a two-year process to combine health systems.", "title": "Beaumont's John Fox talks about progress made in merger with Oakwood, Botsford", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20160118/BLOG010/160119979/beaumonts-john-fox-talks-about-progress-made-in-merger-with-oakwood", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CD/20160118/BLOG010/160119979/AR/0/AR-160119979.jpg&MaxW=1400&MaxH=1400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "BLOG", "tag": "Health Care", "published_time": "2016-01-18T03:01:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-19T14:54:00-05:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/section/blog010/jay-greene"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "theme-color": "#b51218"}, "article_summary": "Another milestone was reached when 897 employed doctors in the Beaumont system combined four separate organizations into the new multi-specialty Beaumont Medical Group.\nAs part of the branding campaign, Beaumont Health ambulances are being repainted with new blue-and-white colors.\nBeaumont Health consists of eight hospitals with 3,337 beds, 168 outpatient sites, 4,603 physicians, 35,000 employees and about 3,500 volunteers.\nAll Beaumont physicians are eligible to join if they agree to participation criteria.\n\"It will be just Beaumont Health going forward.\""}
