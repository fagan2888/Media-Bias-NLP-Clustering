President Barack Obama got a lot of laughs Monday night when he hosted Stephen Colbert’s popular segment “The Word” on The Colbert Report.

Re-branding “The Word” as “The Decree,” the commander-in-chief launched into a health care-themed monologue, while words and phrases making fun of him and his opponents appeared on the right side of the screen.

For example, when he said, “There are things that people from both parties actually like about Obamacare,” the phrase “Everything but the ‘Obama'” showed up. Memorable asides gave hypothetical health care plans designed by Republican congressional leaders new names like “Fracking the elderly?” and “Walk-It-Off.gov.”

But the President cracked up the crowd the most when he said, “Young people don’t watch real news shows like this one. They watch comedy shows, and I just don’t see the President going on one of those. They’re beneath his dignity,” while the phrase, “but above his approval rating” flashed across the screen.

Afterwards, Obama sat down with Colbert, and you can read more about that interview here.
