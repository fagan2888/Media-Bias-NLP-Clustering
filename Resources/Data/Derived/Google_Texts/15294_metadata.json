Mr. Reich has written 14 books including his most recent Saving Capitalism, and is the co-creator of Inequality For All, a documentary exposing surging wealth inequality in America. At 4\u201911\u201d Mr. Reich\u2019s career has long been focused fighting for the little guys\u2014specifically, those taken advantage of by the economically powerful. Mr. Reich served in the administrations of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, and was the Secretary of Labor for the Clinton administration in the 1990s. His achievements earned him a spot on Time Magazine\u2018s 2008 list of the ten most successful cabinet secretaries of the 20th century. Mr. Reich currently serves as the Chancellor\u2019s Professor of Public Policy at the University of California-Berkeley.\n\nOne of the most polarizing differences between Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton is their stance on reforming Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 economic recession. \u201cHillary Clinton doesn\u2019t want to resurrect Glass-Steagall and does not want to bust up the biggest banks,\u201d Mr. Reich told the Observer. \u201cUnless you are prepared to do that, the danger to the entire financial and economic system is simply too large. Her proposals contain some good ideas but they don\u2019t go nearly far enough.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Mr. Sanders has repeatedly proposed to break up the biggest Wall Street banks, reminiscent of the trust-busting reforms enacted by Theodore Roosevelt in the early 20th century in response to the rampant monopolization of the Gilded Age that socially stratified the country.\n\n\u2018He is one of those very rare people in American politics who sticks to his guns and doesn\u2019t confuse means with ends.\u2019\n\n\u201cIn 1990, when I first began looking closely at the financial system and its risks, the five largest Wall Street banks had ten percent of all banking assets in America. By the year 2000, the five largest had 25 percent of all banking assets. By 2006, when some of the risks began increasing substantially, the five largest had close to 30 precent of all banking assets\u2014and then of course in 2008 everything fell apart. Today, the five largest Wall Street banks have 45 percent of all banking assets.\u201d\n\nMr. Reich recommends a two-pronged approach to reform, with the first step being to break up big banks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason they have to be that large\u2014there are no economies of scale that benefit the public in having banks that large,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second prong is separating commercial banking from investment banking. There\u2019s absolutely no reason why they should be combined, particularly given that the government insures the commercial deposits against losses. It\u2019s very important not to allow banks to use these commercial deposits for the purposes of gambling in derivative markets or any other financial markets.\u201d\n\nGlass-Steagall was enacted in 1933 after the Great Depression to separate commercial from investment banking, but was repealed in 1999 during the Clinton administration. Mr. Reich explained, \u201cit\u2019s true that resurrecting Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis of 2008.It would have helped reduce the crisis, and the combination of busting up the big banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall would help prevent another crisis.\u201d\n\nHealthcare reform has also been a major issue in this campaign cycle, following Mr. Sanders\u2019 endorsement of a single payer healthcare proposal just hours before the fourth Democratic debate. Mr. Reich defends the proposal, and believes single payer healthcare is not only viable, but crucial in order to make reforms to our current healthcare system.\n\n\u201cThere is no question in my mind or in the mind of any policy people who have taken a hard look at healthcare systems around the world that a single payer system is far less expensive, far more efficient, and in most cases delivers better quality healthcare than a system based upon private for profit health insurers. That\u2019s because private for-profit health insurance systems have many costs such as advertising, marketing, complex billing systems, and executive pay (which is competitive with other executives at the highest levels of executive pay in the private sector). All of these extensions work to the detriment of consumers.\u201d He added, \u201cthe affordable care act is certainly better than what we used to have, but there are still millions of Americans who do not have health insurance and even those who do are paying more and more in deductibles and co-payments. We simply have to move toward a single payer system and I am hardly alone in believing that. That is the consensus among policy professionals who understand health care and health insurance.\u201d\n\nMr. Reich noted the difference in opinion lies on the feasibility of moving to a single payer system. \u201cThose who say Bernie Sanders\u2019 plan is unrealistic assume Republicans in congress would never buy it. After all, they have tried desperately to repeal Obamacare. But, if Bernie succeeds in being elected that would be a very clear signal of the public\u2019s willingness to take the next step towards a single payer plan and it may also change the membership of congress.\u201d\n\nLast week, Mr. Reich officially endorsed of Mr. Sanders:\n\nI endorse Bernie Sanders for president of the United States. He's leading a movement to reclaim America for the many, not the few. \u2014 Robert Reich (@RBReich) February 27, 2016\n\n\u201cI have always been impressed by his steadfastness and his principled positions. He is one of those very rare people in American politics who sticks to his guns and doesn\u2019t confuse means with ends. He keeps the ends clearly in mind, and also does his homework. He understands public policy, but he also understands politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Michael Sainato", "sailthru.author": "Michael Sainato", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-462964303.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-462964303.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "2016 elections, Bernie Sanders, Bill Clinton, democrats, Glass Steagall, Healthcare Reform, Hillary Clinton, Robert Reich, Wall Street, obsNews & Politics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "2016 elections, bernie sanders, bill clinton, democrats, glass steagall, healthcare reform, hillary clinton, robert reich, wall street", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-462964303.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "%tags%", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Bill Clinton\u2019s Secretary of Labor Puts Endorsement Behind Sanders", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "michael-sainato", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-462964303.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "Robert Reich backs Bernie's plan to break up banks: 'He understands politics.'", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/img_1537.jpg?quality=80&w=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2016-03-04T16:00:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-14T17:31:41+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/michael-sainato"}, "sailthru.description": "Robert Reich backs Bernie's plan to break up banks: 'He understands politics.'", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "Robert Reich backs Bernie\u2019s plan to break up banks: \u2018He understands politics.\u2019", "title": "Bill Clinton\u2019s Secretary of Labor Puts Endorsement Behind Sanders", "url": "http://observer.com/2016/03/bill-clintons-secretary-of-labor-puts-endorsement-behind-sanders/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-462964303.jpg?quality=80&w=1200", "height": 781}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Michael Sainato's writing has appeared in the Guardian, Miami Herald, Baltimore Sun, Huffington Post, LiveScience, Buffalo News, the Plain Dealer, the Hill, Gainesville Sun, Tallahassee Democrat, Knoxville News Sentinel, and the Troy Record.
