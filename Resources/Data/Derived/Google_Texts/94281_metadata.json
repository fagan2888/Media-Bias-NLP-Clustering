You\u2019re rushed to the emergency room, evaluated, and stabilized. Then the hospital has several options: They can send you home or admit you as an inpatient for further treatment. But increasingly, hospitals are shuffling older patients to a third alternative, a category called \"observation status\" under which patients are monitored (and often treated) by doctors, but never formally \u201cadmitted\u201d in the eyes of either the hospital or the insurer.\n\nAs it turns out, this classification is great for hospitals, but it can be far more expensive for patients.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2009, Medicare claims for observation status rose 100 percent, according to a recent report from the public policy arm of the AARP, and the rise was greatest for longer observation stays of 48 hours or more.\n\nSo why the uptick?\n\nPatients under observation often have the same ailments that admitted inpatients do, but hospitals see observation as more efficient than inpatient care, since it frees up doctors and nurses to tend to sicker patients. The AARP also observed a 16 percent decline in the number of inpatient stays, especially one-day stays, during the same nine-year time period, suggesting that hospitals have been substituting inpatient stays for observation.\n\nBut on top of that, insurance regulators have been cracking down on short inpatient stays. Starting in 2005, auditors have been reviewing such claims to ensure their \u201cmedical necessity,\u201d the AARP researchers write, which may have spooked hospitals into using the less-scrutinized observation status.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An obscure classification allows hospitals to keep readmission rates down while patients unknowingly rack up higher costs.", "author": "Olga Khazan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "An obscure classification allows hospitals to keep readmission rates down while patients unknowingly rack up higher costs.", "title": "How Hospitals Pass Their Obamacare Penalties on to Patients", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/4411503465_5dd75853ec_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/how-hospitals-pass-their-obamacare-penalties-on-to-patients/282157/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/olgakhazan"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e16\"", "article_summary": "But on top of that, insurance regulators have been cracking down on short inpatient stays.\nAs it turns out, this classification is great for hospitals, but it can be far more expensive for patients.\nPatients under observation often have the same ailments that admitted inpatients do, but hospitals see observation as more efficient than inpatient care, since it frees up doctors and nurses to tend to sicker patients.\nThe AARP also observed a 16 percent decline in the number of inpatient stays, especially one-day stays, during the same nine-year time period, suggesting that hospitals have been substituting inpatient stays for observation.\nStarting in 2005, auditors have been reviewing such claims to ensure their \u201cmedical necessity,\u201d the AARP researchers write, which may have spooked hospitals into using the less-scrutinized observation status."}
