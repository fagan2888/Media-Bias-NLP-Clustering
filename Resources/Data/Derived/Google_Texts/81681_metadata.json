On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced that his government is in talks with the United Arab Emirates over the purchase of modernized weapons.\n\nPoroshenko\u2019s under-equipped army has been battling well-armed insurgents in the eastern part of Ukraine. The rebels, backed by Russia, are equipped with advanced weapons the government in Kiev does not have.\n\nRelated: McCain Laments U.S. Failure Toward Ukraine\n\nOver the weekend, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk pleaded for U.S. arms in an interview with Fox News. \u201cWe have to defend ourselves,\u201d Yatsenyuk said. \u201cRussia is constantly supplying tanks, surface-to-air missiles and the rest of the stuff. And again everyone knows this, and we still use outdated Soviet-style equipment.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Poroshenko demonstrated that the government in Kiev is willing to look beyond the U.S. and NATO. According to multiple media reports, he told reporters at the International Defense Exhibition and Conference in Abu Dhabi that Ukraine and the UAE had agreed on a deal for unspecified \u201cdefensive\u201d weaponry. He said that Ukraine remains in talks with the U.S., as well.\n\n\u201cI want to stress that the defensive capabilities for the Ukrainian Army are only to defend our territory, to keep our independence, to keep our sovereignty,\u201d he added. \u201cWe do not have any plans to attack anybody.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin Throws Wrench in Iran Nuke Talks\n\nThe question of whether or not the U.S. should arm Ukraine is a fraught one in Washington. The Obama administration has been verbally supportive of the Ukrainian government, and has supplied a small amount of non-lethal aid. However, the likelihood that the transfer of advanced U.S. military equipment to the Kiev government would turn the conflict into a full-blown proxy war between the U.S. and Russia appears to be a sticking point for the Obama White House.\n\nThis has not sat well with many in Congress, including vocal and influential Republicans. Over the weekend, Arizona Sen. John McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, declared himself \u201cashamed\u201d of the U.S. for its failure to better support Ukraine.\n\nA ceasefire between Ukranian troops and Russia-backed rebels was supposed to have stopped fighting between the two sides more than a week ago, but rebel forces pressed their offensive against the town of Debaltseve for several days past the deadline with little pushback from European leaders. After the fall of Debaltseve, reports of continued attacks in the area of the vital port city of Mariupol continued.\n\nOn Tuesday, Reuters correspondents in eastern Ukraine reported seeing heavy weapons in rebel hands being transported away from the front lines, which was a condition of the original ceasefire.\n\nUkrainian officials, though, claim that attacks are still taking place, and said that they would not agree to pull back their weapons until the attacks had stopped for two full days.\n\nRussia has consistently denied supplying troops or equipment to the Ukrainian rebels. Substantial evidence to the contrary has led to general agreement among Western governments that the rebels are essentially the Kremlin\u2019s proxies.\n\nRelated: Europe Chickens Out Over Ukraine Ceasefire Violations\n\nIf a shooting war didn\u2019t create enough tension between the Ukrainian and Russian governments, Kiev also remains dependent on Russia for much of the natural gas its citizens use to heat their homes and for other purposes. On Tuesday, Russian officials said that Ukraine was two days away from having gas supplies shut off because the government has not pre-paid for delivery.\n\nUkraine claims that it has already paid for all the gas it requires through the winter. The controversy is driven, in part, by the fact that Russia is charging the government in Kiev for the gas it is supplying to separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After months of pleading unsuccessfully for U.S. weapons to defend themselves against Russia-backed rebels, Ukrainian leaders have begun looking elsewhere.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Delays Push Ukraine to Look Elsewhere for Arms", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/25/Obama-s-Delays-Push-Ukraine-Look-Elsewhere-Arms", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03072014_Ukraine_USA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/25/Obama-s-Delays-Push-Ukraine-Look-Elsewhere-Arms", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03072014_Ukraine_USA.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "After months of pleading unsuccessfully for U.S. weapons to defend themselves against Russia-backed rebels, Ukrainian leaders have begun looking elsewhere.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe28\"", "article_summary": "On Tuesday, Reuters correspondents in eastern Ukraine reported seeing heavy weapons in rebel hands being transported away from the front lines, which was a condition of the original ceasefire.\nThe controversy is driven, in part, by the fact that Russia is charging the government in Kiev for the gas it is supplying to separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.\nPoroshenko\u2019s under-equipped army has been battling well-armed insurgents in the eastern part of Ukraine.\nThe rebels, backed by Russia, are equipped with advanced weapons the government in Kiev does not have.\nRussia has consistently denied supplying troops or equipment to the Ukrainian rebels."}
