Joaquin Castro, Gene Green and Sheila Jackson Lee asked the Justice Department to \u201cinitiate legal proceedings seeking to enjoin and declare invalid regulations\u201d proposed by the Texas Department of Insurance to regulate navigators operating under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe state of Texas could have established its own health insurance exchange but refused due to the opposition of its governor and other state officials,\u201d the letter said.\n\n\u201cGiven this refusal and opposition to the [Affordable Care Act], it appears clear to us that the dominant, indeed exclusive, purpose of the regulations proposed by the TDI is to sabotage and impede the successful implementation of the health care law,\u201d the letter said.\n\nGov. Rick Perry \u2013 a staunch Obamacare opponent \u2013 instructed Texas Department of Insurance Commissioner Julia Rathgeber in September to adopt additional rules to oversee navigators, saying they were needed to protect Texans and their confidential information, including birth dates, Social Security numbers and financial information.\n\nThe proposed rules would require health care navigators to receive an additional 40 hours of training on top of the 20 to 30 hours required by federal law. The rules would require navigators hired by local organizations through a federal grant to take an additional 40 hours of training on Medicaid rules, ethics and privacy.\n\nACA navigators also would pay training fees of up to $800, an additional $120 for six hours of continued education, plus a $50 registration fee. They also would have to undergo a criminal background check and a fingerprinting process that could cost up to $62, prove their U.S. citizenship, and provide documentation of their educational credentials.\n\nState rules for navigators for other federal benefits are less stringent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Texas Politics", "description": "AUSTIN \u2013 Texas congressional Democrats are calling on U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to stop Texas\u2019 proposed rules for Obamacare navigators that they say impose \u201cabritrary, bur\u2026", "title": "Texas congressional Democrats to Holder: Stop proposed navigator rules", "url": "http://blog.mysanantonio.com/texas-politics/2014/01/texas-congressional-democrats-to-holder-stop-proposed-navigator-rules/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://blog.mysanantonio.com/texas-politics/files/2013/08/AG-Voting-Rights.JPEG-05a6a.jpg", "height": 682}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-14T22:10:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-14T22:19:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://blog.mysanantonio.com/texas-politics/files/2013/08/AG-Voting-Rights.JPEG-05a6a.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "NextGEN": "1.7.5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "AUSTIN \u2013 Texas congressional Democrats are calling on U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to stop Texas\u2019 proposed rules for Obamacare navigators that they say impose \u201cabritrary, burdensome and discriminatory restrictions\u201d on those working to help citizens purchase health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe proposed rules would require health care navigators to receive an additional 40 hours of training on top of the 20 to 30 hours required by federal law.\n\u201cThe state of Texas could have established its own health insurance exchange but refused due to the opposition of its governor and other state officials,\u201d the letter said.\nThe rules would require navigators hired by local organizations through a federal grant to take an additional 40 hours of training on Medicaid rules, ethics and privacy.\nState rules for navigators for other federal benefits are less stringent."}
