Asa Hutchinson encountered no vocal opposition last week when he outlined to a legislative task force his plan for a modified version of Medicaid expansion and his goal of cutting $835 million in costs from the traditional Medicaid program over five years \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean fights aren\u2019t coming.\n\nThe Health Reform Legislative Task Force voted Wednesday \u2014 in a voice vote with no \u201cno\u201d votes heard \u2014 to support Hutchinson\u2019s efforts to obtain federal Medicaid waivers to enable his vision for Medicaid expansion. A co-chairman of the panel said later the show of support should not be taken to mean that the governor\u2019s plan can be achieved without a fight.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s waiting for the cage fight,\u201d said Sen. Jim Hendren, R-Gravette. \u201cIt\u2019s coming. But we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\n\nHutchinson wants to impose new restrictions on the Medicaid expansion program known as the private option, which he has proposed renaming Arkansas Works because he says the changes he favors would encourage more of the beneficiaries to become employed.\n\nTo get the changes approved, Hutchinson will need to obtain federal waivers and \u2014 perhaps a bigger hurdle \u2014 win over both supporters and opponents of the current program.\n\n\u201cSome of these things sound great, but administratively the costs to them outweigh any benefit that you get from them,\u201d said Sen. Keith Ingram, D-West Memphis, a member of the task force and a supporter of the private option.\n\nIngram said some of the proposed restrictions may be overly punitive, such as a requirement that people pay premiums if the value of their assets is above a certain level.\n\n\u201cAll of us have had situations where (a family member) might have a home that\u2019s worth X amount of dollars, but they have no money and they\u2019re in a nursing home,\u201d he said.\n\nIngram said he did not oppose the governor\u2019s pursuit of waivers for Arkansas Works \u2014 he did not vote at all, he said \u2014 because there will be time to debate the details of Medicaid expansion next year.\n\n\u201cI think all of us take comfort in that it\u2019s got to come back in front of the Legislature,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Reginald Murdock, D-Marianna, also a task force member and a supporter of the private option, said that although he is not in total agreement with the governor\u2019s ideas, he voted for the motion to support the governor because that was the appropriate thing to do based on \u201cwhere we are in the process.\u201d\n\nMurdock also said he was pleased that Hutchinson dropped from his wish list a provision to lock out people who fail to pay premiums if required to do so.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we\u2019re not crippling the very purpose of the (Affordable Care Act),\u201d Murdock said.\n\nSen. Cecile Bledsoe, R-Rogers, another task force member, said she abstained because she continues to believe that Arkansas\u2019 Medicaid expansion is not sustainable. But she said she did not vote against supporting the governor at this stage because \u201cwe will always have that chance during the special session to vote on the legislation.\u201d\n\nHutchinson has said he expects to call a special session on the future of Medicaid sometime in the spring, after the March 1 primary election.\n\nThe private option uses federal Medicaid money to subsidize private health insurance for more than 200,000 low-income Arkansans \u2014 an alternative approach to the expansion of Medicaid rolls that was envisioned under the Affordable Care Act. The federal government is paying 100 percent of the cost now, but states that accept Medicaid expansion under the health care law must pay 5 percent in 2017, 6 percent in 2018, 7 percent in 2019 and 10 percent in 2020.\n\nHutchinson has said he is willing to continue with Medicaid expansion after 2016 only if the federal government allows the state to make changes to the program and the state is able to cut costs in the traditional Medicaid program to pay for the state\u2019s share of the expansion cost. He says that means costs must be cut by $835 million over the next five years, of which between $50 million and $60 million per year must come from state spending on Medicaid.\n\nHendren said the task force will work through 2016 to find ways to achieve those savings. By the time of the special session it should have a \u201cframework\u201d to recommend, but it likely will have much more work to do at that point, he said.\n\n\u201cNinety days or so (from now) is what we\u2019re talking about for a special session.\u201d he said. \u201cAre we going to have agreement on $835 million in 90 days? Probably not. And that may make it more politically difficult to some who say, \u2018I want to see the savings before I\u2019ll vote for an expansion program.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Hendren added, \u201cThe good news is, that $835 million, it identifies cuts that would make that 10 percent match sustainable moving forward beyond 2020. So we\u2019re not going to go bankrupt in 2017, \u201818 and \u201819 because the match rate doesn\u2019t jump right up to 10 percent.\u201d\n\nLike the coming battle over continuing Medicaid expansion, cutting millions from traditional Medicaid is not expected to be easy.\n\n\u2018That is the beginning of what we know is going to be a bloody fight,\u201d Hendren said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Gov.
