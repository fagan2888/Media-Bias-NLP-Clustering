But in terms of small meetings, discussing policy, that never happened.\" ...\n\nRead more at USA Today\n\n\n\n======================================\n\nSebelius: \u2018Financial Literacy Of A Lot Of People \u2026 Is Very Low\u2019\n\nBy Chuck Ross, The Daily Caller\n\nIn an interview in which she tried to distance herself from Jonathan Gruber\u2019s remarks about how Obamacare was crafted, former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sounded a lot like the MIT economist.\n\n\u201cI think one of the things that we have learned with the passage of the law \u2026 is a lot of Americans have no idea what insurance is about,\u201d Sebelius told USA Today.\n\nSebelius served as Health and Human Services secretary from the beginning of President Obama\u2019s first term through this June. She came under heavy fire for the federal health law\u2019s rocky roll-out.\n\nConsumers \u201chave no idea, even if they have coverage, what it means, what a deductible is, what a co-pay is, how to choose a network,\u201d Sebelius said, adding that those were \u201ccomplicated terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the financial literacy of a lot of people \u2014 particularly people who did not have insurance coverage or whose employers choose their coverage and kind of present it to them \u2014 is very low,\u201d said Sebelius. \u201cAnd that has be a sort of stunning revelation, and it\u2019s not because anybody hid it from folks, it\u2019s that this is a complicated product.\u201d\n\nIn citing the public\u2019s low financial literacy, Sebelius sounded a lot like Gruber who, at a speech at the University of Rhode Island in 2012, said that the passage of one portion of Obamacare \u2014 the so-called Cadillac tax \u2014 involved \u201ca very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter.\u201d\n\nIn another video recording from 2013 that surfaced last month, Gruber said that \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d was \u201creally really critical for the thing to pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis bill was written in a tortured way to make sure [the Congressional Budget Office] did not score the mandate as taxes,\u201d Gruber continued. \u201cIf CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.\u201d\n\nSebelius denied that Gruber was an \u201carchitect\u201d of Obamacare, as many have called him. She told USA Today that she has never met with Gruber and said he was \u201cone of many\u201d consultants on the federal health bill. She did concede that Gruber could be considered an \u201carchitect\u201d of Romneycare, the Massachusetts health care bill passed during then-Gov. Mitt Romney\u2019s term.\n\nRead more at The Daily Caller\n\n", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "12-03-14", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cGFnZTE=", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dcterms.modified": "12-03-14", "og": {"url": "http://nation.foxnews.com/2014/12/03/kathleen-sebelius-jonathan-gruber-who", "site_name": "FoxNation.com", "image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/SebeliusUSAToday.JPG", "type": "article", "title": "Kathleen Sebelius: Jonathan Gruber?
