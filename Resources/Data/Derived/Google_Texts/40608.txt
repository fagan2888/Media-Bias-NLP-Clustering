The Islamic State group claims that it is now in possession of uranium from Mosul University, which it will use in a “dirty bomb.”

“O by the way Islamic State does have a Dirty bomb. We found Radioactive [sic] material from Mosul university,” a member identifying himself as Muslim al-Britani said on Twitter, the Mirror reported Nov. 29. “We’ll find out what dirty bombs are and what they do. We’ll also discuss what might happen if one actually went off in a public area.”

The Sunni radical then ruminated on what would happen if the terrorist group detonated such a bomb in London, saying it would be “be more of a disruptive than a destructive weapon.”

Mohamed Ali Alhakim, the United Nation’s ambassador to Iraq, acknowledged that nuclear material had been stolen from the Mosul University in July.

“These nuclear materials, despite the limited amounts mentioned, can enable terrorist groups, with the availability of the required expertise, to use it separate or in combination with other materials in its terrorist acts,” Mr. Alhakim said at the time, Breitbart reported.
