Many GOP presidential candidates have been criticizing President Obama's national address on the fight against terrorism. Among those candidates is Carly Fiorina, who made stops in eastern Iowa today.

In Waterloo, nearly 100 people gathered to hear her speak, KWWL had a one-on-one interview after.

Carly Fiorina focusing on her blueprint on what she says is how to "take back our country." On her list: securing our border, repealing Obamacare and defeating ISIS.

Regarding the President's approach she says, "Vintage Obama. No leadership, no strategy and managed to get into politics, dissing the Republicans on something...vintage Obama."

During President Obama's national address Sunday night, he called for stricter gun laws, but Fiorina says that's not the answer.

She says, "California has the strictest gun control laws in the nation and it didn't do anything to prevent this tragedy. This is not where he should be focusing his attention, but of course he and Hillary Clinton are always focused on politics and ideologies instead of solving the problem and defeating ISIS."

She says she has a plan.

She says, "The only way to defeat ISIS, ultimately is to deny them territory. Cut off their supply lines, deny them territory. We can do that but it will require leadership, support and resolve on our part in many cases because we cannot simply do this ourselves. We need other nations to help us defeat ISIS."
