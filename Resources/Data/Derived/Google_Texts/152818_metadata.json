Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., says he wants a full review of all FDIC employees involved in Operation Choke Point.\n\nLuetkemeyer, a rising member of the House Financial Services Committee, names five officials as \u201cimplicated in this unsavory affair,\u201d and adds that \u201cto allow these individuals to go without penalty would be unjust.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Signal reported Monday that the secretive initiative, orchestrated by the Justice Department, was the subject of a second scathing investigative report by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The panel\u2019s report reprints emails between various FDIC officials, including those named in Luetkemeyer\u2019s letter.\n\nLuetkemeyer, a leader in the fight to shut down Operation Choke Point, met yesterday with Gruenberg. They discussed details of the House committee\u2019s 20-page report on the FDIC\u2019s efforts to pressure banks into cutting ties with payday lenders and other businesses that the Obama administration finds objectionable.\n\nFDIC officials \u201clied\u201d and \u201cmisled\u201d Congress about the secretive operation, the Missouri Republican says in his letter.\n\n>>> These 7 Emails Show Federal Officials Scheming to Target Legal Businesses\n\nThe FDIC is the primary agency responsible for regulating and auditing more than 4,500 U.S. banks.\n\nIn his meeting with the FDIC chairman, Luetkemeyer summarizes in the letter, he demanded that staffers who participated in Choke Point \u201cbe held accountable\u201d for allowing personal and political views to interfere with the regulatory agency\u2019s responsibilities.\n\nHe writes:\n\nThere is neither doubt nor denial that numerous members of your senior staff have allowed personal and political views to interfere with the important work of the FDIC. Their actions have not only called into question their ability to appropriately carry out their duties, but also have exposed your entire agency to what many of your staff would refer to as significant \u2018reputational risk.\u2019 You must act swiftly to end this unprecedented and, in my opinion, illegal program and send the message that this behavior is inappropriate and will not be tolerated under your leadership.\n\nBy \u201creputational risk,\u201d Luetkemeyer was referring to a list originating within the FDIC that categorizing certain industries as risks to the banking industry. The goal, as part of Operation Choke Point, was to encourage banks to end relationships with customers engaged in those enterprises, choking them off from their financial life blood.\n\nRepublicans have criticized federal regulators and government lawyers under Attorney General Eric Holder for associating legal enterprises such as firearms and ammunition merchants and home-based charities with blatantly illegal or offensive industries such as Ponzi schemes and pornography.\n\n>>> Congressman Seeks to End Program He Calls \u2018More Dangerous\u2019 Than IRS Scandal\n\nOf Monday\u2019s report by the House panel, which unearthed emails between FDIC officials who sought to ensure banks \u201cget the message\u201d about the businesses they don\u2019t like and cut credit or close accounts, Luetkemeyer said yesterday, \u201cour worst fears have been validated.\u201d He added in a statement:\n\nThe report clearly shows that senior members of the FDIC lied to me, to congressional staff, to other members of Congress, and in testimony to several House committees. Not only that, the communications contained in the report show that the FDIC is inserting personal views into banking supervision, which is unethical and completely unacceptable.\n\nLuetkemeyer urges Gruenberg to use his authority to alter and improve the FDIC\u2019s examination process to create more transparency and reign in \u201cvigilante activists.\u201d\n\nHe points Gruenberg to his own legislation that grew out of Operation Choke Point. Called the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act, the bill would prohibit banking regulators from suggesting, requesting or ordering a financial institution to terminate a banking relationship without \u201cmaterial reason.\u201d It states that \u2018reputational risk\u2019 alone is not a reason to order accounts to be terminated.\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Signal, Barbara Hagenbaugh, FDIC\u2019s deputy to the chairman for communications, said:\n\nIt is the FDIC\u2019s policy that insured institutions that properly manage customer relationships are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing services to any customer operating in compliance with applicable law. The FDIC has reiterated this policy to our bank supervisors and we encourage banks to report to FDIC management, the ombudsmen, or the inspector general if they feel this policy is not being followed. The FDIC has a responsibility to cooperate with other government agencies and to ensure that the banks we supervise are adhering to laws, including those governing anti-money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nLuetkemeyer, who previously worked as a bank regulator, said that Congress will not tolerate actions by a federal agency as described in the House report and that he will continue to hold the FDIC accountable.\n\n\u201cThroughout my more than 35 years in the banking industry, I have always had the utmost respect for the FDIC and the manner in which it carries out its mission,\u201d the congressman said in his prepared statement. \u201cThat respect has been greatly diminished.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to include an official FDIC response.\n\nRead the full letter here:\n\nLuetkemeyer Letter to Gruenberg on Operation Choke Point_12 10 2014-1", "article_metadata": {"description": "FDIC staffers should be held accountable for the banking regulatory agency\u2019s \u201cunethical\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d actions against out-of-favor businesses, he says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "FDIC staffers should be held accountable for the banking regulatory agency\u2019s \u201cunethical\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d actions against out-of-favor businesses, he says.", "title": "Congressman Wants FDIC to Pay for \u2018Choking' Businesses", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericasfour732882.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-11T18:45:11+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1wetSJX"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "FDIC staffers should be held accountable for the banking regulatory agency\u2019s \u201cunethical\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d actions against out-of-favor businesses, he says.", "title": "Congressman Wants FDIC to Pay for \u2018Choking' Businesses", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericasfour732882.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "cronyism,executive overreach,executive power", "published_time": "2014-12-10T18:02:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-11T18:45:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "choke point, fdic, operation choke point, Rep.
