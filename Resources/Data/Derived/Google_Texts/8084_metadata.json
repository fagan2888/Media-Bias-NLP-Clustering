We have been blessed with the foolishness to believe we can change the world.\n\nI\u2019m proud to be part of the generation that is known as the \u201csocially minded\u201d generation, but if we say we care about poverty, the wealth gap and equal rights, then we should be particularly concerned about the budget. This week\u2019s budget proposal will set our national priorities for an entire year.\n\nKnow a recent high school graduate? Share this great article with them before they're off to college!\n\n\n\nWe \u201csocially minded\u201d Millennials should care that Congress is suggesting $1.3 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy, while letting go of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, two of the most important federal mechanisms for helping people out of poverty. We should care that Congress is considering significant limitations to SNAP, a program that helps millions of children, seniors, veterans, people with disabilities, jobless adults seeking work, and those working \u2014 often at multiple jobs \u2014 just to make ends meet. We should care that the Medicaid block grant and repealing the Affordable Care Act may cause many people to become uninsured or underinsured. We should care that Congress is trying to increase military spending through a secret fund that doesn\u2019t hit the bottom line, while cutting housing and food for families.\n\nSocially minded Millennials should be up in arms because if the plan is to balance the budget with no additional revenue, then the brunt of cuts will be felt by low- and moderate-income Americans.\n\nAs the budgets are marked up and talk in Congress centers around things like reconciliation, tax reform and balancing, it seems as though we\u2019ve forgotten for whom we make a budget. Where is the talk of people? Where are the congressional hearings on the needs of the human person? It\u2019s as though we\u2019re buying into what Pope Francis calls \u201ca culture of disposal \u2026 where human beings themselves are nowadays considered as consumer goods which can be used and thrown away.\u201d We\u2019ve enslaved ourselves to money, forgetting that \u201cmoney has to serve, not rule.\u201d\n\nAs Millennials, we cannot stand by while Congress attempts to mortgage our vision of the future by balancing the budget on the backs of the poor. We know that fiscal responsibility and social responsibility aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.\n\nThe Gospels teach us why we must care about the budget: For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also (Lk. 12:34). As a nation, we cannot invest solely in the rich while claiming to care about people who are poor. We cannot spout rhetoric of equality while undermining marginalized groups through our \u201cshared\u201d agenda. We cannot pretend that the budget does not reflect our priorities. Where our treasure is, our heart will be also. Let us, the youth together with our parents and grandparents, push for a faithful budget that, as Francis said, \"build[s] a society and an economy where man and his own good, and not money, are at the center.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=4, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Talk of balancing the federal budget by cutting social services is rampant in Congress this week as the Republicans mark up their annual budget proposal.\nThe Gospels teach us why we must care about the budget: For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also (Lk.\nSocially minded Millennials should be up in arms because if the plan is to balance the budget with no additional revenue, then the brunt of cuts will be felt by low- and moderate-income Americans.\nThis week\u2019s budget proposal will set our national priorities for an entire year.\nI\u2019m proud to be part of the generation that is known as the \u201csocially minded\u201d generation, but if we say we care about poverty, the wealth gap and equal rights, then we should be particularly concerned about the budget."}
