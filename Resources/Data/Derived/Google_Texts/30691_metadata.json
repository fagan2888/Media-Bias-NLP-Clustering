Lori of Baltimore.\n\nFew seemed to expect Dolan to use his final address as president the way he did \u2014 yet many said they appreciated the approach.\n\n\"I'm not sure why he chose the topic, but \u2026 that's the reality of what the servants of the church are facing all over the world,\" said Archbishop Jose H. Gomez of Los Angeles. His diocese \u2014 the nation's largest, with 5 million people \u2014 is 70 percent Hispanic, many of its members immigrants from other countries.\n\n\"Many of these people speak from direct experience about religious oppression, and they celebrate the freedoms they enjoy in this country,\" said Gomez, also a candidate among the 10 who could replace Dolan.\n\nDolan laced his remarks with anecdotes of violence directed at Catholic priests and other Christian believers around the world.\n\nHe described a massacre of Iraqi Christians at Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad that left 58 believers dead last year. The \"humanitarian catastrophe\" flowing from this year's bloodshed in Syria has also bred religious persecution, he said. Dolan recounted the stories of two Orthodox bishops who were kidnapped and another who was killed by sniper fire while trying to help individuals wounded in the widespread violence.\n\nIn August, he said, Muslim extremists stormed a school run by Franciscan sisters in Upper Egypt, raping two and parading three others through a crowd as \"prisoners of war,\" and he told of a 2008 massacre in Orissa, India, where \"hundreds of Christians were murdered and thousands displaced.\"\n\nDolan was clear in pointing out that it isn't just Christians who face persecution \u2014 he cited the abuse of certain sects of Muslims at the hands of others, as well as Buddhists in Tibet who face government torture and oppression. But Dolan said he agreed with John Allen of the National Catholic Reporter, a Rome-based journalist and author who has written that \"Christians are singled out in far more places and far more often\"\n\nAllen wrote in his most recent book, \"The Global War on Christians,\" that Christians today \"indisputably form the most persecuted religious body on the planet.\"\n\nThe cause is one close to the heart of Pope Francis, said Dolan, who quoted from a speech the pontiff gave on the subject in September. \"It's important to look beyond one's own fence, to feel oneself part of the Church, of one family of God,\" Pope Francis said.\n\nDolan encouraged the bishops to pray for those who are suffering, to use whatever means they can to publicize the problem and to raise funds for organizations that support the persecuted. He also urged his colleagues to \"cajole political leaders to be more attentive to the voices of Christians on the ground.\"\n\nFor the past two years, the bishops' organization has been vocal in its support of religious liberty in the United States, especially in the aftermath of the Affordable Care Act, which mandates that some Catholic-related institutions pay for contraceptive care.\n\nDolan called that issue \"legitimate,\" but to some in the audience, his address framed the four-day conference by putting the matter in a wider perspective.\n\n\"We in the United States have a level of comfort in expressing our faith,\" said Archbishop Jerome E. Listecki of Milwaukee. \"And we can be insular. Elsewhere in the world, people are offering their lives. ... He's calling us to be Catholic in a broader sense, for our brothers and sisters throughout the world.\"\n\nA previous version of this story incorrectly summarized Dolan's comments about the number of Christians killed in the 20th century because of their faith.\n\njonathan.pitts@baltsun.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Dolan highlights persecution in last address as bishops' leader", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Baltimore Sun", "author": "Baltimore Sun", "og": {"site_name": "baltimoresun.com", "description": "At a time when the nation's top Roman Catholic leaders have been making headlines with their stands on religious liberty and immigration reform, Cardinal Timothy Dolan opened this year's convention of United States Conference of Catholic Bishops by focusing his attention beyond American borders.", "title": "Dolan highlights persecution in last address as bishops' leader", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-cardinal-dolan-address-20131111-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-52817890/turbine/bs-md-cardinal-dolan-address-20131111", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp01.15", "twitter": {"site": "@baltimoresun", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Cardinal Timothy Dolan", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=496681035, app-argument=http://www.baltimoresun.com/deeplinkid/78144341", "fb": {"page_id": 9299179711, "app_id": 310302989040998}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2013-11-11", "Description": "At a time when the nation's top Roman Catholic leaders have been making headlines with their stands on religious liberty and immigration reform, Cardinal Timothy Dolan opened this year's convention of United States Conference of Catholic Bishops by focusing his attention beyond American borders.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Cardinal Timothy Dolan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb8e6\"", "article_summary": "The \"humanitarian catastrophe\" flowing from this year's bloodshed in Syria has also bred religious persecution, he said.\nA previous version of this story incorrectly summarized Dolan's comments about the number of Christians killed in the 20th century because of their faith.\nCiting events in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Nigeria and China, Dolan described \"lethal persecution on a scale that almost defies belief.\"\nAt a time when the nation's top Roman Catholic leaders have been making headlines with their stands on religious liberty and immigration reform, Cardinal Timothy Dolan opened this year's convention of United States Conference of Catholic Bishops by focusing his attention beyond American borders.\nDolan laid out a five-point plan he said the nearly 300 bishops in attendance could carry out in order to help."}
