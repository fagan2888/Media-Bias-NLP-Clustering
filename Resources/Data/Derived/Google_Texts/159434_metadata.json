The event, held Saturday at UM's hospital, aimed to \"stop the sitgma\" of mental illnesses.\n\nPete Earley is a longtime journalist and former Washington Post reporter. His son Kevin was arrested after breaking into a house during a psychotic episode in Virginia. Earley couldn't get his son proper care because Kevin was not deemed an imminent danger to himself or his father. But Kevin was charged with felonies for the break-in.\n\nSo his father started investigating the criminal justice system and how it treats mentally ill people.\n\n\u201cI was so frustrated. Virginia law had kept him from getting help when he needed it, and now it wanted to punish him for a crime he committed when he clearly wasn\u2019t thinking clearly,\u201d Earley said to a packed conference room on Saturday morning.\n\nAt the beginning of his research for his book, Earley tried and failed to gain access to jails and institutions in Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore, New York City and Washington, D.C.\n\nThen he got a call from Judge Steve Leifman of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida, who invited him to inspect the county\u2019s facilities. In 2004, Earley walked onto the ninth-floor psychiatric ward of the Miami-\u00adDade County jail.\n\n\u201cI saw men completely naked in cells,\" Earley said Saturday. \"Cells built for two people had five or six persons in there. Because of a design flaw, the cells were cold.\u201d\n\nThat floor was closed down this earlier this year.\n\nAlejandro Aristizabal works for the Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court\u2019s Criminal Mental Health Project which is aimed at keeping out of jail mentally ill people who commit crimes due to their condition. He says people in those cases are often processed through multiple systems.\n\n\u201cYou could be released from the hospital today on Zyprexa, arrested tomorrow... on Risperdal, and in the community you see a [different] doctor,\" Aristizabal said. \"There are three doctors, three systems seeing you. All three of them have different electronic information systems that definitely don\u2019t talk to each other, and there\u2019s no continuity.\"\n\nAnd it\u2019s that lack of continuity and communication that has meant some people have difficulty leaving the criminal justice system. During Earley\u2019s research in Florida, he discovered a woman who had been arrested for shoving another woman. The assailant made eye contact with the victim at a bus stop and thought she was stealing her thoughts.\n\n\u201cI discovered this woman had been in jail more than three years -- 1,151 days. Now, how can somebody be in jail that long? Because she was being sent back and forth... to be made competent, so she\u2019d never even been brought to trial,\u201d said Earley.\n\nWhile there are still advocates who will point to deficiencies in the approaches to treating the mentally ill, Aristizabal says Miami\u00ad-Dade County has taken more progressive approaches to aiding people with mental illness.\n\nHe says the county has moved away from using structured housing facilities and day programs, going for more individualized plans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to use clubhouses, drop\u00ad-in centers where it\u2019s not preaching at people, it\u2019s not throwing treatment at them, and [it's] more counseling and psychiatry,\" he said. \"It\u2019s actually trying to normalize people with mental illness.\u201d\n\nAristizabal says many of the clubhouses and related facilities are giving their consumers a work-ordered day and socialization skills to increase their employment opportunities, as well as more recreation instead of traditional \"sit down\" therapy.\n\n\u201cIf you can go play some pool, play ping\u00ad pong, do a little exercise, yoga, meditation -- that\u2019s what normal people are doing, so why do we have to segregate the mental health population into doing therapy five days a week?\u201d he asked.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Miami-\u00adDade County has the largest percentage of individuals with serious mental illnesses among all urban areas in the U.S., according to data from the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/mental-health-conference-points-flaws-criminal-justice-system", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201505/404630395.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Miami-\u00adDade County has the largest percentage of individuals with serious mental illnesses among all urban areas in the U.S., according to data from the", "title": "Mental Health Conference Points To Flaws In Criminal Justice System"}, "org_id": 482, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Diego Salda\u00f1a-Rojas", "wordCount": 806, "dc": {"title": "Mental Health Conference Points To Flaws In Criminal Justice System"}, "nid": 10545, "datePublished": "2015-05-06", "story_id": 404518604, "keywords": "mental illness", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In 2004, Earley walked onto the ninth-floor psychiatric ward of the Miami-\u00adDade County jail.\nAnd it\u2019s that lack of continuity and communication that has meant some people have difficulty leaving the criminal justice system.\nSo his father started investigating the criminal justice system and how it treats mentally ill people.\nAlejandro Aristizabal works for the Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court\u2019s Criminal Mental Health Project which is aimed at keeping out of jail mentally ill people who commit crimes due to their condition.\nMiami-\u00adDade County has the largest percentage of individuals with serious mental illnesses among all urban areas in the U.S., according to data from the Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court."}
