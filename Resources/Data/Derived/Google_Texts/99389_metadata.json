The crowd is not as heavy as compared to June and July.\"\n\nAs for Pandolfi, he said he'll keep looking forward to some paradise in the Panhandle all year long.\n\n\"Every time you come down here, you think you've done it all, and you find something else to do,\" Pandolfi said.\n\nSome other nearby destinations ranked in the top 20 by TripAdvisor include Destin, Fort Walton Beach, Miramar Beach, and Seagrove Beach.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new report from TripAdvisor lists Panama City Beach as one of the top 20 affordable destinations during the fall season.
