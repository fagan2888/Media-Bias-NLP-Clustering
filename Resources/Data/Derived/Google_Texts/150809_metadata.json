(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nRegarding the Jan. 3 oped \u201cClimate science denial fading, except with GOP\u201d by Doug O\u2019Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, there is no such thing as \u201cdenying\u201d climate change. Everyone agrees the climate is always changing. The question is: What is man\u2019s contribution?\n\nO\u2019Malley says that \u201cdeniers\u201d are limited to the GOP. Again he is wrong. As an independent, and one with a functioning brain, I tend to think that if the government strongly supports something, then the government is up to something. In other words, follow the money.\n\nWhen Al Gore starts giving global warming lectures for free and gets to his destination in a Prius or a Tesla, I will consider his position. Like Obamacare, climate change is a money grab.\n\nSome pro-climate change politicians, activists and scientists (who stand to lose their funding if they don\u2019t agree) have clamored for laws to jail the \u201cdeniers.\u201d Sounds a lot like the Middle Ages when scientists challenged the \u201cworld is flat\u201d orthodoxy of the day. Truth, on the other hand, needs no law to support it.\n\nWhen it comes to truth, I shall welcome the plant life that has returned to the Sahara Desert for the first time in 10,000 years , and I shall listen to scientists like meteorologists John Coleman and Joe Bastardi, geologist Donald Easterbrook and physicist Ivar Giaever, who is a Nobel laureate. In fact, Giaever has boldly stated that President Barack Obama, much like O\u2019Malley, is dead wrong when it comes to global warm ... er, climate change.\n\nRick Bauer\n\nMount Ephraim\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1UWiAn6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Like Obamacare, climate change is a money grab", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Like Obamacare, climate change is a money grab", "title": "LETTER: Climate change \u2018deniers\u2019 deny man\u2019s contribution", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/01/15/letter-climate-change-deniers-deny-mans-contribution/78866750/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Like Obamacare, climate change is a money grab", "title": "LETTER: Climate change \u2018deniers\u2019 deny man\u2019s contribution", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d0b87eb52df2e848a31138990524ca6b37fad49e/c=122-0-604-482&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/15/AsburyPark/B9320507649Z.1_20160115171414_000_G9PD5I6QK.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "There is no such thing as \u201cdenying\u201d climate change, only questioning man\u2019s contribution to it.\nLike Obamacare, climate change is a money grab.\nIn fact, Giaever has boldly stated that President Barack Obama, much like O\u2019Malley, is dead wrong when it comes to global warm ... er, climate change.\n(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)Regarding the Jan. 3 oped \u201cClimate science denial fading, except with GOP\u201d by Doug O\u2019Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, there is no such thing as \u201cdenying\u201d climate change.\nThe question is: What is man\u2019s contribution?"}
