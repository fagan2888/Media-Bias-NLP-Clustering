Details about once secret programs continue to leak. The Director of National Intelligence has recently declassified additional information, and the President's Review Group has just released its report and recommendations. With all this going on, it's easy to become inured to the breadth and depth of the NSA's activities. But through the disclosures, we've learned an enormous amount about the agency's capabilities, how it is failing to protect us, and what we need to do to regain security in the Information Age. First and foremost, the surveillance state is robust. It is robust politically, legally, and technically. I can name three different NSA programs to collect Gmail user data. These programs are based on three different technical eavesdropping capabilities. They rely on three different legal authorities. They involve collaborations with three different companies. And this is just Gmail. The same is true for cell phone call records, Internet chats, cell-phone location data.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our choice isn&#39;t between a digital world where the agency can eavesdrop and one where it cannot; our choice is between a digital world that is vulnerable to any attacker and one that is secure for all users.", "author": "Bruce Schneier", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Our choice isn&#39;t between a digital world where the agency can eavesdrop and one where it cannot; our choice is between a digital world that is vulnerable to any attacker and one that is secure for all users.", "title": "How the NSA Threatens National Security", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/01/Welch_McCarthy_Hearings-1/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-the-nsa-threatens-our-security/282822/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe07a9\"", "article_summary": "Secret NSA eavesdropping is still in the news.\nOur choice isn't between a digital world where the agency can eavesdrop and one where it cannot; our choice is between a digital world that is vulnerable to any attacker and one that is secure for all users.\nI can name three different NSA programs to collect Gmail user data.\nThe Director of National Intelligence has recently declassified additional information, and the President's Review Group has just released its report and recommendations.\nWith all this going on, it's easy to become inured to the breadth and depth of the NSA's activities."}
