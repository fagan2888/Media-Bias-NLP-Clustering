More than 200 weighed in to grade Obama\u2019s presidency, and they gave him an overall B- or 2.97 grade point average (GPA).\n\nHistory professors from colleges across the United States graded the president in 16 different categories including his relationship with Congress, how he has handled the economy, and his transparency and accountability.\n\n[[nid:1404037]]\n\n\u201cBarack Obama was a promising presidential candidate and possesses sterling personal leadership qualities, but his administration has merely been adequate in delivering results,\u201d HNN (History News Network) described the results to the poll.\n\nWhile Obama\u2019s Supreme Court appointments received an A- grade, historians polled indicated that the president\u2019s transparency and relationship with Congress were areas that needed improvement.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nHe was praised for the Affordable Care Act, the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, the killing of Osama Bin Laden and for ending the Iraq War. Criticism lay in his handling of the economy, his failure to close Guantanamo Bay and drone strikes.\n\nThe poll, which was conducted before the Edward Snowden story broke, also showed a concern over the Obama\u2019s administration\u2019s lack of transparency and the prosecution of Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning.\n\nHNN sent a poll via email to 679 American history professors at 56 top colleges and universities beginning in April. The network received 203 responses and converted the responses to a letter grade on an A-F scale along with a corresponding GPA.\n\nCommunication ability, integrity and crisis management were Obama\u2019s strong suits \u2013 scoring A- in each category.\n\n\u201cMany historians were also disillusioned by the partisan gridlock in Washington, although they tend to place the blame largely on congressional Republicans,\u201d HNN staff wrote. \u201cJust about the only aspect of Barack Obama's presidency which has received universal praise from historians has been the president's Supreme Court appointments. Both Elena Kagan and especially Sonia Sotomayor are highly respected by academics.\u201d\n\nWhat grade would you give the president?
