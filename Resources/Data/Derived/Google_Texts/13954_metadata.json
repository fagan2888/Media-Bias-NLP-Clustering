They said he had discharged a firearm at imaginary persons and harassed them.\n\nDeputies executed a search warrant at Dick\u2019s home Thursday and found an estimated $5,500 worth of alleged stolen property, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nSan Miguel County Court issued a felony warrant for Dick\u2019s arrest Friday on charges of first-degree felony criminal trespass, felony theft, child abuse, prohibited use of a weapon, harassment and criminal mischief.\n\nOn Friday, Dick began calling law enforcement agencies threatening to kill any officers who attempt to approach him, the sheriff\u2019s office said.
