Among the nine communities categorized as high risk \u2013 Roosevelt, Hempstead and Uniondale \u2013 had the highest teen pregnancy rates in the county in 2008.\n\nAccording to the report, teen pregnancy rates in these communities have decreased from 85 to 48 per every 1,000 females between the ages of 15 to 19. This is still, county officials have said, \u201ca pregnancy rate over four times those of the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nRates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis have also decreased by noticeable amounts, in part because of the work done by Planned Parenthood of Nassau County (PPNC), the largest provider of family planning and reproductive healthcare on Long Island.\n\nEducation is essential\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Nassau County runs education programs in three of the communities the Department of Health has labeled as \u201chigh-risk\u201d \u2013 Hempstead, Roosevelt and Westbury. These education programs use nationally tested, evidence-based curriculum. Both Planned Parenthood and Nassau County health reports have shown that since implementation of this curriculum, Roosevelt has seen a 30 percent decline in teen pregnancy and Hempstead a 17 percent decline.\n\nSarah Miller, vice president of Education and Public Affairs at PPNC, has attributed the success of these programs to their focus on women\u2019s empowerment. \u201cIf women don\u2019t have control over their reproductive health and lives then they don\u2019t have control over anything.\u201d\n\nMany of these programs place a special focus on youth and young adults. \u201cFor the most part we are going to be the entry place into the health care system for young women,\u201d said JoAnn Smith, president and CEO of PPNC.\n\nMany of the students from area colleges and universities take advantage of the services Planned Parenthood offers for simple reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper,\u201d said Sarah, a patient of Planned Parenthood student at Hofstra who requested that only her first name be used. \u201cIt\u2019s easy and\u2026they don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d\n\nHealth care access\n\n\n\nThe Nassau County Department of Health reports that access to quality healthcare is expanding, and that is part of the cause of the dramatic shifts in pregnancy and STD rates. However, populations that need to take advantage of these resources often don\u2019t, despite the increased availability.\n\n\u201cHaving no insurance or [being] unable to afford co-pays and deductibles prevents residents from accessing medical treatment\u201d the Nassau County heath report reads. The number of uninsured in the county is estimated to be 14.1 percent, according to the 2014-2017 County Community Health Assessment.\n\nSeveral officials cited the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as an essential component in the strategy to improve women\u2019s health on Long Island. Smith said that the ACA \u201cwill ensure that women will have access to the quality care they need regardless of whether they can afford it or not\u201d. Over 200,000 people have enrolled in the New York State healthcare exchange as part of the roll-out of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPro-life point of view\n\n\n\nNot everyone is sold on the effectiveness of Planned Parenthood\u2019s programs and advocacy. \u201cAs far as I know, Planned Parenthood is offering them an abortion,\u201d said Mary Ziesig, NY State Regent for Catholic Daughters of the Americas, who can often be found in front of the Hempstead PPNC branch protesting the organization\u2019s work. \u201cI come here is because I\u2019m praying that those women\u2026 will have a change of heart. That they might choose life for their child.\u201d Pro-life advocates all across the country have voiced similar concerns over, what they perceive as the expanding power of Planned Parenthood.\n\nAs originally reported in the conservative news blog NewsBusters, groups like Students for Life in America and the Christian Defense Coalition have claimed that the passage of the Affordable Care Act will increase the number of abortions performed in the country and make Planned Parenthood a \u201c$2 billion industry.\u201d\n\nProviding support\n\nSmith called this type of attitude \u201cideological zealotry that is very frightening.\u201d In fact, only nine percent of what Planned Parenthood does in Nassau County is abortion-related. That number is only three percent nationally.\n\n\u201cWe really practice prevention,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWe help our patients practice it. It\u2019s an economic issue\u2026providing preventative healthcare is far less expensive than paying for those medical costs down the road for unintended pregnancies or for breast cancer or for cervical cancers.\u201d\n\nDespite questions about Planned Parenthood\u2019s moral standing, the organization is a useful tool to address very real public health concerns. \u201cThis is not rocket science,\u201d said Gwen O\u2019Shea, the president and CEO of The Health and Welfare Council of Long Island. \u201cHealth care institutions need to be working in partnership with community based organizations\u2026to be able to get patients the care that works for them.\u201d\n\nSarah, a Hofstra University student, is certainly glad to have access to Planned Parenthood. \u201cYou never know what kind of decisions you\u2019re going to make in your life so I feel like I enjoy the fact that it\u2019s there to help me out if I decide to make the wrong decision.\u201d\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 199636866736948}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a0e\"", "article_summary": "According to the newly released 2014-2017 Nassau County Community Health Assessment, STD and teen pregnancy rates in Nassau County\u2019s \u201chigh risk\u201d communities have decreased.\nAmong the nine communities categorized as high risk \u2013 Roosevelt, Hempstead and Uniondale \u2013 had the highest teen pregnancy rates in the county in 2008.\nAccording to the report, teen pregnancy rates in these communities have decreased from 85 to 48 per every 1,000 females between the ages of 15 to 19.\nMany of the students from area colleges and universities take advantage of the services Planned Parenthood offers for simple reasons.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper,\u201d said Sarah, a patient of Planned Parenthood student at Hofstra who requested that only her first name be used."}
