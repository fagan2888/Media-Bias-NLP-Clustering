''There were some fairly big whacks and the intensity was pretty full on from both sides..\n\n''To come out here and win was a really good effort.\n\n''The boys stuck to their structures really well and executed when we had to.''\n\nThe bonus-point victory lifts Royals to 19 points on the table, just one point behind the third-placed Eagles.\n\nA try to Royals blindside flanker Sokai Tai just before half-time levelled the scores at 8-all at the break.\n\nThe Eagles regained their five-point margin early in the second half before Royals scored 21 unanswered points.\n\nEagles No.8 Rutikha Ilolhia crossed for his third try of the afternoon to bring the gap back to nine points, but Royals were able to hang on.\n\nThe Tuggeranong Vikings, which had the bye, remain on top of the table on 28 points ahead of the Queanbeyan Whites (24), which beat Wests 29-17 at Campese Oval.\n\nIn the weekend's other game, Uni-Norths won its second match of the season, holding out Easts 31-28 at Griffith Oval.\n\nJohn I Dent Cup: Uni-Norths bt Easts 31-28 at Griffith Oval.
