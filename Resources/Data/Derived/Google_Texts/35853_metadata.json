REUTERS\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Motorcycle injuries requiring a trip to the hospital have increased in recent years among older male riders, while injury rates for women and younger men haven\u2019t changed, according to a new study from Canada.\n\nThe spike in injuries among men over 45 suggests that more male Baby Boomers are taking to two wheels as a leisure activity, and they may need training and other injury prevention strategies, say the researchers.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised by the extent of the increase in injuries among older men motorcycle riders,\u201d said Mariana Brussoni of the British Columbia Injury Research and Prevention Unit, who led the study published in the BC Medical Journal.\n\nIn British Columbia, \u201cmotorcycle injuries among younger men are actually going down, and they\u2019ve remained stable for women, so it\u2019s only older men that are going up,\u201d she told Reuters Health in an email.\n\nIn the U.S. between 1998 and 2007, according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) statistics, injuries among riders 50 to 59 years old went from 6,000 to 15,000, a 150 percent increase, and among riders over age 60 the number of injuries rose from 2,000 to 8,000, a 300-percent jump.\n\nBrussoni said she and her colleagues wanted to find out whether there was a similar trend among older motorcyclists in British Columbia.\n\n\u201cThe idea is not to get older men off their motorbikes, but rather to make sure everything is being done to help them keep themselves safe when they\u2019re riding,\u201d she said.\n\nThe researchers looked at British Columbia motorcycle injury data from 2001 to 2010 and found that approximately 37 percent of the men who suffered motorcycle-related injuries were between the ages of 45 and 74.\n\nThey also discovered that motorcycle hospitalization rates for men in that age bracket doubled during that period, from 18.4 per 100,000 to 36 per 100,000. In addition, hospitalization costs for older male riders rose by 61 percent, while the hospital costs for younger men didn\u2019t change.\n\nOlder men also had higher rates of internal organ injury but were less likely to suffer injuries such as sprains and strains. Older men were also more likely to be injured while riding in rural areas.\n\nThe study does not delve into why injury rates have gone up among older BC men, but assumes that the number of older men riding motorcycles in general has risen.\n\nThese Baby Boomers may have used motorcycles as inexpensive transportation when they were younger and now see riding as a primarily leisure-time activity, the study team writes in its report.\n\nBrussoni speculates that older men might be finding themselves with more free time due to retirement and their kids leaving home, and more disposable income.\n\n\u201cThey may have ridden motorcycles in their youth, or may have always wanted to, so they go out and buy a motorbike,\u201d she said. \u201cThey could be buying powerful machines that they may not be adequately prepared to handle.\u201d\n\nBrussoni said age-related changes can influence the ability to handle the machines, such as declines in eyesight, reflexes, flexibility and strength.\n\n\u201cTheir bodies are older so when an injury does happen, it is likely to require more time to recuperate than when they were younger,\u201d Brussoni said.\n\nWhen it comes to preventing injuries, Brussoni said older men should obey all traffic rules. \u201cOver and above that, we don\u2019t actually have strongly evidence-based prevention strategies for older men . . . but in general we would recommend getting the right training, wearing the protective gear, and if needed, making sure they\u2019re riding during daylight hours and in good weather,\u201d Brussoni said.\n\nBrussoni added that it's also the responsibility of other vehicles on the road to be aware of motorcycles. \u201cTheir size makes them harder to see and cars need to pay attention and show care too,\u201d Brussoni said.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1EkA0n6 BC Medical Journal, online October 2, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "rising, injuries, among, older, male, motorcyclists, study", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Motorcycle injuries requiring a trip to the hospital have increased in recent years among older male riders.", "title": "Silver Foxes Are Getting Injured On Their Motorcycles", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rising-injuries-among-older-male-motorcyclists-study-307019", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/14/silver-fox-motorcycle.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Motorcycle injuries requiring a trip to the hospital have increased in recent years among older male riders.", "title": "Silver Foxes Are Getting Injured On Their Motorcycles", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rising-injuries-among-older-male-motorcyclists-study-307019", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/14/silver-fox-motorcycle.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/14/silver-fox-motorcycle.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-10-14T16:27:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-14T16:27:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Motorcycle injuries requiring a trip to the hospital have increased in recent years among older male riders."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda977\"", "article_summary": "When it comes to preventing injuries, Brussoni said older men should obey all traffic rules.\nIn addition, hospitalization costs for older male riders rose by 61 percent, while the hospital costs for younger men didn\u2019t change.\n\u201cOver and above that, we don\u2019t actually have strongly evidence-based prevention strategies for older men .\nOlder men also had higher rates of internal organ injury but were less likely to suffer injuries such as sprains and strains.\nIn British Columbia, \u201cmotorcycle injuries among younger men are actually going down, and they\u2019ve remained stable for women, so it\u2019s only older men that are going up,\u201d she told Reuters Health in an email."}
