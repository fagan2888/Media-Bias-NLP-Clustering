Bloomberg, in an interview published Saturday, blasted Democratic mayoral front-runner Bill de Blasio for running a \u201cracist\u201d campaign after posing in a photo with his biracial family, Politico reported.\n\nNew York Magazine\u2019s Chris Smith suggested that Mr. de Blasio \u201chas in some ways been running a class-warfare campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cClass-warfare and racist,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg interrupted.\n\n\u201cRacist?\u201d Mr. Smith asked.\n\n\u201cI mean he\u2019s making an appeal using his family to gain support,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg clarified. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious to anyone watching what he\u2019s been doing. I do not think he himself is racist. It\u2019s comparable to me pointing out I\u2019m Jewish in attracting the Jewish vote. You tailor messages to your audiences and address issues you think your audience cares about.\u201d\n\nThe incumbent was referring to a photo of Mr. de Blasio posing with his wife, Chirlane McCray, who is a black poet and activist, and their two children, Dante and Chiara.\n\n\u201c[Mr. De Blasio\u2018s] whole campaign is that there are two different cities here,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg continued. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never liked that kind of division. The way to help those who are less fortunate is, number one, to attract more very fortunate people. They are the ones that pay the bills. The people that would get very badly hurt here if you drive out the very wealthy are the people he professes to try to help. Tearing people apart with this \u2018two cities\u2019 thing doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. It\u2019s a destructive strategy for those you want to help the most. He\u2019s a very populist, very left-wing guy, but this city is not two groups, and if to some extent it is, it\u2019s one group paying for services for the other. It\u2019s a shame, because I\u2019ve always thought he was a very smart guy.\u201d\n\nMr. de Blasio said he was surprised to learn of the mayor\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s exactly what he said, it\u2019s obviously inappropriate and I\u2019m surprised to hear him say it,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of my family. I\u2019m very proud of each and every member of my family and the way that they have handled themselves in a very difficult campaign.\u201d\n\nMrs. de Blasio took to Twitter on Saturday: \u201c@MikeBloomberg, enough of the patriarchal thinking. I am not property or a tool to be used or controlled. Stop the sexism!\u201d\n\nNew Yorkers take to the polls Tuesday for the Democratic primary. If no candidate obtains 40 percent of the vote, a runoff between the top two finishers will be held on Oct. 1. A Quinnipiac University poll published last week had Mr. de Blasio at 43 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York City Mayor Michael R.
