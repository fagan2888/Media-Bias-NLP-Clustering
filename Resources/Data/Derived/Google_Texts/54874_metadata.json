On Friday, the challenger barely landed a punch in the first four rounds as Lara snuck in quick combinations throughout the 154-pound fight.\n\nThe southpaw knocked down the 35-year old Rodriguez with a left jab near the end of the sixth round and had Rodriguez against the ropes in the eighth.\n\nRodriguez (28-8-4) was no match for the quicker Cuban. Rodriguez mocked Lara after taking several punches in the 12th round, motioning that Lara couldn\u2019t knock him out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never a comfortable feeling leaving it up to the judges. I\u2019d like to win every round and get the knockout if possible, but at least I got the win tonight,\u201d Lara said.\n\nLara was coming off a unanimous decision over Ishe Smith in December.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to sit down with my team. The future is clear. We want the best. We want Floyd Mayweather. We want Miguel Cotto. We want Gennady Golovkin at 160 pounds,\u201d Lara said.\n\nOn the undercard, Artur Beterbiev (9-0) stopped Alexander Johnson (16-3) in the seventh round of a 175-pound light-heavyweight match. The 30-year old Russian has won all nine of his fights by knockout.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Erislandy Lara wins in unanimous decision over Delvin Rodriguez", "title": "Erislandy Lara wins in unanimous decision over Delvin Rodriguez", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/13/erislandy-lara-wins-in-unanimous-decision-over-delvin-rodriguez/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150613_092615_erislandy-lara.jpg", "height": 461}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150613_092615_erislandy-lara.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-13T09:24:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T18:06:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc99\"", "article_summary": "CHICAGO \u2014 Erislandy Lara defended his WBA world super welterweight title with a unanimous 12-round decision over Delvin Rodriguez on Friday night.\nAfter another convincing win, Lara has his sights set on the best pound-for-pound boxers in the world.\nLara was coming off a unanimous decision over Ishe Smith in December.\nRodriguez mocked Lara after taking several punches in the 12th round, motioning that Lara couldn\u2019t knock him out.\nThe southpaw knocked down the 35-year old Rodriguez with a left jab near the end of the sixth round and had Rodriguez against the ropes in the eighth."}
