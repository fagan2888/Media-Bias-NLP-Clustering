HOUSTON — Thousands of law enforcement officers stood at attention to form a wall Friday outside one of Houston’s largest churches as a 21-gun salute and flyover by police helicopters were carried out in honor of a slain sheriff’s deputy.

The symbolic gestures followed the funeral for Harris County Sheriff’s Deputy Darren Goforth, who was gunned down at a gas pump a week ago.

Goforth, 47, was in uniform when he was killed while putting fuel in his patrol car. A 30-year-old Houston man is charged with capital murder. Investigators are still trying to determine a motive.
