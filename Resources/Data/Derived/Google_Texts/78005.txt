Former President Bill Clinton clarified some tough comments he made about the Affordable Care Act earlier this month, vowing that there was no ill will attached.

In a Tuesday interview with CNN Espanol, Clinton explained that he was fully behind President Barack Obama's health care efforts.

"I was trying to be supportive of him," Clinton said. "I don't think you can find anybody in America who's worked harder for his reelection or supported this bill or went out of his way to explain the bill to the American people more than I did."

Clinton was referencing comments he made in mid-November, a few days after Obama apologized to Americans who were seeing health care plans canceled as a result of the law's launch. Clinton challenged Obama to honor his words to the American people that their insurance would not be lost in the process.

"I personally believe, even if it takes changing the law, the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got," Clinton told OZY TV.

Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) jumped all over that comment, accusing Clinton of distancing himself from the president on behalf of his wife, Hillary.

“That was certainly revealing, and it suggests perhaps that Hillary Clinton is looking to run away from President Obama and Obamacare," Cruz said the following day. "And that ought to be a signal to Democrats. This thing isn’t working."

In a press conference hours after the Nov. 12 Clinton interview emerged, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that Obama agreed. Two days later, the president announced a fix that would allow the sale of canceled individual health insurance policies to existing customers.
