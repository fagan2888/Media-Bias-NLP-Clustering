Paonia junior Bo Pipher added to his family’s accomplishments on Saturday.

The 138-pounder won his second straight state title with a pinfall on Baca County’s J.D. Chenoweth in one minute, 43 seconds during the Class 2A 138-pound final at the Pepsi Center. The victory is the seventh state wrestling title in the Pipher family. His father, Andy, uncle Clint and cousin Charlie all were state champions. His uncle Chuck won two with Hotchkiss in 1983 and 1984.

Pipher finished the season with a 47-0 record, which ties for eighth-most all-time according to Colorado High School Activities Association records.
