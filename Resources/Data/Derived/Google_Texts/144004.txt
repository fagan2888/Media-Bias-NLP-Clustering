If you live in the San Francisco Bay Area, you can be forgiven for thinking the self-driving car of the future is now.

Google’s robot Priuses and Lexuses are common sights around the search giant’s Silicon Valley headquarters, and here in my hometown of Berkeley one occasionally catches a glimpse of a Google engineer’s self-driving Lexus SUV– the spinning laser on the roof is the giveaway–heading off to work.

A report released today, however, brings George Jetson back Earth. Yes, self-driving cars will be an estimated $87 billion market by 2030, according to Lux Research prognosticator Cosmin Laslau. But even by then, Google-like autonomous cars will only account for 8 percent of the automotive market, according to the report.

Laslau labels such cars “Level 3” vehicles—capable of operating autonomously with the aid of high-resolution maps and other technology but still in need a human in the seat as a backup system. What he calls Level 4 cars are so completely autonomous that automakers can do away with steering wheels and pedals. Those cars won’t even exist 20 years from now. (Note that this is a different level-based schema from the one employed by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.)

Lux has no doubt robot cars are coming down the road but in 2030 the highways will be jammed with Level 2 cars that boast technology already showing up today: adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and collision avoidance braking. More than half of cars will offer such features by 2020, and a decade later 92 percent of cars will roll off the assembly line able to operate semi-autonomously.
