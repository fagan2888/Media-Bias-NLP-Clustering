Quad-C Backs Inmark, as Packaging Deals Heat Up

CCL Industries, WestRock and Charter Next have all made recent purchases in the sector

Middle-market private equity firm Quad-C has made an investment in Inmark Packaging. The target is in line with Quad-C’s core sectors, which are packaging, specialty distribution and healthcare, the company says.

Charlottesville, Virginia-based Quad-C’s earlier deals in the packaging sector includes Technimark, which it sold to fellow PE firm Pritzker Group Private Capital in April 2014. Terms of the Inmark purchase have not been disclosed.

Atlanta, Georgia,-based Inmark serves customers in North America, Europe and Asia. Its sweet spot is rigid container packaging; the company designs and distributes life sciences packaging solutions for specimen transport, temperature-controlled and dangerous goods applications. Inmark also offers online dangerous goods regulatory compliance training.

Also, in December, paper distributor WestRock Co. (NYSE: WRK) announced plans to acquire the packaging division of Cenveo Inc.’s (NYSE: CVO) packaging division and Charter Nex Films Inc. purchased plastic film maker Optimum Plastics Inc..
