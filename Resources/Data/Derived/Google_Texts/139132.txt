An American Airlines flight from San Francisco to New York was forced to make an emergency landing in Kansas City on Sunday afternoon because an electronic device thought potentially to be a bomb was found on board, authorities said.

Upon landing, the plane carrying 215 passengers and nine crew members was moved to a remote area of the airport where the jet was evacuated and searched, officials said.

The device found on the JFK-bound 767 was initially described to NBC News by a senior law enforcement official as a "flash drive."

Later, senior government officials said the device was taped to part of the bathroom.

An preliminary inspection of the device showed it was actually a camera disguised as a flash drive, the officials said.

Security officials, including the FBI in Kansas City, were working to determine who the device belongs to.

No injuries related to the incident were reported.
