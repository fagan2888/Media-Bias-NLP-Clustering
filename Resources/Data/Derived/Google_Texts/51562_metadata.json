The 2014 cycle was a test run of sorts \u2014 with the group spending more than $10 million on a slate of candidates ostensibly united only in their belief in curbing the influence of big donors, lobbyists and money in the political system.\n\nIt was money down the drain.\n\nSenate hopefuls Rick Weiland and Greg Orman and House candidates Paul Clements, Staci Appel and Rep. Carol Shea-Porter \u2014 all lost, despite Mayday\u2019s much-touted, high-profile investments in those races. The setbacks across the country on Tuesday follow on the heels of a loss in the New Hampshire primary, when Mayday PAC backed a losing GOP challenger to Scott Brown. In the only race where Mayday PAC backed a winner \u2014 supporting Republican Rep. Walter Jones\u2019 in North Carolina \u2014 it was hard-pressed to claim credit, since Jones\u2019 reelection to a safe GOP seat was all-but assured without outside help....\n\n[Harvard Professor Larry] Lessig [figurehead of the PAC] did not respond to multiple phone calls from POLITICO in the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s election. That\u2019s a marked change from earlier, when he and his allies assiduously courted media coverage \u2013 to great effect.\n\nA PR firm representing Lessig declined requests to make him available and sent this statement from him: \u201cIt was a tough night across the board for supporters of reform, but we\u2019re glad we engaged in this fight. We feel confident that we made progress and we\u2019re collecting and examining data over the next couple of days that can illustrate the impact that Mayday achieved in our races. The fight to root out corruption in our politics is one of the most important in our time and we will continue to pursue it with fierce urgency.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Perfectly lovely irony reported in Politico today: Mayday PAC burst onto the political scene in the spring of 2014 with grandiose designs to elect a pro-campaign", "title": "Oh the Irony!
