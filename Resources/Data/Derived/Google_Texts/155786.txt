Coralville, IA

Police have charged an eastern Iowa man with murder in the shooting death of a woman at a shopping mall in Coralville.

Coralville police said they arrested 22-year-old Alexander Matthew Kozak, of North Liberty, on Friday night and charged him with first-degree murder.

Kozak is accused of shooting a 20-year-old woman at Coral Ridge Mall earlier Friday. The woman, whose name hasn't been released, died at an Iowa City hospital.

Soon after the shooting near the mall's food court, officers spotted Kozak's car on Interstate 80 near Davenport and arrested him without incident.

It wasn't clear if Kozak has an attorney who could comment on his arrest.
