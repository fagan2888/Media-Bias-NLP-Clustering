The overall goal is to improve that to two weeks.\n\nRetired Navy veteran Robin Werner was among those attending Tuesday night. With her she carried years of documentation showing as early as 2009 her doctors suspected she had a gallbladder problem. While they ordered her to have surgery in February of this year, it was not actually performed until May.\n\n\u201cI spent February, March, April, May in complete and severe pain at home,\u201d Werner said. \u201cThe VA used up every second of my vacation time. My sick time. Every bit of time.\u201d\n\nOne Vietnam veteran also pushed the panel of VA leaders for what they were doing about surgical wait times. He recounted his story of having to use private insurance to get his operation.\n\n\"I was scheduled for my second hip replacement in November 2012. When I did not hear anything, I called back,\u201d the veteran said. \u201cAt that time I spoke to a nurse. And at that time she told me I was 343 on the wait list.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re responding aggressively,\u201d Bridges told the crowd, detailing how the hospital now has more operating rooms and evening surgical hours. If it takes longer than three months to schedule a surgery, Bridges says the patient is sent to a non-military hospital.\n\nA couple of injured combat veterans who were also medical professionals complained about having a difficult time actually gaining employment at the VA hospital.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing anything to hire vets?\u201d the Afghanistan veteran asked.\n\nMcKee and Bridges said they would look into the concerns. But many attending said that is the typical response, not usually backed up with action. A number of female veterans also voiced similar complaints about sexist treatment.\n\n\u201cAre you going to allow women vets' voices to be heard?\u201d one veteran asked.\n\nBridges told the women the hospital is in the process of building a women-only treatment center to meet their concerns.\n\nAlthough there were many veterans who voiced their concerns about the organization, just as many gave the facility compliments at Tuesday's meeting.\n\nOne Vietnam veteran, who struggled for years with Agent Orange complications, called the Madison VA hospital a life saver.\n\n\"It's not what you've been hearing,\" he said of the news coverage.\n\nAnother Vietnam veteran complimented the staff saying, \u201cYou guys call before I get home. That\u2019s the VA here.\u201d\n\nWerner, who is the hospital\u2019s happy groundskeeper, is quickly recovering from her gallbladder surgery, even though she feels she should have had the operation five years ago. Now, she's hoping there are no scheduling complications for her upcoming bypass surgery in October.\n\n\"It does take a warrior to ask for help,\u201d Werner says. \u201cI would expect in return I'd be treated as someone who'd ask for help. Kindness. Compassion.
