Fire crews from the United States were keeping an eye on a brush fire burning just south of the Mexican border on Saturday, March 5, according to the Cochise County Sheriff's Office.

The fire is about four miles south of the U.S. town of Palominas, which is about a mile north of the border, said Carol Capas, a CCSO spokeswoman.

It's to the south of Sierra Vista, she said.
