The bartender started talking about the players she had met, mentioning in particular a pitcher who was \u2014 her words, not mine \u2014 \u201ctall, very good looking and polite.\u201d\n\nWhile I was trying to figure out who she was talking about, she mentioned that this certain pitcher came in with another guy who had a thick, dark goatee. She was talking about Todd Helton, of course, whose best buddy was Matt Belisle.\n\nThe bartender was quite smitten with Belisle, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to marry him some day. He\u2019s such a gentleman.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch a gentleman?\u201d When\u2019s the last time you heard that expression? When\u2019s the last time you heard that expression in the realm of sports?\n\nOK, maybe somebody used it to describe Derek Jeter, who plays his final game for the Yankees on Sunday at Boston\u2019s Fenway Park.\n\n\u201cGentleman\u201d seems to have become a forgotten word, but it perfectly describes two men who will likely play their final game in a Rockies uniform Sunday afternoon at Dodger Stadium.\n\nBelisle, a righty reliever, has been with the Rockies for six seasons; outfielder Michael Cuddyer for three. These are two men who cherish the game and respect their teammates; two men who recognize they are blessed with rare athletic gifts; two men who never take being a big-leaguer for granted. They work their tails off every day they come to the ballpark.\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough season for both, but never once have they been rude to the media, made excuses or dodged questions.\n\nBelisle had been a Colorado workhorse, averaging just more than 79 innings pitched per year from 2010-13. But the workhorse broke down this season. Belisle\u2019s fastball lost velocity and his breaking ball lost its bite. As a result, Belisle\u2019s ERA shot up to 5.03 entering Friday and he lost his role as a primary weapon in the bullpen. In retrospect, the Rockies made a big mistake in picking up his $4.2 million option.\n\nEarly in the season, after giving up a crucial home run in an 11-inning loss to San Francisco, Belisle shouldered the blame and said, \u201cMy challenge, to get past this and do my job for my teammates. It is my job and I understand that, and I have to get results.\u201d\n\nHis professionalism in the wake of personal failure was refreshing.\n\nCuddyer entered the weekend hitting .335 with 10 homers, despite playing in just 47 games. Cuddyer, 35, has missed significant time this season, the result of a fractured left shoulder socket and two hamstring injuries.\n\nHard-core baseball fan will tell you Cuddyer\u2019s three-year, $32.5 contract was a mistake. The critics point to Cuddyer\u2019s limited range as an outfielder and injury-marred seasons in 2012 and 2014. The criticism has validity.\n\nBut the number crunchers don\u2019t see Cuddyer\u2019s presence in the clubhouse \u2014 organizing fantasy football leagues and NCAA pools, playing cards with anybody and everybody in spring training. He\u2019s a catalyst that can make a good team great.\n\nAs manager Walt Weiss has said more than once: \u201cIf a young player wants to understand how to be a pro, I tell them to watch \u2018Cuddy\u2019 and do what he does.\u201d\n\nWeiss wants Cuddyer to return, though the Rockies\u2019 economic realities make that unlikely. Perhaps Cuddyer will return to the American League and thrive as a designated hitter and part-time first baseman/outfielder.\n\nLook, I know it\u2019s been a lousy season for Rockies fans and players. There hasn\u2019t been much good to cheer about \u2014 or to write about. But Belisle and Cuddyer held their heads high and were true pros.\n\nSo, in case I don\u2019t get to tell them in person, thank you, gentlemen.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Saunders: Rockies\u2019 Matt Belisle, Michael Cuddyer ooze class in lost season", "title": "Saunders: Rockies\u2019 Matt Belisle, Michael Cuddyer ooze class in lost season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/26/saunders-rockies-matt-belisle-michael-cuddyer-ooze-class-in-lost-season/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140302__Matt-Belislep1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140302__Matt-Belislep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-26T14:34:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:24:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe180e\"", "article_summary": "Belisle, a righty reliever, has been with the Rockies for six seasons; outfielder Michael Cuddyer for three.\nCuddyer, 35, has missed significant time this season, the result of a fractured left shoulder socket and two hamstring injuries.\nLook, I know it\u2019s been a lousy season for Rockies fans and players.\nShe was talking about Todd Helton, of course, whose best buddy was Matt Belisle.\nIt\u2019s been a rough season for both, but never once have they been rude to the media, made excuses or dodged questions."}
