Hunter shot, injured during state pheasant stocking



The head of the state Fish and Game Department has issued an emergency order for later this week, barring hunters from discharging firearms at pheasant stocking sites statewide, after one hunter shot and wounded another on Friday.

..

The order is effective from 7 a.m. until noon on Thursday and Friday, the last two days that Fish and Game will be stocking ring-necked pheasants this year.



Glenn Normandeau, executive director of the agency, said the hunting accident happened Friday morning in the Army Corps of Engineers Pemigewasset flood zone north of Franklin. He said a Fish and Game stocking crew was still in the area after releasing birds, and witnessed the shooting.

..

The victim suffered a non-life-threatening injury when he was hit in the side of the head by “a (shotgun) pellet or two,” Normandeau said. The shooter apparently was aware of the accident but left the scene, he said.

..

Normandeau said witnesses got a license plate number for the hunter's vehicle and he expects charges will be filed.



As soon as he heard about the incident on Friday, Normandeau said, he asked Fish and Game's legal counsel for advice and then issued the emergency order. “I've had enough,” he said. “This is not an isolated incident.”

..

In some cases, Fish and Game biologists have been in the process of releasing pheasants from their wooden crates, Normandeau said.



“They're still putting birds out and people are blasting away,” he said. “It just needs to come to an end.”

..

Such incidents have happened in the past, he said, but this hunting season seems to be worse than usual.



“It just seems like for some reason this year, people are out there just sort of waiting for the stocking truck to show up,” he said. “We appear to be having a bunch of people too anxious to be the first to get one.”

..

“I'm concerned about the public generally, but I'm especially concerned about our own folks and somebody getting hurt.”



Normandeau said the emergency order applies only to this week. But he said he plans to seek a permanent solution when Fish and Game undertakes its biennial rulemaking process in the spring.

..

“I expect we're going to have a serious discussion and probably permanently design something where on stocking days you can't hunt,” he said. “There shouldn't be any hunting going on when we're out there.”

..

Normandeau said this is not a new issue. He found a study dating back to 1949, “which illustrates that these same problems were going on back then.”



“They go away for a while. Then they raise their ugly head again.”

..

Pheasant hunting season continues through Dec. 31 in New Hampshire. A total of 12,200 ring-necked pheasants are being released this year at 70 sites in 46 towns, according to Fish and Game.
