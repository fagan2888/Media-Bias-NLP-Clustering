There was inspirational agreement as to \u201cwhat the world needs now.\u201d\n\nThe sponsor of SJR 39, Sen. Bob Onder of St. Charles, argued that Missouri needed more religious freedom. He proposed a constitutional amendment that would have allowed legal discrimination toward same-sex couples by some individuals and broadly defined \u201creligious institutions.\u201d He especially sought to create a right for those who work in wedding-connected industries (bakers, photographers, florists, etc.) to refuse to sell their services to same-sex couples.\n\nYou must login to view the full content on this page.

Rep. Jack Bondon, a \u201cyes\u201d vote, made this point eloquently and strongly, saying the General Assembly must be able to discuss difficult issues \u201cwithout demeaning and demagoguery.\u201d He closed by saying what matters most is that you \u201clove your neighbor.\u201d\n\nWe strongly endorse a politics of love. We need more loyalty, the kind of love that stands by the loved one when disagreements emerge, continuing to respect and trust.\n\nFreedom, liberty and independence are fine, but they are not a sufficient foundation for a nation. For every flag proclaiming \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me,\u201d we need a flag that says \u201cJoin, Or Die\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Franklin\u2019s famous cartoon showing how essential it was for the American colonies to join to fight together. Loyalty is as important as freedom.\n\nMany same-sex spouses have religious convictions as deep and sincere as those of Sen. Onder\u2019s dissenting baker \u2014 and belong to churches that honor their marriages. That is the beauty and the challenge of living in these United States.\n\nSJR 39 divorced liberty from love, independence from interdependence. We are glad that SJR 39 failed in the end (in a 6-6 tie) because it ignored the necessity for us to coexist amicably in spite of deep-seated differences.\n\nWe need laws that do a better job of balancing freedom and loyalty. We especially need the respectful and thorough periods of study and discussion that Rep. Bondon has recommended.\n\nWe hope to see the politics of love break forth in 2016 electoral campaigns and the 2017 legislative session of the Missouri General Assembly. A great place for the kind of respectful and thoughtful discussion that Rep. Bondon has endorsed is the income guidelines for our Medicaid program. What does it mean to love our neighbor when more than 300,000 low-wage workers in Missouri cannot afford an insurance plan through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace but also make more than $300 per month so cannot get into Medicaid?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"site": "@columbiatribune", "image": {"src": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.comhttp://www.columbiatribune.com/tu-a-lovemug-jpg/image_02bbeea0-8e22-50eb-9ca5-848906c3ec13.html", "height": 379, "width": 250}, "description": "Something truly remarkable happened in Jefferson City last week as the House Committee on Emerging Issues moved toward a vote on Senate Joint Resolution 39 \u2014 SJR 39.
