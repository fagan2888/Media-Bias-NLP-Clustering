And if Ted Cruz has to suffer, he thinks his supporters should, too.\n\nIn a strange fundraising solicitation sent out by email Wednesday night, the Republican senator from Texas enumerated all the terrible things that go along with seeking the highest office in the land, as part of a pitch to get \u201ccourageous conservatives\u201d to \u201cmake tough sacrifices\u201d \u2013 basically, sending him money.\n\nRelated: The NY Times Just Made Marco Rubio a Middle Class Hero\n\n\u201cYou see, running for President of the United States is a significant sacrifice,\u201d Cruz writes. \u201cOnly through prayer and many late night discussions with my wife, family, and closest friends did I make THE decision.\u201d\n\nThe Cruz logo: Turns out it\u2019s not a flame; it\u2019s a teardrop\n\nThen, he goes into specific details about just how difficult his life has become since he decided to declare his candidacy. It\u2019s really worth quoting in full, but first: cue the violin, and pass the Kleenex.\n\nTime with my family \u201cSpending almost every day on the campaign trail or fighting on the Senate floor means precious little time spent with my wife, Heidi, and my daughters -- the very family that gives me the motivation and drive to fight.\u201d\n\nHealth and sleep: \u201cMy runoff campaign for the Senate in 2012 took a toll, but now I'm sacrificing even more sleep with long nights and constant travel. And the pizza diet is a staple on the campaign trail.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Battle that Will Define This Congress Begins\n\nFinances: \u201cThe cost of campaigning back and forth across the country for president is increasingly expensive, but Heidi and I are willing to invest our livelihoods into this sacrifice.\n\nPersonal time: \u201cYou think of this the least, but as a candidate, my days are no longer my own. Days start before dawn and many times don't end until early the next morning. There is almost no personal time when you run for president.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've chosen to sacrifice part of mine and my families (sic) lives to run for President -- but I think you will agree with me that the sacrifice is well worth it.\u201d\n\nCruz, currently scuffling along in the second tier of Republican candidates, added a note of urgency to the appeal, because candidates are reaching the end of the second quarter reporting period and want to show the best fundraising numbers they can to create a sense of momentum. \u201cTime is critical,\u201d he writes.\n\nRelated: Chafee, with Guns Blazing, Calls Hillary Unfit to Be President\n\nThe message id signed \u201cFor liberty, Ted Cruz\u201d but it doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nApparently concerned that he hadn\u2019t stressed just how much he is giving up to run for president, Cruz throws in a post-script: \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to make some steep, necessary sacrifices in our fight to restore America. Will you join me with your gift of $250 or $100? OR if $35 or $10 is a stretch gift for you, I will be grateful for every dollar you can sacrifice and will ensure it is faithfully used.\u201d\n\nMaybe on a new consultant to review email fundraising letters\u2026\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Ted Cruz\u2019s latest fundraising missive is an odd combination of a lengthy wallow in self-pity combined with a guilt-trip-based plea for his supporters to make sacrifices like he is.", "title": "Ted Cruz Throws Himself a Pity Party", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/11/Ted-Cruz-Throws-Himself-Pity-Party", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/03252015_Cruz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/11/Ted-Cruz-Throws-Himself-Pity-Party", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/03252015_Cruz.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Ted Cruz\u2019s latest fundraising missive is an odd combination of a lengthy wallow in self-pity combined with a guilt-trip-based plea for his supporters to make sacrifices like he is.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: The NY Times Just Made Marco Rubio a Middle Class Hero\u201cYou see, running for President of the United States is a significant sacrifice,\u201d Cruz writes.\nRelated: Chafee, with Guns Blazing, Calls Hillary Unfit to Be PresidentThe message id signed \u201cFor liberty, Ted Cruz\u201d but it doesn\u2019t end there.\nApparently concerned that he hadn\u2019t stressed just how much he is giving up to run for president, Cruz throws in a post-script: \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to make some steep, necessary sacrifices in our fight to restore America.\nAnd if Ted Cruz has to suffer, he thinks his supporters should, too.\nDays start before dawn and many times don't end until early the next morning."}
