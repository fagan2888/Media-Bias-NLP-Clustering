Let me quote some of them:\n\nThe Trans Pacific Trade Agreement is to the advantage of China: China is not part of it.\n\nDon't arm ISIS: we actually don't\n\nWe are losing jobs by the thousands: the job creation last month was 271,000 and 26 months of increase\n\nWe need to deport 11 million immigrants and build a wall: the U.S. does not have the money, the forces and the ability to deport 11 million people\n\nWe will reduce our debt and reduce taxes: it is an arithmetic contradiction\n\nObamacare is bankrupting companies: there is not one single company that got bankrupt because of Obamacare\n\nThe Iran deal is the worst ever signed: companies support it\n\nBanks have higher concentration of risks: the Dodd Frank has actually reduced the risk\n\nRegulation needs to be repelled: back to 2008?\n\nWe should have a policy not to allow banks to expand: the Republicans do not want an antitrust regulation\n\nCompanies cannot get loans: they are not in need of loans because of the low growth\n\nThe Federal Reserve crashed asset prices: they supported assets and bailed banks out by an amount of 4 trillion\n\nIt is symptomatic that the debate cannot build a consensus between Republicans on any of those issues. On the key economic issues I have not found any agreement on tax rates, immigration, indebtedness, regulation, job creation, international trade, the Federal Reserve or the IRS.\n\nIt was a competition for outrageous statements. But more worryingly, it was the worse collection of incompetent statements.\n\nGod protects us from such appalling bunch of candidates.\n\nFollow Georges Ugeux on Twitter: www.twitter.com/Ugeux\n\nMore: Presidential Election", "article_metadata": {"description": "The debate of the Gross Obstructive Party has shown an appalling view of the Republican candidates' ignorance of basic economics.
