But what began as a simple game of chicken between the White House and the Republican opposition has quickly morphed into a game of political Russian roulette.\n\nA nation polarized, stuck in the ultimate political gridlock imaginable over federal spending. As America waits for a resolution to the federal government shutdown, an unlikely community has decided to put their money where their mouth is. By all accounts, they are the most under-appreciated industry in today\u2019s America. Truck drivers are the backbone of the American economy. Everything Americans own, buy and need is delivered to them by trucks daily, yet few take any notice of the people behind the wheels. That could all change after this weekend, as America gets a taste of its first-ever diesel-driven flash mob.\n\nAccording the organizers at RideForTheConstitution.org, over 3,000 truckers, thousands more demonstrators on foot, have already RSVP\u2019d to converge on the nation\u2019s capital starting this Friday, Oct 11th, as they plan to slow traffic into Washington DC, and present a list of demands to law makers there.\n\n\u201cSomebody had to do it,\u201d explained Zeeda Andrews, a former country singer and Mac Truck spokesmodel. Organizers have been surprised by the amount of support they\u2019ve gathered since their campaign gained visibility last month.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be this big. Maybe that\u2019s because the American people are just fed up. It\u2019s more than just a trucking issue now, we are in a constitutional crisis and something has to be done, and it\u2019s common people like myself - with nothing to lose, who are going to get something done.\u201d\n\nConsidering the fact that most people have never sat in the cab of an 18 wheeler in their life, the DC truckers have somehow managed to attract a pretty wide appeal. Already, parallel protests have sprung up, set to take place in most major US cities on Friday and Saturday.\n\nLarry Klayman, a former US Justice Department prosecutor, and founder of Freedom Watch, has also volunteered his support for the DC truckers\u2019 campaign. This past summer Klayman represented the families of Navy SEAL Team 6 who were killed when their Chinook helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan in August 2011, following the White House\u2019s rather incredible raid on the alleged bin Laden lair in Abbotabad, Pakistan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m throwing my support behind this campaign because we\u2019ve have had enough. Our government has broken away from the people, and our grievances are not being heard, so we need to get out there and make it clear to the powers that be that be - whether it\u2019s President Obama, Speaker of the House John Boehner, or whether it\u2019s majority leader Harry Reid in the Senate - that we are simply not going to take it anymore. The time has come to save our country, and we\u2019ll do it in the style of Ghandi, Lech Walesa, and Martin Luther King\u201d, said Klayman.\n\nPolitical demands\n\nOrganisers will join Klayman today at the steps of the US Capitol building to present their list of demands. At the top of that list is an appeal for economic survival, with a call for immediate action on the spiralling cost of diesel and harassment from federal regulatory agencies which is not only driving up costs of goods and services, but also killing transportation profits, pushing independent truckers into fuel poverty, and ultimately out of business.\n\n\n\nBeyond this emerges a broader spectrum movement of political dissent, which echoes concerns heard from many different quarters in the US.\n\n\n\nAs far as civil disobedience goes, their protest is no walk in the park. Logistically speaking, it\u2019s a nightmare. Then there\u2019s the political demands, which, in terms of the average Americans\u2019 attention deficit disorder, are comprehensive, and not exactly \u2018media friendly\u2019 \u2013 especially for the likes of MSNBC and FOX. But unlike the much celebrated, but highly ineffective Occupy Movement, which ended up being a controlled street party whose indelible mark on society was that it produced a boiled down abstract of class warfare \u2013 \u2018The 1% vs. the 99%\u2019 - the DC Truckers have a fairly sharp libertarian agenda, coupled with a detailed list of constitutional demands.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been hiding in a bunker lately, you would know that something is serious brewing in America. In the last year alone, \u2013 the White House has been dodging and fighting to stave off a seemingly endless daisy chain of scandals. In addition to the Navy SEAL Team 6 cover-up, there is a not-so-small issue of the White House using the IRS to target the President\u2019s political opponents, the horrific Benghazi cover-up involving a dead US Ambassador and servicemen, and gun-running from Libya to Syria, and the US support of al Qaeda fighters in Syria.\n\nIn addition to these and other federal interventions hurting truckers' livelihoods, the campaign feels that all unconstitutional federal laws and agencies should be wiped from the books. They include the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Transport Security Agency (TSA), and The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).\n\nUS talk radio host Pete Santilli has volunteered to help the truckers get their message out over the airwaves.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the list of demands, regardless of where you are in the political spectrum, you would not disagree with: stop supporting al Qaeda (in Syria), don\u2019t raise the debt ceiling \u2013 and threaten us - that if we don\u2019t print another trillion dollars that they\u2019ll collapse out system \u2013 that\u2019s a forceful means to steal money from us. President Obama needs to be held accountable for crimes committed against the United States and Congress needs to hear those crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe beauty of this event is that it is open and nonpartisan \u2013 it absolutely cuts right through party lines. Every American can participate in this\u201d. Santilli adds here, \u201cJohn McCain and Lindsey Graham \u2013 they must go. Any of these unconstitutional legislators, anyone who has committed unconstitutional acts in office, must vacate voluntarily. If they refuse to go, we want to cut off their money supply so they won\u2019t be able to make millions off us anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\nAttacks and Censorship\n\nThe Truckers are not without their enemies, who are keen to discredit them, silence them, or both.\n\nAs their campaign goes viral, so goes the media shooting match. The campaign has been directly targeted by George Soros-funded leftwing outlet, Media Matters, who have been busy digging up old Facebook posts and \u2018likes\u2019 from personal pages of Ride For The Constitution\u2019s organisers, in effect, waging a character assassination against them.\n\nWhen running a 21st century activist campaign, one must also beware of deadly communitarian policing, also known as \u201ccommunity guidelines\u201d policy.\n\n\n\nRide For The Constitution\u2019s Facebook page was live only six days when it received 86,000 likes, only to be promptly pulled down by the social network. The same happened with its Twitter account, which was pulled down after only 6 days.\n\nIn both cases, accounts were frozen because of an anonymous complaint.\n\n\n\nSantilli says he\u2019s mounting a legal challenge against one of the social networks.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt seems like the First Amendment doesn\u2019t apply on social networks. You work hard to build-up a huge audience, only to see it disappear in an instant \u2013 because a few political enemies anonymously complain that they were somehow offended\u201d.\n\nFuel poverty\n\nAs with all political movements through history, the pain normally starts in the wallet. Rising toll road charges and inflated diesel prices are forcing many out of America\u2019s trucking industry. In 2013, the reality is that drivers are losing their trucks - and losing their business. After labour, diesel fuel is the second highest expense for motor carriers, and can reach as much as much as 20% of transport\u2019s total operating costs.\n\nOrganisers Zeeda Andrews and Michael \u2018JB\u2019 Schaffner concluded in their joint statement on what they feel is a national crisis:\n\n\u201cBy no means are these the only issues that need action, to be resolved. There are many, many more issues that continue to plague this industry, as new regulations create even more contradictions in law. As per the fourteenth amendment of our Constitution, \u201cNo state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges, or immunities of Citizens of the United States, nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\u201d.\n\n\"So let these issues be the beginning of where we take a stand, not just as The American Drivers, but as Free and Independent Americans, protecting what our Constitution preserves for us.\u201d\n\nAt the very least Washington DC might be in for a shock this weekend. Call it shock therapy for the political class. At its best, it could jump-start real American discourse nationwide.\n\nLet the ride begin.\n\n\n\nThe statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There seems to be no end to the political theater in Washington DC.
