It's about time we convened to focus on this under-researched, poorly funded, heavily represented population in homelessness. Whether your program exclusively serves\n\nunaccompanied women or serves them with other populations, this conference will offer new and best ideas and Next Practices. For decades while other populations of our homeless neighbors have had the attention of research, policy, and focused resources, unaccompanied homeless women have not. Yet one in four sheltered homeless adults is an unaccompanied woman. One in Four. Recently in our quest to find research, uncover targeted policy, or simply discover when the last conference focused on this population occurred, we learned about the deficiency of research and data, the absence of policy focus, and the lack of convening/conferencing targeted to this often vulnerable population. Our aim is to begin a process to remedy these oversights. In partnership with organizations who serve women exclusively or in larger programs, we have announced a One in Four Convening on October 23 - 24, 2014 at Harvard University. Our intent is to begin a national dialogue to rectify the deficiencies in research, policy, and convening, as well as to offer an opportunity to those who serve women to listen and learn from one another.\n\nTwo full days focused on research, policy, practice, and resources. One in Four Convening Thursday, October 23: 9 am to 5 pm, followed by an informal reception, Dinner on your own, Friday, October 24: 9 am to 7 pm including annual Robert Coles Call of Service Lecture.
