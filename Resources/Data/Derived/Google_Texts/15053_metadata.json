Wholesome Wave's mission\u2014providing healthier food choices in underserved communities by increasing affordability and access\u2014has netted it our Food, Inc. Pioneer Award.\n\nThe Connecticut-based outfit\u2019s initial project provides matching funds for food stamp recipients who shop at farmers markets. Come armed with $20 worth of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program bucks, and you can leave with $40 worth of fresh fruits and vegetables. And if and when the United States Congress manages to pass a farm bill, anywhere between $25 million and $100 million of federal funds, backed by a 50 percent private match, will go toward turning $1 worth of green beans or apples into $2 for the 47 million Americans who depend on food aid.\n\nNischan hopes that next time the farm bill is up for renewal, a few billion federal dollars, with no match, will permanently be devoted to a doubling program\u2014eliminating the need for Wholsesome Wave to administer the initiative. \u201cThen we can say, \u2018We\u2019ve done our jobs; let\u2019s find something else to fix,\u2019 \u201d Nischan says.\n\nIndeed, Wholesome Wave is already tackling other problems related to the food system. The nonprofit tracks analytics on the doubling initiative, is developing a program that would integrate doctor-issued prescriptions for healthy foods into traditional health care, and maintains an investment fund to finance entrepreneurs looking to start triple-bottom-line businesses in the food space.\n\nDespite all this impressive work, which takes Wholesome Wave from Capitol Hill to impoverished neighborhoods to public hospitals and clinics, Nischan says the approach is always to promote the idea\u2014the program\u2014rather than the brand.\n\n\u201cThe model wasn\u2019t how do we go in and hang the Wholesome Wave shingle and do the Wholesome Wave program,\u201d he says, addressing the doubling program, \u201cbecause we know in communities of poverty there\u2019s a lot of resistance to well-meaning white people coming in with their program saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to save you, because we care.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe\u2019d like the prescription program to become a permanent federal program under the Affordable Care Act, thereby eliminating that aspect of the nonprofit's work as well.\n\nLet\u2019s just hope Nischan isn\u2019t too successful at making Wholesome Wave irrelevant.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Willy Blackmore", "description": "Wholesome Wave, an anti-hunger non-profit, works to double SNAP recipients dollars spent at farmers' markets.", "rights": "TakePart is the Social Action Network\u2122 of Participant Media. \u00a9 2008-2016 TakePart, LLC", "og": {"site_name": "TakePart", "description": "This anti-hunger group is doubling food-assistance dollars for hungry Americans who shop at farmers markets.", "title": "'Food, Inc.'
