MMC, +0.17% which talked to 564 companies. Firms were asked to describe how the court\u2019s 6-3 ruling that preserves government assistance in the 37 states that don\u2019t have their own Obamacare exchanges would affect their businesses.\n\nMercer\u2019s survey found 54% of employers saw no impact. Another 29% saw a positive effect while 17% saw negative results. The study also found that 7% of employers saw \u201cstrongly positive\u201d outcomes while 4% predicted \u201cstrongly negative\u201d impact.\n\n\u201cTo me, that was a surprise because we tend to not get that kind of a response about the ACA,\u201d said Beth Umland, director of research for Mercer\u2019s health-care business and the author of the study. She says that most employers have tended to be \u201cless than enthusiastic\u201d about Obamacare.\n\nMercer\u2019s study found that the larger the business, the more favorable reception the ruling received. Roughly 41% of companies -- ahead of the 29% average -- with 5,000 or more employees predicted a positive impact from the ruling, which could include putting part-time workers or early retirees on public exchanges.\n\nThe option to put early retirees on exchanges is a particularly attractive option for many, as roughly 45% of those who responded said they would consider it. At companies with more than 5,000 employees, that percentage was 54%.\n\nUmland said for many large employers, retiree health benefits can be a huge expense. She cited the example of General Motors Co. GM, +1.93% which has faced more than its share of financial troubles in recent years over retiree health benefits.\n\n\u201cIf there is a retiree medical plan, people tend to retire early,\u201d she said, which adds to expenses.\n\nThe survey also found that 16% of respondents believe Obamacare has hampered their employees\u2019 ability to get coverage. While the percentage seems low, Mercer is watching this figure closely to see if it rises.\n\nBut Umland says there has been no increase in the percentage of employers who say they\u2019ll drop coverage due to Obamacare offerings. In fact, that number has dropped from 9% in 2012 to 4% last year for companies with 500 or more workers, she says.\n\nThe breakdown of companies in Mercer\u2019s survey was: 47% with 500-4,999 workers, 29% with 5,000 or more employees and 24% with fewer than 500 staffers.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Last week\u2019s Supreme Court ruling has no impact for most companies, and mostly positive for those that will feel effects, a survey finds", "creator": "@russbrittmktw", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DO808_suprem_ZG_20150625102412.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Russ Britt", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Last week\u2019s Supreme Court ruling has no impact for most companies, and mostly positive for those that will feel effects, a survey finds", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-ruling-is-neutral-to-positive-for-most-companies-survey-2015-07-02", "author": "Russ Britt", "parsely-title": "Obamacare ruling is neutral to positive for most companies: survey", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-07-02T14:39:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Last week\u2019s Supreme Court ruling has no impact for most companies, and mostly positive for those that will feel effects, a survey finds", "title": "Obamacare ruling is neutral to positive for most companies: survey", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-ruling-is-neutral-to-positive-for-most-companies-survey-2015-07-02", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DO808_suprem_ZG_20150625102412.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DO808_suprem_ZG_20150625102412.jpg"}, "article.id": "D4F7F232-20D4-11E5-BE26-3895793CC0AC", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d4d\"", "article_summary": "The study also found that 7% of employers saw \u201cstrongly positive\u201d outcomes while 4% predicted \u201cstrongly negative\u201d impact.\nMercer\u2019s survey found 54% of employers saw no impact.\nUmland said for many large employers, retiree health benefits can be a huge expense.\nThe breakdown of companies in Mercer\u2019s survey was: 47% with 500-4,999 workers, 29% with 5,000 or more employees and 24% with fewer than 500 staffers.\nThe survey also found that 16% of respondents believe Obamacare has hampered their employees\u2019 ability to get coverage."}
