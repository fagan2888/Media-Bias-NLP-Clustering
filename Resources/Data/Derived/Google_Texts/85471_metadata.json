Now they are scared of three-year-old orphans. That doesn\u2019t seem so tough to me.\"\n\nThe remarks were a direct shot at New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who on Tuesday joined a majority of the country\u2019s governors when he said he wouldn\u2019t allow migrants to resettle in his state, not even \u201corphans under the age of five.\u201d\n\nObama went on to say he couldn\u2019t \u201cthink of a more potent recruitment tool for ISIL than some of the rhetoric that's been coming out of here during the course of this debate,\u201d especially an idea by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), another presidential contender, to prioritize Christian refugees over Muslims.\n\nHe previously singled out Cruz\u2019s proposal on Monday during a combative press conference in Turkey, labeling a religious test for refugees as \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cnot American.\u201d\n\nRelated: Funding for Syrian Refugees Could Spark a Big Fight in Congress\n\n\u201cThese are the same folks oftentimes who suggest that they're so tough that just talking to Putin or staring down ISIL, or using some additional rhetoric somehow is going to solve the problems out there,\u201d Obama noted.\n\nCruz fired back at the commander-in-chief. \"It is utterly unbefitting of the president to be engaging in those kind of personal insults and attacks,\" he told reporters, according to NBC News.\n\n\"He talked about how he was belittling the Republican field as scared. Well let me suggest something: Mr. President, if you want to insult me, you can do it overseas, you can do it in Turkey, you can do it in foreign countries. But I would encourage you Mr. President, come back and insult me to my face,\" Cruz said.\n\nThe president rarely employs such confrontational rhetoric, aside from statements he\u2019s made following mass shootings in the U.S. Like those deadly incidents, the white-hot debate over U.S. policy on Syrian refugees after last week\u2019s attack in Paris by ISIS that killed around 130 people seems to have struck a nerve with Obama.\n\nIn a Wednesday speech on the chamber floor, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said lawmakers would vote Thursday on a measure that would \u201cpause\u201d the administration\u2019s plan to bring in 10,000 migrants by the end of 2016 until more security measures are in place.\n\n\"We will not have a religious test, only a security test,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nThat no doubt will go over poorly with the administration, which has dug in its heels on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe are going to do the right thing in the right way -- protecting the American people even as we provide refuge to some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people,\u201d Amy Pope, deputy homeland security adviser for the National Security Council, wrote in a Tuesday blog post.\n\nRelated: Ted Cruz\u2019s Flawed Logic for Blocking Muslim Refugees\n\nObama didn\u2019t spare congressional Republicans from scorn, noting that he\u2019s waited a year and a half for Capitol Hill to approve an anti-ISIS war power resolution.\n\n\u201cAnd now, suddenly, they're able to rush in, in a day or two, to solve the threat of widows and orphans and others who are fleeing a war-torn land, and that's their most constructive contribution to the effort against IISL? That doesn't sound right to me,\u201d he chided.\n\nObama said he understands \u201cwhy the American people have been particularly affected\u201d by the Paris attacks, out of fear a similar massacre could occur in the U.S.\n\nBut \u201cwe are not well served when, in response to a terrorist attack, we descend into fear and panic,\" he said. \"We don't make good decisions if it\u2019s based on hysteria or an exaggeration of risks.\"\n\nPerhaps realizing how fired up he had become on the issue, Obama concluded his remarks by turning to Philippines President Benigno Aquino and apologizing.\n\n\u201cSorry, Mr. President, I had a lot to say on that one,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After months of criticism by Republican presidential hopefuls over his administration\u2019s efforts to combat ISIS, and critiques about his demeanor in the wake of last week\u2019s terrorist attack in Paris and the resulting debate about Syrian refugees, President Obama on Wednesday signaled he\u2019s had enough and laid into his GOP opponents.", "title": "A Testy Obama Warns Republicans: Your Rhetoric Is Helping ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Testy-Obama-Warns-Republicans-Your-Rhetoric-Helping-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11182015_Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Testy-Obama-Warns-Republicans-Your-Rhetoric-Helping-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11182015_Obama.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "After months of criticism by Republican presidential hopefuls over his administration\u2019s efforts to combat ISIS, and critiques about his demeanor in the wake of last week\u2019s terrorist attack in Paris and the resulting debate about Syrian refugees, President Obama on Wednesday signaled he\u2019s had enough and laid into his GOP opponents.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"We will not have a religious test, only a security test,\u201d Ryan said.\nAfter months of criticism by Republican presidential hopefuls over his administration\u2019s efforts to combat ISIS and recent critiques of his demeanor in the wake of last week\u2019s terrorist attack in Paris and the debate about Syrian refugees, President Obama on Wednesday signaled he\u2019s had enough.\nPerhaps realizing how fired up he had become on the issue, Obama concluded his remarks by turning to Philippines President Benigno Aquino and apologizing.\n\"At first, they were too scared of the press being too tough on them in the debates.\nThat no doubt will go over poorly with the administration, which has dug in its heels on the issue."}
