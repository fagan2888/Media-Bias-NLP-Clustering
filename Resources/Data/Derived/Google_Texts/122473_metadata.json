And in recent months, the President has made good on his threat, issuing edicts affecting everything from energy policy, health care and even labor rules. Last week, Obama took out his pen once again, ordering an increase in the threshold for overtime pay \u2013 once again without consulting lawmakers or seeking the approval of Congress.\n\nUnder the president\u2019s sweeping proposal, all salaried workers earning under $50,400 would be eligible for overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week. While Obama has predictably touted his proposal as a way to ensure \u201cfair pay,\u201d workers and the small businesses that employ them will be among the most negatively impacted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile backers of Obama\u2019s proposal suggest his executive action will result in pay increases for 5 million workers, his own Labor Department (the agency charged with implementing the new rules) estimates that only about one-fifth that number will see any tangible benefit \u2013 and even that could be an overestimate.\n\nMoreover, mandating higher overtime pay carries with it serious economic risks. The most likely response by employers to Obama\u2019s order, as seen in a recent study examining the effects of 2004 regulatory changes in overtime pay, are pay cuts. Since many employers are in no position to simply absorb the costs of these artificially-mandated higher wages, they will be forced to consider more draconian options to comply \u2013 such as scaling back compensation levels, or simply closing up shop. In lower paying jobs, employers may simply slash hours instead of reducing wages -- leaving less in the pockets of those who can least afford pay cuts. Even Obama\u2019s own Department of Labor projects reduced wages and hours as the most likely outcome.\n\nIn short, the potential result of Obama\u2019s latest overreach will be cutbacks in employee schedules, greater pressure on struggling small businesses, and shrinking paychecks for some of America\u2019s most vulnerable workers.\n\nAnother looming question surrounding the controversial order is if Obama will exempt the White House and Congress from this expensive mandate. It\u2019s well known around Washington that recent graduates and often unpaid interns make significant contributions to the day-to-day operations of the West Wing and Capitol Hill.\n\nWhile senators make a robust $174,000 plus benefits, most Hill staffers make substantially less than the new threshold despite toiling long hours \u2013 a lifestyle most are nonetheless happy to embrace. The same goes for those who work in the White House, with roughly a quarter of White House employees earning less than the proposed threshold of $50,400 \u2013 with many of those likely putting in more than 40 hours a week as well.\n\nThe reality of the 21st century economy is many Americans choose to work in excess of 40 hours a week, whether at the office, at home, online or some combination of all three. They do so for a variety of reasons \u2013to pursue their passions, to develop skills that will pay off in the long run, or to jump at an opening with opportunities for advancement. Rather than attempting to turn back the clock on the American economy, or to use the coercive power of government to inject bureaucracy between workers and employers, Obama should pursue pro-growth policies that promote economic expansion and real wage growth \u2013 the kind that isn\u2019t dependent on executive fiat.\n\nPeterson is a policy analyst for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy organization.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Mandating higher overtime pay carries with it serious economic risks.", "description": "Mandating higher overtime pay carries with it serious economic risks.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Mandating higher overtime pay carries with it serious economic risks.", "title": "Obama works overtime on executive overreach", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/247928-obama-works-overtime-on-executive-overreach", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/247928-obama-works-overtime-on-executive-overreach", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-15T15:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Eric Peterson", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-15T15:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/247928-obama-works-overtime-on-executive-overreach", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Mandating higher overtime pay carries with it serious economic risks.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama works overtime on executive overreach"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama works overtime on executive overreach"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe372b\"", "article_summary": "Last week, Obama took out his pen once again, ordering an increase in the threshold for overtime pay \u2013 once again without consulting lawmakers or seeking the approval of Congress.\nMoreover, mandating higher overtime pay carries with it serious economic risks.\nUnder the president\u2019s sweeping proposal, all salaried workers earning under $50,400 would be eligible for overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week.\nThe most likely response by employers to Obama\u2019s order, as seen in a recent study examining the effects of 2004 regulatory changes in overtime pay, are pay cuts.\nWhile Obama has predictably touted his proposal as a way to ensure \u201cfair pay,\u201d workers and the small businesses that employ them will be among the most negatively impacted."}
