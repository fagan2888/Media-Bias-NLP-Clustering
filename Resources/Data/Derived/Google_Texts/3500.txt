Californians get a second shot at Obamacare coverage starting Saturday as the next open enrollment season gets underway amid events statewide.

More than 1 million Californians signed up for private health plans in the state-run marketplace during the initial rollout of the Affordable Care Act this year. More than 2 million people enrolled in Medi-Cal, the state's low-income health plan.

Open enrollment in the Covered California exchange runs until Feb. 15.

The federal penalties for being uninsured increase in 2015. Going without coverage will cost $325 per adult or 2% of household income, whichever is greater.

For more information and details on enrollment events, visit the Covered California exchange at http://www.coveredca.com or 1-800-300-1506. Plug in your Zip Code at the Covered California website to find certified insurance agents or enrollment counselors near you.

Applicants should bring photo identification, proof of address and citizenship, pay stubs or tax returns and Social Security numbers for each family member enrolling.
