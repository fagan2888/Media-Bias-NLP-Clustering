The chair-elect of the board of HIMSS (the Chicago-based Healthcare Information & Management Systems Society, sponsor of HIMSS15), Dana Alexander, asked each if they had a concluding message they would like to leave with the healthcare IT leaders gathered in the ballroom.\n\n\n\nKaren DeSalvo, M.D., Andy Slavitt, and Dana Alexander at HIMSS15\n\nSlavitt said, \u201cWe are moving to a place where it\u2019s not about adoption of technology, but where, when you are walking the halls of a clinic, are patients feeling the improvement, and are caregivers feeling the improved productivity? The good news is that we have momentum, but I fear that if we don\u2019t get very urgent about it, it won\u2019t move fast enough.\u201d That\u2019s why, he said, it was important for all the federal healthcare agencies to continue to push the healthcare industry forward not only to adopt health IT, but also to collaborate to change the U.S. healthcare delivery system.\n\nAnd DeSalvo responded by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s the fourth quarter, and games are won and lost in the fourth quarter. We have a plan, and we\u2019re executing on the plan, and we know we can\u2019t do it alone. But the change in payment models and continued progress will have to continue in the private sector and in the states,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve set goals out to 2018\u2026 to give some stability and certainty to the future. It\u2019s really important to us and the administration, that we are partnering, collaborating, consulting, and listening,\u201d to and with healthcare providers going forward.\n\nOpening the keynote session, DeSalvo delivered her prepared remarks first, saying that healthcare IT adoption \u201chas brought us all to a tipping point. Today, we know that adoption is strong. Such incredible accomplishments from just five years ago\u2014these are the result of your hard work; and I know it is hard work,\u201d she said, addressing the healthcare IT leaders in the audience. She added that \u201cincreasing changes to health information exchange and interpretability are just beginning,\u201d and that \u201cWe have much work to do to achieve true interoperability, not just exchange.\u201d She made it clear that the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) was, while continuing to ensure that the meaningful use program under the HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical health) Act evolved forward successfully, already looking far beyond the conclusion of that program towards a future of collaboration with healthcare provider leaders.\n\nIn his prepared remarks, Slavitt offered his listeners a clear, rigorous vision of the aims of CMS and of the federal healthcare agencies in relation to the provider sector in healthcare. \u201cOur priority is simple: to drive a delivery system that provides better care, smarter spending, and keeps people healthier,\u201d he said. \u201cThe success in the first five years since the Affordable Care Act has been very encouraging. We\u2019ve moved lack of insurance from 20 percent to less than 13 percent. We\u2019ve reduced patient harm in the last four years in hospitals by 17 percent. And we\u2019re not doing this by breaking the bank. Health inflation is at its lowest rate of increase in four years. Our agenda now,\u201d he said, \u201cis to get busy strengthening these gains. That will mean that more providers in more communities will need to be able to transform the care they provide so that they will benefit from value-based reimbursement. And they will need technology to help them get there.\u201d\n\nSlavitt cited three key goals he wanted CMS to help providers accomplish in the coming years. \u201cOne, care providers and patients should begin to feel the benefit from all that investment in care technology, what I call the care dividend,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have a great need for a more modern infrastructure in healthcare. For the healthcare industry to become truly as great as we deserve\u2026 we need a Moore\u2019s law effect in healthcare productivity to care for our dual-eligible patients and aging Baby Boomers, and we need technology to do that. I think we could do with a little less emphasis on shareable and wearable and more infrastructure emphasis.\u201d In that regard, he cited new grants coming out of CMS for technology investments by state Medicaid programs. With regard to what Medicaid programs and other initiatives need, he said, \u201cWe need off-the-shelf, easy-to-maintain, modular systems that are faster to stand up and use.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s really important to us and the administration, that we are partnering, collaborating, consulting, and listening,\u201d to and with healthcare providers going forward.\n\u201cOne, care providers and patients should begin to feel the benefit from all that investment in care technology, what I call the care dividend,\u201d he said.\nOpening the keynote session, DeSalvo delivered her prepared remarks first, saying that healthcare IT adoption \u201chas brought us all to a tipping point.\nAnd they will need technology to help them get there.\u201dSlavitt cited three key goals he wanted CMS to help providers accomplish in the coming years.\nIn his prepared remarks, Slavitt offered his listeners a clear, rigorous vision of the aims of CMS and of the federal healthcare agencies in relation to the provider sector in healthcare."}
