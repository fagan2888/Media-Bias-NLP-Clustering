That\u2019s putting upward pressure on wages just when employers are getting the yips about the future of the national economy.\n\nA couple of court cases inject additional uncertainty, and federal regulators are considering rule changes that could affect the way that many exempt salaried workers are paid.\n\nAnd if all this wasn\u2019t enough, employers and their human resources departments face the challenge of developing policies to address the use of medical marijuana by some employees.\n\nThe state\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen below 6 percent for the first time since the recession, and researchers at the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation (DETR) say employers are soaking up available workers quickly. The Las Vegas economy added nearly 23,000 jobs in the past year. The Reno-Sparks area added more than 6,000 jobs.\n\nIn the Las Vegas area, the recent arrival of two new casinos \u2014 SLS Las Vegas and The Cromwell \u2014 tightens the market for senior and mid-level executives in the hospitality sector.\n\n\u201cThis is like 2005 or 2006,\u201d said Ann Simmons Nicholson, owner of The Simmons Group, a Las Vegas-based human relations and organizational development firm. \u201cWho\u2019s willing to move? What\u2019s it going to take to get them to move?\u201d\n\nIn Northern Nevada, the market for construction workers seemingly got tight overnight as work began on Tesla\u2019s gigafactory at the same time that numerous other industrial and distribution facilities began rising out of the ground, said Don Soderberg, director of DETR.\n\nStatewide, a burst of hiring by new and expanding technology firms appears to be just over the horizon, Soderberg said.\n\nWages\n\nThe tightening market for workers is forcing employers to consider pay raises, many of them for the first time since the onset of the recession in 2008.\n\n\u201cEmployers have had the luxury of not moving the needle on wages,\u201d said Jeff Parker, a Las Vegas-based vice president of Manpower. \u201cThat needs to change.\u201d\n\nParker advised clients that raises need to be strategic \u2014 not across-the-board increases \u2014 to address specific retention and recruitment issues that are different from one job classification to another.\n\nEmployers understand the need for raises, Parker said, but they\u2019re wary about the future course of the economy as the stock market continues to send mixed signals. Adding to the economic uncertainty: a contentious presidential election season.\n\nWhen employers decide to provide raises, they\u2019re often finding that it\u2019s difficult to get good data on current market rates, says Nicholson. The organizations that collected and shared compensation data in the past often let the work lapse during the recession.\n\nBenefits/Compensation Packages\n\nWhile Nicholson agreed that higher pay helps with recruitment and retention, she encouraged her clients ranging from major gaming companies to small professional firms to take a look at their total compensation package.\n\nThat includes benefits \u2014 and not just the healthcare benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. For many job candidates, a company\u2019s policies on the use of personal electronic devices are so important that the policy can make or break a decision to come on board. Training and opportunities for professional advancement are also viewed as an important benefit by candidates and existing employees alike.\n\nParticularly for the millennial generation, Nicholson said, flexible work arrangements are an important benefit. Younger workers pay close attention to the community involvement of employers, and their impression of companies is likely to be shaped by its presence on social media.\n\nTalent Recruitment\n\nLeigh Goddard, a partner with the statewide law firm of McDonald Carano Wilson, encouraged her clients to take a fresh look at pre-employment screening that may be a barrier to some candidates.\n\nFor instance, employers commonly conduct criminal background checks on applicants for all positions. But as employers scramble to meet their staffing needs, this may be a good time to reconsider the need for criminal checks for some positions.\n\nWidespread uses of non-compete agreements might also get a fresh look. While well-crafted non-compete agreements regularly are enforced by the courts in Nevada, they also may present a recruiting issue. \u201cThey could cause talented people to look elsewhere,\u201d said Goddard.\n\nThe rapidly shifting environment brought changes to JobConnect, the state-run network that connects job-seekers with employers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a period of transition,\u201d noted Soderberg, whose department oversees the employment service. \u201cJobConnect is doing much more outreach.\u201d\n\nJobConnect specialists are going through state unemployment filings to find and recruit jobless workers with skills that may be sought by employers. The agency is also stepping up its testing of applicants to determine if they have the aptitude for training into higher-skilled jobs they may not have considered in the past.\n\nEven the seemingly routine task of applying for jobs at JobConnect offices is getting a new approach. Employment specialists help applicants present themselves so they\u2019re not left behind as corporate HR offices increasingly use technology that automatically screens applicants before their application is seen by a human being.\n\nJobConnect these days isn\u2019t just a place where entry-level workers go to find low-skill jobs.\n\nSoderberg added JobConnect works ever more closely with community colleges, labor union apprenticeship programs and other training programs to make sure that higher-skilled and middle-skilled workers have appropriate skills for employers. The agency is focused on ensuring that training programs are nimble, quick and meet the customized needs of employers.\n\nNevada\u2019sWorkforce System\n\nThe workforce system is a large puzzle that includes the economic development agencies that work with potential new employers, the K-12 educational system that is locally controlled, a higher education system (especially the community colleges) that is overseen by a Board of Regents and DETR.\n\n\u201cThe biggest workforce trainer is our education system,\u201d said Soderberg.\n\nThe competitive labor market and the possibility that key staff members will be recruited away from their current employers comes at a time when thousands of baby boomers are also preparing to retire or scale back their employment.\n\nSmart employers are crafting succession plans that extend far beyond ownership and top management, Nicholson said. \u201cWhat would happen if you lost your top five people?\u201d she asked clients. \u201cWould they leave with the secret sauce?\u201d\n\nNew Regulations\n\nLawmakers, regulators and judges have played key roles in establishing the playing field for employer-employee relationships.\n\nLast year, the Nevada Legislature approved a measure that helped employers deal with the vexing questions that surround designation of workers as employees or contractors.\n\nThe new law (SB 224) sets a series of standards to designate a worker as a contractor. They must have control over the time and the manner of the work, or they must be able to work for others at the same time. If those standards are met, the state establishes a \u201cconclusive presumption\u201d the worker is a contractor rather than an employee.\n\nThis can be confusing, however. Federal standards for determining a worker\u2019s status are different, and unwary employers could find themselves in violation of the federal standard even if they meet the state\u2019s conclusive presumption.\n\n\u201cBe careful and be aware of both designations,\u201d said McDonald Carano\u2019s Goddard. \u201cMy advice to employers would be to err on the side of caution and designate workers as employees.\u201d\n\nAt the federal level, employers and human resources specialists are keeping a close eye on a proposed rule that would change the Fair Labor Standards Act regulations covering executive, administrative, and white-collar employees who are exempt from overtime.\n\nCurrently, the minimum salary threshold for exempt workers is set at $24,000 a year, and workers who earn less than that can\u2019t be exempted. The U.S. Labor Department, however, is pondering a change in the threshold, perhaps setting it as high as $54,000.\n\nIt\u2019s still uncertain when the new rules might be adopted. \u201cEmployers need to stay tuned,\u201d said Dora Lane, a partner in the law firm of Holland & Hart.\n\nGoddard said employers are closely watching a Nevada case, Hancock v. State of Nevada Office of the Nevada Labor Commissioner, which addressed a couple of sticky questions in the state\u2019s minimum wage law.\n\nNevada\u2019s minimum wage is unusual because it\u2019s set on two tiers \u2014 $8.25 an hour, or $7.25 an hour if the employer offers qualified health benefits. But what happens if the employer offers a qualified health plan, but the employee declines? This commonly arises when a worker chooses to be covered by a spouse\u2019s health plan.\n\nThe Hancock case, which was heard by the Nevada Supreme Court in early April, also addressed whether tips received by the employee should be calculated in determining whether the health plan qualifies. State law says qualified health insurance can\u2019t cost more than 10 percent of the employee\u2019s gross taxable income.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty important case for employers who are required to comply with the two-tier minimum wage,\u201d said Goddard.\n\nIn another case with implications for restaurants and hospitality businesses, the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a U.S. Department of Labor ruling from 2011 that prohibits businesses from requiring that employees share their tips.\n\nSome restaurants have required pooling of tips, which then are shared with back-of-the-house staff such as line cooks and dishwashers. The federal court barred that practice, although the decision may be challenged.\n\nRule Compliance\n\nWhile employers wrestle with the implications of recent court decisions, Lane said workers, perhaps emboldened by the stronger labor market, appear to be filing more complaints about workplace issues with federal regulators.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing stepped up enforcement by the U.S. Department of Labor, and audits almost always are pushed by complaints,\u201d Lane explained.\n\nThat provides even more reason why all employers, even small companies with fewer than 10 employees, need to get their ducks in a row and keep them in a row.\n\nNicholson said, \u201cMake sure you are in compliance with the rules for organizations your size, but plan for the next level now.\u201d As a general rule, she said, it\u2019s helpful if small firms plan as if they will become a 50-person organization. It\u2019s fairly easy to plan ahead and get the proper systems in place. It\u2019s difficult to play catch-up after the company has outgrown the rules for small companies.\n\nThe forms that small businesses need to be compliant generally are available from the Department of Labor, and Nicholson added her firm, like other HR consultants, provides free and low-cost counseling to small business with compliance questions.\n\nHowever, compliance alone isn\u2019t enough. Consistent application of rules across the workforce is important, Nicholson said. The owner of a small business needs to take personal responsibility for legal compliance, no matter who in the office handles the routine HR paperwork. \u201cIt always falls on the owner,\u201d she cautioned. \u201cThe owner is the person responsible.\u201d\n\nAmong the compliance issues causing some headaches is the legalization of medical marijuana in the state \u2014 and the possibility that voters in November could legalize recreational use of marijuana in Nevada. In most cases, Lane said employers have handled the use of medical marijuana by workers the same as they handle other medical cases. They make accommodation.\n\nBut Goddard noted that the marijuana-using employees raise questions for employers with drug-testing policies, particularly if recreational marijuana becomes legalized.\n\n\u201cEmployers should be aware of these issues,\u201d Goddard said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real concern because so many employers have drug-testing policies.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, she said that employers need to take a close look at their drug-testing policies to ensure that they meet an actual need \u2014 workplace safety, for instance \u2014 and don\u2019t unnecessarily create difficulties in the recruitment and retention of workers.\n\nAs the state\u2019s job market continues to tighten, every little edge will make a difference in the competition to land top workers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Employers and their human resources departments face the challenge of developing policies to address the use of medical marijuana by some employees.", "og": {"site_name": "Nevada Business Magazine", "description": "Employers and their human resources departments face the challenge of developing policies to address the use of medical marijuana by some employees.", "title": "Back to Work: Human Resource & Employment Issues", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.nevadabusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FeatFeat-300x257.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-11T17:01:21-07:00", "url": "http://www.nevadabusiness.com/2016/05/back-work-human-resource-employment-issues/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "Feature Story", "tag": "The Simmons Group", "published_time": "2016-05-01T00:18:43-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T17:01:21-07:00"}, "google-site-verification": "NC_os-83w0gjbGT2Fm1x_1aQGclHifhqFIwd_sxky1A", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEmployers need to stay tuned,\u201d said Dora Lane, a partner in the law firm of Holland & Hart.\n\u201cThis is like 2005 or 2006,\u201d said Ann Simmons Nicholson, owner of The Simmons Group, a Las Vegas-based human relations and organizational development firm.\nBut Goddard noted that the marijuana-using employees raise questions for employers with drug-testing policies, particularly if recreational marijuana becomes legalized.\nEmployment specialists help applicants present themselves so they\u2019re not left behind as corporate HR offices increasingly use technology that automatically screens applicants before their application is seen by a human being.\nWhen employers decide to provide raises, they\u2019re often finding that it\u2019s difficult to get good data on current market rates, says Nicholson."}
