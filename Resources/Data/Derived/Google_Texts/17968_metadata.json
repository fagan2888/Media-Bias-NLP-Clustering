Rand Paul looking likely to emerge as a top-tier candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016. That\u2019s bringing to the forefront questions about whether religious conservatives who oppose abortion and gay marriage can co-exist with libertarians, many of whom hold more liberal social views and oppose the government regulating anything.\n\nConway will take part in a panel Saturday at the social conservative Values Voter Summit in Washington to make that exact case: \u201cMoral Decline Causes Big Government: Why Libertarians Should Joine the Pro-Family/Pro-Life Movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth groups reject unelected judges upending voter will,\u201d Conway said. \u201cLibertarians may be less religious than values voters, but they share a growing distaste for the assault on religious liberty in so many corners of our culture.\u201d\n\nAs TheBlaze previously reported, libertarian groups, including the CATO Institute think tank, submitted legal briefs on behalf of Hobby Lobby in the company\u2019s successful lawsuit against the Obamacare mandate for employers to cover certain contraceptive drugs for their employees.\n\nDivisions between core conservatism and libertarianism can be traced back to the rift between William F. Buckley and Ayn Rand. But tensions seem to have cooled in recent years, chiefly because both camps found a common enemy with the increased growth of the federal government.\n\nA representative for former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer\u2019s American Values group, which is sponsoring the panel, believes that libertarians need to embrace social conservative policies to achieve their ends.\n\n\u201cAt the core of the challenge is that many libertarians don\u2019t believe they have a dog in the fight on issues like abortion, marriage and family values,\u201d the representative said. \u201cBut libertarians have virtually zero chance of achieving their primary goal of reducing the size of government if negative societal trends continue because the breakdown of the family has contributed to the massive growth of big government.\u201d\n\nThe other members of the panel are conservative commentator and author Maggie Gallagher, Doug Stafford, executive director of RANDPAC, and moderated by media consultant Kristi Hamrick.\n\n\u201cOur Founding Fathers gave us a system of limited government because they believed virtue and morality would restrain human passions. As Benjamin Franklin put it: \u2018Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom. As nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters.\u2019 Today we are seeing the confirmation of that wisdom,\u201d the Values Voter Summit schedule says in describing the forum.\n\n\u201cAs out-of-wedlock births increase, as marriage declines, as more children go to sleep at night in fatherless homes the demand for bigger government grows,\u201d the description continues. \u201cAs Judeo-Christian values decline, the heavy-hand of government fills the vacuum. If Libertarians want to achieve the goal of reducing the size and scope of government, they should join with social conservatives and support the pro-family agenda.\u201d\n\nConway cited the book by FreedomWorks head Matt Kibbe, \u201cDon\u2019t Hurt People and Don\u2019t Take Their Stuff: A Libertarian Manifesto,\u201d as a philosophy that could easily unite two factions.\n\n\u201cThere is more overlap than obstinacy, between the two groups really, but of course there will be disagreements,\u201d Conway said. \u201cMany libertarians are pro-life because they believe \u2018don\u2019t hurt people\u2019 extends to the womb. Libertarians abhor taxpayer-funding of abortion, and like, most of America, raise their eyebrows to stand against sex-selective, late-term and five month, 20 weeks or \u2018fetal pain\u2019 abortions.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul, like his father former Rep. Ron Paul \u2013 the 1988 Libertarian Party presidential nominee \u2013 is anti-abortion. The younger Paul has even sponsored sweeping pro-life legislation.\n\nBut Paul\u2019s problem might not be with social conservatives, said Steven Gross, a University of Kentucky political science professor.\n\n\u201cHe will not have a problem on social issues or abortion, he would not have gotten the nomination in Kentucky if he had not taken that position,\u201d Gross told TheBlaze. \u201cHis bigger problem will be in foreign affairs, not domestic. On foreign affairs he takes a few non-traditional Republican positions.\u201d\n\nGross believes Paul will have tough time securing the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, based on his less than hawkish view on military intervention. Still, he thinks Paul will be an interesting candidate.\n\n\u201cHe is promoting outreach to African Americans and Latinos emphasizing the need to broaden the base of the Republican party,\u201d Gross said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Could libertarians and social conservatives \u2013 often viewed as clashing forces on the right \u2013 actually be natural allies?  \u201cValues voters and libertarians share the view that a more intrusive, invasive, expensive and expansive federal government threatens self-governance and self-reliance and diminishes the worth of the individual,\u201d \u00a0said...", "creator": "@FredLucasWH", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/09/27/do-libertarians-need-to-embrace-a-socially-conservative-agenda-to-achieve-their-goals/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/600x39993.jpg", "title": "Do Libertarians Need to Embrace a Socially Conservative Agenda to Achieve Their Goals?", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "can, libertarians, social, conservatives, call, truce", "sailthru.tags": "abortion, campaign-2016, conservatives, libertarianism, politics, rand-paul, ron-paul, same-sex-marriage, author-fred-lucas, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 888, "gplus-count": 0, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/870141", "categories": "abortion,campaign-2016,conservatives,libertarianism,rand-paul,ron-paul,same-sex-marriage,politics", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 147, "description": "Could libertarians and social conservatives \u2013 often viewed as clashing forces on the right \u2013 actually be natural allies?  \u201cValues voters and libertarians share the view that a more intrusive, invasive, expensive and expansive federal government threatens self-governance and self-reliance and diminishes the worth of the individual,\u201d \u00a0said...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 3, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "Could libertarians and social conservatives \u2013 often viewed as clashing forces on the right \u2013 actually be natural allies?  \u201cValues voters and libertarians share the view that a more intrusive, invasive, expensive and expansive federal government threatens self-governance and self-reliance and diminishes the worth of the individual,\u201d \u00a0said...", "title": "Do Libertarians Need to Embrace a Socially Conservative Agenda to Achieve Their Goals?", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/09/27/do-libertarians-need-to-embrace-a-socially-conservative-agenda-to-achieve-their-goals/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/600x39993.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 399}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-09-27T12:14:44+00:00", "twitter-count": 42}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca59a\"", "article_summary": "Could libertarians and social conservatives \u2013 often viewed as clashing forces on the right \u2013 actually be natural allies?\nA representative for former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer\u2019s American Values group, which is sponsoring the panel, believes that libertarians need to embrace social conservative policies to achieve their ends.\nBut Paul\u2019s problem might not be with social conservatives, said Steven Gross, a University of Kentucky political science professor.\nAs nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters.\u2019 Today we are seeing the confirmation of that wisdom,\u201d the Values Voter Summit schedule says in describing the forum.\n\u201cHe is promoting outreach to African Americans and Latinos emphasizing the need to broaden the base of the Republican party,\u201d Gross said."}
