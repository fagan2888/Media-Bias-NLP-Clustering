Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) thinks it's time for Republicans to let go of their efforts to repeal Obamacare.

Speaking to an NBC affiliate in Portland on Thursday, Collins argued that the GOP has missed its chance to get rid of the health care law entirely. She noticeably did not say whether she would vote to repeal or defund Obamacare, despite being asked.

"You know at this point, I think we’re past that," Collins said. "I think it would’ve been much better if there’d been a bipartisan bill crafted in 2008 that had provisions that both parties could agree on, such as prohibiting insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions."

"I think at this stage what we should do is a number of bills that would fix flaws in Obamacare. I think we’re past the point of being able to repeal the bill altogether," she added. "And as you point out, there are some good provisions in the bill, as well as some that have increased the cost of health care."

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said he will remain committed to full repeal if Republicans take control of the upper chamber in midterms. It's unclear whether there are other Republicans in the Senate who, like Collins, believe the party should shift its focus toward fixing Obamacare. But as The New Republic points out, McConnell will probably need the support of his whole conference to pass bills that repeal or chip away at the law.
