There are things that can be done. We keep listening to people saying \u2018the horse is out of the barn, you can\u2019t get it back in there, end of story,\u2019 [and] that\u2019s a bunch of crap. We can do anything. This is America.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, also decried how Obamacare shifted the role of power in the nation and took health care out of the hands of the people and put it into the control of government.\n\n\u201cThe people are supposed to be at the pentacle,\u201d he said, Newsmax reported. \u201cThe government is supposed to conform to our will, not us to their will.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson still hasn\u2019t decided whether he\u2019ll seek the presidency in 2016. But he did admit that\u2019s been listening to people and learning more of issues of importance to America.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m rapidly acquiring that knowledge, listening to people and really finding a tremendous amount of frustration with the status quo, politics as usual, be it Republican or Democrat,\u201d he said, Newsmax reported. \u201cOur system was designed for the people. It wasn\u2019t designed for professional politicians. I\u2019m thinking very seriously, listening to people, and we\u2019ll make a decision in a few months.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Noted conservative commentator and talked-about Republican presidential contender Ben Carson cut to the chase about the fate of Obamacare, saying there is absolutely no reason politicians can't unravel, reinvent or outright repeal the health care plan \u2014 and those who say otherwise are selling a lie.", "Author": "Cheryl K.
