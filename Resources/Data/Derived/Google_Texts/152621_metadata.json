Augsburg College is offering the 3-1/2 month program. Students will end their voyage at the southern end of the Mississippi, in Louisiana.\n\nBlair Stewig, a sophomore from Maple Lake, shoved off from the shore around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. She said she was ready as she hugged her mother and grandparents goodbye.\n\nJust a minute into the trip, Stewig said, \u201cI think that the river feels like home, and it\u2019s going to be home for the next several months.\u201d\n\nShe and 15 other Augsburg students, along with several guides and a professor, set sail from St. Paul in locally made voyager canoes. Some are tasked with taking soil samples, while others take pictures.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to shoot a feature-length film, tentatively named \u2018Learning to Listen: A Semester on the River,'\u201d Augsburg Junior and Eagle Scout Ricky Taylor said.\n\nFrom film to biology to the arts, students of many majors will study the Mississippi and its towns top to bottom, no matter the autumn elements.\n\n\u201cYou kind of have to plan that every day\u2019s going to be cold and rainy and then every sunny day\u2019s a blessing,\u201d Stewig said.\n\nPaddling will be a way of life for these students. It will take two months to get to St. Louis. In December, they\u2019ll arrive in New Orleans.\n\n\u201cSouth for the winter, or at least part of the winter anyways,\u201d Stewig said.\n\nIt appears they\u2019ll be in good company: Eagle after eagle flew overhead as they started their journey in a classroom with no walls and more than 1,400 miles of space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be like family, honestly, all of us,\u201d Stewig said.\n\nThe students are expected to make it to Winona on Sept. 12, where they will visit students there, then on to Iowa.\n\nThey will camp at nights, read as they paddle and have classes at night as guest lecturers join in along the way.\n\nTo learn more about the inaugural program, go to Augsburg\u2019s website.\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
