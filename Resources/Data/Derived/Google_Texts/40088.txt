PALM BEACH, Fl. — Sen. Ted Cruz addressed the Club for Growth Friday night, and predictably, he impressed many of the attendees gathered at The Breakers. But while much of what he said was recycled, he did say a couple of things that were worth noting. Asked if he had made any mistakes regarding the defund Obamacare strategy, he conceded he made a mistake by not spending enough time “explaining the specific strategy to elite opinion leaders.”

Perhaps more interesting, Cruz conceded it would have taken “an almost perfect storm” to actually defund Obamacare. Had Republicans stuck together, he said, they might have negotiated some sort of compromise. This seemed at odds with the argument at the time, which insisted that, yes, it was possible to defund Obamacare (and anyone who said otherwise was deemed a RINO sellout).

Gov. Scott Walker addressed the Club on Saturday morning. Much of the speech was wonky, but during the Q&A session, he was asked about his inability to answer questions about social issues.

Walker seems to have decided he can focus solely on fiscal and economic issues, without answering other questions. In the case of social issues, he dodges them by arguing that he was elected to focus “like a laser beam” on the economy.

The implication is that real people care only about economic issues (it’s only those pesky media types who want to know about social issues!). He likewise dodges questions about his lack of foreign policy experience by talking about leadership and courage (essentially this argument) — not an absurd argument for him to make, but one that he won’t be able to get away with making forever.
