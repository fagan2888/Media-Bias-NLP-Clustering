Emails obtained by the House Ways and Means Committee show IRS executive Lois Lerner working on the new rules in secret with Obama Treasury officials at the height of the targeting. Lerner has refused to testify before Congress amid the criminal investigation into misconduct at the agency. The regulations, which are currently pending, would allow the IRS to crack down on political activity by non-profit groups. A June 2012 email from a Treasury official to Lerner suggests that they work \u201coff plan\u201d \u2013bureaucratic shorthand for keeping their meetings off of publicly available schedules \u2013 to devise the rules. Critics say the rules that resulted would permit agents to shut down dissent by non-profit groups.\n\n[Daily Caller - \u201cThe American Civil Liberties Union\u2026 stated its \u2018serious concerns with the [proposed IRS regulations]\u2026 from a First Amendment perspective,\u2019 saying that \u2018the proposed rule threatens to discourage or sterilize an enormous amount of political discourse in America.\u2019\u201d]\n\nEMPLOYERS READY OBAMACARE INSURANCE CUTS\n\nWashington Examiner: \u201c\u2026a Duke University survey of top companies found that 44 percent are considering reducing health benefits to current employees due to Obamacare, confirming the fears of millions of American workers\u2026Duke also found that nearly half are \u2018reluctant to hire full-time employees because of the Affordable Care Act.\u2019 And 40 percent are considering shifting to part-time workers and others will hire fewer workers of fire some to avoid the costs of the program.\u201d\n\nFor the record - \u201c[ObamaCare] creates a disincentive for people to work\u201d \u2013 Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf during House testimony. More.\n\nNEW OBAMACARE REGS WILL TRY TO EASE \u2018DOC SHOCK\u2019\n\nWSJ: \u201cInsurers are facing pressure from regulators and lawmakers about plans that offer limited choices of doctors and hospitals, a tactic the industry said is vital to keep down coverage prices in the new health law's marketplaces. This week, federal regulators proposed a tougher review process for the doctors and hospitals in plans to be sold next year through HealthCare.gov, a shift that could force insurers to expand those networks. Meantime, regulators in states including Washington and New Hampshire are ramping up their own scrutiny, and lawmakers in Mississippi and Pennsylvania, among others, are weighing bills that could force plans to add more hospitals and doctors.\u201d\n\nBack end backup - A House committee will investigate why the ObamaCare Web site does not allow ObamaCare enrollees to appeal errors and is asking Health and Human Services officials to testify no later than February 21 to discuss the problem. More.\n\nStudy measures Obama\u2019s enrollment exaggerations - WaPo: \u201cBetween 1 million and 2 million Americans signed up for Medicaid last year because of [ObamaCare], according to a new report suggesting that many of the people who have joined the program since the initiative\u2019s rollout in October would have done so absent the law. The Obama administration has said that 6.3 million people were determined to be eligible for Medicaid between October and December. But the study, from health-care industry consulting firm Avalere Health, suggests that only a fraction of the enrollments are strictly the result of the health-care law.\u201d\n\nRUBIO\u2019S PLEA: GOP NEEDS TO RALLY ON OBAMACARE BAILOUT\n\n\u201cMany of these insurance companies were for ObamaCare when it first came out. I mean, they thought this was going to be a huge bonanza for them. So they got involved in pushing for the law, advocating for the law. Many of them were at the table when it was drawn up. But of course, they always counted on this money being there for them at the back end. That\u2019s not right. That isn\u2019t fair that people and companies who can afford to hire lobbyists come up here and figure out a way to get the taxpayers to bail them out for a program that doesn\u2019t work, was never going to work and is now worse than ever.\u201d\u2014Sen.

Boehner scrambled to sell a new debt-ceiling solution to his Republican colleagues on Wednesday\u2026 \u2018Right now, Jesus himself couldn\u2019t be the speaker and get 218 Republicans behind something, so I think Speaker Boehner is trying his best to come up with a plan that can get close to that,\u2019 said Rep. Patrick J. Tiberi (R-Ohio), a longtime Boehner ally\u2026\u201d\n\n[Watch Fox: Boehner will face reporters at an 11:30 a.m. ET press conference.]\n\nUNION\u2019S ACCESS TO YOUR EMAIL AT ISSUE\n\nShould your employer be required to give your email address to unions looking to get you to join up? The National Labor Relations Board said yes, but a court ruling that President Obama\u2019s effort to pack the board with union-backers amid a blockade by Senate Republicans could render that and other rulings by the NLRB moot. \u2013 Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream considers if this union showdown could be on the fast track to the Supreme Court.\n\nBig Labor appm wage hike no help to poor - Less than 2 percent of Americans workers earn wages at or below the federal minimum, meaning President Obama\u2019s proposed hike in the federal minimum wage would do little for most living in poverty. So says a new study by the conservative American Action Forum.\n\nBOMBS ROCK BAGHDAD\n\nAP: \u201cA string of car bomb attacks hit commercial areas in Baghdad on Thursday, killing at least 13 people, said Iraqi officials\u2026 The bombings came a day after 34 people were killed in multiple explosions, mainly in the heart of Baghdad.\u201d\n\n\u2018Iraq is gone\u2019 - \u201cI don\u2019t need a big hearing to figure this one out. You had millions of Americans serve. You had Americans die\u2026 It\u2019s very simple. We\u2019re not there anymore and we left too quickly with no leave-behind force. The Obama administration failed and now you have the disaster. Iraq is gone.\u201d \u2013 Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d\n\nGOP LOOKS TO EXPOSE DEM RIFTS ON IRAN\n\nDaily Beast: \u201cThe Republican Senate caucus is planning to use every parliamentary trick in the book to push Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to allow a floor vote on a new Iran sanctions bill that the Obama administration strenuously opposes. The Obama White House has succeeded in keeping most Democrats in line against supporting quick passage of the \u2018Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act\u2019 which currently has 59 co-sponsors, including 13 Democrats. Reid has faithfully shelved the bill, pending the outcome of negotiations between Iran and the world\u2019s major powers...\u201d\n\nHouse sets up Benghazi Web hub - Washington Examiner: \u201cHouse Republicans have set up a new website focused on the Benghazi attack and the circumstances surrounding it that promises to bring the facts about the deadly assault \u2018straight to the American people\u2019\u201d\n\n[Watch Fox: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., discusses Benghazi in the 10 a.m. ET hour]\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nAt Fox News Opinion, Judge Andrew Napolitano considers if President Obama can legally bypass Congress. From Executive Order Tyranny: \u201cThe same president who claims the unlawful power to rewrite federal law on his own would use his veto power to prevent Congress from doing so lawfully. His preferences surely constitute no less than a perversion of the roles assigned to the branches of government by the Constitution.\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

A spokesman with the group, Priorities USA Action, confirmed to BuzzFeed on Wednesday night that it would not be involved in House or Senate campaigns\u2026Sources close to the group say its leaders considered helping Democrats in House and Senate races approaching this fall. The PAC\u2019s principal financial backer, Hollywood magnate Jeffrey Katzenberg, has shown an interest in one midterm candidate in particular: Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democrat gunning to unseat Sen. Mitch McConnell.\u201d\n\nIf the pantsuit fits, wear it - Page Six: \u201cHillary Clinton went on a private shopping spree at Bergdorf Goodman early Tuesday morning, sparking further speculation that she\u2019s suiting up for a 2016 presidential run. Hillary was spotted entering the posh department store by a side entrance at 9 a.m., with a small entourage of security and assistants.\u201d\n\nLANDRIEU MAKES MAJOR DEM PATRON\u2019S NAUGHTY LIST\n\nThe Hill: \u201cBillionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer is launching a new campaign against proponents of Keystone XL, and one possible target is [Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La.] Steyer's green group NextGen Climate Action posted a list of candidates that are strong advocates of the controversial TransCanada oil pipeline on its website, asking people to pick which one it should target for its Keystone XL television ad.\u201d\n\n[Ed. note: Is this just bipartisan cover for a group that has basically functioned as an extension of Team Obama or will it really spend money on this race? It would be hard to argue that Steyer\u2019s bid to push the government into regulating his competitors in the fossil-fuel industry and pumping more subsidies to green energy outfits like his would be helped by having a Republican in Landrieu\u2019s seat.]\n\nTILLIS PAINTS HAGAN AS OBAMA LOYALIST\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Senate frontrunner Thom Tillis is painting Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., as an Obama Democrat in his latest ad. The spot asks \u201cHow many people will have to pay for Kay Hagan's loyalty to [President Obama]\u201d\n\nPRYOR WHACKED OVER OBAMACARE\n\nDaily Caller: \u201cAmericans for Prosperity, a well-funded conservative group, is putting more than half a million dollars behind\u2026 attacking Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor\u2026The ad targets Pryor, who faces a tough re-election in a decidedly red state, on his support for Obamacare. It will begin running on television statewide on Thursday, and AFP has put $606,000 behind it. \u2026the group will also have a \u2018very aggressive\u2019 ground game \u2013 knocking on doors and running phone \u2026.\u201d\n\nNRSC USES CBO REPORT TO HIT VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee is using the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s report on ObamaCare\u2019s effects on jobs to blast vulnerable Democrats. Among the candidates the NRSC is targeting: Sens. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Al Franken, D-Minn., Mary Landrieu, D- La., Mark Pryor, D-Ark., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Mark Udall, D-Colo., and Mark Warner, D-Va. From Hagan\u2019s version: \u201cObamaCare punishes additional work, professional advancement, and additional income hurting those trying to climb into the middle class most of all. Kay Hagan repeatedly lied about ObamaCare, and voters no longer trust her judgment.\u201d\n\nPICK SIX: TREASURE HUNT\n\nRepublicans only need to gain six seats to take control of the Senate.

The poll indicates Sasse has the edge with anti-establishment-leaning voters: 54 percent of those surveyed said they support Tea Party ideals, and Sasse has a slight lead among them, leading 35 to 31 percent.\u201d\n\n[Watch Fox: Shane Osborn appears on \u201cPower Play with Chris Stirewalt\u201d in the 11:30 half-hour.

It would allow people with concealed handgun licenses to wear a pistol on their hip, in full view, while in public. Davis has said she supports expanding gun rights in Texas. But in a statement to The Associated Press, she said that includes open-carry \u2013 a position that puts her at odds with her own party but could keep her from alienating gun rights advocates in a deeply conservative a state where the Second Amendment is sacrosanct\u2026 Texas State Rifle Association spokeswoman Alice Tripp noted Davis' previous calls for more restrictions on gun show sales and past votes against allowing concealed license holders to carry their guns in classrooms and buildings on college campuses. \u2018Wendy Davis has a very bad record as far as gun owners go,\u2019 Tripp said, calling Davis an \u2018opportunist.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nABBOTT DUCKS CHRISTIE\n\nDallas Morning News: \u201c[Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J.] will be in Dallas and Fort Worth on Thursday for Republican governor fundraisers. He\u2019s also planning on trips to Illinois, New York, Maryland, Georgia and Washington DC to raise money for the RGA. A planned stop at the Conservative Political Action Conference \u2013 or CPAC \u2013 in Washington will be an opportunity to show that he\u2019s not damaged goods politically. Conservatives in the party haven\u2019t been keen on Christie since his embrace of President Obama and federal assistance to New Jersey in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. Likely GOP gubernatorial nominee Greg Abbott will not join Christie. An aide said Abbott will be in Houston as part of a statewide series of appearances on immigration.\u201d\n\n[Ed. note: Christie\u2019s fellow Republican governors may sympathize with his claim of being the victim of a smear campaign by liberal media outlets over a dirty trick played by his subordinates on a uncooperative Democrat. But that doesn\u2019t mean other GOPers would like to get involved. Christie\u2019s turn as RGA chairman was supposed to be about rebuilding his brand in the party after his 2012 snubbing of Mitt Romney. Christie\u2019s falling out with NBC News & Co. has robbed him of his main attraction for GOP governors: positive establishment press appeal. Like Romney in 2012, Christie needs help when the chips are down. If his fellows do as he did two years ago and think of their states and campaigns first, Christie\u2019s chairmanship stands to be a painful rather than palliative experience for all involved.]\n\nPAUL: INFIGHTING IS GOOD FOR GOP\n\n\u201cEverybody else told [Ronald Reagan] to shut up too. They said, \u2018shut up and wait your turn.\u2019 And he didn\u2019t. There was a big fight over what was the direction of the Republican Party. So fighting doesn\u2019t have to be impolite. It doesn\u2019t have to be rude. But there needs to be a struggle over the direction of the party. We have to decide, are we going to go bold \u2013 are we going to go big \u2013 or are we going to become Democrat-lite? That debate always occurs in a party. And so we should fight; we should struggle for what we believe in and try to move the party forward.\u201d \u2013 Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., speaking at a gala hosted by the American Principles Project.\n\nCRIST FUNDRAISING TURNS PALE\n\nSunshine State News: \u201cIs [Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate] Charlie Crist losing fundraising momentum? The former Republican governor made headlines when he raised $2.1 million in November. But, just two months later, his numbers tell a different tale. In January, a political committee backing Crist raised only $375,000. Further analysis shows an even starker picture: two donors alone made up $200,000 of the total\u2026\u201d\n\n[In the latest University of Florida poll, Crist leads Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., 47 percent to 40 percent.]\n\nJUST IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING\u2026\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry will not run for president in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m out of politics. I have no plans whatsoever. This is my last stop,\u201d Kerry told CNN.\n\n[Kerry will join Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, at this year\u2019s Gridiron Club dinner, the most prestigious gathering of Washington journalists. WaPo reports.]\n\nSHERIFF JOE RIDES IN FOR FLORIDA HOUSE RACE\n\nTampa Bay Times: \u201c\u2026Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to campaign\u2026 for Democratic congressional candidate Alex Sink. Biden will appear at a Feb. 12 fundraiser\u2026 [Republican rival David Jolly\u2019s] spokeswoman Sarah Bascom was not impressed. \u2018I wonder how many lobbyists will be there and solicited for a contribution and how many conversations will be had about the priorities of President Obama and Nancy Pelosi over the communities of Pinellas County.\u2019\u2019\u2019 Sink, the Democratic nominee for a March 11, Tampa-area special election to serve out the remainder of the term of the late Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., has repeatedly hit Jolly over his background as a lobbyist.\n\n[George Will: \u201c..[I]f Republican David Jolly prevails, Republicans will construe this as evidence that Barack Obama has become an anvil in the saddle of every Democratic candidate\u2026 If Sink wins, Republicans nationally can shrug; if Jolly wins, Democrats should tremble.\u201d]\n\nBiden: Unions keep the barbarians at bay - \u201cAnd there\u2019s a reason why the middle class is shrinking, I know I got in trouble for saying this before, but I'm going to say it again. You guys [unions] are the only guys keeping the barbarians at the gate, man. That's the deal,\u201d \u2013 Vice President Joe Biden, in an address to the United Automobile Workers Community Action Program Conference Wednesday, via Washington Examiner.\n\nBIG MOUTH SAVES THE DAY\n\nHe may have ended gasping on the floor of the crime scene, but he apparently saved the day for the proprietors of Hooked on Fishing in Rochester, Minn. Authorities say Big Mouth Billy Bass, the popular motion-activated, animatronic novelty display \u201cas seen on TV\u201d scared away a would-be burglar. The bass, mounted by the shop\u2019s door, apparently broke into strains of \u201cTake Me to the River\u201d when the intruder broke in. The Olmstead County Sherriff\u2019s Office said the intruder left in a hurry. Sgt. Tom Claymon told Minneapolis Star Tribune that the fake fish \u201ctook one for the team,\u201d noting that \u201cnothing was missing \u2026 other than Billy\u2019s pride.\u201d\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cThe statement that [White House Press Secretary Jay Carney] made is going to be emblazoned on the tombstone of liberalism. He says\u2026 that the government is giving opportunity for people to decide if they want to work.
