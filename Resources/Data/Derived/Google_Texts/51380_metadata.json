Within two hours, he found that Robinson's doctor had moved offices and she needed a new doctor.\n\nWithout this rare home visit, Robinson, 65, likely would have ended up hospitalized, Fogle said. To avoid this, hospitals target patients such as Robinson and send doctors to their homes, hoping to prevent readmissions.\n\n\u201cWe go outside the walls of the hospital for early recognition of symptoms going bad,\u201d said Lori Shotts, a registered nurse who is part of a high-risk care team that tracks patients at risk for readmission to Allegheny Valley Hospital. \u201cWe want to keep the patient at home where they want to be.\u201d\n\nThe hospital's approach is fueled partly by the government's goal to curb readmissions, which cost an estimated $12 billion in Medicare spending. Three-quarters of readmissions are preventable, according to an analysis of claims data by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2012 began imposing fines on hospitals that readmit too many patients within a month of discharge. Records show Allegheny Valley in the past two years received among the steepest fines for hospitals in Western Pennsylvania \u2014 1 percent of its Medicare reimbursement.\n\nPenalties nationwide have averaged about $127,000 per hospital every year.\n\nExperts say the fines have pushed hospitals to send workers to patients' homes, where they might learn some people can't get a handle on their health. The task falls primarily on nurses; it's unusual for doctors to visit homes, said Dr. Karen Joynt, an instructor at Harvard University School of Public Health who studies readmissions.\n\n\u201cSome patients are so complex, it makes a ton of sense for a physician to visit those homes,\u201d Joynt said.\n\nFogle, who began working for Allegheny Health Network in June, said most patients at risk for readmission are those who have trouble with medications \u2014 taking the wrong dosage, or trying to juggle multiple drugs prescribed by doctors who did not communicate with each other.\n\n\u201cIt's always the meds. It's our society. Everybody thinks a pill will make them better. If one pill won't do it, they want another one. It's a pharmaceutical nation,\u201d he said.\n\nWho gets home visits\n\nThe impetus to address readmissions at Allegheny Valley came in March 2012 when administrators noted just over 19 percent of patients were returning within a month of discharge.\n\nThey established the high-risk care team \u2014 nurses, social workers and paramedics \u2014 to meet daily and review details of recently discharged patients who they suspected might return. Most such patients are elderly with diabetes, congestive heart failure or other chronic conditions.\n\nThey do not follow specific guidelines when deciding who should get a home visit.\n\n\u201cIt's just a feeling,\u201d said Fogle, 61, who was an Army physician in Afghanistan and is a brigade surgeon for the Pennsylvania National Guard. \u201cIf it looks like every 21 days that patient is coming back, we figure, let's hit him on Day 19 and stop him from coming back in.\u201d\n\nRobinson fit the bill. The former mental health counselor is diabetic and was hospitalized more than 10 times in a six-month period \u2014 for symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, back pain and headaches.\n\nWhen Fogle asked to look at her medications, she gave him a container with 16 pill bottles. As he checked them, she produced two plastic bins filled with medicines, ointments, vitamins and medical supplies.\n\n\u201cI never throw my bottles out,\u201d said Robinson, who sat on a bed in her living room, near the kitchen and a large flat-screen TV.\n\nFogle and Shotts discarded about a dozen of Robinson's pills bottles. Shotts pricked Robinson's finger to test her blood in a glucometer. Later she listened to her lungs.\n\nWhen Robinson told Fogle that her doctor had moved to Bloomfield, he promised to make an appointment for her with another doctor.\n\n\u201cIt's right here, right around the corner. You can power-chair over there,\u201d he joked. \u201cIs that a deal? Keep you out of the hospital?\u201d\n\nShe nodded and smiled. And having a physician check on her at home should help her stay healthy, she said.\n\n\u201cI get confused about the medicines,\u201d she said.\n\nExpanding the practice\n\nOfficials at Allegheny Health Network consider the program successful enough to try it at other hospitals.\n\nReadmission rates at Allegheny Valley dropped to 11.8 percent in May, the lowest since officials recorded the 19.2 percent readmission rate in March 2012.\n\nUPMC Health Plan started a similar program about a month ago that is run by doctors from an internal medicine practice at UPMC Montefiore in Oakland. The program has enrolled 20 patients, said Dr. Jodie Bryk, who leads the program with Dr. Gary Fischer.\n\n\u201cWe're trying to get out of the practice of you coming to the hospital to be seen,\u201d Bryk said. \u201cPatients are better off if they stay at home.\u201d\n\nLuis F\u00e1bregas is Trib Total Media's medical editor.
