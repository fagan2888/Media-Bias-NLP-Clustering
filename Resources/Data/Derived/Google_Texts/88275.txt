SANTA MARIA, Calif. (AP) â€” A California woman died after a car driven by her mother ran over her while they were fighting, police said Saturday.

Kimberly Wilson, 55, and her daughter, 34-year-old Brandy Wilson, were in a Jeep Cherokee in a Santa Maria parking lot Friday when they got into a fight that turned physical, said Sgt. Mark Streker, a police traffic supervisor.

Brandy Wilson began assaulting her mother before Kimberly Wilson rapidly backed up the Jeep, which threw her daughter from the passenger's seat, police said.

The car then ran over Brandy Wilson, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

Investigators believe Kimberly Wilson, who is homeless and lived in the car, did not intentionally run over her daughter. She was extremely distraught at the scene, Streker said.

There was evidence of drug use and results of drug and alcohol tests of the mother and daughter were pending, Streker said.

Wilson was released after being interviewed and the investigation is ongoing. Prosecutors will decide whether Wilson should face any charges.

Streker said the mother and daughter have a history of getting into physical fights with each other.
