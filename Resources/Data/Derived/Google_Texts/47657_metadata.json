On accident.\n\nThe 40-year-old professional poker player said he intended to play no-limit Texas Hold \u2019em but instead inadvertently signed up for a different game happening the same day: so-called no-limit deuce-to-seven draw lowball. The cost? A $1,500 buy-in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a totally different game. Different mindset. Different strategies,\u201d said Shawn Harris, Pham\u2019s dealer at the final table.\n\nEssentially, the goal is to have the lowest poker hand, no straights or flushes, and if a player ends up with a pair, it\u2019s better if it\u2019s a pair of twos. Players can also draw cards.\n\nThe event was just one of 68, all offering a chance at a golden bracelet prize, happening in Las Vegas at the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino throughout the 51-day World Series of Poker that started on May 27 and culminates with the closely watched Main Event.\n\nPham said he didn\u2019t realize his mistake until he was dealt five cards instead of the usual two. He panicked, then observed, leaning on helpful players who advised him what beat what.\n\n\u201cAt first you suspect an act, but if it was, it was very good,\u201d said Chris Mecklin who was sitting next to Pham when the game\u2019s newbie realized he had made a mistake. He didn\u2019t know it would be a fortuitous one.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Minnesota man\u2019s mistake leads to winning poker\u2019s top prize", "title": "Minnesota man\u2019s mistake leads to winning poker\u2019s top prize", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Minnesota man\u2019s mistake leads to winning poker\u2019s top prize", "title": "Minnesota man\u2019s mistake leads to winning poker\u2019s top prize", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/14/minnesota_mans_mistake_leads_to_winning_pokers_top_prize/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/world-series-of-poker-lucky-win.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Minnesota man\u2019s mistake leads to winning poker\u2019s top prize", "title": "Minnesota man\u2019s mistake leads to winning poker\u2019s top prize", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/world-series-of-poker-lucky-win.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kimberly Pierceall", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb35\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s a totally different game.\nChristian Pham of St. Paul, Minnesota, did exactly that Thursday, rising to the top of 219 players, including a few poker icons.\nThe 40-year-old professional poker player said he intended to play no-limit Texas Hold \u2019em but instead inadvertently signed up for a different game happening the same day: so-called no-limit deuce-to-seven draw lowball.\nIt\u2019s another thing entirely to win a game you\u2019ve never played before.\nPham said he didn\u2019t realize his mistake until he was dealt five cards instead of the usual two."}
