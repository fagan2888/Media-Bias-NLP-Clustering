The online exchange is expected to be flooded with applicants during the three month enrollment period.\n\nSaturday, a healthcare workers union held an enrollment fair in South Sacramento to help locals navigate the process in person.\n\n\"It\u2019s amazing because before I\u2019ve been meaning to do a checkup to check on my health and I couldn\u2019t do it before and now I can. So I\u2019m really grateful for that,\" said attendee, Hiu Do.\n\nHiu Do was one of many who turned up at the free enrollment fair, organized by SEIU united healthcare workers west.\n\nAt the event, undocumented immigrant families could learn about health insurance options, people could register to vote, but the main goal was to get people signed up for Covered California.\n\n\"We have counselors to help them with that if they need and being that its different than last year was six months and this year was only three months,\u201d said SEIU organizer, Rosalia Rodriguez.\n\nOne by one, volunteers helped attendees navigate the online process, which had some major technical problems during open enrollment last year.\n\nAlthough officials say the issues have been fixed for this year\u2019s enrollment period, many appreciated the guidance.\n\n\"Today it was really good that I signed up here, I had people to talk to instead of online which was really confusing for me but this was so much easier so much faster,\u201d said Do.\n\nCovered California is hoping for 1.7 million people to be enrolled this year.\n\nFavian Betancourt is one of them. He is currently unemployed and says for him, getting health insurance will be a relief.\n\n\"I had a lot of worries I never knew if I was gonna get hurt or not so you have to be more safe. But now I can be safe and not worry about getting hurt,\u201d said Betancourt.\n\nSEIU will host about 80 open enrollment fairs throughout California over the next three months.\n\nOpen enrollment is underway now through February 15th.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Covered California open enrollment kicked off Saturday.
