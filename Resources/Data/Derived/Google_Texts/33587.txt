The National AIDS Education & Services for Minorities (NAESM) has served the HIV community for almost 25 years–and we wanted to highlight their conference, the National African American Leadership Conference on HIV/AIDS and Other Disparities, which is currently underway in Los Angeles (through January 24).

The conference is expected to draw a new generation of HIV professionals and advocates “to identify, discuss, and troubleshoot the intersection of health equity [and] social justice across a range of disciplines and sectors that define the experiences of black gay men.”

This conference is increasingly incorporating social media communication. You can follow along on digital media with these hashtags:
