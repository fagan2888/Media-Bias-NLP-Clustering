Phi Beta Sigma and Zeta Phi Beta teamed up with the Mississippi chapter of the March of Dimes to have a walk at Bonita for a good cause.

A morning full of cooking, dancing and most importantly walking. The focus of the March for Babies campaign is to bring important information to parents of prematurely born babies.

"When you have kids that are born premature, you have things you might need. March of Dimesâ€™ goal is to make sure that if a kid is born premature they know the necessary research to know how to have a healthy and happy baby," Meridian Zeta Phi Beta President Jacklyn Buford says.

This the walks second year raising funds for the Mississippi march of dimes. Many people came out.

"We haven't totaled it up, but have certainly exceeded last year, which I think was around $300,000," Meridian Phi Beta Sigma President says.

Mothers and fathers, who have had premature children were there to help raise awareness about the difficulties that come with having an early birth.

"This is new, we don't know what's going to happen. We're just praying every day that these babies get well. For everybody that is having a preemie baby; I know it's hard, but you have to keep praying and keep your faith and eventually everything will work out," mother of a premature baby Tina Kennedy says.
