Lachlan Fain Akins,20, one of the suspects in Friday's shooting of a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Officer had his first appearance in Bay County Saturday morning.

His charges include accessory after the fact to attempted murder of a law enforcement officer and armed burglary of a structure. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison.

Akins says he only lived in Panama City for three months, and before that he lived in Michigan.

His total bond is set at $175,000.

A court date for the second suspect, Samuel Wyndham Reager has not been set. Reager is in the hospital after being shot in the hand during the shootout with Officer Brady. Once he's released from the hospital Reager will be arrested and booked into the Bay County Jail.
