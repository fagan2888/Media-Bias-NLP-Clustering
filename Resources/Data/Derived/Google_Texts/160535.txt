On Sunday, a group of about twenty people gathered at the Quad City International Airport to welcome their friend, Irina Volk, home from three months of marine boot camp."It's been very hard seeing her gone for very long but it's good to see her coming home," said one of her friends, Cheyenne Claussen.

The U.S.O. and Patriot Guard members are stationed at the airport every day during the busiest flight times, greeting military members home for the holidays.

"It's the least that we can do to show our honor and actually show that we respect them and the job that they perform for us," said Doug Boemecke, a Patriot guard rider.
