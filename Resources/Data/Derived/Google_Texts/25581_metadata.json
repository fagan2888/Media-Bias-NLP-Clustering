Lead investigator Valerie Voon, an honorary consultant neuropsychiatrist at the university, told The Sunday Times the brain lit up \u2014 similar to the brains of alcoholics viewing an advertisement for Budweiser, Crown Royal, or similar invocations of the high life.\n\n\u201cWe found greater activity in an area of the brain called the ventral striatum, which is a reward centre, involved in processing reward, motivation, and pleasure,\u201d Voon said. \u201cWhen an alcoholic sees an ad for a drink, their brain will light up in a certain way and they will be stimulated in a certain way. We are seeing this same kind of activity in users of pornography.\u201d\n\nAlthough investigators have yet to publish the small study, UK's Channel 4 will air a documentary called \u201cPorn on the Brain\u201d in September, featuring the new research. The findings support a public policy initiative from Prime Minister David Cameron to limit access to online pornography, with the idea that pornography may affect human health in ways similar to substance addiction.\n\nAs pornography remains firmly protected by the First Amendment in the United States, the issue remains contentious in the UK. On Sunday, the pornography industry began a three-day trade conference in London for online purveyors with speeches including \u201cState of the Industry: The War on Porn.\u201d Meanwhile, women\u2019s rights activists in the country planned to protest outside the conference, accusing the industry of presenting a \u201ctoxic\u201d effect on people \u2014 a contrast to the more tolerant style of many younger American feminists billing themselves as \u201csex-positive.\u201d\n\nJulia Long, from the London Feminist Network, lambasted the industry insiders in an interview with The Independent. \u201cAt the very moment we are having a national debate on the harms of pornography, and not least the enormous amount of porn in teenagers' and children's lives, [the trade group] is holding sessions specifically aimed at combating any attempts to curb access to internet pornography,\u201d she said. \u201cPornographers don't care about the damage their industry does. Their only concern is profit.\u201d\n\nAmong sessions on mobile pornography and \u201clive/cam dating,\u201d conference attendees planned to discuss Cameron\u2019s conservative attack on the industry.\n\n\u201cSuccessive governments have mounted a sustained campaign against the UK porn industry and now's the time to fight back,\u201d trade lawyer Myles Jackson said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pornography addiction, pornography addiction similar to alcohol and drugs, porn addition", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "For some addicted to porn, the neurological response may be similar to alcohol and drug addiction.", "title": "Scientists Warn Of Pornography's Potential For Addiction", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/uk-debate-over-internet-porn-scientists-warn-pornographys-potential-addiction-257555", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/22/pornset5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For some addicted to porn, the neurological response may be similar to alcohol and drug addiction.", "title": "Scientists Warn Of Pornography's Potential For Addiction", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/uk-debate-over-internet-porn-scientists-warn-pornographys-potential-addiction-257555", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/22/pornset5.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/22/pornset5.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2013-09-22T14:11:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-22T14:11:55-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "For some addicted to porn, the neurological response may be similar to alcohol and drug addiction."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb15c\"", "article_summary": "People addicted to pornography display similar brain activity as those addicted to drugs or alcohol, an upcoming study from Cambridge University finds.\n\u201cSuccessive governments have mounted a sustained campaign against the UK porn industry and now's the time to fight back,\u201d trade lawyer Myles Jackson said in a statement.\nAs pornography remains firmly protected by the First Amendment in the United States, the issue remains contentious in the UK.\nResearchers scanned the brains of 19 study participants who acknowledged an addiction to pornography, using functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the brain\u2019s reaction to the material.\nTheir only concern is profit.\u201dAmong sessions on mobile pornography and \u201clive/cam dating,\u201d conference attendees planned to discuss Cameron\u2019s conservative attack on the industry."}
