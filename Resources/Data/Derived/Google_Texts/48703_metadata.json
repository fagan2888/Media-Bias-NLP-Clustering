But a new poll shows they still have that sinking feeling when it comes to long-term finances\u2014and they feel Washington is only hurting matters.\n\nHere\u2019s the good news: a whopping 90% believe they are realistically able to pay their day-to-day bills, and 68% believe they can make their mortgage payments, according to a Heartland Monitor poll commissioned by Allstate/National Journal. Despite that gloomy outlook on the economy at large\u2014more than half of respondents believe we\u2019re still in a recession\u2014Americans are also modestly optimistic about their financial future in the near term: 39% believe their personal financial situation will improve over the next year. Only 15% believe it will get worse.\n\nAnd there\u2019s lot of evidence to show that Americans are getting better at paying down debt and avoiding delinquency\u2014with the glaring exception of student loans. The average household is now spending about 10.5% of their post-tax income servicing their debt, the lowest level in 30 years, according to Ethan Harris, head of North America economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nBut Americans are still feeling anxious about their long-term finances, as many don\u2019t have the means to accumulate savings and wealth for the future. Nearly 40% say it\u2019s not realistic for them to invest their money for the future, as they can\u2019t afford to, according to the Heartland Monitor poll.\n\nOnly 37% have a employer-backed 401(k), and an even smaller percentage have an IRA or a personal investment account. Many are still afraid to even make the jump: 42% say it\u2019s too risky to rely on personal investments to pay for their retirement\u2014the same number as in March 2009, during the darkest months of the economic meltdown. And just half of Americans have enough savings to last them six months in case of an unexpected job loss or health emergency.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have jobs. And the people who have jobs\u2014the high unemployment is hurting their wage growth,\u201d Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said at a discussion of the poll\u2019s findings. \u201dThey\u2019re spending the money they have right now.\u201d\n\nSuch figures help explain the rapidly growing wealth gap between the richest households in the U.S. and everyone else\u2014a divide that\u2019s twice as large as the income gap. \u201cDow 16,000 is a driving force in runaway wealth inequality,\u201d says Justin King, policy director for the New America Foundation\u2019s asset-building program. \u201cThe housing crash is the worst for the middle and lower class, since all their eggs were in that basket, and since wages aren\u2019t going anywhere, there\u2019s no excess capacity for ordinary [people] to put into building up wealth.\u201d\n\nAnd Americans have little confidence that their representatives in Washington will be able to provide them with greater financial security. More than 60% believe that the federal government\u2019s budget troubles have had a negative impact on their personal financial situation, and nearly three-fourths believe we\u2019ll face another shutdown over the budget in January. \u201dThere is a very negative confidence shock from the brinksmanship moments,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBusinesses have learned not to trust the economy and not to trust Washington.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Most Americans now feel like they're able to pay their day-to-day bills.
