Union bosses think so, and they\u2019re asking the Supreme Court to agree.\n\nIn legal briefs filed this month in the Rebecca Friedrichs vs. California Teachers Association case, public employee unions argued the First Amendment shouldn\u2019t stop them from taking mandatory fees from teachers and other government workers.\n\nThe National Education Association, American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees implored the Court to stick with the precedent set in its 1977 Abood vs. Detroit Board of Education ruling.\n\nThe Abood ruling is the basis for \u201cagency shop\u201d contracts letting NEA, AFSCME and AFT take mandatory fees \u2014 a practice Friedrichs and her fellow plaintiffs believe violates the First Amendment by forcing them to fund political organizations.\n\nLawyers for NEA, CTA and several other California NEA affiliates argued \u201cthe State\u2019s interests as employer outweigh any interference with employees\u2019 First Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nNEA is the largest labor union in America. AFT and AFSCME \u2014 both members of the AFL-CIO coalition \u2014 are the nation\u2019s third and fourth largest unions. Each stands to lose tens of millions of dollars per year if forced union fees are outlawed in the public sector.\n\nFederal law requires unions to refund nonmembers for political activities; the Friedrichs plaintiffs consider all public union activity political, because it affects government services, government spending and government workers.\n\nPublic employee union collective bargaining, the NEA legal brief asserted, \u201cdoes not resemble the wide-ranging, open, and public debate that the First Amendment traditionally protects.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment interest against compelled subsidization is certainly not stronger than the interest in affirmative expression,\u201d NEA\u2019s lawyers wrote.\n\nLawyers for AFL-CIO and AFSCME made a similar argument, asking the Court to rule in favor of mandatory public-sector union fees because \u201cthe effect on employees\u2019 First Amendment rights is limited.\u201d\n\nSince employees can speak out against unions in their free time, \u201cthe government\u2019s reasonable understanding of the utility of the agency shop is sufficient to justify any impingement upon employees\u2019 First Amendment rights,\u201d AFL-CIO and AFSCME\u2019s lawyers asserted.\n\nAFT president Randi Weingarten and AFT\u2019s legal team said teachers \u201cbenefit substantially from union activities,\u201d whether they join their local union or not.\n\nWeingarten \u2014 who was paid $497,118 last year \u2014 said teachers shouldn\u2019t have \u201ca constitutional right to a free ride\u201d because they would hurt themselves and their students by choosing not to pay unions.\n\n\u201cWith reduced funds, unions will have fewer resources to devote to implementing school reform measures, participating in health and safety committees, or other collaborative projects,\u201d Weingarten warned.\n\nDuring its most recent fiscal year, AFT spent $37 million on explicitly political activities. The union funneled millions to Democratic campaigns, union think tanks and \u201cprogressive\u201d activist groups.\n\nRELATED: American Federation of Teachers union spends $37 million on politics\n\nUnion criticisms of Friedrichs meant for public consumption paint the plaintiffs as pawns of corporate interests. In a news release, AFT said the case \u201cthreatens to make it harder for working people to join together and speak out together.\u201d\n\nLarry Sand, president of the California Teachers Empowerment Network and a former teacher, called the unions\u2019 rhetoric \u201cbaloney.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lawsuit is simply about choice,\u201d Sand said in an email to Watchdog. \u201cTwenty-five states now ban forced union dues payments and are doing just fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking people will still be allowed to speak out together\u201d if the Court rules in favor of Friedrichs, Sand said. \u201cThe case is not about getting rid of unions.\u201d\n\nGary Beckner, chairman and president of the nonunion Association of American Educators, agreed.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit is all about a teacher\u2019s ultimate freedom of association,\u201d Beckner told Watchdog. \u201cIndividual educators should not be compelled to fund a hyper-partisan organization simply for the privilege of having a job in the public schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority of Americans, and the overwhelming majority of AAE members, support the fundamentals of the Friedrichs case and freedom of association,\u201d Beckner said.\n\nNEA, AFT and AFL-CIO all failed to respond to requests for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Should teachers be forced to pay left-wing labor unions in order to teach?
