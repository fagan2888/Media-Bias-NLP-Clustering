Replacing the \u201cdoc fix\u201d is just one of many issues those facilities face, said National Rural Health Association CEO Alan Morgan.\n\n\u201cAll of these rural hospitals are either operating on a break-even, or many of them are actually operating in the red,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cSo any reductions of percentages of the income coming in is going to threaten their existence.\u201d\n\nSince 2010, Morgan said, 48 rural hospitals have closed their doors \u2013 including two in Arizona \u2013 and 283 more hospitals nationwide are at risk of closing.\n\n\u201cOf our 15 critical-access hospitals in 2013, half of them had negative margins,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Derksen, director of the Arizona Center for Rural Health. \u201cIn other words they were losing money, and half of them were just barely above breaking even.\u201d\n\nCritical-access hospitals are those with 25 beds or fewer, most of which are in rural areas.\n\nArizona\u2019s rural hospitals have been largely resilient in the face of Medicare cuts, in part because of the state\u2019s voter-approved 2001 ballot initiative that expanded Medicaid, and because of early expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Derksen said rural Arizona hospitals still face \u201can array of threats.\u201d\n\nState lawmakers this month approved a state budget for fiscal 2016 that cut Medicaid by 5 percent. While that cut is estimated to result in direct savings of $127 million, advocates said repercussions in the healthcare industry are much larger.\n\n\u201cWhat it would cost the state is over $500 million in federal matching funds, and what it would cost the physicians and hospitals that now have to absorb that extra cost is $600 million,\u201d Derksen said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s not saving anyone any costs.\u201d\n\nRural residents have higher rates of hypertension, obesity, alcohol abuse, suicides, and fatal and serious-injury accidents, among other health-related issues. But providing them health care is challenging.\n\n\u201cThis is a place where those most in need of health care service have the fewest options available,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got disparities, you\u2019ve got chronic illness, you\u2019ve got obesity, you\u2019ve got high rates of diabetes. I could go on and on and on.\u201d\n\nRural hospital closures also have a ripple effect in their communities, often leading to the shutdown of other health-related facilities like pharmacies and nursing homes, and even driving out private practice physicians.\n\nPatients living in rural areas have no choice but to drive hours or delay medical care when their community hospital closes, and physicians fear that even the smallest change to the bottom line could push several rural Arizona hospitals over the edge.\n\n\u201cAny one of these threats as they play out could create a tidal wave that washes over them and puts them out of business,\u201d Derksen said.\n\nOne threat that could be eliminated is the so-called \u201cdoc fix\u201d legislation, which addresses Medicare payments and contains important provisions for low-volume hospitals that Morgan said are \u201cdesigned to keep rural hospitals open.\u201d\n\nThe current doc fix bill expires Tuesday, meaning Medicare payments for services performed from Wednesday on would be cut 21 percent. The House voted Thursday to make the fix permanent, and head off those cuts, but Senate leaders said early Friday they do not plan to take up the measure until after they return from a two-week recess.\n\nBecause it takes two weeks to process payments, senators believe they will be able to act before health care providers feel any cuts.\n\nIf they don\u2019t act, the 21 percent cut to Medicare payments kicks in. And rural hospitals would be forced to absorb increased costs.\n\nLawmakers have passed temporary fixes 17 times since 2002, but Morgan is hopeful for the permanent solution advanced by the House Thursday.\n\nThat measure passed 392-37 with an unusual degree of bipartisan support \u2013 just 33 Republicans and four Democrats voted against the bill.\n\n\u201cBoth policy leaders in D.C. and rural advocates understand that this patchwork system that we deal with yearly is not a sustainable path going forward,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThere needs to be a new way of looking at how we ensure rural access in the future.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "index.html", "image": "http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/15/03/27-rural-checkup-lead.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 House members repeatedly patted themselves on the back Thursday for passing a permanent fix to a broken Medicare funding formula, after years of \u201ckicking the can down the road.\u201d But even if the Senate votes to fix the funding formula by Tuesday \u2013 Medicare payments will be cut by 21 percent then if [...]", "title": "Even if Congress OKs \u2018doc fix,\u2019 rural hospitals face other challenges"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Replacing the \u201cdoc fix\u201d is just one of many issues those facilities face, said National Rural Health Association CEO Alan Morgan.\n\u201cAll of these rural hospitals are either operating on a break-even, or many of them are actually operating in the red,\u201d Morgan said.\nAnd rural hospitals would be forced to absorb increased costs.\n\u201cOf our 15 critical-access hospitals in 2013, half of them had negative margins,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Derksen, director of the Arizona Center for Rural Health.\n\u201cThis is a place where those most in need of health care service have the fewest options available,\u201d Morgan said."}
