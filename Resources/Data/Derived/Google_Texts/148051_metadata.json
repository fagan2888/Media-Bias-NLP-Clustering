Listen, I\u2019ve made clear, we\u2019re not going to default on our debt. And there are several paths forward that I\u2019m going to lay out for the members, and \u2014 but we\u2019re going to find some path forward here in the next few days, so we\u2019re going to move.\u201d\n\nHe also said it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d to get a clean debt ceiling increase, and blamed President Obama for walking away from negotiations, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of doing a clean debt ceiling, but we\u2019re going to talk to our members, and we\u2019ll find a way forward here in the next couple of days.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he would \u201ctry to clear the plate\u201d for the next speaker, Boehner responded, \u201cWell, we\u2019ve tried to do as much as we could. My big priority this week, is to re-authorize the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, a program I started 10 or 11 years ago, and it\u2019s helped \u2014 helps about 1,700 kids here in DC go to a school. It empowers their parents. But, dealing with the debt ceiling is a big priority. I think the Ex-Im Bank is going to be dealt with through a discharge petition, I expect to see that on the floor early next week. And I also expect you\u2019ll see action on the highway bill before the end of the month as well.\u201d\n\nAsked again if he would clear the plate, Boehner answered, \u201cI\u2019d like to if I could.\u201d\n\nBoehner further said that, \u201cwe\u2019re going to repeal as much of Obamacare as we can through the reconciliation process, the budget process, which isn\u2019t all of it, but you can basically gut Obamacare, which is what the House bill will do.\u201d He also stated such a bill \u201ccould be on the floor as early as this week. If not, it\u2019ll be on the floor next week.\u201d\n\nBoehner also discussed Rep.e Paul Ryan (R-WI) potential run for the speakership. He stated that he doesn\u2019t know what Ryan will do, but \u201cI think Paul would be a great speaker. I think he\u2019s got the skills to do the job, and I think he also has the credentials to reach out to traditional conservative organizations, to help bridge the gap that we have in the House today.\u201d He later stated, \u201cI hope he does decide to run, and if he does, I think he\u2019ll be elected.\u201d\n\nBoehner added that he believes Ryan will be able to get the votes necessary to win if he runs, and \u201cI\u2019ve made it clear to the members that I\u2019m committed to an orderly transition to a new speak. But I\u2019ve also made clear I expect to be out of there by the end of this month. And I have confidence that I\u2019ll be out of there by the end of this month.\u201d\n\nAs far as the timeframe, Boehner said Ryan\u2019s decision could come sooner rather than later.\n\n\u201cI do expect that we\u2019ll know later on this evening what his answer is,\u201d Boehner added.\n\nBoehner also defended his record as speaker, stating, \u201cWe got an awful lot of things done. If you look at the four and a half years, or almost five years that I\u2019ve been speaker, we protected 99% of the American people from an increase in our taxes. We saved $2.1 trillion in spending over ten years. There\u2019s a reason that the budget deficit is one-third of what it was when we came into power. We made the first major entitlement reforms in 20 years, saving Medicare over the course of the next 30 or 40 years, $2.9 trillion. there\u2019s a lot that we can point to, and there\u2019s another long list of things that didn\u2019t happen, because we had a Republican majority here in Washington.\u201d\n\nHe also argued the House has \u201cabsolutely\u201d done an effective job using the power of the purse \u201cto the extent that we can, and we\u2019ve moved bills to the Senate. But you know in the Senate if you have 54 votes, you don\u2019t have a majority. you\u2019ve got to have 60 votes to move things in the Senate. And so there\u2019s a lot of things that couldn\u2019t happen in the Senate, that came out of the House. It\u2019s part of the legislative process.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Boehner stated he'd \"like to\" clear the plate for the next speaker and that he hopes Paul Ryan runs for speaker and would be \"great\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "John Boehner stated he'd \"like to\" clear the plate for the next speaker and that he hopes Paul Ryan runs for speaker and would be \"great\"", "title": "Boehner: 'I'd Like To' Clear the Plate for the Next Speaker, Ryan Would Be 'Great Speaker' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Boehner-1020-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-10-20T16:03:20-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/10/20/boehner-id-like-to-clear-the-plate-for-the-next-speaker-ryan-would-be-great-speaker/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Boehner stated he'd \"like to\" clear the plate for the next speaker and that he hopes Paul Ryan runs for speaker and would be \"great\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Boehner-1020-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Boehner: 'I'd Like To' Clear the Plate for the Next Speaker, Ryan Would Be 'Great Speaker' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, Debt ceiling, Ex-Im Bank, John Boehner, Paul Ryan,Breitbart TV,Boehner", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-10-20T15:58:29-07:00", "section": "Breitbart TV", "modified_time": "2015-10-20T16:03:20-07:00", "tag": "Paul Ryan", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROutgoing House Speaker Representative John Boehner (R-OH) stated he\u2019d \u201clike to\u201d clear the plate for the next speaker and that he hopes Paul Ryan runs for speaker and would be \u201cgreat\u201d on Tuesday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\nHe stated that he doesn\u2019t know what Ryan will do, but \u201cI think Paul would be a great speaker.\nBoehner also defended his record as speaker, stating, \u201cWe got an awful lot of things done.\nListen, I\u2019ve made clear, we\u2019re not going to default on our debt.\nAnd so there\u2019s a lot of things that couldn\u2019t happen in the Senate, that came out of the House."}
