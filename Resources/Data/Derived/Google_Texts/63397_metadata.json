We won\u2019t know specific amounts until November, he noted, but it could change the rhetoric of mayoral hopefuls. \u201cDuring the 2012 mayoral campaign, candidates\u2019 promises for big new initiatives at times conflicted with the reality that pension headwinds meant the money wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s a Parklet? This is.\n\nWander by the Caff\u00e9 Calabria coffeehouse in the North Park neighborhood and you\u2019ll notice something new: it\u2019s a parklet. \u201cThere\u2019s no room to kick a soccer ball, but it is a nice place to drink coffee and read a book,\u201d reported Andrew Keatts. It\u2019s got seating for 20, and despite what you may think on first glance, it is free and open for public use. It won\u2019t be the last one you see, either. The city wants to \u201cbuild five to 10 of the pedestrian-friendly areas citywide,\u201d Keatts wrote.\n\nPublic Records Law Needs Accountability\n\nJoel Hoffman has been asking about ideas for increasing transparency in city government, and wrote about some responses he\u2019s gotten from the community. Former Voice of San Diego Editor Andy Dononhue summed up the frustration felt by many in San Diego with his suggestion: he wants \u201creal punishment for failure to comply\u201d with public records requests in a timely manner.\n\nHealthcare Q-and-A: Separated Family, One Plan?\n\nSpeak City Heights has been taking questions about the looming start of Covered California, the state-wide insurance exchange that will implement the Affordable Care Act. In the most recent of the Second Opinion series, they tackle the question of whether a family with one member living in a different region can still cover the whole family under one plan.\n\nCovered California spokeswoman Ann Gonzales says it won\u2019t work. \u201cPlans in different regions come with different price tags, and each insurance provider has to be paid separately,\u201d reported Speak City Heights. The family member living in a different region can still participate in the exchange, but would have to purchase an individual plan.\n\nSend in your questions about insurance coverage under Covered California.\n\nNew Principals in High Schools Today\n\nAs Christie Ritter prepared to send her daughter off to high school, a recent shake up of principals in the San Diego Unified School District had her feeling nervous. \u201cPrincipals are the heart of a school,\u201d wrote Ritter. \u201cThirty-six new principals will be there to open the school doors on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nMeeting of the Minds Returns\n\nOur next Meeting of the Minds event is coming up on Sept. 18. These popular events have taken place in unusual places all over San Diego and feature speakers presenting in the pecha-kucha style, which is rapid-fire and visually compelling. Kelly Bennett will return to host the event featuring six presenters covering theater, music, dance and other arts. We\u2019ll be in the East Village neighborhood of Downtown San Diego. This Meeting of the Minds event, however, is open to members only, but we\u2019ll be registering new members onsite with a special deal.\n\nPointing Fingers\n\nMember Bill Bradshaw wrote in sarcastically blaming Carl DeMaio\u2019s policies and campaign strategies for Bob Filner\u2019s successful bid for mayor. \u201cSo DeMaio is the villain in this saga, no doubt to the delight of his many detractors,\u201d Bradshaw wrote.\n\nLibrary School Now Open\n\n\u201cIt may be the first public school in the country located inside a library.\u201d While San Diego\u2019s new Central Library won\u2019t be open for weeks, the school inside of it opens its doors to full-time classes today. KPBS toured the new charter school on the first day teachers were working full-time and construction was still being completed. The school, e3 Civic High, is home to 260 freshman and sophomores and it\u2019s built for working in teams. \u201cSome of the classrooms look like conference rooms and other spaces are designed to bring teachers and students together in casual ways,\u201d wrote KPBS. \u201cTo match the sophisticated environment, the charter school\u2019s students will have to dress professionally.\u201d\n\nD-day For Mayoral Potentials\n\nWe\u2019re expecting an announcement today from former City Councilman Carl DeMaio about his intentions on running for mayor. A Politico story circulated over the weekend claiming that DeMaio had already decided to stop campaigning for Congress and instead run for mayor of San Diego. DeMaio denied on Sunday that he had made his decision, and instead released a picture of himself with his family holding both \u201cDeMaio for Mayor\u201d and \u201cDeMaio for Congress\u201d signs. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached max coy,\u201d wrote Scott Lewis.\n\nThe U-T, one of DeMaio\u2019s fiercest backers last year, has told him not to do it. They said it was no time for \u201copportunists,\u201d which he would be if he bailed on his congressional run. \u201cHis in-your-face doggedness and sometimes abrasive manner is just what is needed to fix a broken Congress.\u201d\n\nTodd Gloria also said yesterday that he would announce his own decision about running for mayor on Tuesday.\n\nNews Nibbles\n\n\u2022 Filner coverage topped the list of our most-read articles last week, followed by our coverage of large community construction projects that recently went up with uncharacteristic ease.\n\n\u2022 Smoking is now banned on the University of California San Diego campus.\n\n\u2022 Members of San Diego\u2019s congressional delegation have been speaking out about American intervention in the Syrian conflict.\n\n\u2022 The U-T took an interview with San Diego Planning Director Bill Fulton, who says he really wants to re-plan Mission Valley.\n\n\u2022 NBC San Diego has a gallery of the amazing talent that was on display this weekend at the U.S. Sand Sculpting Competition.\n\n\u2022 UT San Diego published its own photo gallery of the bridges of San Diego County.\n\n\u2022 San Diego Police Department will soon begin rolling out new bigger, faster patrol cars.\n\nWe\u2019re Getting Quite A Reputation\n\nThe National Zoo in Washington, D.C. welcomed a new panda bear cub last week, which many San Diegans may have welcomed with a yawn considering how good our zoo\u2019s pandas are at procreating. The Atlantic highlighted a New Yorker article about why San Diego pandas, to put it bluntly, are way better at having sex than the ones at the National Zoo.\n\nOur pandas apparently have \u201cno need for sex aids fashioned by zoo carpenters,\u201d compared to the pandas at the National Zoo which were tempted into procreating using a variety of methods including the administration of Viagra. None of it worked; ultimately the cub they have now was conceived artificially.\n\nSeth Hall is a local writer and technologist.
