By denying Medicaid coverage for abortion care, the Hyde Amendment, which disproportionately impacts women of color, imposes economic barriers on those struggling to get by and in need of safe, affordable reproductive health care. Women who seek abortions but are denied are three times more likely to fall into poverty than those who can get an abortion.\n\nProtecting survivors of human trafficking and providing affordable abortion care are not mutually exclusive, but hijacking the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act to codify and expand the scope of Hyde does neither. When we are talking about the health and well-being of society\u2019s most marginalized, we must get the facts straight. Politicians should not treat safe and affordable reproductive health care as a political bargaining chip in any legislation.\n\nJessica Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas, Jackson Heights, N.Y.\n\nThe writer is executive director at the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health.\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn annual appropriations bills since 1976, Democrats routinely have united with Republicans in passing the Hyde Amendment, which simply prevents taxpayer monies from funding abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to save the life of the mother. Americans overwhelmingly oppose opening public coffers to the abortion industry.\n\nNevertheless, Democrats increasingly have been injecting abortion partisanship into human trafficking programs. Congressional hearings revealed how Obama administration officials denied a grant to a faith-based organization over abortion and other morally objectionable issues.\n\nMany would note that abortion would only add to the trauma that human trafficking victims have already experienced. Yet even the Hyde Amendment does not disallow government-funded abortions in cases of rape, nor does it prevent abortions paid for with nongovernment funds. So protests over the Hyde Amendment in this trafficking-victims program are little more than partisan politics designed to enforce a radical abortion ideology.\n\nJonathan Imbody, Ashburn\n\nThe writer is vice president for government relations for the Christian Medical Association.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "jessica gonzalez-rojas, abortion, hyde amendment, justice for victims of trafficking act, sex trafficking, human trafficking, abortion federal funds, jonathan imbody", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The March 16 editorial \u201cRemember the children\u201d understated the harmful, even life-threatening, effects of the Hyde Amendment, which has a devastating effect on individuals, families and communities.
