I certainly contributed to that frenzy.\n\n\n\nBut the 2015 enrollment period has been a snoozefest. I wrote one blog post about back in November and haven\u2019t revisited the topic since.\n\n\n\nEven the enrollment totals have tracked expectations.\n\n\n\nIn Indiana, there were 132,000 sign-ups on the exchange last year. And the nine insurers that signed up to compete on the exchange this year predicted they would add 70,000 to 75,000 new customers for 2015.\n\n\n\nThat would put total 2015 enrollment between 200,000 and 2010,000.\n\n\n\nRight on schedule, enrollment hit 198,635 on Feb. 11, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\n\n(This number is likely to shrink in the next few weeks, as roughly 40,000 exchange customers that now qualify for the expanded Healthy Indiana Plan switch over to that state-funded program.)\n\n\n\nNo news is good news for consumers\u2014and probably for the long-term success of the exchanges. (However, the U.S. Supreme Court could throw the exchanges into chaos again this summer if it strikes down the tax credits that nearly one out of every nine Hoosiers have received to reduce the cost of coverage.)\n\n\n\nBut here\u2019s something that caught my attention. One of the newcomers to the Indiana exchange this year, Ohio-based CareSource, has far outstripped even its own projections for enrollment.\n\n\n\nAs of Feb. 12, CareSource had 21,000 exchange customers in Indiana. That was more than double the 10,000 it expected right before enrollment began in November. And it was more than five times as much as it projected last May, when it first filed paperwork to sell on the exchange.\n\n\n\nCareSource\u2019s premiums were the lowest available this year\u2014even lower than those offered by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. That has swayed a lot of customers, noted health insurance broker Tony Nefouse\u2014although Anthem will remain, by far, the largest exchange enrollment in 2015. It attracted 83,000 Indiana health plan members during last year\u2019s enrollment period, and expected enrollment to grow about 26 percent this year.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe people that were really sensitive to cost, they moved from Anthem and went to a lower-costing plan,\u201d Nefouse said. In Marion County, Anthem\u2019s cheapest plan was 13 percent more expensive than CareSource\u2019s cheapest plan, even before the impact of Obamacare\u2019s tax credits.\n\n\u201cObviously our price is very competitive,\u201d said Steve Smitherman, CareSource\u2019s executive director for Indiana. CareSource is running a health maintenance organization, which limits which providers are covered. Among the major health systems in the Indianapolis area, only Indiana Unviersity Health is part of CareSource\u2019s provider network.\n\n\n\nAlso, CareSource has blitzed the Indianapolis and Bloomington areas with advertising\u2014on radio, on billboards, on TV. And it has made scores of presentations at community meetings designed to help Hoosiers get signed up for coverage.\n\n\n\n\u201cBrand awareness was obviously a concern for us, because we were new to the marketplace,\u201d Smitherman said. The company hired The Ohlmann Group, a marketing firm based in Dayton, Ohio, to create and place ads all over the Indianapolis market\u2014so many, in fact, that the average Indianapolis radio listener hears CareSource\u2019s name 11.6 times per day.\n\n\n\nOther health insurers I checked with weren\u2019t disclosing their exchange enrollment, in part because it\u2019s a moving target. There be a rush of enrollment this weekend. Plus, any 2014 exchange customer gets a 90-day grace period, beginning on Jan. 1, before he or she must make a payment in order to renew coverage for 2015. That means any payments made by March 31 would restart coverage for 2015.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am not sure that Marketplace plans will know a solid membership total until April,\u201d wrote Jamie Bruce, chief development and marketing officer at MDwise Inc., an Indianapolis-based health plan that expected to add about 10,000 members to the 28,000 it signed up last year. \u201cOur retention goals have exceeded our original expectations, we believe in large part [due] to renewing members\u2019 fear of another bad Healthcare.gov experience like last year. Our new member enrollment has been at the higher end of our original expectations.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, if you\u2019ve tuned out Obamacare open enrollment these past few months, no problem. Just tune back in in a couple months to see the final results on how it all shook out.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A sleepy season for Obamacare sign-ups will end on Sunday will overall enrollment almost exactly where insurers predicted it would be.
