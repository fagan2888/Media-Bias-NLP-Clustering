Powerhouse Northwestern Memorial HealthCare could extend its reach further west. The Chicago-based system and community-focused KishHealth System have signed a letter of intent to explore an affiliation.

This would be the second deal in less than a year for Northwestern. In September, Winfield-based Cadence Health became part of Northwestern, making it a four-hospital network.

“Our board of directors employed a thoughtful process that led them to conclude that Northwestern Memorial HealthCare would best enable KishHealth to build upon its already high standard of care,” KishHealth CEO Kevin Poorten said in a statement. “The proposed alignment positions us to serve the future needs of our patients and community.”

"KishHealth is recognized for their commitment to high-quality care and clinical excellence," Northwestern CEO Dean Harrison said in the statement. "Together with the physicians and staff of KishHealth, we look forward to the opportunity to provide patients in DeKalb County and northern Illinois more convenient access to enhanced clinical innovation and breakthrough research as part of our integrated academic health system."

DeKalb-based KishHealth, about 70 miles west of Northwestern, has two hospitals: Kishwaukee Hospital in DeKalb and Valley West Hospital in Sandwich. The health system also provides hospice, home health and behavioral health services, according to its website.

Northwestern had $2.4 billion in 2014 revenue, nearly 11 times more than KishHealth's $221.7 million, according to financial statements.

While the two systems will take the next few months to define how they would affiliate, KishHealth likely would become part of Northwestern as Cadence did, Northwestern spokesman Chris King said.

OBAMACARE CHANGES DROVE DECISION

King traced the ties between the health systems to the relationship between KishHealth and Cadence. Some Cadence physicians also practice at KishHealth facilities.

“As Cadence merged with Northwestern, the opportunity presented itself again to continue down the path,” King said.

The deal would give patients in DeKalb and northern Illinois access to the clinical innovation, research and physicians of an academic medical center, King said.

Mike Kokott, KishHealth assistant vice president of marketing and planning, said there was no “aha moment” when KishHealth board members decided the system needed a partner. It was more of an evolution, particularly driven by federal health care reform and the need to coordinate patient care.

Under Obamacare, health systems and physicians are paid to keep patients healthy and away from expensive overnight stays and unnecessary procedures. Otherwise, they could take a financial hit to their bottom lines.

While Cadence physicians already come to campus to provide cardiology services, and doctors at Maywood-based Loyola University Health System provide cancer care, Kokott said KishHealth was looking to fill gaps in services.

Among the biggest: patients typically must leave the community for specialty services that KishHealth doesn’t have. And that doesn’t bode well for preventing patients from slipping through the cracks.

“Once a patient leaves our health system, once they get discharged from that academic medical center, they may or may not have that care switched back to their primary care physician,” Kokott said.
