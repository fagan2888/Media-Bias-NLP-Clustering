(WFSB) — ENFIELD, Connecticut – A local dentist accused of making dangerous decisions and putting lives at risk has had his license suspended and was ordered to stay away from his patients.

State health officials said Dr. Rashmi Patel has been ordered to stay away from his patients after one died and another spent six days in the hospital.

The Department of Public Health and the state Dental Commission suspended Patel’s license last month.

Both began investigating after receiving an anonymous tip in February following the death of a patient.

State investigators said Patel not only broke the law, but the public’s health, safety and welfare was in “clear and immediate danger” before they became involved.
