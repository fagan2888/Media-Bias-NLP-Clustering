Such products, which cost less and provide fewer benefits than conventional insurance, can play a role similar to \u201cmedigap\u201d coverage, which fills holes in the Medicare program for seniors, insurers say.\n\nThe policies are promoted as helping cover out-of-pocket expenses that can reach thousands of dollars in plans offered by employers and the health-care law\u2019s online marketplace.\n\n\u201cThese supplemental health products have been recently \u2014 and we believe will be in the future \u2014 one of the fastest-growing components of the employer benefits market,\u201d said Todd Katz, an executive vice president with MetLife.\n\nSome experts, however, see risk for policyholders in the lightly regulated plans, which tend to be highly profitable for insurers and might be mistaken for more generous coverage.\n\n\u201cAn individual has to understand this is something you buy to cover expenses that aren\u2019t covered by a comprehensive medical plan,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University and a consumer health specialist. \u201cIf employers are not offering it as [full] health insurance coverage, and if somebody gets sick and has some extra expenses, it might be okay.\u201d\n\nFederal regulators moved to ease restrictions on supplemental medical plans in January following industry lobbying while also noting \u201ca significant increase\u201d in such policies. The Labor Department signaled it would let plans pay benefits for each medical service, such as hospitalization or office visits. A previous rule, requiring payments per day or week, would have restricted consumer choice, the industry argued.\n\nNot long ago, limited medical plans were thought to be doomed or severely restricted by the Affordable Care Act. According to figures from the Eastbridge Consulting Group, sales of supplemental hospital policies plunged in 2012 as the industry prepared for health-law rules requiring minimum coverage.\n\nInstead of disappearing, the plans are rebounding, offered through employers or to individual consumers.\n\nThe health-care law requires most people to obtain and most employers to offer major medical coverage with certain essential benefits. Even so, what consumers pay out-of-pocket through these plans keeps rising as employers and insurers try to control their own costs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been this demand in the market for a while\u201d for supplemental coverage, said Todd Yates, a managing partner with Hill, Chesson & Woody, a North Carolina benefits consultant that expanded its supplemental-insurance sales team. \u201cBut it\u2019s just continued to grow as employers offered leaner and leaner plans.\u201d\n\nFor employer plans, the average deductible hit $1,135 last year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Deductibles for silver and bronze plans, the most popular coverage sold to individuals through the health-care law\u2019s online exchanges, averaged $2,567 and $4,343, respectively, in a study by Avalere Health.\n\nA typical limited plan, also known as fixed-indemnity coverage, might cost $13 to $45 per month, depending on a customer\u2019s age, and pay $10,000 or $20,000 upon diagnosis of a critical illness, according to Hill, Chesson. Other plans pay for hospitalization, cancer or accidents.\n\nFixed cash benefits are the common feature. Unlike with medigap, regulators have proposed banning supplemental insurance for those under 65 with payouts that are explicitly triggered by what\u2019s left uncovered in another policy.\n\nEven when employers offer the plans, workers generally pay the premiums through payroll deduction. Aflac is one of the biggest sellers of limited health plans.\n\nLast year, MetLife started offering insurance that pays limited amounts for hospitalization, cancer or accidents, Katz said. Other sellers include Nationwide, Allstate and Aetna. In November, an affiliate of Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield said it would start selling coverage that pays off for hospital admissions.\n\nConsumer advocates want carriers to clearly disclose that limited plans are not minimum essential coverage under the ACA and won\u2019t by themselves fulfill an individual\u2019s requirement to be insured.\n\nNeither will the policies automatically fill all out-of-pocket gaps in a high-deductible policy, analysts say. A limited cancer plan will not pay anything if you have a heart attack. A hospital plan will not cover out-of-pocket costs at a doctor\u2019s office.\n\nOthers warn that fixed-indemnity plans might not be a good financial deal. Unlike major medical plans, which under the health-care law must spend 80 percent or 85 percent of their revenue on medical care, limited plans often spend 60 percent or less on claims, agents say. The rest goes for profits, overhead and broker commissions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a big believer in these things,\u201d said John Jaggi, an insurance broker in Forsyth, Ill. For agents, he said, \u201cthe commissions can run anywhere from 30 to 45 percent in the first year. . . . And it\u2019s possible to do that because you have such a high profit in these things and you don\u2019t pay the claims out.\u201d\n\nTo Thomas Rice, a health policy professor at University of California at Los Angeles, the surge in supplemental plans for those 65 and under sounds familiar. The early days of medigap plans for seniors in the 1970s were marked by lax regulation, expensive policies, a lack of standards and consumer confusion, he said.\n\nEventually, congressional hearings, new laws and industry reform improved medigap plans, he said.\n\nNo matter who the customer is, \u201ca policy like this has a place if it returns the vast majority of premiums in terms of benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s keeping 40 percent of the premiums, it\u2019s a disservice.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
