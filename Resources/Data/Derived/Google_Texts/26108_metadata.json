John Kasich capped his landslide re-election win with a victory speech praising Obamacare while artfully avoiding the unpopular law\u2019s name.\n\nRunning as a foe of Obamacare and simultaneously promoting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion as his own program for the drug-addicted and mentally ill, Kasich beat hapless Democrat Ed FitzGerald 64 percent to 33 percent.\n\nTuesday night Kasich repeated a campaign theme, saying, \u201cas we\u2019ve gotten stronger, as we\u2019ve had more job growth, as our finances have improved, I am so excited about the fact that we have been able to reach out to many people who had been forgotten.\u201d\n\nThis was one of several arguments Kasich offered for the Obamacare Medicaid expansion in 2013. When Kasich\u2019s fellow Republicans in the Ohio General Assembly refused to take billions in new federal spending to redefine Ohio\u2019s Medicaid program, Kasich expanded Medicaid unilaterally.\n\nThe governor\u2019s re-election victory speech listed \u201cthe mentally ill,\u201d \u201cthe drug-addicted,\u201d and \u201cthe working poor\u201d among those his administration has helped. These are the groups Kasich talks about whenever asked about Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which he claims has nothing to do with Obamacare.\n\nBy Kasich\u2019s formulation, Medicaid expansion is a laser-focused state-level handout taxpayers can afford because of his successful economic policies. In reality, Ohio has already spent $1.7 billion in Obamacare money on Medicaid expansion.\n\nUnder Obamacare, states have the option of taking additional Medicaid funds from the federal government \u2014 but in order to do so, must expand Medicaid from a program for the most vulnerable into a sweeping entitlement based only on income.\n\nKasich\u2019s own Department of Medicaid has estimated \u201cabout half\u201d of the Ohioans covered by the Obamacare Medicaid expansion are employed. In 2012, Urban Institute estimated 90 percent of uninsured Ohioans eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare would be working-age, able-bodied adults without dependent children.\n\nIgnoring concerns about program effectiveness, costs, access to doctors and the impact on the workforce, Kasich expanded Medicaid last autumn to meet Obamacare\u2019s guidelines and bring new federal deficit spending to Ohio.\n\nKasich continued Tuesday\u2019s victory speech by adding, \u201cwe\u2019re beginning to show the rest of the country that by reaching out, by having a good head and building a strong economy but a good heart that recognizes the struggle of those who oftentimes had been left behind, people now in Ohio feel included.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey feel optimistic,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cThey feel hopeful.\u201d\n\nBy the time Kasich expanded Medicaid to meet Obamacare\u2019s funding requirements, the state\u2019s rebound from the 2007-2009 recession had slowed dramatically.\n\nEmployment in Ohio is still more than 100,000 jobs below pre-recession highs, and more than 300,000 jobs shy of the 5.63 million peak reached before the 2001 recession. Since Jan. 1, over 400,000 Ohioans have been added to Medicaid under Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion while the state has gained just 34,500 jobs.\n\n\u201cIt seems that Gov. Kasich \u2018forgot\u2019 about the 40,000 children and adults with developmental disabilities that he left languishing on Medicaid waiting lists when he pushed 400,000 able-bodied adults to the front of the line,\u201d Foundation for Government Accountability research director Jonathan Ingram told Ohio Watchdog via email.\n\n\u201cSadly, Gov. Kasich\u2019s unilateral ObamaCare expansion is poised to reverse any gains Ohio\u2019s economy has made,\u201d Ingram added. \u201cAs even the Congressional Budget Office admits, ObamaCare expansion discourages work and shrinks the economy. If past expansions are any indication, nearly 100,000 able-bodied adults could drop out of Ohio\u2019s workforce as a result of Kasich\u2019s expansion, while many more could reduce their hours or work only seasonally.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith a new Republican Congress elected on the promise of ObamaCare repeal, how long will Gov. Kasich continue to undermine them with his false rhethoric meant to protect his own ObamaCare expansion?\u201d\n\nEmbracing Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion and justifying it with rhetoric similar to President Obama\u2019s would be difficult for a Republican who didn\u2019t control his state Republican Party and could not rely on the press to agitate on his behalf. These are not concerns that apply to Kasich.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
