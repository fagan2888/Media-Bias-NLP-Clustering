â€” A Sanford man is charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of a 46-year-old man, police said Thursday.

Sanford police said they went to 405 Dudley Ave. on Tuesday for a report of a gunshot victim and found Michael Andre Smith with injuries. He was taken to UNC Hospitals, where he died on Christmas.

Police on Wednesday found Phillip Howard Fortune, 20, of the 600 block of McIver Street, at his residence and arrested him without incident. He was held without bond in the Lee County jail.

Police did not say whether the men knew each other or release more details about the crime.
