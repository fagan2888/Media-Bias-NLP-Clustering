Levon Helm Danny Clinch

After Levon Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998, the singer, songwriter and drummer pared down his tour schedule and instead invited fans to come to him. Helm, once part of the archetypal roots-rock group the Band, launched the Midnight Ramble concert series in 2004. Held on his property in Woodstock, N.Y., the Midnight Ramble shows featured an impressive roster of guest performers, including Elvis Costello, Emmylou Harris, Norah Jones, Dr. John, Steve Earle, My Morning Jacket and plenty more. Helm released a selection of performances in 2006 as part of a two-volume live set, “The Midnight Ramble Sessions.”

Two years after his death in 2012 from a recurrence of cancer, his estate is releasing a third installment, “The Levon Helm Band — The Midnight Ramble Sessions, Vol. 3,” which premieres today on Speakeasy. The latest edition features the Levon Helm Band with special guests including Allen Toussaint (with Costello on guitar) on “A Certain Girl,” former Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson on “Shake Your Money Maker” and singer and guitarist Jimmy Vivino, the bandleader for “Conan,” on “God Don’t Ever Change.” Helm also sings lead vocals on a handful of tracks here, and so do daughter Amy Helm and guitarist and music director Larry Campbell.

“Levon would see it as a great representation of the vitality of the second act of his career,” Campell says by e-mail.

Helm picked the 13 songs himself from 20 or so possible titles (culled from many hours of recordings) before he died, and also designed the cover art. “The Levon Helm Band — The Midnight Ramble Sessions, Vol. 3,” comes out July 1 on Vanguard Records.
