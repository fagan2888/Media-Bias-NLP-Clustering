Much of the area was in the old 22nd Congressional District, where Maurice Hinchey earned a reputation as a member of the progressive wing of the Democratic caucus before retiring in 2012. The redrawing of district lines that year led to Gibson, who was elected to the 20th Congressional District in 2010, into a matchup against Ulster-based Democratic candidate Julian Schreibman.\n\nGibson, a 50-year-old retired Army officer, beat Schreibman 53 to 47 percent (despite losing Ulster), while a Democratic tide gave Barack Obama a 52 to 46 percent margin of victory in the district over Republican Mitt Romney.\n\nGibson\u2019s 2012 victory in part stemmed from a successful outreach effort to Democratic and non-enrolled voters in the new district, where Republicans hold a slim 147,000-to-144,000 edge in party affiliation. Unaffiliated voters account for 126,000 of NY-19\u2019s electorate. Several prominent Ulster County Democrats, including current Ulster County Legislature chairman John Parete, supported Gibson in 2012 based on his promise to be an independent voice who could make alliances with Democrats and help break Congressional deadlock.\n\nWorking against the Democrats this year is the fact that it\u2019s a midterm election; past trends suggest an older, whiter and more conservative electorate, especially compared to the pro-Obama vote in 2012. It\u2019s also the sixth year of the president\u2019s administration, when traditionally the presidential party loses seats.\n\nGibson, a retired U.S. Army colonel and former professor of American government at West Point, has cast a handful of votes that place him, according to most independent political analyses, less conservative than most members of the Republican Congressional caucus and in the center-right of Congress as a whole.\n\nAfter supporting the first \u201cRyan budget,\u201d which called for severe cuts in entitlement programs, Gibson voted against the next three. He was one of a handful of Republicans who broke ranks with his caucus rather than risk a government shutdown in a failed effort to defund Obamacare. He voted for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and against a law that would allow intelligence agencies to share cyber-security information with the private sector.\n\nOn foreign policy, Gibson whose 24-year Army career included three tours leading combat units in Iraq, has emerged as an advocate for a smaller U.S. military footprint overseas and more limits on presidential authority to deploy combat forces without Congressional approval. He\u2019s a Congressional co-chair of \u201cNo Labels,\u201d a group which promotes bipartisan compromise.\n\nWorking against gridlock\n\nGibson says he\u2019s accustomed to criticism from both the left and the right for his compromise votes on controversial issues. \u201cIf you think gridlock is a problem, then you\u2019ve got to have the temperament to work together with the guys across the aisle,\u201d said Gibson. \u201cIf you say, I have to have 100 percent of what I want, then you have to accept the status quo. [Eldridge] doesn\u2019t seem to get that.\u201d\n\nIn response to complaints of a \u201cdo-nothing Congress,\u201d Gibson points out votes on a water bill which included aid to victims of Superstorm Sandy, a farm bill that included first-time authorization for an industry-wide marketing campaign for New York\u2019s organic farmers, and the first federally authorized budget in five years. Gibson said that he\u2019s also backed legislation in Congress that added resources to combat opiate abuse and fund Lyme disease research in New York State.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually getting things done that are important to upstate New York communities,\u201d said Gibson.\n\nGibson\u2019s opponents, meanwhile say that his reputation as an independent Republican voice says more about the lock-step nature of the GOP House caucus than his own political inclinations. They note that Gibson has remained solid with his caucus on issues like abortion \u2014 he voted for a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks \u2014 and opposition to raising the federal minimum wage. He signed a pledge, promoted by Americans for Prosperity \u2014 a Koch Industries-funded conservative activist group \u2014 promising not to vote for any climate change legislation that would raise government revenue. His unwillingness to risk a government shutdown aside, he\u2019s backed a \u201crepeal and replace\u201d strategy regarding Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Woodstock Times", "description": "The local race for Congress pits a relative newcomer to the Hudson Valley with deep pockets and a progressive agenda who\u2019s battling the \u201ccarpetbagger\u201d label against an incumbent who\u2019s positioned hi\u2026", "title": "This fall\u2019s big race", "url": "http://www.woodstockx.com/2014/07/25/this-falls-big-race/", "image": {"width": 290, "identifier": "http://www.woodstockx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gibson-eldridge-SQ.jpg", "height": 290}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-25T10:30:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-24T17:04:52+00:00"}}, "article_summary": "Much of the area was in the old 22nd Congressional District, where Maurice Hinchey earned a reputation as a member of the progressive wing of the Democratic caucus before retiring in 2012.\nThe redrawing of district lines that year led to Gibson, who was elected to the 20th Congressional District in 2010, into a matchup against Ulster-based Democratic candidate Julian Schreibman.\n\u201cNY-19\u201d covers all of Ulster, Delaware, Greene, Columbia, Otsego, Schoharie and Sullivan counties and parts of Broome, Dutchess, Rensselaer and Montgomery counties.\nAfter supporting the first \u201cRyan budget,\u201d which called for severe cuts in entitlement programs, Gibson voted against the next three.\nHe\u2019s a Congressional co-chair of \u201cNo Labels,\u201d a group which promotes bipartisan compromise."}
