Jim Weldon, the leader of an electricians union for 38 years, died at a Fort Lauderdale hospice Wednesday from ailments including respiratory failure.

Mr. Weldon, of Fort Lauderdale, who also served a brief stint as a commissioner at Port Everglades, was 79.

Born in Queens, NY., Mr. Weldon joined the Navy in 1953, the same year his parents moved to South Florida. When he finished his service, he joined his family in Fort Lauderdale, said his brother, A.J. Weldon.

He became a trained electrician and labor leader, following in the footsteps of his father who had belonged to a painters union.

Mr. Weldon was business manager of Local 728 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for 38 years, retiring eight years ago. The union represents 1,200 workers in 11 Florida counties.

"Jim was quite the champion of the little guy; he worked tirelessly for the membership," said Dave Svetlick, the current business manager and financial secretary. "He was fighting for national health care before Obamacare, fair wages, and, as a union leader, he negotiated contracts for us."

He was an outspoken activist, his brother said.

"Jim was a champion of the underdog and human rights," said A.J. Weldon. "Before we called [it] living wages, Jim was always in favor of fair wages and human rights."

Mr. Weldon notably championed the rights of subcontractors, including his electricians, to be paid millions of dollars that the Florida Panthers owed them after the construction of the Sunrise arena now called the BB&T Center.

Mr. Weldon is survived by his wife Gisela Weldon; and daughters Kimberly Weldon, of Arizona; and Kelly Weldon Bentley, of Arizona.

The viewing will be 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. May 21 at Fred Hunter Funeral Home, 718 S. Federal Highway in Fort Lauderdale. The funeral will immediately follow.
