Cuyahoga County to finance $60 million of upgrades at homes of Cleveland Indians and Cavs

Cuyahoga County government is preparing to finance $60.4 million worth of repairs and upgrades to Progressive Field and Quicken Loans Arena that include a new scoreboard for the Cleveland Indians and a new roof for the Cavs.

County Council introduced legislation Tuesday to cover these costs through the sale of $65 million of bonds that will be repaid by the county's latest 20-year tax on alcohol and cigarettes, which voters approved in 2014.

This is the first proposed distribution of the so-called sin tax that is expected to raise $260 million for Progressive Field, Quicken Loans Arena and the FirstEnergy Stadium. The county began collecting the renewed sin taxes in August.

The $60.4 million is the cost of repairs and upgrades that the county is obligated to cover per its respective leases with the Indians and the Cavs. | Read Mark Naymik's story
