If the idea of spending your retirement digging holes doesn’t sound too enticing, just ask Harry Owens.

The long-time Athens-Clarke County Human Resources Director turned in his notice this month and he’ll use accrued leave until his effective retirement date on Aug. 22.

“My wife is a master gardener and I’m her hole digger,” he joked.

But he’s not joking. He explained the reason for his retirement, which is coming a little earlier than initially planned, involves the timing of a medical procedure and the birth of his fourth grandson.

“We’re excited about our retirement, and spending time with the kids and doing some traveling,” he said. “I’m coming up on age 68, and I was planning on doing it this year anyway, then I had the procedure and it seemed better this way.”

Assistant Human Resources Director Jan Hansford, another longtime employee, will serve as interim HR director until a full-time department director is named.

Owens said he’s most proud of the county’s implementation of an employee wellness program during his tenure, which involves both health benefits and a fitness aspect.

“We’ve been able to keep our health insurance premiums for employees at a reasonable rate when other organizations were going nuts with (the Affordable Care Act),” he said. “Participation is up, which keeps the cost down. We’re well positioned.”

Owens said he plans to continue teaching at the Carl Vinson Institute, which he’s done for 24 years, but intends to scale back his independent human resources consulting work.

He’ll work with the county through Aug. 22 to finish ongoing obligations, but he’s already begun passing the torch to Hansford.

“We have a very good, well-organized and functioning HR department thanks to him, and we’ll be sorry to see him go,” County Manager Alan Reddish said.
