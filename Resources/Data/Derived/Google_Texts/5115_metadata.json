He makes false statements and refuses to correct them. He attacks other religions and ethnic groups, inflaming domestic tension and foreign terrorist rage. He pledges to overhaul long-standing U.S. commitments in ways that frighten allies. He cavalierly predicts a \u201cmassive recession,\u201d undermining confidence in the U.S. economy.\n\nWhen criticized, Trump adopts the stance of one of his beloved WWE professional wrestlers caught in the act: He throws up his hands, protests his innocence and claims the other guy threw the first punch.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments are troubling because he isn\u2019t just a candidate, he\u2019s an alternative news source. The Post\u2019s Fact Checker may give him \u201cFour Pinocchios\u201d for falsely claiming that he saw TV clips of \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of New Jersey Muslims celebrating the collapse of the twin towers on 9/11. But the absence of any confirming video footage is seen by some Trump supporters as evidence of a \u201cmainstream media\u201d conspiracy to conceal the truth.\n\nThe Founding Fathers\u2019 instructions were clear: The right to free speech includes bad speech; it means tolerance of ideas that many find obnoxious. First Amendment partisans (especially journalists, like me) avoid discussing hypothetical situations in which free speech becomes so recklessly defamatory that it no longer deserves protection. But we should recognize that in other countries suffering political decay and the popular rage that it engenders, free speech has indeed proved to be an instrument in the destruction of liberty.\n\nThe Supreme Court has considered this problem on two recent occasions. Both times, the court ruled for protection of political speech, even when it\u2019s false.\n\nIn U.S. v. Alvarez, the court held in 2012 that making a false statement about having won a medal was protected speech, even though it might cheapen the heroism of those who\u2019d actually been decorated. The ruling overturned the Stolen Valor Act, finding that this 2005 law, which had criminalized false claims about military honors, was unconstitutional.\n\nIn a 2014 case, Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, the court found that an Ohio law that banned dissemination of false information about political candidates also violated the First Amendment. The case grew out of a claim by an Ohio legislator who said he had been falsely accused of backing \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion\u201d when he had voted for the Affordable Care Act. Even though such a statement might have been false, it was still protected.\n\nThe court\u2019s desire to safeguard political speech, despite the risks that its exercise may pose to democratic institutions, is perhaps clearest in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , the 2010 Supreme Court case that struck down limits on political contributions by companies and unions . Opponents argued that special-interest money was corrupting and obstructing the very process of democracy. But for the court, freedom of speech (and freedom to spend money to amplify that speech) outweighed such concerns.\n\nConstitutional scholars sometimes debate these issues by invoking a dissent by Justice Robert Jackson against the court\u2019s 1949 ruling that held that hateful speech was permissible even if it violated a Chicago breach of peace ordinance. \u201cThis court has gone far toward accepting the doctrine that civil liberty means the removal of all restraints,\u201d Jackson argued. \u201cThere is danger that, if the Court does not temper its doctrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom, it will convert the constitutional Bill of Rights into a suicide pact.\u201d\n\nGarrett Epps, who teaches constitutional law at the University of Baltimore, noted that Jackson\u2019s idea of free speech was framed by his time as chief U.S. prosecutor at the Nuremburg war crime trials. \u201cStudying the rise of National Socialism, he began to argue that the framers had not foreseen the rise of mass media and scientific propaganda,\u201d Epps said. Although he doesn\u2019t endorse Jackson\u2019s view, Epps said that it shows \u201chow circumstance can shape our sense of what\u2019s permissible.\u201d\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer has suggested that the rise of the Internet may force a re-examination of First Amendment jurisprudence. In a provocative 2010 interview, he recalled Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes\u2019s famous comment that free speech doesn\u2019t mean you can shout \u201cfire\u201d in a crowded theater, and then asked pointedly: \u201cWhat is the crowded theater today?\u201d\n\nThe American experiment has always depended on a measure of tolerance and good sense. We haven\u2019t usually had to face the extreme questions about liberty and order because we\u2019re not a nation of extremists. We love freedom and good government, both. But this has been a testing year, and it may get worse.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "David Ignatius, donald trump, free speech, first amendment, hate speech, protected speech, political speech", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/davidignatiusbooks", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Donald Trump has pushed the limits of the common sense behind the First Amendment.", "title": "A testing year for American tolerance \u2014 and it may get worse", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-does-free-speech-mean-today/2016/04/07/5ae60ee6-fcf9-11e5-80e4-c381214de1a3_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/04/07/Editorial-Opinion/Images/APTOPIX_GOP_2016_Trump-0ad92.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ignatiuspost"}, "description": "Donald Trump has pushed the limits of the common sense behind the First Amendment.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-does-free-speech-mean-today/2016/04/07/5ae60ee6-fcf9-11e5-80e4-c381214de1a3_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "David Ignatius, donald trump, free speech, first amendment, hate speech, protected speech, political speech", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/davidignatiusbooks"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "5ae60ee6-fcf9-11e5-80e4-c381214de1a3"}, "article_summary": "The Founding Fathers\u2019 instructions were clear: The right to free speech includes bad speech; it means tolerance of ideas that many find obnoxious.\nBut for the court, freedom of speech (and freedom to spend money to amplify that speech) outweighed such concerns.\nFirst Amendment partisans (especially journalists, like me) avoid discussing hypothetical situations in which free speech becomes so recklessly defamatory that it no longer deserves protection.\nBut this has been a testing year, and it may get worse.\nBoth times, the court ruled for protection of political speech, even when it\u2019s false."}
