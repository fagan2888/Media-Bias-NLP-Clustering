Because a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat is supposed to be a sudden event, it is unlikely that a seditious group would announce, or hold a rally, publicizing their intention to overthrow America\u2019s legally elected government, but this is the 21st Century and an African American man has been twice elected by the people to serve as President. A little under two months ago, an anti-government Islamophobe and Christian announced in an op/ed his intent to marshal a million like-minded rebels to march on Washington D.C. to demand the President\u2019s removal, and subsequently proclaimed a date a week before Thanksgiving to demand the surrender of President Obama to face charges set out by a citizens\u2019 grand jury.\n\nOn Monday, the same un-American, Larry Klayman, released a new declaration of independence and announced that on November 19th he and fellow Islamophobes, extremist Christian leaders, and right-wing gun fanatics will converge on the White House and depose the Obama Administration, members of Congress, and the Supreme Court. According to Klayman, President Obama is a \u201cdespot, socialist, ultra-leftist \u201cMuslim\u201d who, with his Democratic minions, passed a destructive piece of legislation\u201d (Affordable Care Act) that Klayman claims is unconstitutional. Within the new declaration of independence is a laundry list of imagined slights that claims after \u201cwarning him and his administration of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us, we must acquiesce in the necessity, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\u201d Klayman\u2019s group clearly holds the United States government and Barack Obama as \u201cEnemies in War.\u201d\n\nThe November 19th rally calling for the overthrow of President Obama and the government is being co-sponsored by groups such as Accuracy In Media, GrassTopsUSA, Gun Owners of America, Pacific Justice Institute, and several teabagger groups. Klayman claims Representative Trent Franks (R-Ariz) will speak at the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat rally, but a spokesperson from Franks\u2019 office says the congressman will not attend. Franks is likely wise enough to avoid being seen with the other speakers slated to join Klayman who say they are \u201cdisgusted by Obama\u2019s criminality, his Muslim, socialist, anti-Semitic, anti-Christian, anti-white, pro-illegal immigrant, pro-radical gay and lesbian agenda to demand the President leave town and resign from office if he does not want to face prison time.\u201d Klayman said if the seditionists\u2019 \u201clist of grievances is not considered by the ruling establishment it will result in their demise\u201d and strongly suggested there may be a violent revolution if the November 19 rally fails to reach its stated goal; overthrow of the United States government.\n\nKlayman\u2019s threat of a violent revolution if the President, congressional leaders, and the Supreme Court do not meet their list of demands and be \u201cabolished from all allegiance to the current government\u2019s regime, including political connection between them and the current government, is to be totally dissolved\u201d is treason. Calling on, and inciting, millions of other Americans to join in the overthrow of the United States government is sedition, particularly under the threat of violent force, but it is glaringly obvious Klayman\u2019s group eschews U.S. law and the U.S. Constitution.\n\nReading through the list of grievances against the President and the government exposes Klayman and company\u2019s motivation is rank Islamophobia, hatred of minorities, and a desire to dissolve the Union into a collection of independent nation states. In fact, in the \u201cnew declaration of independence\u201d there are repeated references to \u201ctyranny\u201d against \u201cthe patient sufferance of the States\u201d that leaves them with no choice but, according to their duty, \u201cto throw off and alter the former system of government.\u201d In its place the rebels demand that the country be made up of \u201cfree and independent States\u201d and if their demands are not met, \u201cit is only a matter of time before the people and the military rise up to remove the shackles that have been placed on them by the government.\u201d\n\nKlayman is a seditious traitor and he joined Ted Cruz and Sarah Palin during a Washington rally to protest the government shutdown where he repeated his demand that President Obama \u201cget up, put the Quran down, get up off his knees and come up with his hands up.\u201d Klayman\u2019s group also joins Ted Cruz in demanding that \u201cthe Internal Revenue Service be abolished entirely,\u201d as well as obliterating the Affordable Care Act. The group also demands that on November 19, the day they designated as \u201cnew independence day,\u201d that President Obama \u201csubmit himself to examination and appear in front of a citizens\u2019 grand jury to answer questions under oath regarding his illegal, treasonous and impeachable actions during his presidency, as well as provide a physical, original copy of his birth certificate and submit himself to the scrutiny of qualified forensic experts.\u201d\n\nOn November 19, Klayman hopes millions will join him and demand the President and key leaders of both Parties and the courts surrender and leave the government. According to Klayman, if nonviolence fails to achieve their goals then \u201csurely another recourse will break out\u201d and after three straight years of threats of armed rebellion against the government, their threats cannot be taken lightly. The U.S. Constitution\u2019s 1st Amendment certainly guarantees Klayman and his un-American cabal the right of free speech, but even the Supreme Court put limitations on speech regarding sedition and imminent danger that certainly includes incitement to overthrow the United States government under threat of violent rebellion.\n\nAccording to 18 USC \u00a7 2382 \u2013 Misprision of treason, \u201cWhoever, owing allegiance to the United States and having knowledge of the commission of any treason against them, conceals and does not, as soon as may be, disclose and make known the same to the President or to some judge of the United States, or to the governor or to some judge or justice of a particular State, is guilty of misprision of treason and shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than seven years, or both.\u201d Therefore, any American with knowledge of Klayman and company\u2019s intent to commit treason and overthrow the legal government of the United States has a duty to report the November 19th coup d\u2019\u00e9tat rally; if not to avoid imprisonment, but to put a stop to these persistent call-to-arms to overthrow the legally elected government. Maybe then the ascendance of right-wing Christian extremists will come to a halt because it is just a matter of time before these well-armed un-American maniacs will succeed in starting what they yearn for America; a violent rebellion to overthrow this country\u2019s government.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Right wing extremists have proclaimed  a date a week before Thanksgiving to demand the surrender of President Obama to face charges set out by a citizens' grand jury.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Right wing extremists have proclaimed  a date a week before Thanksgiving to demand the surrender of President Obama to face charges set out by a citizens' grand jury.", "title": "Extremists Launch Treasonous Plot to Overthrow President Obama A Week Before Thanksgiving", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/11/13/extremists-launch-treasonous-plot-overthrow-president-obama-week-thanksgiving.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/klayman-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-13T15:09:55+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Coup d'\u00e9tat,Gun Owners of America,Independence Day,Larry Klayman,Obama Administration,Sedition,Ted Cruz,Treason,Trent Franks,Washington D.C.,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-11-13T14:31:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-13T15:09:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Coup d'\u00e9tat, Gun Owners of America, Independence Day, Larry Klayman, Obama Administration, Sedition, Ted Cruz, Treason, Trent Franks, Washington D.C."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6bf\"", "article_summary": "According to Klayman, President Obama is a \u201cdespot, socialist, ultra-leftist \u201cMuslim\u201d who, with his Democratic minions, passed a destructive piece of legislation\u201d (Affordable Care Act) that Klayman claims is unconstitutional.\nKlayman claims Representative Trent Franks (R-Ariz) will speak at the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat rally, but a spokesperson from Franks\u2019 office says the congressman will not attend.\nA little under two months ago, an anti-government Islamophobe and Christian announced in an op/ed his intent to marshal a million like-minded rebels to march on Washington D.C. to demand the President\u2019s removal, and subsequently proclaimed a date a week before Thanksgiving to demand the surrender of President Obama to face charges set out by a citizens\u2019 grand jury.\nCalling on, and inciting, millions of other Americans to join in the overthrow of the United States government is sedition, particularly under the threat of violent force, but it is glaringly obvious Klayman\u2019s group eschews U.S. law and the U.S. Constitution.\nReading through the list of grievances against the President and the government exposes Klayman and company\u2019s motivation is rank Islamophobia, hatred of minorities, and a desire to dissolve the Union into a collection of independent nation states."}
