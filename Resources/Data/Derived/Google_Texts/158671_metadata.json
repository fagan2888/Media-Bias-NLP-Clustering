He needs to veto the bill,\u201d said Gary Stubblefield, a retired Navy SEAL commander and chairman of Special Operations for America.\n\nAnother group, the Fleet Resource Association, told The Washington Times on Thursday that it is also asking Mr. Obama to veto the bill.\n\nMr. Obama has previously praised the agreement, and the White House gave no indication on Thursday that he\u2019s having second thoughts.\n\nBut the veterans\u2019 retirement benefits cut has dinged what was being billed as a major bipartisan compromise, reached by House Republicans and Senate Democrats.\n\nThe bill boosts spending in the short term in exchange for longer-term fee hikes and spending cuts.\n\nBut it includes a provision that would reduce the cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees to 1 percent less than the rate of consumer inflation \u2014 and even reduces payments for veterans who were wounded in action. The cut will go into effect in 2015 and is expected to save more than $6 billion over 10 years.\n\nSome groups, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said a veto is unrealistic.\n\n\u201cNobody can realistically expect that the House and Senate will come back \u2026 and come to an agreement,\u201d said Joe Davis, a national spokesman for Veterans of Foreign Wars. \u201cWe have to face the political reality.\u201d\n\nInstead, those groups said they\u2019ll try to pressure Congress to fix the problem in another bill early next year.\n\nMr. Davis said the VFW plans to meet with Congress members to gain their support, while Tom Tarantino, chief policy officer for IAVA, said staff members will focus their attention on Washington when lawmakers return in January.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the special operations community has clashed with the president. Many have publicly spoken out against the president\u2019s possible leaks to Hollywood for movies like \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d and have criticized the administration\u2019s handling of the Benghazi attack.\n\nEven as the Senate was passing the flawed bill this week, members of both houses of Congress were scrambling to introduce legislative fixes. Some bills would just provide relief for wounded veterans while others would include all military retirees.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, has been a vocal supporter of a fix and asked Mr. Obama to hold off on signing the bill and give Congress a chance to fix the provision before it becomes law.\n\n\u201cHow hard is it to change the law once it\u2019s passed? Extremely hard. We\u2019re going to run in to special interest groups who say you can\u2019t fix it because it hurts my people. That\u2019s coming,\u201d he said Wednesday night after the bill passed the Senate.\n\nEven though the majority of Congress members seem to support a fix, it still won\u2019t be easy. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire Democrat, introduced a bill to replace the cuts by closing offshore corporate tax loopholes \u2014 something Republicans took off the table before budget talks had even begun.\n\nOn the other side, Mr. Graham and Sen. Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire Republican, suggested paying for the change by better regulating food stamp eligibility and child earned income tax credits to prevent fraud.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two veterans groups demanded Thursday that President Obama veto the budget bill Congress passed earlier this week, saying that the cuts to military retirement benefits \u2014 which even the bill's authors now admit were a partial mistake \u2014 are an insult to former troops.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Two veterans groups demanded Thursday that President Obama veto the budget bill Congress passed earlier this week, saying that the cuts to military retirement benefits \u2014 which even the bill\u2019s authors now admit were a partial mistake \u2014 are an insult to former troops.", "title": "Veterans groups say military cuts should prompt Obama budget veto", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/19/veterans-groups-say-military-cuts-should-prompt-ob/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/19/12192013_budget-battle-veterans-48201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/19/12192013_budget-battle-veterans-48201.jpg", "description": "Two veterans groups demanded Thursday that President Obama veto the budget bill Congress passed earlier this week, saying that the cuts to military retirement benefits \u2014 which even the bill's authors", "card": "summary", "title": "Veterans groups say military cuts should prompt Obama budget veto"}, "Author": "Jacqueline Klimas", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Congress, Senate"}, "article_summary": "Some groups, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said a veto is unrealistic.\nTwo veterans groups demanded Thursday that President Obama veto the budget bill Congress passed earlier this week, saying that the cuts to military retirement benefits \u2014 which even the bill\u2019s authors now admit were a partial mistake \u2014 are an insult to former troops.\nAnother group, the Fleet Resource Association, told The Washington Times on Thursday that it is also asking Mr. Obama to veto the bill.\nEven though the majority of Congress members seem to support a fix, it still won\u2019t be easy.\nWe\u2019re going to run in to special interest groups who say you can\u2019t fix it because it hurts my people."}
