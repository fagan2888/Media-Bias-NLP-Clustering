Until February, Ukraine\u2019s military maintained close ties to Russia. The chances that its military is penetrated by Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, the GRU are high.\n\nSo far, events in the east of Ukraine have followed a similar pattern as in Crimea. Pro-Russian separatists have built barricades and seized buildings in three cities and demanded a referendum for independence from Kiev.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has accused Russian Special Forces of being behind the chaos. If this is the case, then Russia could already have put the wheels in motion for an offensive.\n\nIt is currently estimated that Russia has upwards of 80,000 troops on the Ukrainian border.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Jeremy Bender", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "The lack of intelligence being supplied to Ukraine could hamper it from responding effectively to a Russian invasion.", "creator": "bendedbrains", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/us-refuses-to-share-intelligence-with-ukraine-2014-4", "image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5324a64969bedda76b4b7d62-506-253/the-us-is-reportedly-refusing-to-give-ukraine-intelligence-about-an-impending-russian-invasion.jpg", "title": "The US Is Reportedly Refusing To Give Ukraine Intelligence About An Impending Russian Invasion", "site": "BI_Defense", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "defense", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Russia, Military, Defense, Ukraine, Jeremy Bender", "description": "The lack of intelligence being supplied to Ukraine could hamper it from responding effectively to a Russian invasion.", "author": "Jeremy Bender", "sailthru.date": "2014-04-09", "sailthru.title": "The US Is Reportedly Refusing To Give Ukraine Intelligence About An Impending Russian Invasion", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/532318b06bb3f73f47387608-50-50/the-us-is-reportedly-refusing-to-give-ukraine-intelligence-about-an-impending-russian-invasion.jpg", "news_keywords": "Russia, Military, Defense, Ukraine, Jeremy Bender", "tbi-image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/532318b06bb3f73f47387608/the-us-is-reportedly-refusing-to-give-ukraine-intelligence-about-an-impending-russian-invasion.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2014-04-09", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/jeremy-bender"}, "sailthru.description": "The lack of intelligence being supplied to Ukraine could hamper it from responding effectively to a Russian invasion.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "The lack of intelligence being supplied to Ukraine could hamper it from responding effectively to a Russian invasion.", "title": "The US Is Reportedly Refusing To Give Ukraine Intelligence About An Impending Russian Invasion", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/us-refuses-to-share-intelligence-with-ukraine-2014-4", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5324a64969bedda76b4b7d62-1190-625/the-us-is-reportedly-refusing-to-give-ukraine-intelligence-about-an-impending-russian-invasion.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "The US Is Reportedly Refusing To Give Ukraine Intelligence About An Impending Russian Invasion", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/532318b06bb3f73f47387608/the-us-is-reportedly-refusing-to-give-ukraine-intelligence-about-an-impending-russian-invasion.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "defense"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9cb0\"", "article_summary": "There is a fear that by divulging American intelligence to Ukraine, Russia may learn of U.S. sources and methods.\nThe chances that its military is penetrated by Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, the GRU are high.\nThe intelligence, which could help Ukraine better position troops in an effort to defend its eastern cities, has reportedly been gathered by a network of American spies and intelligence officers.\nThe U.S. is not sharing with Ukraine information, analysis, and intercepts that signal a growing likelihood of a full-scale invasion by Russia, The Daily Beast reports, citing a senior U.S. intelligence official.\nEli Lake, of The Daily Beast, reports:In the case of Ukraine, the United States historically does not share much out of concern that the information provided to Kiev would make its way back to Moscow."}
