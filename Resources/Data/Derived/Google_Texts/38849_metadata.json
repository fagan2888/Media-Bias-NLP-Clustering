Other projections have him as high as No. 2. CBS Sports also has him going to the 49ers.\n\nBut first, Goff will face Air Force in Fort Worth, Texas, on Tuesday. And the Falcons are excited about it.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d outside linebacker D.J. Dunn said. \u201cIt would be even better if we defeat them. I think that would be a better thing to talk to my kids about.\u201d\n\nGoff has thrown for 4,252 yards, 37 touchdowns and 13 interceptions and completed 64.2 percent of his passes this season for the Golden Bears (7-5). He has averaged 460 yards in the air over his past three games, with 13 touchdown passes and just one interception.\n\nHe will join a shortlist of the best QBs to face Air Force (8-5) in the past nine years. Aside from TCU\u2019s Andy Dalton, the only other approaching this level was perhaps Michigan State\u2019s Connor Cook this season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably the best quarterback I\u2019ve faced as a coach since we played (Ben) Roethlisberger three years in a row at Ohio University,\u201d Air Force defensive coordinator Steve Russ said of Goff. \u201cHe\u2019s a different guy than Ben, but he\u2019s that kind of caliber of a guy. I\u2019m very impressed with the guy, and at the same time it\u2019s our job to go out there and find a way to slow him down.\u201d\n\nAir Force\u2019s pass defense ranks No. 23 in the nation at 190.4 yards per game, but helping that stat was three option teams on the schedule (Army, Navy and New Mexico) and a down year in general for quarterbacks in the Mountain West.\n\nWhen the Falcons played Sept. 19 at Michigan State, Cook lit them up for 158 yards and three touchdowns on 9-of-13 passing in the first half. The Spartans eased up on the passing in the second half when they had put the game out of reach, but Cook still finished with 257 yards passing, four TDs and no interceptions, hitting 15-of-23 throws.\n\n\u201cI feel like me and the whole defense in general have developed a whole lot since that day,\u201d said Roland Ladipo, the Falcons\u2019 all-Mountain West cornerback. \u201cWe\u2019ve come together as a group and we\u2019ve been able to click a lot better than we were at that point in the season. I feel like we\u2019re putting ourselves in a lot better position than we were against Michigan State.\n\n\u201cI accept the challenge. The defense in general, we love having the opportunity to have a chance to go against a top-tier offense from the Pac-12. It\u2019s a great opportunity, honestly. We\u2019re all excited to go out there and show them what we can do in the Mountain West.\u201d\n\nPlenty of eyes figure to be on the Armed Forces Bowl, particularly with Goff as the headliner. Air Force coach Troy Calhoun spent a lot of his time in the NFL as a talent evaluator, and he said bowl games were a critical part of that process because players were at their most refined at that point in the season and quarterbacks and receivers were in sync with each other. But of the 6-foot-4, 210-pound Goff, Calhoun has done all the evaluating he needs to do.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s everything you\u2019d want in an NFL quarterback,\u201d Calhoun said.\n\nGoff hasn\u2019t said whether he will enter the 2016 NFL draft, but he is aware of the spotlight that Tuesday\u2019s bowl game will provide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always exciting when you\u2019re playing in front of however many people in the stands and however many people on TV,\u201d Goff said. \u201cIt makes it fun for guys to finally get on a big national stage. It will be the only game on at the time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Air Force football eager to face Cal QB Jared Goff in Armed Forces Bowl", "title": "Air Force football eager to face Cal QB Jared Goff in Armed Forces Bowl", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/25/air-force-football-eager-to-face-cal-qb-jared-goff-in-armed-forces-bowl/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__f509177498351435890f6a70670054cap1.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__f509177498351435890f6a70670054cap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-25T20:50:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:45:49+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Air Force Academy"}, "article_summary": "AIR FORCE ACADEMY \u2014 After the Armed Forces Bowl, Jared Goff\u2019s next football snaps likely will take place in the NFL.\nHe will join a shortlist of the best QBs to face Air Force (8-5) in the past nine years.\nBut first, Goff will face Air Force in Fort Worth, Texas, on Tuesday.\nI feel like we\u2019re putting ourselves in a lot better position than we were against Michigan State.\nGoff hasn\u2019t said whether he will enter the 2016 NFL draft, but he is aware of the spotlight that Tuesday\u2019s bowl game will provide."}
