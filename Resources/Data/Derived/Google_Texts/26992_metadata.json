This year, 61 senators and 308 House members in both parties signed letters opposing cuts.\n\nOne of the Republican criticisms of ObamaCare was that it cut payments under Medicare Advantage, where the government contracts with private insurers to provide coverage as an alternative to traditional Medicare.\n\nHowever, the administration points out that enrollment in Medicare Advantage has continued to grow since ObamaCare was signed into law in 2010. Added benefits in Medicare Advantage, compared to traditional Medicare, have helped make the program popular with seniors.\n\n\u201cMedicare Advantage has reached record high enrollment each year since 2010,\u201d the CMS said in a statement.\n\nThere are now 17.1 million people enrolled in the program, or about 32 percent of all Medicare enrollees.\n\nThe CMS also says it is responding to feedback from some insurers to adjust the ratings system for insurance plans to take into account the socioeconomic status of enrollees. Some plans had concerns that they were being unfairly penalized for serving lower-income enrollees.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The payment announcement is a subject of intense lobbying.", "description": "The payment announcement is a subject of intense lobbying.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The payment announcement is a subject of intense lobbying.", "title": "CMS proposes small increase in Medicare Advantage payments", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/270080-cms-proposes-small-increase-in-medicare-advantage-payments", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-19T17:12:35-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-19T17:12-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/270080-cms-proposes-small-increase-in-medicare-advantage-payments", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-19T17:02-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-19T17:02:47-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-19T17:12:35-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/270080-cms-proposes-small-increase-in-medicare-advantage-payments", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The payment announcement is a subject of intense lobbying.", "card": "summary", "title": "CMS proposes small increase in Medicare Advantage payments"}, "dcterms.title": "CMS proposes small increase in Medicare Advantage payments"}, "article_summary": "Added benefits in Medicare Advantage, compared to traditional Medicare, have helped make the program popular with seniors.\nADVERTISEMENTThe modest increase is a contrast to several recent years when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) proposed a cut to average payments.\nThe Obama administration announced on Friday a proposed payment increase to insurers of 1.35 percent on average in 2017 under the Medicare Advantage program.\n\u201cMedicare Advantage has reached record high enrollment each year since 2010,\u201d the CMS said in a statement.\nOne of the Republican criticisms of ObamaCare was that it cut payments under Medicare Advantage, where the government contracts with private insurers to provide coverage as an alternative to traditional Medicare."}
