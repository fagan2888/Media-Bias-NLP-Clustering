Officials say the new helicopters will be far more powerful, easier to maintain and easier to fly.\n\nThe new helicopter will carry three times as much as the current aging CH-53E helicopter in challenging high altitude and heat, about 27,000 pounds (12,247 kg) versus 9,000 pounds (4,082 kg) for the older model.\n\n\"This is a key step toward fielding this brand-new capability,\" Marine Corps Colonel Hank Vanderborght told reporters after the flight. He said the aircraft would give the Marine Corps greater ability to move cargo from ship to shore and participate in disaster relief missions.\n\nRelated: Yet Another Costly F-35 Glitch That Won\u2019t Be Fixed Any Time Soon\n\nLockheed Martin Corp is expected to complete its $9 billion takeover of Sikorsky by late October or early November.\n\nVanderborght said he did not expect the takeover to affect the program.\n\nThe newly designed K-model has roughly the same footprint as the E-model but has a far larger inside loading space, which will enable Marines to load palettes of equipment and gear directly from cargo planes onto the helicopters.\n\nVanderborght said the gear box problem would likely result in a five-month delay in the expected start of production of the new helicopters until January 2017.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sikorsky Aircraft's CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter being built for the U.S.", "title": "The Marine Corps Debuts Its Cool New $29 Billion Helicopter", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/28/Marine-Corp-Debuts-Its-29B-Cool-New-Helicopter", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/sikorsky_ch53k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/28/Marine-Corp-Debuts-Its-29B-Cool-New-Helicopter", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/sikorsky_ch53k.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Sikorsky Aircraft's CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter being built for the U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09f6\"", "article_summary": "He said the aircraft would give the Marine Corps greater ability to move cargo from ship to shore and participate in disaster relief missions.\n\"This is a key step toward fielding this brand-new capability,\" Marine Corps Colonel Hank Vanderborght told reporters after the flight.\nSikorsky Aircraft's CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter being built for the U.S. Marine Corps completed its first test flight on Tuesday, about seven months later than expected due to a problem with its main gear box, company and military officials said.\nOfficials say the new helicopters will be far more powerful, easier to maintain and easier to fly.\nVanderborght said the gear box problem would likely result in a five-month delay in the expected start of production of the new helicopters until January 2017."}
