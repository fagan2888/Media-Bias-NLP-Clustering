Aside from a few Baghdad Bob impersonators in the White House and over at HHS, few people seem to be arguing that the performance of the online exchanges has been successful.\n\nIt could be about to get a lot worse.\n\nAs President Obama noted yesterday, \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is not just a website. It\u2019s much more.\u201d Part of the \u201cmuch more\u201d of Obamacare is throwing millions of Americans off of their current insurance policies because they don\u2019t comply with the rich benefit requirements imposed by the law.\n\nYesterday Kaiser Health News had the following story:\n\nThousands of Consumers Get Cancellation Notices Because of Health Law Changes Health plans are sending hundreds of thousands of cancellation letters to people who buy their own coverage, frustrating some consumers who want to keep what they have and forcing others to buy more costly policies. The main reason insurers offer is that the policies fall short of what the Affordable Care Act requires starting Jan. 1. Most are ending policies sold after the law passed in March 2010. \u2026the cancellation notices, which began arriving in August, have shocked many consumers in light of President Barack Obama\u2019s promise that people could keep their plans if they liked them\u2026 An estimated 14 million people purchase their own coverage because they don\u2019t get it through their jobs. Calls to insurers in several states showed that many have sent notices. Florida Blue, for example, is terminating about 300,000 policies\u2026 Kaiser Permanente in California has sent notices to 160,000 people\u2026 Insurer Highmark in Pittsburgh is dropping about 20 percent of its individual market customers, while Independence Blue Cross, the major insurer in Philadelphia, is dropping about 45 percent. \u2026Some receiving cancellations say it looks like their costs will go up, despite studies projecting that about half of all enrollees will get income-based subsidies. Kris Malean, 56, lives outside Seattle, and has a health policy that costs $390 a month with a $2,500 deductible and a $10,000 in potential out-of-pocket costs for such things as doctor visits, drug costs or hospital care. As a replacement, Regence BlueShield is offering her a plan for $79 more a month with a deductible twice as large as what she pays now, but which limits her potential out-of-pocket costs to $6,250 a year, including the deductible\u2026 Blue Shield of California sent roughly 119,000 cancellation notices out in mid-September, about 60 percent of its individual business. About two-thirds of those policyholders will see rate increases in their new policies\u2026 Like other insurers, the Blue Shield letters let customers know they have to make a decision by Dec. 31 or they will automatically be enrolled in a recommended plan.\n\nThe headline on the article says \u201cthousands\u201d are getting their insurance cancelled by Obamacare, but the three insurers cited here with hard numbers, covering just two states, add up to almost 580,000 people having their policies cancelled. It should be obvious that across all fifty states at least several million Americans, maybe 10 million or more, are having their insurance policies cancelled because of Obamacare.\n\nIf the exchanges were working, this might only be a serious problem. The people losing their insurance because of Obamacare could presumably buy new policies effective January 1, many of them at higher premiums or with narrower networks. But they\u2019d at least be insured.\n\nBut, the exchanges aren\u2019t working. And the deadline for people to sign up for new coverage through the exchange that will start on January 1 is December 15.\n\nBetween the front-end problems of the Obamacare web site, where people can\u2019t even get in to the system to look at coverage options and select a new plan, and the back end problems, where insurers aren\u2019t getting accurate information on new enrollees, it\u2019s entirely possible that there will not be a functioning online exchange in time for the millions of Americans losing their existing coverage to buy new coverage by December 15.\n\nAlternatives to the online system don\u2019t seem to be viable options either, at least at this point. Megan McArdle wrote about this yesterday:\n\nIt\u2019s true, there are call centers. But the computer systems at the call centers for states running the insurance exchanges are the same as the computer systems that consumers are having such a hard time with. A nice woman at a federal call center told me that (at least for the state of Florida, where my in-laws live) there is an alternate procedure: They can fill out a manual application in PDF format. But she also told me that it takes three weeks for that application to be mailed to your house. After you receive it, you check the application to ensure it\u2019s accurate, and then mail it in. One to two weeks later, you will be notified of your subsidy eligibility. Then you can actually enroll in a plan, though she wasn\u2019t quite clear on how that part would work \u2014 do you call back again?\n\nJudging by the timeline described above, I\u2019d guess that if you haven\u2019t started the paper online enrollment process by November 1, there\u2019s a decent chance you\u2019re not going to be enrolled in time for new insurance effective January 1. And even if the front-end problems are resolved and people can actually access the exchange and chose a plan, there\u2019s still the problem of the back-end systems and insurers not getting the accurate information they need to enroll people.\n\nThose currently insured in the individual market will still have the option of just selecting the \u2018replacement\u2019 plan recommended by their current insurer, although plans purchased directly from the insurer aren\u2019t eligible for subsidies (and even if they were, many wouldn\u2019t qualify for them).\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of the \u2018replacement\u2019 policies typically being much more expensive than the current policy, making them simply unaffordable for many. One outraged supporter of Obamacare wrote the following on the DailyKos web site:\n\nMy wife and I just got our updates from Kaiser telling us what our 2014 rates will be. Her monthly has been $168 this year, mine $150. We have a high deductible. We are generally healthy people who don\u2019t go to the doctor often. I barely ever go. The insurance is in case of a major catastrophe. Well, now, because of Obamacare, my wife\u2019s rate is gong to $302 per month and mine is jumping to $284. I am canceling insurance for us and I am not paying any ******* penalty. What the hell kind of reform is this?\n\nSo it\u2019s entirely possible that millions of Americans who are insured today will be uninsured on January 1, 2014, solely because Obamacare terminated their existing policies and then sent them to buy a replacement policy on exchanges that do not allow them to buy policies, with the only alternatives being either unworkable in the needed timeframe or unaffordable.\n\nIf I were one of the millions of Americans reading a cancellation notice for my existing insurance policy and I didn\u2019t want to be without any coverage on January 1, I\u2019d be sure I\u2019ve either got my paper application requested in the next week, or I\u2019m looking at non-traditional options like health sharing ministries or short-term health insurance. Because there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be willing to cross my fingers and hope that the online exchanges will be fully functioning before December 15.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/10/millions-lose-coverage-will-obamacare-prevent-them-from-getting-new-health-insurance/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ObamacareRoseGarden.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Will Obamacare Prevent Millions of Currently Insured Americans from Getting New Health Insurance?"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Because there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be willing to cross my fingers and hope that the online exchanges will be fully functioning before December 15.\nIt should be obvious that across all fifty states at least several million Americans, maybe 10 million or more, are having their insurance policies cancelled because of Obamacare.\nIt\u2019s much more.\u201d Part of the \u201cmuch more\u201d of Obamacare is throwing millions of Americans off of their current insurance policies because they don\u2019t comply with the rich benefit requirements imposed by the law.\nBut the computer systems at the call centers for states running the insurance exchanges are the same as the computer systems that consumers are having such a hard time with.\nAside from a few Baghdad Bob impersonators in the White House and over at HHS, few people seem to be arguing that the performance of the online exchanges has been successful."}
