A pilot project administered by the State Library of Kansas is allowing 19 Kansas libraries to lend portable Wi-Fi hotspot devices to patrons.

“Many Kansas residents rely on library Internet for job searching, homework help and e-government so when the doors close, so does their connection,” said state librarian Jo Budler. “Too many Kansas households do not have Internet access, and this pilot project has the potential to provide 24/7 quality access to those limited to the library’s operating hours.”

Patrons can check out Wi-Fi hotspot devices, with unlimited data usage, through 2015 by visiting participating libraries. Borrowers must be 18 years old to check out the device and are required to fill out a customer survey to help the State Library determine possibilities of expanding the program to more libraries.

Both the device and monthly service fees are funded by a grant from the Knight Foundation, through the New York Public Library.

Participating libraries in northeast Kansas include Atchison Public Library, Carbondale City Library, Effingham Public Library, Leavenworth Public Library, Lyndon Carnegie Library, Mary Cotton Public Library in Sabetha, Meriden-Ozawkie Public Library and Silver Lake Public Library.
