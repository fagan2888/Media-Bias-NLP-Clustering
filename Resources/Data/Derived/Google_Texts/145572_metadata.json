The CCD&P were very excited to talk with us and were hoping to have a clinic facility there for a while,\u201d Selby said. \u201cIt was a beautiful organic thing that happened.\u201d\n\nThe clinic is open for both walk-ins and appointments.\n\nSelby said full medical services are available out at the Cove Creek site and staff is available to refer folks for specialty care back to the Boone clinic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially the same setup as here and we have it all bundled up and ready to go on Monday mornings. We pack up the car and go, ready to see patients,\u201d Selby said.\n\nThe Community Care Clinic is still searching for a site out in Meat Camp and Todd area, which also has a concentrated population of uninsured in the county.\n\nSelby said that the Meat Camp Fire Department denied a request to operate a site out of its base. While the Profitt\u2019s Grove Baptist Church welcomed the clinic to open for one day a week in its church in the Todd and Meat Camp area, Selby said it wasn\u2019t a \u201cworkable situation\u201d because internet or cell phone service isn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how wonderful they\u2019ve been. Even though we aren\u2019t able to be there, I\u2019m sure they will be an important part of helping get the word out,\u201d Selby said of the church.\n\n\u201cThe hunt is on and we definitely need volunteers,\u201d Selby added.\n\nAlso, the Community Care Clinic is still seeking $40,000 to fully fund the satellite clinic at Cove Creek and community members that reside in the rural areas to serve on its board.\n\nThe Community Care Clinic was established in 2006 to provide health care services for the uninsured in Boone and the surrounding area. It serves 1,000 people each year with the vast majority falling into the \u201cMedicaid gap\u201d and featuring at least one chronic illness.\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act passed about 30 of the Community Care Clinic\u2019s 1,000 clients were able to get insurance through Obamacare. The rest, Selby said, fell into the uninsured Medicaid gap when Gov. Pat McCrory and Republican legislators decided not to expand Medicaid.\n\nThe Community Care Clinic offers primary care, case management, health education, and the following specialty care for our patients: mental health services, gynecology, neurology, chiropractor, physical therapy, orthopedics, dermatology and more.\n\nPartnerships with Appalachian Dental Care and Western Carolina Eye Associates allow patient referrals for limited dental and vision care.\n\nTo schedule an appointment or for more information, please call 828-265-8591.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "headlines, business, education, sports, community", "og": {"site_name": "High Country Press", "description": "Dec. 15, 2015.
