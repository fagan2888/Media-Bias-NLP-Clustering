Dannel P. Malloy isn't around. He is. But still: Where is the Porcupine?\n\nHere are some things the Porcupine did this week: attended the Stamford ribbon-cutting for a 15-story building (yawn), toured the plant of PCX Aerostructures in Newington (zzzzz), spoke about his Second Chance Society initiative at a forum at the Capitol (been there, done that, got the T-shirt).\n\nHe signed the \"Doug Glanville bill\" on Monday, which clears up some muddiness about police jurisdiction. He compared Connecticut favorably to Missouri because \u2026 never mind.\n\nWhere are you, Porcupine? You're here, but you're not here. You haven't said anything obnoxious or combative in days, weeks. Dude, it's like your mind and heart are somewhere else.\n\nEarly in the summer, the Porcupine foreshadowed state Democrats changing the name of their annual dinner from Jefferson-Jackson-Bailey. \"I have a better name. How about the Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare, Human Rights, LGBT Rights dinner? How about that for a name?\" he asked the audience at the future SSMMOHRLGBTR Dinner.\n\nThat sounded a little like the Porcupine we know. But then he let state Democratic Chairman Nick Balletto take over the issue.\n\nIn mid-July, when Hartford Mayor Pedro Segarra asked for state police to help with the rising homicide rate, the Porcupine wrote back a letter that was slightly mean. We already give you all this stuff, the Porcupine said. And violent crime is at a 40-year low all over the state. Let's have a meeting to discuss what's wrong with you, said the Porcupine. But then he gave Segarra more stuff than Hartford had even asked for.\n\nYou can tell the Porcupine is dormant, because the Republicans have been reduced to picking fights with study groups. The study group looking at ways to fund transportation was discussing something called a mileage tax. They were barely discussing it. They were discussing the possibility of discussing it. At their study group. Which will issue a report in October. A nonbinding report.\n\nSo you can see: This is just one step shy of letting the Joker shove transponders in the neck of every Connecticut child under the age of 7. It had to be stopped! First, two Republicans, Rep. Themis Klarides and Sen. Toni Boucher, publicly freaked out about it. Then a leading Democrat, Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bob Duff, promised they would strangle this devil baby in its crib. Then all three of them burst into the study group's meeting room and took their eyeglasses and mussed up their hair and stomped on their calculator and knocked over a pile of books.\n\nTake that, study group!\n\nPlease note: The mileage tax, which would use some kind of GPS tracking to tax you based on your miles driven, is a politically unworkable idea, even if its core principle \u2014 that heavy users of roads should pay a larger cost for transportation upkeep \u2014 contains a grain of sense. In some countries, it works for heavy trucks, because they're already regulated in other ways.\n\nThat's not the point. A study group is supposed to be able to spitball ideas in a free-wheeling discussion without being hauled before the Tribunal of Zaragoza, tortured and tried for heresy.\n\nThis would never happen if the Porcupine were fully rampant, defined in heraldry as \"with the body upraised and resting on the left hind leg, the tail and other legs elevated, the right foreleg highest.\" Yes, that Porcupine would be keeping the legislators occupied with all kinds of snarling recriminations on a wide range of fronts. There would be no time to pick on study groups.\n\nSo, to paraphrase Tom Jones, what's new, Porcupine? (Whoa whoa whoa-whoa.) Has this unusually balmy summer put you in a lazy, contented mood? Have your porcupine eyes (notoriously nearsighted but compensated for by sharp hearing and a keen nose) been straying to the battlefields of the national political campaigns, where other players are jousting?\n\nIf so, come back. We miss you. Sort of. Earlier this summer, an African rock python, one of the world's largest snakes, died in South Africa. Its stomach burst after it ate a you-know-what.\n\nThat's the kind of porcupine story we like.\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this column incorrectly characterized the position of House Speaker Brendan Sharkey, who favors letting the transportation study panel discuss all options.\n\nColin McEnroe appears from 1 to 2 p.m. weekdays on WNPR-FM (90.5) and blogs at courantblogs.com/colin-mcenroe.
