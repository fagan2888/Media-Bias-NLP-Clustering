In January, 66 percent said they held a negative view of Obamacare, down 10 points from December. According to the poll, the law is most popular among those who have signed up for Obamacare. About 46 percent of enrollees support the law, compared to just 27 percent of the general public.\n\nThis poll comes about two months before the open enrollment period closes at the end of March. The White House is still well below its goal of signing up 7 million people by the March 31 cutoff. Still, officials say they are on pace and are counting on people waiting until the last minute to sign up. A new survey, however, found that the majority of Americans are unaware of that deadline.\n\nThose who miss the March 31 cutoff will have to wait until the next open enrollment period begins, and if they go without insurance they will be required to pay a tax penalty under the new law.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After spending three months and millions of dollars repairing the troubled Obamacare w", "title": "Majority Still Having Problems with Obamacare Website", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/27/Majority-Still-Having-Problems-Obamacare-Website", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Obamacare%20down.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/27/Majority-Still-Having-Problems-Obamacare-Website", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Obamacare%20down.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After spending three months and millions of dollars repairing the troubled Obamacare w", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "After spending three months and millions of dollars repairing the troubled Obamacare website - just 8 percent of users say it\u2019s working well.\nThe White House is still well below its goal of signing up 7 million people by the March 31 cutoff.\nAccording to the poll, the law is most popular among those who have signed up for Obamacare.\nEarlier this month, the Associated Press reported that the Spanish version of HealthCare.gov, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, was having serious translation problems, preventing Spanish-speaking users from signing up for health care.\nIn January, 66 percent said they held a negative view of Obamacare, down 10 points from December."}
