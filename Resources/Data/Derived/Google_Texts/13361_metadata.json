Delegate-rich New York, the fourth most populous U.S. state, is a big prize for the candidates.\n\n\"There is nothing more sacred in our nation than the right to vote, yet election after election, reports come in of people who were inexplicably purged from the polls, told to vote at the wrong location or unable to get into their polling site,\" city Comptroller Scott Stringer said.\n\nStringer said his office had received reports of polling stations that failed to open on time and were unable to tell voters when they would be operational. A voter in the borough of Queens reported a broken machine and staff instructing voters to place their ballots in a \"slot\" for processing at a later time.\n\nIn a letter to the New York City Board of Elections, the comptroller cited reports that polling staff were unable to operate voting machines, were giving out conflicting information and erroneously directing voters to alternate sites.\n\nOf particular concern, Stringer said, were allegations of widespread removal of eligible voters from registration rolls and incorrect party affiliations on voter records. Stringer said eligible Democratic voters in Brooklyn fell by 120,000 from November 2015 to April 2016 without explanation.\n\nBoard of Elections officials could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Edward Krudy; Editing by David Gregorio and Peter Cooney)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "New York Republicans and Democrats are holding presidential nominating contests for th", "title": "New York City watchdog decries 'irregularities' in primary voting", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/New-York-City-watchdog-decries-irregularities-primary-voting", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/New-York-City-watchdog-decries-irregularities-primary-voting", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "New York Republicans and Democrats are holding presidential nominating contests for th", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In a letter to the New York City Board of Elections, the comptroller cited reports that polling staff were unable to operate voting machines, were giving out conflicting information and erroneously directing voters to alternate sites.\nDelegate-rich New York, the fourth most populous U.S. state, is a big prize for the candidates.\nNew York Republicans and Democrats are holding presidential nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election.\nStringer said eligible Democratic voters in Brooklyn fell by 120,000 from November 2015 to April 2016 without explanation.\nOf particular concern, Stringer said, were allegations of widespread removal of eligible voters from registration rolls and incorrect party affiliations on voter records."}
