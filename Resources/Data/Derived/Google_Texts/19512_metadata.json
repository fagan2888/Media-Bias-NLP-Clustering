In response, Academy toughened its tone on the issue, and in January, AAFP Board Chair Reid Blackwelder, M.D., of Kingsport, Tenn., told CMS that the Academy had grave concerns about the practice. \"We recognize that insurers have a responsibility to align networks of physicians and hospitals to maintain affordable premiums while ensuring quality and efficiency,\" said Blackwelder in a letter to the agency. \"However, we feel that disruptions to the patient-primary care physician relationship are contrary to both of these goals.\" With that background in mind, it's easy to see the good news in a recent press release(www.ncqa.org) from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) that announced the release of its 2016 health plan accreditation standards to emphasize patient access to care and the timeliness of such care.\n\n\n\nStory Highlights The National Committee for Quality Assurance recently reported that it has beefed up its 2016 accreditation standards for health insurance plans to better ensure patient access.\n\n\n\nThe 2016 standards include a network management section designed to more closely scrutinize a plan's provider network and give special attention to high volume and high impact specialties such as primary care.\n\n\n\nSince 2014, the AAFP has been pushing back on the narrowing of insurance networks because the practice has been shown to disrupt relationships between family physicians and their patients.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "AAFP News", "description": "The National Committee for Quality Assurance recently reported that it has beefed up its 2016 accreditation standards for health insurance plans to better ensure patient access.", "pubdate": "2015-08-20", "author": "News Staff", "og": {"image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/logos_internal/og/AAFP-capital-RGB2_1024x512B.png", "description": "The National Committee for Quality Assurance recently reported that it has beefed up its 2016 accreditation standards for health insurance plans to better ensure patient access.", "title": "Are Narrowing Insurance Plan Networks a Thorn in Your Side?"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2015-august/NarrowNetworks_Family-waiting.jpg", "description": "The National Committee for Quality Assurance recently reported that it has beefed up its 2016 accreditation standards for health insurance plans to better ensure patient access.", "site": "@aafp", "card": "summary", "title": "Are Narrowing Insurance Plan Networks a Thorn in Your Side?"}, "lastreviewdate": "2015-08-20", "news-category": "Practice & Professional Issues", "nav-title": "Are Narrowing Insurance Plan Networks a Thorn in Your Side?", "image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2015-august/NarrowNetworks_Family-waiting.jpg.daijpg.90.jpg", "keywords": "narrow networks, health insurance plans narrowing networks, National Committee Quality Assurance, NCQA, 2016 standards, network management", "content-type": "news-article", "archive": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "subcategory": "Practice & Professional Issues"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7ec\"", "article_summary": "Since 2014, the AAFP has been pushing back on the narrowing of insurance networks because the practice has been shown to disrupt relationships between family physicians and their patients.\nThe AAFP -- and the family physicians it represents -- are all too familiar with the concept of \"narrow networks,\" a belt-tightening practice undertaken by health insurance companies to reduce their physician networks.\nStory Highlights The National Committee for Quality Assurance recently reported that it has beefed up its 2016 accreditation standards for health insurance plans to better ensure patient access.\n\"We recognize that insurers have a responsibility to align networks of physicians and hospitals to maintain affordable premiums while ensuring quality and efficiency,\" said Blackwelder in a letter to the agency.\n\"However, we feel that disruptions to the patient-primary care physician relationship are contrary to both of these goals.\""}
