(AP) - In this day of Kindles, Nooks and whatever other electronic book readers there are, finding something to read has never been easier.\n\nTouch your cellphone screen and new books are downloaded to your account. You don\u2019t even have to leave the house.\n\nIt\u2019s good news for readers, bad news for libraries.\n\nTami Anderson, director of the Hartington Public Library, said it\u2019s a challenge to find things in addition to books to draw people through the door reports The Sioux City Journal (http://bit.ly/1DAwNQx ).\n\n\u201cWe have to be more creative in our library services just because of this digital age to get library visitors,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nLucky for her, she\u2019s got a built-in attraction that most libraries don\u2019t have: an art gallery.\n\nThe Arlo and Anne Wirth Art Gallery is a small gem found outside the larger cities where you\u2019d normally expect to find art galleries. Arlo and Anne were big library supporters, and Anne was a longtime library board member. They left a $75,000 gift to the library\u2019s foundation after they died.\n\nIt was a gift that helped the library do something with its old space. A new library had been built at 106 S. Broadway Ave. in 1997, connected to the town\u2019s Carnegie Library, which had been built in 1915. After the new library opened, the board pondered uses for the old space. An art gallery wasn\u2019t one of the original considerations, but the Wirths\u2019 gift \u201cgot the ball rolling,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nLibrary board member Clarence Hoesing did a lot of the work to renovate the upper level of the Carnegie Library into a sizable gallery capable of displaying all kinds of art. It\u2019s not just a small corner of a room reserved for a few paintings; it\u2019s a full floor of wood-paneled walls and spotlights aimed at showing off the skill of local artists. It opened in 2002, a couple years after the Wirths\u2019 gift.\n\n\u201cWe have some regulars who come to see every show,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt is a lot of work, but it adds a lot to our library.\u201d\n\nAnderson purposely seeks out area artists whom local residents may have heard of. She\u2019s found that familiarity brings in more visitors, plus the artists\u2019 friends and relatives.\n\n\u201cIt draws people into our community,\u201d she said.\n\nIt also adds something to the community.\n\nThe high school art teacher brings her students to the gallery to teach them about different art styles. Every March, as part of National Youth Art Month, the gallery displays art from students in all of Cedar County\u2019s schools.\n\nThe gallery also helps boost the career of young artists. For the past three years, one of the shows has featured work from senior art students from nearby Wayne State College.\n\n\u201cIt gives those senior art students a chance to get a gallery experience to show their work,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young kids that have this artistic ability. It\u2019s kind of neat to see.\u201d\n\nThere has been a lot to see: paintings, photography, mixed media, pottery, sculpture. A local quilting group meets in the library basement, and each year their quilts blanket the gallery for a show.\n\nAnderson and her staff like to encourage library visitors to check out the gallery. The exhibits change every two months, so there\u2019s often something new to see.\n\n\u201cWith the changes,\u201d Anderson said, \u201chopefully it brings people back in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly worth checking out, along with a couple books, of course.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Sioux City Journal, http://www.siouxcityjournal.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "In this day of Kindles, Nooks and whatever other electronic book readers there are, finding something to read has never been easier.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "In this day of Kindles, Nooks and whatever other electronic book readers there are, finding something to read has never been easier.", "title": "Hartington art gallery draws readers to the library", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/15/hartington-art-gallery-draws-readers-to-the-librar/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/15/aa86268817d706076e0f6a706700c944.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/15/aa86268817d706076e0f6a706700c944.jpg", "description": "In this day of Kindles, Nooks and whatever other electronic book readers there are, finding something to read has never been easier.", "card": "summary", "title": "Hartington art gallery draws readers to the library"}, "Author": "NICK HYTREK", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe have to be more creative in our library services just because of this digital age to get library visitors,\u201d Anderson said.\nThe Arlo and Anne Wirth Art Gallery is a small gem found outside the larger cities where you\u2019d normally expect to find art galleries.\nLucky for her, she\u2019s got a built-in attraction that most libraries don\u2019t have: an art gallery.\n\u201cIt gives those senior art students a chance to get a gallery experience to show their work,\u201d Anderson said.\nEvery March, as part of National Youth Art Month, the gallery displays art from students in all of Cedar County\u2019s schools."}
