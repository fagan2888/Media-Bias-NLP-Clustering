A new report card released by the March of Dimes grades the 100 largest U.S. cities based on how many mothers living there give birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy, which can lead to serious health complications for babies.\n\nThe preterm birth rate in 2013, the latest year with local data, ranges from 7.2 percent in Portland, Ore., to 18.8 percent in Shreveport, La. (See full list below.)\n\nDr. Siobhan Dolan, an obstetrician at Montefiore Medical Center in New York and a March of Dimes medical adviser, said the cause of preterm births isn\u2019t the same everywhere, so focusing on local rates can help doctors, parents and researchers prevent them. \u201cFor example, smoking has a bad effect on health for everyone and pregnant women in particular,\" Dolan said. \"There\u2019s parts of the country where 20 percent of pregnant women still smoke.\"\n\nStill, she said that \"there\u2019s not one simple answer, there\u2019s not one pill or one shot that will make the difference,\u201d Dolan said.\n\nThe national preterm birth rate spiked in the mid-2000s. Dolan said a number of initiatives have contributed to the decline, including new guidelines that recommend doctors only implant one embryo in at a time during an in-vitro fertilization cycle; doctors discouraging early elective delivery; better access to pre-natal care thanks to the Affordable Care Act; and making sure women have access to birth control to space births the ideal 18 months apart.\n\nDolan added, \u201cin about half of cases of preterm birth, there\u2019s no identified \u2018cause\u2019, quote unquote. We need more research to provide insight into why some women deliver preterm.\u201d She said researchers are not sure why women of some races are more likely to deliver preterm babies.\"\n\nList of cities by premature birth rate in 2013", "article_metadata": {"description": "National disparities in pre-term births, mapped.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "National disparities in pre-term births, mapped.", "title": "The cities where women are most likely to have premature babies", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/12/the-cities-where-women-are-most-likely-to-have-premature-babies/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/09/bigstock-Pregnant-Woman-2068250.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@darlacameron"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/12/the-cities-where-women-are-most-likely-to-have-premature-babies/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "article_summary": "We need more research to provide insight into why some women deliver preterm.\u201d She said researchers are not sure why women of some races are more likely to deliver preterm babies.\"\nList of cities by premature birth rate in 2013\nThe preterm birth rate in 2013, the latest year with local data, ranges from 7.2 percent in Portland, Ore., to 18.8 percent in Shreveport, La.\nThe national preterm birth rate spiked in the mid-2000s.\nDolan added, \u201cin about half of cases of preterm birth, there\u2019s no identified \u2018cause\u2019, quote unquote."}
