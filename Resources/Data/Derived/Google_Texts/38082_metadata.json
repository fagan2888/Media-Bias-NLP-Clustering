Cory Gardner\u2019s proposal to allow the sale of birth control pills over-the-counter.\n\nGardner says in a TV ad that he has a plan to sell oral contraceptives, or the pill, over-the-counter without a prescription. But Congress has nothing to do with the process for making drugs available over-the-counter. That\u2019s done by the Food and Drug Administration if petitioned by the drug manufacturer.\n\nGardner\u2019s ad also says his over-the-counter plan would be \u201ccheaper and easier, for you\u201d than Democratic Sen. Mark Udall\u2019s plan. But the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which Udall voted for and which Gardner voted to repeal \u2014 already requires insurance companies to fully cover birth control costs, including the pill. It\u2019s also unclear whether birth control pills would be cheaper if they were available over-the-counter.\n\nA Planned Parenthood Votes ad claims that Gardner wants to \u201ctake away\u201d insurance coverage for birth control pills and have \u201cwomen pay for all of it.\u201d Yes, he supports the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and, absent any replacement bill, insurers may well revert to covering some \u2013 but not necessarily all \u2013 of the cost. But Gardner hasn\u2019t called for a ban on insurance coverage of the pill.\n\nGardner\u2019s Plan\n\nGardner\u2019s TV ad begins with the candidate saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between me and Mark Udall on contraception?\u201d There are differences between the candidates on birth control, but the political claims from both sides leave voters in the position of having to hunt for them.\n\nMainly, Gardner wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Udall doesn\u2019t. Repealing the law would make a range of birth control more expensive for women with private insurance, but Gardner doesn\u2019t mention that in his ad. Instead, Gardner says in the ad that his plan would make the pill \u201ccheaper and easier, for you.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires most private insurance plans to cover the pill, and other methods of female contraception, including sterilization, IUDs, sponges and spermicides, with no cost-sharing. There is an exemption for nonprofit religious employers, and the Supreme Court ruled in late June in the Hobby Lobby case that for-profit, closely-held companies couldn\u2019t be required to pay for contraception coverage because of a federal religious freedom law. Hobby Lobby and another company, Conestoga Wood Specialties, objected to covering IUDs and emergency contraception on religious grounds.\n\nGardner praised the Hobby Lobby ruling in a statement and called for the FDA to \u201cmove quickly to make oral contraceptives available to adults without a prescription.\u201d In July, Udall co-sponsored a Senate bill to prohibit employers from not covering contraception, but the measure failed.\n\nBirth control has emerged as a key issue in the race. Gardner had first proclaimed his support for over-the-counter birth control pills in a June 19 op-ed published in the Denver Post.\n\nIt came after Udall had aired numerous ads criticizing Gardner\u2019s past support for state personhood initiatives, which are anti-abortion measures that could lead to some hormonal forms of birth control, including the pill, being outlawed. Gardner withdrew his support for the latest state initiative this year, but still supports a similar federal bill. (See our Aug. 15 article \u201cA Fight Over Birth Control in Colorado\u201d for more on this issue.)\n\nGardner\u2019s June op-ed called for birth control pills to be sold over-the-counter without a prescription and touted the convenience and potential cost savings of the idea. He wrote: \u201cSince it makes so much sense, you might wonder why this change has not happened yet. It\u2019s because too many people in Washington would rather play politics with contraception instead of actually making life easier for women.\u201d\n\nBut an act of Congress couldn\u2019t move the pill to over-the-counter status. In fact, what Gardner \u2014 and other Republican Senate candidates, including Thom Tillis in North Carolina and Ed Gillespie in Virginia \u2014 is suggesting wouldn\u2019t happen quickly or easily. A drug manufacturer would submit an application to the FDA, and the FDA would then have to review and approve it. \u201cThis is a decision-making process that\u2019s driven by the FDA, it\u2019s not driven by Congress,\u201d Sneha Barot, senior public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute, told us in an interview. \u201cIt can be a fairly long and expensive process.\u201d\n\nPlus, if the FDA were to approve one brand of the pill, there are dozens more that would need to go through the same process to make all oral contraceptives over-the-counter. A Senate bill introduced by Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte in July included a \u201csense of the Senate,\u201d basically a suggestion, that the FDA \u201cshould study whether contraceptives that are available with a prescription \u2026 would be safe and effective for adults if available without a prescription.\u201d\n\nMaking the pill OTC isn\u2019t a new idea, either. The OCs OTC Working Group \u2014 that\u2019s oral contraceptive (OC) and over-the counter (OTC) \u2014 was established in 2004 to explore the issue. It\u2019s made up of reproductive health and advocacy groups, researchers and clinicians. The Guttmacher Institute, which researches reproductive health issues, is part of it.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s set aside the logistics and look at the claims about what would happen if oral contraceptives were available over-the-counter. Gardner says in his TV ad, \u201cI believe the pill ought to be available over the counter, round the clock, without a prescription \u2014 cheaper and easier, for you.\u201d His campaign says he also wants to \u201callow for women to be reimbursed for it through their insurance.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether birth control pills would be cheaper if they were available over-the-counter. The available research is mixed, and it\u2019s not specifically about the pill.\n\nA 2012 study funded by the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a trade group for manufacturers of over-the-counter drugs, said there were savings from having common ailment drugs over-the-counter \u2014 including allergy, cough/cold and anti-fungal medications \u2014 and that most of the savings came from not needing an office visit to get a prescription. But the study, which looked at drugs that were already available OTC, cautioned that its findings were limited to the medications it analyzed. The OCs OTC Working Group cites two conflicting studies: A 2002 study published in the journal Drug Benefit Trends that found out-of-pocket costs for consumers went up when certain drugs moved from prescription to OTC status, and research from 2005 that found out-of-pocket costs decreased for antihistamines and gastritis medication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unclear what would happen to the price of an oral contraceptive if it went over the counter,\u201d said Barot, who told us the cost of emergency contraception \u2014 which is essentially a high dose of the birth control pill \u2014 went up a bit when it became available without a prescription.\n\nBarot co-wrote a blog post for the journal Health Affairs on Sept. 10 in support of OTC contraceptives paired with the ACA\u2019s requirement for private insurance to fully cover all methods of birth control for women without cost-sharing. A July 30 opinion piece, written by members of Ibis Reproductive Heath, a research and advocacy group that coordinates the OTC working group, and published in The Hill newspaper also argued that: \u201cFor an over-the-counter pill to have the most positive impact on access to contraception, it must be covered by insurance.\u201d\n\nSo would the pill be \u201ccheaper\u201d over-the-counter? Not for women with most private insurance coverage, who get full coverage of the pill and also get a fully covered annual \u201cwell-woman\u201d office visit during which time they can get a prescription. Both benefits are mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Those without insurance coverage could save money, since they won\u2019t have to go to a doctor for a prescription. And even those with insurance may feel the convenience saves them money in terms of not having to miss work or arrange child care to go to a doctor. \u201cThe impact would be different depending on the group of women we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Barot says.\n\nAs for getting the pill over-the-counter being \u201ceasier,\u201d that, too, depends on the person. Women without insurance wouldn\u2019t have to get a prescription, but if the cost were covered through a reimbursement system, as Gardner proposes, they\u2019d have to spend time taking whatever steps were required to get their money back. Women in rural areas, as Gardner points out in his op-ed, may drive long distances to see a doctor and would likely find an OTC option easier.\n\nGardner further claims in his ad that Udall \u201cwants to keep government bureaucrats between you and your health care plan.\u201d It\u2019s true that the ACA places new requirements on insurance companies \u2014 such as covering contraception without cost-sharing. But if Gardner\u2019s plan occurred in conjunction with the ACA, that would still be the case. In fact, in his op-ed, he proposed changing the ACA to allow insurers to cover OTC drugs obtained without a prescription.\n\nAnd some federal regulation might have to be enacted for Medicaid. The OCs OTC Working Group says it\u2019s \u201cunclear\u201d how Medicaid recipients would be affected, since federal Medicaid funds can\u2019t pay for over-the-counter drugs obtained without a prescription, though some states do cover OTC emergency contraception.\n\nThere are missing details to Gardner\u2019s proposal, which, as we mentioned, would have to start with drug manufacturers and the FDA, not Congress. With or without the ACA, he\u2019s still advocating insurance coverage of OTC oral contraceptives, which would presumably require some government regulation. We asked his campaign whether he would require insurers to fully cover birth control pills purchased over-the-counter if the ACA were repealed, or would he allow insurers to make decisions about the level of coverage, as they did before the health care law was passed. We did not receive a response to that question.\n\nWould Gardner \u2018Take Away\u2019 Insurance Coverage?\n\nPlanned Parenthood Votes jumped into the debate with an ad launched Sept. 12 that says on screen, \u201cGardner\u2019s over-the-counter proposal would TAKE AWAY insurance coverage for birth control,\u201d with a drawing of a pack of birth control pills. Another on-screen graphic reads, \u201cGardner\u2019s plan: Women pay for all of it.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Udall campaign has criticized Gardner\u2019s OTC proposal by saying on its website that he had a \u201cradical position on ending insurance coverage for the pill.\u201d Another posting on the campaign website says Gardner \u201chas said that we should remove insurance from the process of purchasing birth control altogether.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve said, Gardner\u2019s campaign says he wants to allow women to be reimbursed for OTC oral contraceptives. His campaign spokesman Alex Siciliano told us that Gardner\u2019s plan is different from many other over-the-counter proposals in this regard. \u201cCory understands the problem associated with potential out-of-pocket cost increases if insurance coverage is lost,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s why Cory has called for a change to Obamacare that will permit the coverage of OTC medication like oral contraceptives without a prescription.\u201d\n\nGardner\u2019s original June op-ed on the idea didn\u2019t fully explain the insurance-reimbursement proposal, but did allude to insurance coverage for OTC oral contraceptives. He wrote in that piece: \u201cSince January 2011, an obscure provision of Obamacare has blocked insurers from covering OTC medicine without a prescription. If Democrats are serious about making oral contraception affordable and accessible, we can reverse that technical provision.\u201d\n\nThe provision bars reimbursement from a Flexible Spending Arrangement or Health Savings Account for over-the-counter medications obtained without a prescription (excluding insulin and medical devices). The ACA does require private insurance plans to cover over-the-counter contraceptives including sponges and spermicides, but only with a doctor\u2019s prescription.\n\nGardner\u2019s camp hasn\u2019t provided more specific details on how his plan would work in terms of insurance reimbursement. But that\u2019s still no reason for Udall and Planned Parenthood Votes to misrepresent his over-the-counter proposal.\n\nWhen we asked Planned Parenthood Votes about its ad, a spokeswoman told us that Gardner\u2019s plan was to repeal the ACA and its full coverage of a range of birth control methods, plus a \u201cvague\u201d over-the-counter proposal for the pill. And since it would take years before any brand of birth control pill was available over-the-counter, women would go back to paying out-of-pocket for contraception in the absence of the ACA, she said.\n\nFair enough \u2014 but that\u2019s not what the ad says. Instead, it says Gardner wants to \u201ctake away\u201d insurance coverage and have \u201cwomen pay for all of it,\u201d and it specifically references the pill. Gardner hasn\u2019t called for any kind of ban on insurance coverage of the pill, or birth control in general. If the ACA were repealed, insurers may well revert to life before the health care law, when many private plans covered some of the cost of prescription contraceptives, according to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute survey of insurers\u2019 on employment-based plans. (In fact, more than half of the states, including Colorado, require insurance plans that include prescription drug coverage to cover contraception. Colorado passed its contraception law in 2010. Gardner voted against it.)\n\nThe Udall camp points to a brief interview Gardner gave to Fox News in July, when he said \u201clet\u2019s take out the insurance\u201d in regards to his OTC plan. The full quote: \u201cI support a birth control policy that will allow us to have common forms of oral contraception available over-the-counter without a prescription. Let\u2019s take out Obamacare. Let\u2019s take out the insurance.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not sure what Gardner meant by that, but it contradicts what his campaign has said since then.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Votes and the Udall campaign would be correct to say that Gardner wants to repeal the ACA, and with it the law\u2019s requirement of full private insurance coverage of women\u2019s contraception. But both twist Gardner\u2019s position into something more extreme. Gardner, meanwhile, tries to sell voters on a plan he himself \u2014 or Congress \u2014 can\u2019t implement. And he glosses over his support for repealing the ACA, a move that, absent additional health care legislation, would increase the cost of a range of birth control methods for many women with private insurance plans.\n\n\u2014 Lori Robertson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e82\"", "article_summary": "\u201cCory understands the problem associated with potential out-of-pocket cost increases if insurance coverage is lost,\u201d he wrote in an email.\nGardner had first proclaimed his support for over-the-counter birth control pills in a June 19 op-ed published in the Denver Post.\n(See our Aug. 15 article \u201cA Fight Over Birth Control in Colorado\u201d for more on this issue.)\nThe full quote: \u201cI support a birth control policy that will allow us to have common forms of oral contraception available over-the-counter without a prescription.\n(In fact, more than half of the states, including Colorado, require insurance plans that include prescription drug coverage to cover contraception."}
