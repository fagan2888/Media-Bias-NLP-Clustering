Mitch McConnell, overly-enthusiastic detractor of Obama\u2019s \u2018war on coal,\u2019 seems to be waging that same war in his own bedroom. It turns out that McConnell\u2019s wife, former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao sits on the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, an organization working to kill the coal industry.\n\nYahoo News has more:\n\nIn 2011, Bloomberg Philanthropies teamed up with the Sierra Club to target coal plants for closure in an effort to \u201cend our nation\u2019s reliance on dirty coal, plant-by-plant, community-by-community, and state-by-state,\u201d according to Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 website\u2026The Bloomberg Philanthropies-funded campaign has a stated goal of \u201cretir[ing] a third of the nation\u2019s 500 coal plants by 2020, replacing the majority of retired coal plants, and keep[ing] coal in the ground in Appalachia.\u201d The organization boasts that it has \u201cprevented 150 coal plants from being built,\u201d and has taken direct action against 16 plants in McConnell\u2019s homestate of Kentucky, arguing that coal production is a health hazard and is harmful to the environment. The website takes credit for retiring 172 \u201cdirty power plants\u201d with \u201c351 to go.\u201d\n\nChao joined Bloomberg Philanthropies in April 2012 and earned $9,400 for her work that year. She also sits on the Board of Directors at Wells Fargo, which announced its intention to divest from Appalachian coal mining because of environmental concerns. Additionally, the company announced that it would cease lending to coal companies that participated in Mountain Top Removal.\n\nSen. McConnell has been aggressively campaigning throughout his home state Kentucky against the EPA\u2019s new carbon regulations which would shutter a number of the state\u2019s coal plants. He has also been outspoken in his disapproval of his opponent Alison Lundergan Grimes for her perceived support of the EPA\u2019s ban. \u201cPeople are against the Kentucky way of life and need to be sent a strong message by the voters in November,\u201d he said on the campaign trail. \u201cThey question our values. They question our work habits. These people are not the kind of people we have here in Kentucky.\u201d\n\nSen. McConnell recently aired the following ad, promising to save the jobs of thousands of coal miners from destructive EPA restrictions:\n\nBut the senator\u2019s record on these issues is less than impressive. Last year, 12,342 people worked in Kentucky coal mines, compared with the over 40,000 employed in the early 1980s. Grimes\u2019 campaign manager, Jonathan Hurst said of the incumbent: \u201cNo matter how many ads Mitch McConnell runs, he can\u2019t hide from the fact that he has failed to save a single coal job in his 30 years in Washington.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The senator from Kentucky has been an outspoken opponent of the EPA's \"war on coal\" VIDEO", "author": "Joanna Rothkopf", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The senator from Kentucky has been an outspoken opponent of the EPA's \"war on coal\" VIDEO", "title": "Mitch McConnell\u2019s wife sits on the board of an organization trying to eliminate coal", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/08/mitch_mcconnells_wife_sits_on_the_board_of_an_organization_trying_to_eliminate_coal/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/kentucky-senate-mcconnell.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The senator from Kentucky has been an outspoken opponent of the EPA's \"war on coal\" VIDEO", "creator": "@@joannarothkopf", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/kentucky-senate-mcconnell.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Mitch McConnell\u2019s wife sits on the board of an organization trying to eliminate coal", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Mitch McConnell\u2019s wife sits on the board of an organization trying to eliminate coal", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Coal, elaine chao, Kentucky, Mitch McConnell, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1868\"", "article_summary": "It turns out that McConnell\u2019s wife, former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao sits on the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, an organization working to kill the coal industry.\nLast year, 12,342 people worked in Kentucky coal mines, compared with the over 40,000 employed in the early 1980s.\nRepublican Sen.
