PLUM CITY - Members of the 1993-94 and 1994-95 boys basketball teams from Plum City High School were honored in a halftime ceremony during the Plum City-Boyceville boys basketball game Saturday afternoon.

These teams were the first state boys basketball tournament teams in school history. In fact they were the first teams in school history to win regional titles in basketball as well in back-to-back seasons and play in the old Spooner Sectional Tournament. Plum City had only been to a state tournament in baseball before then.

Team members were announced by Paul Churchill who was the head coach of those teams. He is currently the Principal at PCHS and the currrent head coach as well.

"These were the team that put Plum City on the map," Churchill said. "What they did was very special for the school and for the whole community."

Team members and coaches were honored later in the day at a pizza party held at Molly's on Main in Plum City.
