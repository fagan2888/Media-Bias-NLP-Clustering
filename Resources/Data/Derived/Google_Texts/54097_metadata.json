The celebration is to honor all the accomplishments of the members for the year.\n\nTo start the event the 2013-2014 officer team received their recognition while saying their opening ceremony speeches. The officer team consists of Wesley Meier, President; Jarrod Thompson, Vice President; Karah Karg, Secretary; Austin Yahn, Treasurer; Ryan Walther, Reporter; Seth Miller, Sentinel; Austin Zink, Parliamentarian.\n\nKarah Karg introduced the guest speaker for the celebration, State FFA President Tim Stahley. Stahley's speech was about members working to their full potential to be successful in reaching goals. Stahley started his speech off by talking about some memories he had from when he showed cattle. He had one story in particular that he shared, about a very ornery cow. He described the struggle he had when the cow got loose and him having to chase it down. \"Well, are you just going to stand there or are you gonna go after it?\" Stahley used this phrase several times in his speech. This phrase came from his father, which he repeatedly said to Tim during their wild cow chase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMembers of the Caliche chapter were humored by this story, but they took something important from the speech. They realized that when they set their goals they can't just stand around waiting for them to be achieved, but instead have to chase after them to be successful in the end. Tim's speech was described as \"genuine.\" He talked about his FFA experience from beginning to end and what he has gained from this organization.\n\nThe 2013-14 Caliche FFA officer team.

The outgoing president expanded on Stahley's speech about working to your full potential. Meier also talked about mediocrity. He said that it is truly a privilege to be a part of such an amazing organization, but it is a shame that so many people choose to be mediocre at it. He has noticed that many people choose to excel at sports and academics, but slack when it comes to FFA. Meier mentioned how honored he is to wear the blue corduroy jacket.\n\nHe left the audience with a challenge to find their purpose in life and work hard at achieving it, then decide what kind of legacy they want to leave behind.\n\nInstallation of the 2014-2015 officer team was the next, and most awaited part of the program. Austin Zink, member of the nominating committee, gave the committee report. Ebony Lester, Sentinel; Kent Summers, Reporter; Kyle Etl, Secretary; Trent Marick, Treasurer; Austin Yahn, Vice President; Karah Karg, President.\n\nThe old officers escorted the new officer team to their respective stations, as Karg took the podium to start the closing ceremonies. After a salute to the flag and a tap of the gavel, the FFA Awards Celebration was over. Members and their families enjoyed cake and ice cream while mingling with others and being honest and fair in the game of life.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-local_news/ci_25916463/caliche-high-school-ffa-members-recognized-at-awards-celebration", "sailthru.author": "By Journal-Advocate staff", "ag": {"canon": "JournalAdvocate:article:25916463:view"}, "startDate": "2014-06-07T07:02:03-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "journal-advocate.com", "description": "On Sunday, May 18, members of the Caliche FFA Chapter gathered for their annual Awards Celebration.
