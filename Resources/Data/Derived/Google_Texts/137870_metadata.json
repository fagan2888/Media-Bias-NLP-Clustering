Today, the Idaho Senate introduced amended legislation to keep the pathway wide open.\n\nThe Senate, on a 27-to-8 vote this afternoon, approved an amended House Bill 644 to give $10.4 million to Idaho health centers for data collection projects and care for low-income state residents.\n\nThe unamended bill, approved by the House Wednesday, stopped there. But Sen. Marv Hagedorn, R-Meridian, amended the measure Thursday morning, and inserted language to allow the state to negotiate Medicaid expansion with the federal government.\n\nHagedorn\u2019s language would ask the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to explore a Medicaid waiver to allow the state to only cover a portion of the projected 78,000 Idahoans who fall in the so-called \u201cgap.\u201d The gap is primarily comprised of single adults who earn too much to participate in Medicaid, but not enough to bring home tax credits through Idaho\u2019s Obamacare exchange.\n\nIdahoans in the so-called gap also lack employer-sponsored health coverage.\n\nHagedorn told his colleagues during floor debate that the bill isn\u2019t the state\u2019s best option, but that it made the best of a bad situation.\n\nSen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCammon, criticized the plan for delaying explicit action to help Idahoans without health coverage. Without endorsing Medicaid expansion, Guthrie expressed his distaste for the plan.\n\n\u201cWe truly need to either fish or cut bait,\u201d Guthrie said.\n\nSen. Jim Rice, R-Caldwell, suggested the plan would lead to a loss of liberty for Idahoans and Americans alike, which he said is not what the country\u2019s founders intended.\n\n\u201cNot one of those who left the bloody tracks in the snow at Valley Forge did so for free health care,\u201d he said.\n\nHe reminded the body that the U.S. Constitution is limited in scope.\n\n\u201cThere is no right to health care,\u201d Rice said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nStill, Rice supported the bill.\n\nSen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, said while he generally opposes federal health-care schemes, he doesn\u2019t believe this qualifies as that.\n\n\u201cI oppose Medicaid expansion,\u201d Lakey said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t look at this as Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nHe said the bill\u2019s language provides for more accountability and oversight than traditional Medicaid, which swayed his vote.\n\nThanks to Hagedorn\u2019s amendment, the House needs to vote on the bill again before it heads to the governor\u2019s desk. That vote will likely come later today as lawmakers attempt to conclude their work for the year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "IdahoReporter.com", "description": "Medicaid expansion was alive, then it wasn\u2019t.
