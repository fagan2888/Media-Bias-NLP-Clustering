He knocked down walls for us.\u201d\n\n\u2013former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant worker Robert Pierce, in an ad for Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)\n\n\u201cBut Mitch McConnell fought for us \u2014 creating cancer screening programs, and providing compensation for sick workers.\u201d\n\n\u2013Pierce, in a shorter version of the ad.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), in his first major ad buy of his reelection campaign, has chosen to highlight his efforts to win compensation and cancer screening programs for workers at a nuclear fuel plant in Western Kentucky. The ads are very evocative, featuring a worker who can barely speak above a whisper because of throat cancer.\n\nMcConnell is a fierce opponent of the Affordable Care Act, which has proven to be quite popular in Kentucky, and it is noteworthy that the ad highlights his efforts on a discrete form of health care and claims that McConnell \u201cgives a voice to Kentucky\u2019s working families.\u201d McConnell faces a potentially strong Democratic challenger\u2014and also a Tea Party rival in the GOP primary\u2013and the Republican leader in the Senate not so subtly highlights his clout.\n\nHere at The Washington Post, these ads hold interest because the problems at the plant\u2014including previously unknown exposure to plutonium\u2014were originally uncovered by our colleague Joby Warrick in 1999. Warrick\u2019s articles, which documented that plutonium and other highly radioactive metals slipped into the plant over 23 years, created a political firestorm and spurred swift action by Congress and the federal government.\n\nLet\u2019s examine whether the assertions made by Pierce holds up to scrutiny.\n\nThe Facts\n\nReaders will note that there is a subtle difference between the two statements: one says that McConnell \u201chelped\u201d create a cancer screening program and provide compensation; the other, shorter ad lacks the modifier and simply asserts that the senator created the programs.\n\nFormer governor Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), who was Energy secretary at the time, in an interview unhesitatingly supported the first version of the ad. He said that, more than any other lawmaker, McConnell was essential to passage of the legislation that created a compensation fund for workers and former workers at DOE plants. In the Senate, he said, there were three key senators\u2014McConnell, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) and Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.)\u2014and \u201cMitch, of the three, helped the most.\u201d He said the bill had stalled, and \u201che got it done. I have to give him credit. The bill was going nowhere.\u201d\n\nBut Richardson is also quick to note that the fund was a Clinton administration initiative\u2014one that he says was in the works before The Post report appeared in print. \u201cI also have to give myself credit,\u201d he said.\n\nRichardson said he become concerned about the plant because of a lawsuit that had been filed by workers a few months before Warrick\u2019s stories were published. He was also moved by a constant stream of letters from the widow of a man who was convinced he had been poisoned at the plant. But when he tried to come up with a plan to compensate workers who had been harmed, it was blocked by the White House Office of Management and Budget as an unaffordable entitlement.\n\n\u201cBecause The Washington Post put it on the front page, that helped me get it past OMB,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIt was a Clinton administration initiative. But I wouldn\u2019t expect him to give me credit in a campaign ad.\u201d\n\nLeon Owen, who was vice president (and later president) of the workers\u2019 union at the time, agreed that McConnell played an important role in the legislative efforts. \u201cMcConnell took the lead in navigating the legislation through Congress,\u201d he said. (Owen currently works for a contractor at the plant.)\n\nIn other words, there is little dispute that McConnell was a key part of a bipartisan team that responded to the reports and enacted legislation to deal with the problem, which is why \u201chelped\u201d is a useful and appropriate modifier.\n\nThe lung cancer screening program has even more of McConnell\u2019s fingerprints. He highlighted the idea at a congressional hearing he chaired on Oct. 26, 1999, and then worked to secure and expand funding for it, according to a 2003 newsletter of the Queens College Worker Health Protection Program, which conducts the screening.\n\n\u201cSenator McConnell was instrumental in setting up our cancer screening program in 1999,\u201d said Steven Markowitz, director of the program, in an e-mail.\n\nOf course, the question arises whether McConnell should have done more before The Post expose was published. Mark Donham, who for six years chaired the plant\u2019s Citizens Advisory Board on the cleanup, wrote an opinion article in 2008, when McConnell last ran ads featuring the Paducah plant. \u201cMcConnell did little or nothing to further environmental concerns at the plant until he was so embarrassed about his failures that he felt compelled to do something,\u201d he argued.\n\nDonham, in an interview, said that McConnell was responsible for \u201cbenign neglect\u201d because \u201che was aware that people were saying there were problems with the plant and he should have held a congressional hearing.\u201d But he conceded, \u201cit was not just McConnell. There was a hear-no-evil, see-no-evil, speak-no-evil attitude about the plant\u201d because of its importance to the local economy.\n\nA lengthy profile of McConnell in The Huffington Post last year made a similar case, saying that before the Post articles, \u201cMcConnell\u2019s sole concern about the plant seems to have been protecting it from layoffs and lawsuits.\u201d\n\nStill, Richardson says that McConnell had contacted him about the problems at the plant before the Post stories were published, urging an investigation and help for the workers.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to reach a definitive conclusion about whether McConnell should have done more about the conditions at the plant. Certainly the political failure was collective, especially at the Department of Energy, which had fought long and hard to dismiss the concerns of workers. But at the same time, McConnell took a leading role once the problems were documented.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nThe record is fairly clear on the specific issue of McConnell\u2019s involvement in securing funding for workers after the Washington Post articles appeared. He had a critical role in shepherding legislation through Congress\u2014a textbook example of helping constituents faced with a crisis.\n\nThe version of the ad that lacks the crucial modifier of \u201chelped\u201d goes a bit too far, as it suggests it was McConnell alone who did this. The compensation plan was a Clinton administration initiative, though it appears it would have failed without McConnell\u2019s intervention. At worse, that would be a One Pinocchio violation.\n\nThe other ad, with the word \u201chelped,\u201d stands up well by the standards of such ads. We will leave to political pundits the irony of McConnell running an ad that features what is, in effect, an entitlement program. We have been critical of McConnell\u2019s campaign ads in the past, but the longer version of this ad earns a coveted Geppetto.\n\nGeppetto Checkmark\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "We examine how much Sen.
