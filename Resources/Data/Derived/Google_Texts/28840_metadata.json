The dunk eliminated Sacramento\u2019s Ben McLemore, the last hope for the Western Conference. Wall was named \u201cdunker of the night.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, the dunk contest was a competition between conferences. Along with McLemore, the West was represented by Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard, Golden State\u2019s Harrison Barnes.\n\nEarlier, San Antonio\u2019s Marco Belinelli won the 3-point contest.\n\nThe Italian, who previously played for New Orleans, needed to win a tiebreaker round in the final to beat Bradley Beal.\n\nThe Washington all-star had made his final six shots, including two \u201cmoney balls\u201d worth two points each, to tie Belinelli\u2019s initial final-round score of 19.\n\nBelinelli then racked up an event-high score of 24 for the win.\n\nBelinelli had a score of 19 to win the West, beating Damian Lillard\u2019s 18. Beal had a score of 21 to win the East, easily eclipsing defending champ Kyrie Irving\u2019s total of 16.\n\nEarlier, the tandem of Portland\u2019s Lillard and Utah\u2019s Trey Burke won the skills challenge, while Team Bosh, consisting of Miami\u2019s Chris Bosh, former NBA star Dominique Wilkins and WNBA player Swin Cash, won the shooting stars event.\n\nLillard won the skills challenge for the second straight year.\n\nLillard and Burke, representing the Western Conference, beat the tandem of Michael Carter-Williams and Victor Oladipo of the East in the final round by a tenth of a second.\n\nThe skills course consists of dribbling around obstacles, passing to targets, and hitting shots from medium and close range. The winning time was 45.2 seconds.\n\nIn the first round, Lillard and Burke beat Phoenix\u2019s Goran Dragic and Oklahoma City\u2019s Reggie Jackson.\n\nCarter-Williams and Oladipo downed Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo and Toronto\u2019s DeMar DeRozan to represent the East in the final round.\n\nBosh hit a half-court shot to give his team the victory in the Shooting Stars contest that opened up NBA All-Star Saturday night.\n\nTeam Bosh had a final-round time of 31.4 seconds.\n\nEach team had to hit shots from 10 feet from a right-side angle, the top of the key, 3-point range and half court, with the victory going to the team with the best time.\n\nTeam Durant, consisting of Kevin Durant, Karl Malone and Skylar Diggins, opened the final round with a time of 43.6.\n\nThere were two teams from each conference. Team Durant beat Team Curry \u2014 made up of Stephen Curry, Dell Curry and former Colorado State standout Becky Hammon \u2014 in the first round to represent the West. Team Bosh edged Team Hardaway \u2014 consisting of Tim Hardaway Jr., Tim Hardaway Sr. and Elena Delle Donne in the first round.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wall\u2019s wizardry helps win slam dunk contest", "title": "Wall\u2019s wizardry helps win slam dunk contest", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/15/walls-wizardry-helps-win-slam-dunk-contest/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140216__dunk-contestp1.jpg", "height": 508}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140216__dunk-contestp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-16T01:00:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:16:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde831\"", "article_summary": "Carter-Williams and Oladipo downed Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo and Toronto\u2019s DeMar DeRozan to represent the East in the final round.\nTeam Bosh edged Team Hardaway \u2014 consisting of Tim Hardaway Jr., Tim Hardaway Sr. and Elena Delle Donne in the first round.\nTeam Durant, consisting of Kevin Durant, Karl Malone and Skylar Diggins, opened the final round with a time of 43.6.\nThe Italian, who previously played for New Orleans, needed to win a tiebreaker round in the final to beat Bradley Beal.\nTeam Bosh had a final-round time of 31.4 seconds."}
