D\u2019Entrone wears many different hats in the process of finding services, including gaining authorizations from insurance companies and helping a substance abusing person navigate the admission process for help. \u201cI\u2019m kind of a boots on the ground person in the community,\u201d D\u2019Entrone said, \u201cproviding screening for people who need treatment, helping them access treatment, whether it\u2019s with us or someone else.\u201d He taps into services available throughout Ulster and Duchess County, including government, outpatient, residential, community and mental health services.\n\nD\u2019Entrone explained that, historically, insurance companies did not recognize mental health and addiction. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that people understand benefits and understand some of the laws that have passed in the last decade or so, federally and also in New York State.\u201d He began with the New York Parity law (aka Timothy\u2019s Law) signed by Governor George Pataki in 2006 that mandated insurance companies treat mental health equally with physical health. D\u2019Entrone said, \u201cI remember at times, patients would be coming in and we would be verifying the benefits and [there would be] no detox benefits, no rehab benefits. In 2008, when the Parity law went into effect, the state slowly enforced them.\u201d\n\nNow, according to law, insurance companies must have detox and rehabilitation services in their plans, including 60 outpatient visits following inpatient treatment, and 20 therapeutic outpatient services for family members. Insurance companies can no longer mandate outpatient services before inpatient. Previously, if a person failed as an outpatient, then inpatient would be considered. \u201cIt used to be even if you were using ten bags of heroin a day, you had to go to outpatient first. That no longer happens,\u201d said D\u2019Entrone. When the Affordable Care Act went into effect, and was later strengthened through the Federal Combat Heroin Initiative, a mandated process went into place for insurance denials requiring appeals process to be met within 24 hours. While that appeals process is in place, a patient cannot be denied treatment for those days. \u201cIf they don\u2019t get back in 24 hours, it automatically reverses the denial,\u201d said D\u2019Entrone.\n\nOpenness has also improved as the new laws went into effect. D\u2019Entrone explained that before the laws, \u201cwe would have to throw stuff at the wall and see what stuck. They wouldn\u2019t tell us what the criteria were. Now it\u2019s very transparent.\u201d If the claim is still denied, an external appeal would then be filed with the State and that appeal must be decided within 72 hours.\n\n\u201cWe have to hold insurance companies accountable,\u201d said D\u2019Entrone, \u201cand that\u2019s how a lot of these changes will take place.\u201d He pointed out important websites that advocate for patients through the Attorney General of New York State Health Care Bureau, and the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services. \u201cIf there is a possible violation of someone\u2019s rights, they (the State) need to be made aware of this.\u201d For opiates, D\u2019Entrone said, \u201cWe used to see denials left and right.\u201d Those patients were instead sent to outpatient services and, \u201cwe know that is not good enough, and a lot of people died and a lot of people continue to die from this.\u201d\n\nAround 2014, he said, the organization he works for stopped getting denials. \u201cEspecially opiates, there has been sort of a sea change not only with the number of denials that we are not getting anymore, but also there seems to be a greater likelihood they\u2019re going to get approved. It\u2019s not an issue as it used to be.\u201d\n\nIdentifying pills\n\nEarlier during the meeting, during the power point presentation, Micucci presented the website Drugs.com and pointed to a section titled, Pill Identifier. She explained if parents may suspect their child is abusing prescription drugs, this would be a place to identify anything found. \u201cIf you are finding weird pills in your house, this is something to really think about and maybe start a conversation.\u201d Every pill would have an imprint number to type in. Micucci and Quednau went through a long list of illegal substances including cocaine, marijuana, crystal meth, hallucinogens, and inhalants. What they deem the most poplar abused substances locally, are benzodiazepines and opiates, which include Xanax, Valium, OxyContin and heroin. Micucci said, \u201cRemember that addiction is a mental health issue, and it doesn\u2019t discriminate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Woodstock Times", "description": "The Rt. 212 Coalition meeting on substance abuse brought out a handful of people on a snowy Tuesday night at the Town Hall in Woodstock as founders Shayna Micucci and Kasandra Quednau introduced Wo\u2026", "title": "Rt. 212 Coalition talks insurance in substance abuse treatment", "url": "http://www.woodstockx.com/2016/03/01/rt-212-coalition-talks-insurance-in-substance-abuse-treatment/", "image": {"width": 290, "identifier": "http://www.woodstockx.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/212TaskForce-SQ.jpg", "height": 290}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-01T11:30:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-25T19:44:01+00:00"}}, "article_summary": "Insurance companies can no longer mandate outpatient services before inpatient.\nD\u2019Entrone explained that, historically, insurance companies did not recognize mental health and addiction.\nD\u2019Entrone wears many different hats in the process of finding services, including gaining authorizations from insurance companies and helping a substance abusing person navigate the admission process for help.\nWhile that appeals process is in place, a patient cannot be denied treatment for those days.\nWhen the Affordable Care Act went into effect, and was later strengthened through the Federal Combat Heroin Initiative, a mandated process went into place for insurance denials requiring appeals process to be met within 24 hours."}
