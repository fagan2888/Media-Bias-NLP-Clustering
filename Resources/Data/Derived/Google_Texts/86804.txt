The U.S. Army debuted its newest unity Saturday, the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team at Fort Carson.

A ceremony was held in Pinon Canyon where the unit has been training for the last year. The 230,000 acre area has a lot more room to maneuver than Fort Carson does, making it an ideal training site for three battalions to work together.

This week the troops will convoy back from the training site to Fort Carson. More than 600 military vehicles will be making the trip.
