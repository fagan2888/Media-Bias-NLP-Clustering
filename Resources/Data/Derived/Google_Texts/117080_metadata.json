Recognizing that healthcare was about to experience a revolution, in 2005, Wayne Lipton founded Concierge Choice Physicians (CCP), a company created to provide physicians and patients with greater choice and freedom in how healthcare was delivered. This May, the company celebrates its 10th anniversary, making it one of the oldest and largest concierge companies in the nation.\n\n\u201cFew of us back in 2005 could have predicted what healthcare would look like in just 10 short years,\u201d says Lipton. \u201cAs healthcare continues to become larger and more systems-oriented, we are seeing a real interest from patients and physicians for a return to a more personalized approach to healthcare.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s because of this desire for a more one-on-one relationship with their physician that CCP\u2019s innovative approach to concierge medicine, including Hybrid Choice\u2122 and FullFLEX\u2122, have grown.\n\n\u201cI was one of the first members of the CCP hybrid model and it has been a very good choice for my patients and practice,\u201d said Glenn Soppe, M.D., a family practice physician in San Diego, California and one of the first to join CCP. \u201cAt times I have considered doing this on my own, but with all CCP does for the practice, I decided not, and still, after 10 years, I am very happy about this decision. CCP does a much better job at managing the program and communicating with patients than we could. We wish them continued success,\u201d he says.\n\nChanges in national healthcare law encouraged Sanford Friedman\u2014MD, FACC, FACP, a top cardiologist in New York City, to sign up for CCP. One of the latest physicians to join, he says CCP\u2019s flexible approach to concierge ensures he can care for his patients who want a more personalized connection to their physician, and continue to accept insurance plans and Medicare.\n\nFriedman is representative of a new trend in concierge, a growing number of specialists exploring the option, especially the hybrid (where a small portion of the practice chooses to join the concierge program).\n\n\u201cI have a large practice; I\u2019ve known my patients for years and many are friends,\u201d he notes. \u201cI was forced to make a change because all the turmoil in healthcare was making it difficult for small practices to survive. I was initially concerned that my patients wouldn\u2019t embrace the change, but the response has been overwhelmingly positive! It\u2019s an unexpected validation of my life\u2019s work. I can see why CCP has made it to their tenth anniversary. I wish them the best as they continue to help physicians find ways to care for patients and maintain their practices.\u201d\n\nConcierge care, defined as a relationship in which a patient pays a membership fee in exchange for range of services not covered by insurance, began in the early 2000s. Interest grew significantly after the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 when patients and physicians realized it would be hard to secure a truly personal relationship as payers moved to volume and team-based care to ensure greater efficiencies and cut their costs.\n\nIn return for a modest fee averaging about $5/day with the CCP program, patients gain access to a range of enhanced services not typically covered by their insurance (which most retain) \u2014 including executive-style physicals that retail for considerably more than the annual yearly fee; enhanced preventive care; same- or next-day appointments; leisurely office visits; shorter provider wait times; and direct access to physicians by way of private phone numbers, mobile phones, texts, and other means. Children up to age 26 are covered under their parents\u2019 program.\n\n\u201cI can honestly say the last 10 years have been an adventure,\u201d says Lipton. \u201cWe\u2019ve been witness to a historical change in our nation\u2019s healthcare system and I\u2019m proud that we are helping physicians and patients find options that meet their needs and preferences.\u201d\n\nAbout Concierge Choice Physicians\n\nDedicated to providing real options for patients and physicians, Concierge Choice Physicians\u2122 is one of the largest private providers of the full range of concierge programs available today\u2014Hybrid Choice\u2122 and FullFLEX\u2122.
