CA tells North Delta C.A.R.E.S. we should revive Tulare Lake from Gene Beley on Vimeo.\n\nTulare Lake was once the largest body of fresh water west of the Mississippi River, fed by the Kern, Tule and Kaweah rivers. But it was drained by farmers and cities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. With the water gone, the former lake\u0092s rich bottom soils have been used for farming.\n\nIf the Central Valley cuts back on irrigation due to the drought or other demands on its current system of water transfers, Mr. Simpson feels it can have devastating impacts on other states that will lose rainfall.\n\nMr. Simpson is not a graduate water engineer or politician. He is a college business graduate, real estate broker and contractor who got interested in the California water problems in an offbeat way. His son\u0092s church had scheduled a water skiing weekend at a Southern California lake that was too low to launch a boat. The church had to reorganize the trip and travel a long distance to a reservoir north of the California Delta that had enough water for water skiing plus shade for camping.\n\nMr. Simpson began researching the water problems and first studied the Bay Delta Conservation Plan which proposes to build gigantic, 40-feet in diameter twin tunnels that would hook up to the Sacramento River and divert water southward to the Tracy Clifton Forebay before going farther south. Immediately, Mr. Simpson thought the plan was \u0093unrealistic in its expectations.\u0094\n\n\u0093Why are we paying $25 billion for a project that promises no extra water down south?\u0094 Mr. Simpson asked himself.\n\nThe $25 billion is the \u0093official\u0094 estimate but independent estimates, which unlike the state\u0092s figure include the cost of the money borrowed for the project, put the tab at about $67 billion.\n\n\u0093Also, it provides the ability for any politician to suck extra water out of the North Delta and destroy habitat for the Delta smelt farther south in the salinity zone that feeds salmon, striped bass, large mouth bass and other fisheries,\u0094 Mr. Simpson said.\n\nSubsequently, he spent a year intensely researching California water problems. Then he ran into Steve Haze, of Auberry (northeast of Madera) and semi-retired from the Silicon Valley high tech world who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2010. Mr. Haze was the first one he met who was promoting a revival of Tulare Lake.\n\nTulare Lake was once a 600 square mile body of water and a stop for thousands of birds on the Pacific Flyway. But by 1871 the lake that provided boating and fishing recreational outlets was being used for agriculture water diversions. Fences became a more common site than birds. In the 1920s one of the first big corporate farmers, James G. Boswell bought 50,000 acres of the lake bottom and began planting cotton \u0097 the king crop of his day. (For more details of that era, read the book, \u0093The King of California.\u0094)\n\n\u0093I came to some of the same conclusions as some of you other folks,\u0094 Mr. Simpson told his Clarksburg audience.\n\n\u0093Pumping winter waters from the Delta that has flows from 50,000-500,000 cubic feet per second going out to sea is a much safer time for the inhabitants of Suisun Bay and for the folks here in the North Delta, rather than pumping water from the Delta when flow rates are small. They can get as small as 2,000 feet per second during those times that salt water is bleeding into the Delta. The less than fully treated sewage from Sacramento is providing a toxic chemical mix that is not good for the Delta or the farmers.\n\n\u0093I made an Excel model of 43 years of data that indicated by utilizing our existing canals, we can provide a minimum of 1.2 million extra acre feet per year on average \u0097 stretched out over the long term. This can be used to fill a new Tulare Lake.\n\n\u0093We would use the Western Delta Intakes Concept design, or at least the location. I believe this is a viable solution.\u0094\n\nBut he said he doesn\u0092t believe anyone today has all the answers and that\u0092s why he is eagerly meeting with groups like North Delta CARES in Clarksburg to come up with a solution that works for everyone. He seems to be the latest of several citizen activists who are hoping to pull together the North and South warring factions in the water world.\n\nMr. Simpson said a hydrologist who worked at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena said for every drop of water that we irrigate, it\u0092s just not one drop of water that evaporates and falls in the Colorado Rockies, or panhandle in Texas \u0097 it is more than one drop. \u0093Irrigation in the Central Valley actually increases the strength of the Northern American monsoon water cycle,\u0094 he said.\n\n\u0093Water flowing over the Sierra Nevada June through September joins with the North American monsoon and strengthens the flow, like with a hurricane, when moist air goes into the core. Rain falls in the Rockies. It provides water into the Colorado River, the Rio Grand River, the Arkansas River and the Red River for farmers in the Midwest, our national forests, and those regions. Make no mistake \u0097 the water policies we maintain here have an effect on our nation and economy.\u0094\n\nMr. Simpson reminded the audience that when the U.S. slowed down manufacturing, it went to China. \u0093If we stop producing food in the Central Valley, where is the most likely place it will go? The rainforest of South America? Central America?\u0094\n\nMr. Simpson showed in a power point presentation what he feels are today\u0092s main problems in water policy:\n\n\u0095 Lack of interest by the general public.\n\n\u0095 Lack of understanding by the general public.\n\n\u0095 Lack of understanding by politicians\n\n\u0095 Engineering bias from special interest groups\n\n\u0093Politicians push water plans that reflect the wants and needs of constituents and fail to see the larger picture,\u0094 he said. \u0093They fail to see everything is connected. We must take a larger environmentally sound look at how to solve our water problems.\u0094\n\nHe said that understanding water issues in the Tulare Basin are the key to understanding the problem and the solution.\n\nHow would reviving Tulare Lake work?\n\nMr. Simpson showed a graphic with a yellow line indicating the wet season when San Luis Reservoir gets filled. \u0093There is no need for irrigation during that time of year,\u0094 he said. \u0093We end up all wasting the capacity that our forefathers built with their money and tax dollars that left us with an under-used asset. If we can take water out of the environment in an environmentally friendly sort of way and move it down south and store it in Tulare Lake, we can join with the San Joaquin Restoration program and actually pump water back to the Bay Area and the Delta with about 400,000 acre feet per year to help maintain the environment within the Delta.\n\n\u0093That is a vast amount of water that goes out to sea. There is a vast amount of under-utilization of existing infrastructure. As a general contractor, if the state of California were my client, I would say, \u0091Look, you\u0092re looking at doing a remodel here. Utilize the assets you have, the blessings God has given you, and maximize your return for the dollar you spend. This includes using pumping during the winter and using Tulare Lake.\u0094\n\nHe says the \u0093new\u0094 Tulare Lake would be connected via an existing structure to the Kern Canal.\n\n\u0093We\u0092d have outlets going back to the north. The turnover rate of this lake would be as quick as the turnover rate for the San Luis Reservoir. We\u0092re going to be returning water utilizing about 800,000 acre feet of water to irrigate, returning about 400,000 acre feet back into the Delta. We\u0092re increasing San Joaquin River inputs into the Delta during the drought years to maintain an outflow of at least 10,000 cubic feet per second prior pumping. There will still be times when actual outflow drops to 7,500 feet from 10,000 but it will not be 2,500. That\u0092s what kills fish and creates other problems.\u0094\n\nMr. Simpson said this circular kind of system was pioneered by Steve Haze, who was sitting in the audience. \u0093We have the ability to circulate this water and move it around the Central Valley by not having some sort of transport system across the valley. You\u0092re relying on Friant Dam and its reservoir to feed all of Bakersfield and that area. Currently the idea is to take that away and use it for the San Joaquin River Restoration Program.\u0094\n\n\u0093There are farmers in the Central Valley whom have planted long term, water hungry plants increasing the amounts shown in the video to 600 acre feet to over one million. We have to strike a balance with new ground water laws.\u0094\n\nHe continued, \u0093We need more water for farmers but we need the farmers\u0092 cooperation in terms of doing dry land farming and irrigating. But we can no longer continue to over use the assets. Just because we give you more, it doesn\u0092t mean you have it.\u0094\n\nThe race to the bottom\n\n\u0093The race to the bottom means who can dig the deepest well that produces the most water to suck the most out to produce the most water rich crop,\u0094 said Mr. Simpson. \u0093That particular philosophy needs to go away.\u0094\n\nHe pointed to how Lake Tahoe and Lake Mead are getting depleted. He said if irrigation in the Central Valley goes way down, those areas won\u0092t receive the evaporated water and the nation can\u0092t afford to let that happen. He also said there is a need for more managed outlet recharge locations. He said the Tulare Lake Basin\u0092s soil is easily penetrated and is ripe for recharge.\n\n\u0093In an El Ni\u00f1o year, we could pump as much as five to six million acre feet more to create an artificial flood in this area,\u0094 continued Mr. Simpson. \u0093Much of it could be used for irrigation.\u0094 He added that other water could be used for recharging groundwater for long-term storage for the next drought.\n\n\u0093It is a combination of adding recharge during wet years and reducing pumping that will bring us to a possibility of groundwater management,\u0094 he said. \u0093Under California law, you are entitled to use any groundwater under your property. This is one of those race to the bottom things. If you are a farmer, you are competing against your neighbor for that limited resource. It\u0092s been conflated with politics and corruption. These are as large an issue as the engineering. The engineering is actually pretty simple \u0097 storage in the north and conveyance during the summer to extraction during the winter and wet seasons, then store it in the south to have a lot more efficient system. I join with Steve Haze and his ability to shuffle the water around and where to put groundwater recharge stations to flood fields during extremely wet years.\n\n\u0093I also join with Robert Pyke\u0092s Western Delta Intake Concept (WDIC), saying \u0091Hey, he\u0092s got a great idea in terms of this Sherman Island thing and self-regulating system. If you try to pump too much water during a dry season, or disrupt the flows in the north Delta or eastern inputs, or anywhere else, you will be sucking salt water through your own intakes. I\u0092d rather have that than a politician with his hand on the trigger like the BDCP where they can say my buddy down in Southern California needs more water, so can we pump more through the BDCP (twin tunnels) and cut off flows to the Delta for the smelt and farmers within the Delta.\u0094\n\nMr. Simpson concluded by saying, \u0093I\u0092ve heard the frustration in your voices. I\u0092ve been on the ground and see what\u0092s going on. It really saddens me that most of us don\u0092t trust our government.\u0094\n\nMr. Haze commended Mr. Simpson for coming from Southern California. Mr. Haze said he heard about an individual from Fresno who was going to speak in Vallejo that planned to say, \u0093The best thing that can happen is an earthquake and a flood in the Central Valley \u0097 \u0093nothing about people living here or about the economy or way of life.\u0094\n\n\u0093There are greater interests and greater powers that do not look at how to respect everybody\u0092s way of life. It does mean sharing and making sacrifices. The Greatest Generation of this country made extraordinary sacrifices when asked. We\u0092re not talking about making extraordinary sacrifices. What we\u0092re talking about is making people like Rob from Southern California coming up here to say, \u0093I\u0092m against those tunnels. I don\u0092t want water transferred South of the Delta if it will impair the Delta.\n\n\u0093But when you talk about salt water intrusion, that\u0092s another challenge. You don\u0092t want brackish or salt water to intrude into the Delta because it will affect agriculture. The bottom line is it doesn\u0092t matter how much research or how many more reports are made. We are at 10 million-acre feet of extraction in the San Joaquin Valley. That is not sustainable. It\u0092s a call to action.\u0094\n\n\u0093Rob,\u0094 concluded Mr. Haze, \u0093thank you for coming to share your concepts, your ideas. Working with people here in the Delta is the most important. If there\u0092s a place I would stand no matter where I live in California, it\u0092s right here in the Delta, because it is indicative of the future of California.\n\n\"If we can\u0092t take care of the Delta, the people, agriculture, environment and the economy, California loses overall. It\u0092s more important to protect the Delta in my humble opinion and the people of Clarksburg, Walnut Grove, Isleton and others here than to have the water sent south to have another high rise in LA.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "California, Central Valley, business, San Joaquin Valley, Great Central Valley, news, urban sprawl, rural, real estate, housing, farming, dairy, agribusiness, cotton, oil, gasoline, ethanol, biodiesel, alternative fuels, prices, Kern, Tulare, Kings, Fresno, Madera, Merced, Mariposa, Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Stockton, Modesto, Merced, Visalia, Portervile, Bakersfield, Schwarzenegger", "distribution": "global", "description": "Central Valley Business Times.
