Every time I work out at Crunch Fitness I see the trainers warm their clients up with what they call a "dynamic warm-up." I incorporate stretching into my workout routine but Crunch Fitness trainer Jameson Fullick says this warm-up helps make the muscles "a little more pliable and (it) reduces the risk of injuries."

What you see in the video below: high knees, heel-to-toe reach, cradle step, toy soldiers, good mornings, quadricep stretch and lateral step.
