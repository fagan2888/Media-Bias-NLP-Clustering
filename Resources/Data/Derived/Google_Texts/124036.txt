Q In your recent Roadshow columns and Page One story, you did not address the very real concerns some of us have about FasTrak and privacy. Recent publications have documented the amount of tracking information FasTrak can acquire, and how it is kept on file for a long time. I do not support FasTrak for this reason.

A I know this worries some drivers, but Bay Area bridge officials insist it's not a reason to fret.

Said John-the-MTC-Man:

"Readers who think FasTrak can be used to track their whereabouts are just plain wrong. Yes, FasTrak can be used to identify which lane of which bridge was traveled at what time by a vehicle with which toll tag. But guess what? We get that same information for every vehicle passing through the toll plazas.

"Even if you don't use FasTrak, we have a camera system to record bridge, lane number, time and both front and rear images of the vehicle license plate.

"These toll collection points are the only places on the entire freeway system where this data is collected. How many of those worried about privacy have a cellphone on in the car while traveling around the region? Further, FasTrak data cannot be used for marketing or shared with any parties other than those responsible for the toll collection and customer service systems.

"Even law enforcement agencies must obtain a court order to get narrowly specified FasTrak information during investigations of criminal cases."

Q What is the plan to accept FasTrak at the San Jose airport?

C.D. Kennedy

A Not likely. The airport did consider using FasTrak at one time as a method of payment in its parking lots, but learned it's expensive to operate and the benefits to passengers didn't pencil out. Plus, drivers currently do not experience any backups when exiting lots, so there is no benefit to adding FasTrak.

Q While on a trip in Southern California, we encountered many HOV lanes. With three people in our car, we used them. However, we just received in the mail a ticket for a FasTrak violation. I assumed that as long as we had a carpool, we could use any lane. Guess I was wrong.

A Wrong you were. If you use express lanes with a passenger in Southern California, you must have a FasTrak Flex tag programmed for one, two or three passengers. Operators of express lanes in Los Angeles decided to require all users to have transponders to make it easier to enforce the lanes and also keep track of carpool use. In the Bay Area, those Flex tags won't be needed until this October, and then only on the new Interstate 580 express lanes. But more of those lanes are coming; if any readers missed that article, it's posted on the website at www.mercurynews.com/mr-roadshow. Look for the Fastrak Flex headline.

Q Should people with two-seater cars set the switch to two or three when crossing the Bay Bridge?

A The setting does not matter at the toll bridges. Eligible carpools using the carpool lane and paying with FasTrak (the old tag or the Flex tag) get the discounted $2.50 toll.
