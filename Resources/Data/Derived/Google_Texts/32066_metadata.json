McCall Leadership Lecture at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Nov. 6. The lecture, Hewitt said, is important because of the mission of the seminary to send out leaders into the world with the Great Commission.\n\n\u201cI know what the mission of this institution is: it\u2019s a volcano of leadership and it throws out leaders across the world,\u201d he said. \u201cLong it\u2019s done that and long may it do so.\u201d\n\nMcCall, the leader whom the lecture honors, was Southern Seminary\u2019s seventh and longest serving president (1950-1982). Hewitt, a broadcast journalist and lawyer, hosts the Hugh Hewitt Show with more than two million listeners each week, lectured to the seminary community about the need for strong leaders in today\u2019s society. He examined three leaders he esteems as important, and considered character qualities that he believes make each of the men good leaders. Hewitt knew some may not agree with him, so he asked the audience to suspend their judgments on the individuals he lectured about.\n\nEarly in his career, Hewitt worked on Richard Nixon\u2019s writing staff. He noted that even though Nixon\u2019s presidency ended with failure when he resigned following the Watergate scandal, he was able to provide counsel to world leaders up until his death. This, Hewitt said, exemplifies failures do not have to define a leader.\n\n\u201cThere is no setback that is final; there is no permanent failure,\u201d he said.\n\nHewitt, who also worked for President Ronald Reagan as assistant counsel in the White House and special assistant to two attorneys general, also discussed the leadership qualities of Chief Justice John Roberts, his officemate during his time with the administration. He praised Roberts\u2019 humility despite the accomplishments and intelligence demonstrated by his work in the White House. Hewitt said Roberts showed courage and conviction in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act, an unpopular decision among conservatives.\n\n\u201cLeaders do what leaders have to do even when they know that those upon whom they\u2019ve counted for support will not be there for them,\u201d Hewitt said. \u201cLeaders must be ready to get hit from behind.\u201d\n\nThe third leader Hewitt examined was Mitt Romney, 2012 Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor. Although he disagrees with his Mormon faith, Hewitt described Romney as a man committed to his family and faith, emphasizing the importance of family in leadership roles. It is not inconsistent to live faithfully toward a family, Hewitt said, and Christian leaders need more of this in their lives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen too many leaders lose their leadership because they first lost the love of their spouses and children,\u201d he said.\n\nHewitt also offered students five practical tips for growth in leadership qualities: be physically prepared to endure the hardships that accompany leadership positions; spend ample time with spouse and family because leaders can never do it too often; read consistently and widely, both for growth and enjoyment; embrace social media with discipline and purpose; and be deeply involved with politics. He gave 10 suggestions for good citizenship, including several ways to support schools, politicians and community.\n\nHewitt closed the lecture lauding President George W. Bush and his leadership during and after his presidency. He illustrated Bush\u2019s humble leadership with several stories including his private encouragement during his last week in office to radio talk show hosts to give his successor, Barack Obama, a chance as the new commander in chief.\n\n\u201cThe best and worst thing about being a leader is you get to decide,\u201d he said, emphasizing that the president, no matter who he is, makes difficult decisions on a daily basis that affect a whole nation, which is why it is important to cultivate good leadership skills.\n\nAudio and video from the lecture is available online at sbts.edu/resources.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "Successful leaders need a strong will and disciplined life, said broadcaster Hugh Hewitt in the fourth annual Duke K.
