They\u2019re divided over the ongoing military intervention in Iraq, a dispute made more difficult by the fact that Americans increasingly see the U.S. as obliged to subdue the Islamist militants there. And on the home front, the party is tearing at itself over the unrest in Ferguson, Mo. where local and state Democratic leaders are dropping the hammer on increasingly violent protests to the outrage of liberal activists. And what does the Democratic president say about all of this? Well, it\u2019s complicated. President Obama, in Washington for a two-day vacation from his vacation, took essentially the same attitude to both current crises, saying that the individuals involved needed to work things out on their own and that the federal government would be judicious in its involvement. Got it. That equivocal attitude got Obama a broadside today in the NYT for being disengaged and aloof from his own party. That\u2019s nothing new, especially coming from moderate Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. But what about Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid?\n\n\n\n[The cabinet, ranked in scatological magnetism - According to Politico, President Obama refers to his confidante and point man on the Missouri unrest, Attorney General Eric Holder, as his administration\u2019s designated \u201cs***t magnet.\u201d]\n\n\n\n\u2018Reid seethed quietly\u2019 - From NYT: \u201cThe meeting in the Oval Office in late June was called to give President Obama and the four top members of Congress a chance to discuss the unraveling situation in Iraq. But Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, wanted to press another point. With Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, sitting a few feet away, Mr. Reid complained that Senate Republicans were spitefully blocking the confirmation of dozens of Mr. Obama\u2019s nominees to serve as ambassadors. He expected that the president would back him up and urge Mr. McConnell to relent. Mr. Obama quickly dismissed the matter. \u201cYou and Mitch work it out,\u201d Mr. Obama said coolly, cutting off any discussion. Mr. Reid seethed quietly for the rest of the meeting, according to four separate accounts provided by people who spoke with him about it. After his return to the Capitol that afternoon, Mr. Reid told other senators and his staff members that he was astonished by how disengaged the president seemed.\n\n\n\n[Not almost heaven - \u201cAsked to characterize his relationship with the president, Mr. Manchin, a centrist Democrat who has often been a bridge builder in the Senate, said: \u2018It\u2019s fairly nonexistent. There\u2019s not much of a relationship.\u2019\u201d]\n\n\n\nBAIER TRACKS: THE WORLD IS WATCHING\u2026\n\n\u201cThe media is focused like a laser on the unrest in Ferguson, Mo. And as is often the case, the news frenzy feeds itself once ratings surge or the number of clicks increase. That\u2019s certainly not to say that the story doesn\u2019t merit full and extensive reporting, but the wall-to-wall coverage given to such stories encourages Americans to see individual stories as passing events rather than part of a larger narrative about our world and our lives. The media tendency is to focus on one chapter of our American story and then turn the page, moving on and forgetting about the passions of the previous moment. We see the chapters, but we don\u2019t always read the book.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also been interesting to note the extensive, sometimes gleeful, foreign press coverage. Russian and Chinese outlets are hammering the U.S. for civil rights abuses and Reuters reports that Egypt\u2019s foreign ministry is warning against harsh treatment of protesters, even echoing the language used in U.S. statements to the government in Cairo urging \u201csecurity forces to exercise maximum restraint and caution\u201d during the 2013 crackdown on protestors backing Egypt\u2019s deposed Islamist government. My how things have changed from the Arab Spring to the Ferguson Summer.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier\n\n\n\nWHITE HOUSE: NO DOCS ON OBAMACARE WEB SECURITY\n\nFox News: \u201cThe White House has rejected a request to publicly disclose documents relating to the kinds of security software and computer systems behind the federal health care exchange website on the grounds that the information could \"potentially\" be used by hackers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services denied a Freedom of Information Act request made late last year by the Associated Press amid concerns that Republicans raised about the security of the website, which had technical glitches that prevented millions of people from signing up for insurance under ObamaCare. In denying access to the documents, including what's known as a site security plan, Medicare told the AP that disclosing them could violate health-privacy laws because it might give hackers enough information to break into the service. \u2018We concluded that releasing this information would potentially cause an unwarranted risk to consumers' private information,\u2019 CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said in a statement.\u201d\n\n\n\nObamaCare batters businesses - Daily Caller: \u201cObamacare is increasing the cost of providing health insurance to workers, according to a report released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A majority of businesses surveyed by the New York Fed expect the health-care law to increase the cost of their coverage, and the median respondent estimates a boost by 10 percent in 2015\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nWhat is the perfect cup of coffee worth? According to the design mind behind the latest entrant into the world of ultra-premium coffee machines, the Blossom One Brewer, a perfectly brewed cuppa might cost you $11. Fast Company introduces us to Jeremy Kuempel, the MIT-trained engineer who left the world of high-tech in a bid to move Americans away from the espresso-milk coffee drinks and back into the delights of brewed coffee, rendered unappetizing by automatic drip machines and the plastic coffee sarcophagi made common by automatic one-cup pod brewers. \u201cEchoing the sentiments of many third-wave coffee purists, Kuempel also believes it won\u2019t be long until coffee will be appreciated and subsequently sold like wine. Not just $3 or $4 a cup, but why not $11 for a rare, delicious single origin from a nano-lot?\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Republican primary frontrunner Dan Sullivan and campaign staffer, retired Air Force Col. Otto Feather, did just that on Monday. The two were among the first on the scene of an accident after a semi-truck rear-ended a Princess Tours bus on a remote stretch of the George Parks Highway, near Hurricane Gulch, Alaska. According to Sullivan\u2019s campaign, the candidate and the colonel \u201cassessed the scene, notified Mat-Su Valley Emergency Services, and assisted in removing passengers from the tour bus. In addition, Colonel Feather directed the landing of the first responders\u2019 helicopter on the Highway.\u201d State troopers reported only minor injuries in the accident according to Anchorage Dispatch News. Two events on Sullivan\u2019s RV campaign tour had to be cancelled due to the encounter. Sullivan is one of a trio of candidates facing off today in Alaska\u2019s Senate GOP primary. The winner will be gunning for vulnerable Democratic Sen. Mark Begich, in a key race in the Republican quest for control of the Senate this fall. The other two GOP contenders are Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell, whose Alaskan political pedigree reaches back to the late 70s, and Tea Party favorite and 2010 Senate candidate Joe Miller.\n\n\n\n[Real Clear Politics offers five things to watch for in Alaska\u2019s GOP Senate primary. RCP aggregation of the latest Alaska polling is here.]\n\n\n\nA surge for Miller? - WSJ: \u201cMiller is trying to replicate the 2010 surge that won him the surprise GOP Senate nomination. Mr. Miller, who has drawn tea-party support, has spent the summer campaigning not just against his GOP opponents\u2014former state attorney general Dan Sullivan and current Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell \u2014but against Sen. Lisa Murkowski, [R-Alaska,] whom he beat in the 2010 GOP Senate primary only to lose to her when she ran a write-in campaign for the general election\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n[Polls Close in Alaska at 12 am ET.

Cynthia Lummis, face perhaps their biggest challenges this election year as they compete with lesser-known challengers in Wyoming\u2019s Republican primary Tuesday. Retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Bryan Miller, of Sheridan, is contesting Enzi\u2019s bid for a fourth term\u2026.Enzi\u2019s most serious challenger had been Liz Cheney, the elder daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. But Liz Cheney had difficulty getting mainstream Republicans to back her candidacy and, citing family health issues, dropped out of the race in January\u2026.Lummis, who is seeking a fourth term, faces Jason Senteney, 36, a corrections officer and volunteer firefighter from Torrington who said he wants to speak for the working class. Lummis, 59, said she needs to return to Washington so she can continue to protect Wyoming\u2019s interests against what she calls federal overreach on issues like endangered species and water.\u201d Neither incumbent is likely to fail in November in the increasingly red state.\n\n\n\n[Polls in Wyoming close at 9 pm ET. For Results: Wyoming Secretary of State.]\n\n\n\nBUT I THOUGHT BUBBA WAS A VEGAN\n\nDes Moines Register: \u201cHillary and Bill Clinton will return to Iowa next month as headliners for the 37th Harkin Steak Fry, The Des Moines Register has learned. It will mark Hillary Clinton\u2019s first public appearance in Iowa since losing the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses in early 2008, and will undoubtedly spark a national political firestorm, as she is widely expected to run again in 2016. The Harkin Steak Fry, hosted annually by U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin [D-Iowa], frequently attracts the top names in Democratic politics\u2026With Harkin\u2019s coming retirement from the Senate, this year\u2019s Steak Fry will be his last\u2026Hillary Clinton has had a rocky relationship with Iowa. Then a U.S. senator from New York, she entered the lead-up to the 2008 Iowa Democratic caucuses as the front-runner, only to finish a disappointing third behind the surging Barack Obama and John Edwards in second.\u201d\n\n\n\nHillary gearing up to pitch for Dems - The Hill: \u201cHillary Clinton is heading to San Francisco in October for a fundraiser with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) focused on House Democratic women candidates\u2026A Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee aide said the former secretary of State will join Pelosi in her home district this fall as part of Clinton\u2019s midterm campaign tour. She\u2019s also expected to headline fundraisers for the rest of the party\u2019s major campaign committees\u2026Though Clinton is one of Democrats\u2019 most coveted campaign surrogates, she\u2019s largely stayed away from electoral politics thus far this cycle, only hosting a fundraiser for a Pennsylvania Democratic House candidate who ultimately lost her primary bid.\u201d\n\n\n\nPELOSI PROVIDES PLUMS FOR STEYER\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer, a Democratic mega-donor, seems to get what he wants. As Washington Examiner\u2019s Tim Carney details: \u201c\u2026[W]hy did the federal government give $10 million in taxpayer money to develop [San Fran Cisco\u2019s Mission Bay] transit? House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi cheerfully announced in 2012 that the federal government would shell out eight figures in stimulus funds for \u2018street additions, highway off-ramps, bike lanes, pedestrian walkways, and transit additions.\u2019 Why are the bike lanes for the millionaires of Mission Bay the responsibility of taxpayers in Green Bay? As always, follow the money \u2014 and the lobbying. And no surprise, the trail leads you to the West Coast mansion of liberal Billionaire Tom Steyer, the Democrats\u2019 top funder in the 2014 elections\u2026Steyer raised money for President Obama and donated to Pelosi while Pelosi pushed for the federal money that profited Steyer \u2014 and that Steyer\u2019s fund, Farallon Capital, lobbied on.\u201d\n\n\n\n[A new report from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s School of Law is predicting outside spending this midterm cycle will exceed the $97 million that those groups spent on 37 Senate races in 2010.]\n\n\n\n-- 77 days until Nov. 4 --\n\n\n\nGRIMES CAMPAIGN GETS GOODIES FROM DAD\u2019S FIRM\n\nA review conducted by Politico finds Allison Lundergan Grimes\u2019s campaign vehicle could place her add odds with federal election laws. According to the review Grimes\u2019 father, Jerry Lundergan, a former Blue Grass State Democratic Party chairman and state lawmaker, is renting a campaign bus to the campaign far below market value. Lundergan who was forced from office in 1989 for accepting a no-bid contract for catering an event in violation of a state law.

Sarah Palin, R-Alaska. From the ad: \u201cJoni Ernst would be another Tea Party vote in the Senate. Ernst would privatize Social Security. She\u2019d cut taxes for millionaires and eliminate the national minimum wage.\u201d The ad concludes with a narrator saying, \u201cPalin. Ernst.

The Hill: \u201cThe $7 million raised by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee online in July is just $1 million less than the total raised from all sources by its GOP counterpart.

Pardo was one of the original voice talents for the game show \u201cJeopardy.\u201d Pardo\u2019s booming voice was one of the first to tell the nation of the death of President John F. Kennedy. SNL Producer Lorne Michaels said he wanted Pardo to be voice of authority for the newly launched sketch show. Pardo did that but also proved to be game for comedy bits and self-parody. Along the way, Pardo\u2019s voice became known to five generations of Americans and, no matter how flat the season of the long-running sketch show, the sound of hope that the next Eddie Murphy or Phil Hartman was waiting in the wings to be discovered.
