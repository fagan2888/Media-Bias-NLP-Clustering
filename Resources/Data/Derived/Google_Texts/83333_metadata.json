For decades, taxpayer-backed policies kept premiums artificially low. With insurance rates so cheap, wiped-out home\u00adown\u00aders could rebuild again and again \u2014 despite the increasing risks.\n\nThen came Katrina. Claims after the historic 2005 storm broke the National Flood Insurance Program. Its debt is $25 billion and getting deeper with every storm.\n\nEven before Sandy, Uncle Sam wanted out of the flood insurance business. The solution was the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, which phases out government-subsidized policies and, over time, forces flood-prone property owners to pay market rates. The first higher bills began arriving last month. In some cases, premiums rose thousands of dollars.\n\nWith sticker-shock setting in, some in Congress, including Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), are urging a delay. That\u2019s a reasonable call. Move too quickly and only the wealthy will be able to afford Jersey Shore housing.\n\nLast week, Menendez sponsored a bill to slow down Biggert-Waters \u2014 delaying rate hikes up to four years while the Federal Emergency Management Agency conducts an affordability study and devises a plan to ease home\u00adown\u00aders\u2019 pain. The bill would stall rate hikes for primary home\u00adown\u00aders and recently bought homes, although not for vacation homes or those in the highest-risk zones, where damage is frequent and expensive.\n\nAmong Menendez\u2019s concerns:\n\n\u2022 Biggert-Waters\u2019 changes were relatively sudden: The law passed in mid-2012, leaving New Jersey\u2019s almost 40,000 subsidized policyholders with little time to prepare for drastic price hikes;\n\n\u2022 The accuracy of FEMA\u2019s post-Sandy flood maps, which put thousands more properties into high-risk flood zones and sent insurance rates soaring, has been questioned;\n\n\u2022 The Northeast is still recovering from Sandy\u2019s destruction. For many, the immediate worry is rebuilding, not insurance.\n\nThose concerns are valid \u2014 especially in New Jersey, where flooding has grown chronic: Post\u2013Sandy, we\u2019re the No. 1 collector of flood claims outside the Gulf of Mexico coast. Eleven flood-related disaster declarations in eight years. Climate change and sea-level rise only heighten our risk.\n\nMenendez\u2019s questions deserve a full hearing before Congress. At a minimum, a Biggert-Waters requirement that home\u00adbuy\u00aders start paying full-market flood insurance rates immediately must go. It\u2019s estimated that every $1,000 in higher flood insurance premiums drops a home\u2019s value by $20,000. That\u2019s crushing sellers in the Shore\u2019s still-weak housing market.\n\nEven Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the law\u2019s namesake, supports a delay. But a four-year timeout goes too far, and could give opponents time to gut the law for good. Ceres, a sustainability-geared nonprofit, has recommended keeping Biggert-Waters on schedule, while offering help to those who show they can\u2019t afford the hikes.\n\nSoftening the blow while keeping the fixes on track combines wisdom and compassion.\n\nIts timeline may be flawed, but the law remains sound: Taxpayer subsidies let policyholders underpay for flood insurance for decades. That, in turn, encouraged overdevelopment in high-risk flood zones with little concern for the risks.\n\nThe question now is how \u2014 not whether \u2014 to implement the law. Helping flood insurance stay affordable is reasonable and humane. Continuing to sell taxpayer-backed policies whose premiums don\u2019t come close to covering the damage would be unsustainable and nuts.\n\nWe should do everything possible to ease home\u00adown\u00aders\u2019 pain, without slowing the commitment to disconnect taxpayers from the National Flood Insurance Program before the next Sandy \u2014 or, worse, the next Katrina \u2014 breaks the bank for good.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "hurricane-sandy, national-news, robert-menendez, news", "title": "Flood insurance reforms must go on to survive the next Sandy: Editorial", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Flood insurance reforms must go on to survive the next Sandy: Editorial\", \"link\": \"http://blog.nj.com/njv_editorial_page/2013/11/flood_insurance_reforms_must_g.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/njv_editorial_page/photo/13695125-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11556514\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-03T12:02:46Z\", \"author\": \"Star-Ledger Editorial Board\", \"tags\": [\"@njvoices\",\"@river\",\"hurricane-sandy\",\"national-news\",\"robert-menendez\"] }", "twitter": {"description": "It's estimated that every $1,000 in higher flood insurance premiums drops a home's market value by $20,000.", "creator": "@NJ_Opinion", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/njv_editorial_page/photo/13695125-standard.jpg", "title": "Flood insurance reforms must go on to survive the next Sandy: Editorial", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, November 03, 2013,  7:02 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/njv_editorial_page/photo/hurricane-katrinajpg-f7cf69fdd7ccc808.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"njosledit\", \"author_nickname\": \"Star-Ledger Editorial Board\", \"author_id\": \"1828476\", \"source_blog_name\": \"The Star-Ledger Editorial Page\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://blog.nj.com/njv_editorial_page/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "It's estimated that every $1,000 in higher flood insurance premiums drops a home's market value by $20,000.", "title": "Flood insurance reforms must go on to survive the next Sandy: Editorial", "url": "http://blog.nj.com/njv_editorial_page/2013/11/flood_insurance_reforms_must_g.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/njv_editorial_page/photo/13695125-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NJ.comOpinion/"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, November 03, 2013,  7:00 AM", "article_author": "Star-Ledger Editorial Board", "Description": "It's estimated that every $1,000 in higher flood insurance premiums drops a home's market value by $20,000."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0014\"", "article_summary": "Even before Sandy, Uncle Sam wanted out of the flood insurance business.\nIt\u2019s estimated that every $1,000 in higher flood insurance premiums drops a home\u2019s market value by $20,000.\nClaims after the historic 2005 storm broke the National Flood Insurance Program.\nAt a minimum, a Biggert-Waters requirement that home\u00adbuy\u00aders start paying full-market flood insurance rates immediately must go.\nIt\u2019s estimated that every $1,000 in higher flood insurance premiums drops a home\u2019s value by $20,000."}
