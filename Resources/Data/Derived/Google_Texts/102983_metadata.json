House Majority Caucus Chairwoman Sannie Overly, Conway\u2019s running mate, was offered as an alternate, but CAE declined that offer, Kemp said, adding that the campaign was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the audience did not hear from the ticket.\n\nDespite Conway\u2019s absence, Bevin found a target within his vicinity in The Courier-Journal\u2019s Joe Gerth.\n\nBevin accused the journalist and others in the news media of intentionally misinterpreting his views on early childhood education. During his response, Bevin turned to, gestured toward and addressed Gerth, who was seated in a front pew, by name.\n\nBevin\u2019s vitriol stems from coverage of the May 11 Republican primary debate on KET\u2019s \u201cKentucky Tonight,\u201d in which Bevin criticized the federal Head Start program. He said Head Start \u201cserves no purpose\u201d once students reach third grade, and he advocated \u201cputting everything we have\u201d in developing a new system, although he did not propose an alternative.\n\nWhile Gerth\u2019s piece on that debate reflected Bevin\u2019s call for a reconsideration of money spent on early childhood education, Conway and the Kentucky Democratic Party have seized on Bevin\u2019s Head Start remarks to portray him as an enemy of such initiatives.\n\nBevin, who reminded the audience of his nine natural and adopted children, said he wholeheartedly supports early childhood education initiatives at Tuesday\u2019s forum, but specific policies he would pursue to bolster young learning if elected governor were nonexistent.\n\n\u201cWe need education across the board, on all fronts,\u201d he said. \u201cNo question about it. What does that look like? What is the cost of that? Because whether we like it or not, there is a cost to everything. Maybe it\u2019s the cost of your time. Maybe it\u2019s absolute dollars. Maybe it\u2019s some combination thereof, but it will cost something.\u201d\n\nStable families and societal support will also help improve education outcomes for children, he said.\n\nBevin was clear on one point, calling to randomly drug test recipients of \u201csome of the benefits that are received in this state\u201d when asked how he would combat substance abuse as governor.\n\nHe said the state could not test every public aid recipient because that would be too costly.\n\n\u201cWill it preclude this from happening? Of course it won\u2019t,\u201d Bevin said. \u201cIs this going to fix the problem? Of course it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t have any delusions to the fact that it will. Will this help to limit the influx of people who are wrestling with this? You bet, because some people among us have the wherewithal, if we know that there may be some punitive result, to not enter into activity that ultimately would entrap us.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the proposal may be limited solely to recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or welfare. The Cabinet for Health and Family Services, in a 2014 legislative analysis on a bill that would have mandated drug tests for recipients with prior felony or misdemeanor drug convictions, said federal law prohibits the state from setting additional requirements on Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamp, beneficiaries.\n\nThirteen states have passed measures mandating drug tests for public assistance recipients in some form, according to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures. The Associated Press reported in March that Florida Gov. Rick Scott declined to request a U.S. Supreme Court review on Florida\u2019s drug-testing law after a federal appeals court ruled it an unconstitutional search and seizure.\n\nBevin has made dismantling Kentucky\u2019s health-benefit exchange under the Affordable Care Act a key plank of his campaign platform, and he also has his sights on shaking up CHFS. When asked about the cabinet under his administration if victorious, Bevin said it would \u201clook very different than it looks today.\u201d\n\nHe heaped praise on Louisville Metro Council member Julie Denton, a former state senator who chaired the Senate Health and Welfare Committee and backed Agriculture Commissioner James Comer in the May 19 primary.\n\nBevin called Denton, who sat in a front pew, \u201can extraordinary asset and ally to me\u201d and someone \u201cwho you know for a fact cares about this issue, is knowledgeable about this issue, knows 10 times anything that I\u2019ll ever know about some of these issues, which is why I\u2019m grateful for the fact that she\u2019s willing to be somebody who is supportive of my willingness to learn more.\u201d\n\nDue to time constraints, Pure Politics could only cover the first hour of the CAE forum Tuesday afternoon.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "cn|2", "description": "The event was touted as a gubernatorial forum and its logo featured the mascots of both political parties, but those who lined the pews of Crescent Hill Baptist Church on Tuesday only heard from one candidate: Republican Matt Bevin.\n\n\tThe Louisville investment manager had the stage to himself for...", "title": "Bevin takes aim at Courier-Journal reporter in Conway's absence at Louisville forum", "url": "http://mycn2.com/politics/bevin-takes-aim-at-courier-journal-reporter-in-conway-s-absence-at-louisville-forum", "image": "http://mycn2.com/images/10817.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://mycn2.com/images/10817.jpg", "description": "<p>The event was touted as a gubernatorial forum and its logo featured the mascots of both political parties, but those who lined the pews of Crescent Hill Baptist Church on Tuesday only heard from one candidate: Republican Matt Bevin.</p>\n\n\t<p>The Louisville investment manager had the stage to himself for more than an hour, touching topics like poverty, health care, drug abuse and early childhood education in front of officials from myriad non-profits and community groups at the forum hosted by the Council of Agency Executives.</p>\n\n\t<p>Donovan Fornwalt, chief executive officer of the Council on Developmental Disabilities and public policy chairman for <span class=\"caps\">CAE</span>, said he reached out to Attorney General Jack Conway\u2019s campaign in March and hoped to have the Democratic nominee speak to the group at a later date. </p>\n\n\t<p>Daniel Kemp, Conway\u2019s campaign spokesman, said the candidate had a \u201clongstanding conflict,\u201d but he declined to elaborate.
