Trading under the stock symbol AAC, the company is offering 250,000 shares with estimated net proceeds of $66 million. In the first 30 minutes of trading, the price hovered above $18 per share.\n\nIt\u2019s a significant move in the behavioral healthcare market, which is generally comprised of smaller organizations and not-for-profit institutions. However, for-profit and public entities aren\u2019t so rare in the larger business of healthcare overall. It\u2019s not unusual for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers, insurance carriers and some hospital companies to be publicly traded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of perception,\u201d says Paul Schwada, a Chicago-based business consultant. \u201cIf it\u2019s healthcare, it\u2019s work that needs to be done. And sometimes it\u2019s better for it to be done by a for-profit than by a not-for-profit.\u201d\n\nSchwada says behavioral health entities can operate with a profit-making model because treatment and recovery services provide benefit to the many people nationwide who need them. Too often, not-for-profit organizations struggle with accountability and lack of strong leadership, he says. In his estimation, AAC has a good mix of executives with for-profit and not-for-profit experience.\n\n\u201cYou just plain get better results when you are for-profit and when people have to perform,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they can do it better than anybody else, they will expand and perform and provide people with real help.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Nashville Tennessean, Cartwright\u2019s goal is to build AAC into the first billion-dollar brand in the addiction space. His 2013 total compensation package amounted to $1.9 million, which included a $1.2 million bonus, according to its recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And observers are calling AAC a worthwhile buy.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of money in behavioral health because the need is so widespread,\u201d Schwada says.\n\nIn fact, he says he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if AAC grows from its current six locations to 60 or more and moves behavioral health from a cottage industry to a franchise industry.\n\n\u201cFolks are going to look at this as a bellwether,\u201d he says.\n\nAAC growth projection\n\nAs chairman and CEO, Cartwright propelled AAC to $115 million in revenue in 2013, earning it a position on the Inc. Top 500 list, at No. 474. With six owned/leased inpatient centers accounting for 467 beds, AAC also has three new facilities under development (Tampa, Dallas and Las Vegas), as well as an additional property pending for purchase in Ringwood, N.J. Acquisitions are part of its growth strategy moving forward, according to the company, and it is particularly interested in claiming existing properties that lend themselves to behavioral health care models.\n\nAAC is in a position to benefit from the increasing sources of payment for addiction treatment that have emerged as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Not only are more individuals covered by private health plans under the law\u2019s provisions, their plans are also more likely to cover mental health and SUD services. In 2013, 90% of AAC\u2019s revenues came from a mix of commercial payers, with the balance paid by individuals directly.\n\nFollow AAC here or here on the New York Stock Exchange.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s a significant move in the behavioral healthcare market, which is generally comprised of smaller organizations and not-for-profit institutions.\n\u201cThere is a lot of money in behavioral health because the need is so widespread,\u201d Schwada says.\nThis morning, American Addiction Centers launched its initial public offering\u2014a milestone CEO Michael Cartwright has been working toward for quite some time.\nAAC is in a position to benefit from the increasing sources of payment for addiction treatment that have emerged as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\nTrading under the stock symbol AAC, the company is offering 250,000 shares with estimated net proceeds of $66 million."}
