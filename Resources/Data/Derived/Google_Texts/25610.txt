About Health Net Federal Services

Health Net Federal Services has a long history of providing cost-effective, quality managed health care programs for government agencies, including the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. As the managed care support contractor for the TRICARE North Region, Health Net provides health care services to approximately 2.8 million uniformed services beneficiaries, active and retired, and their families. In addition, Health Net provides high quality, cost-effective health care solutions for veterans, as well as behavioral health services for active duty service members, veterans and their families.

Additionally, Health Net Federal Services administers the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Patient Centered Community Care (PC3) program in three of six regions across the United States (regions 1, 2 and 4), which includes all or portions of 37 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The PC3 program provides eligible veterans access to health care through a comprehensive network of community-based, non-VA medical professionals who meet VA quality standards when VA supplements care outside its own facilities. In 2014, VA extended its PC3 contract with Health Net to include primary care services for veterans who are unable to obtain primary care at a VA medical center in the three PC3 regions in which Health Net operates. The expanded PC3 contract now adds primary care services to Health Net’s existing specialty care and behavioral health services.
