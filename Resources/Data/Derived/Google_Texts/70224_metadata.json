To ensure that these new coformulations are accessible to all who need them, they must be priced in accordance with today's cost-containment needs, particularly those affecting HIV care and treatment delivery in the U.S.\n\nThe Fair Pricing Coalition, of which TAG is a member, is requesting individual and organization sign-ons for a letter to Gilead Sciences, in advance of an October 12th meeting to discuss pricing and access plans for these TAF-inclusive coformulations.\n\nDrug pricing in the U.S. is proving to be beyond what the market can reasonably bear. Antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV continue to face significant access barriers, including high-copay specialty drug tiering and prior authorization requirements by employer-based and Affordable Care Act health insurance plans, along with restricted access by state Medicaid programs and Medicaid managed care organizations.\n\nPlease join us in urging Gilead Sciences to buck the historical trend of pricing new products higher than that of their predecessors, particularly when TAF may be seen as offering only incremental benefit at a premium price.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thebody.com/content/76405/request-for-sign-ons-letter-to-gilead-on-pricing-o.html", "type": "article", "image": "http://img.thebody.com/images/thumbnails/dollarsigns_200x200.jpg", "site_name": "TheBody.com", "title": "Request for Sign-Ons: Letter to Gilead on Pricing of New HIV Drug TAF"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600154527", "twitter": {"description": "The Fair Pricing Coalition is requesting individuals and organizations to join them in 'urging Gilead Sciences to buck the historical trend of pricing new ...", "title": "Request for Sign-Ons: Letter to Gilead on Pricing of New HIV Drug TAF", "url": "http://www.thebody.com/content/76405/request-for-sign-ons-letter-to-gilead-on-pricing-o.html", "image": {"src": "http://img.thebody.com/images/thumbnails/dollarsigns_200x200.jpg"}, "site": "@TheBodyDotCom", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The Fair Pricing Coalition is requesting individuals and organizations to join them in 'urging Gilead Sciences to buck the historical trend of pricing new ..."}, "article_summary": "The Fair Pricing Coalition is requesting individuals and organizations to join us on a sign-on letter to Gilead Sciences about the pricing of their new HIV drug.\nThe Fair Pricing Coalition, of which TAG is a member, is requesting individual and organization sign-ons for a letter to Gilead Sciences, in advance of an October 12th meeting to discuss pricing and access plans for these TAF-inclusive coformulations.\nPlease join us in urging Gilead Sciences to buck the historical trend of pricing new products higher than that of their predecessors, particularly when TAF may be seen as offering only incremental benefit at a premium price.\nDrug pricing in the U.S. is proving to be beyond what the market can reasonably bear.\nTo ensure that these new coformulations are accessible to all who need them, they must be priced in accordance with today's cost-containment needs, particularly those affecting HIV care and treatment delivery in the U.S."}
