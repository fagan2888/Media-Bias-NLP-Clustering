It consumed the political oxygen, and generated an intense amount of speculation: Was Romney doomed? Could Republicans recover? Does this guarantee President Obama\u2019s reelection?\n\nAt the time, it looked like a glancing blow to the GOP campaign. But, in hindsight, it wasn\u2019t. There was nothing about that video that changed the political landscape. The former Massachusetts governor saw a small decline in his numbers against Obama\u2014going from a deficit of 2.8 points to 4 points\u2014and a slight uptick in his un-favorability. At most, it was a few weeks of bad press, which were abruptly forgotten after his strong debate performance against the president. But even that didn\u2019t last: In the end, the fundamentals prevailed and Obama won a small victory, as predicted by most models of the election.\n\nThis is all apropos of the GOP\u2019s ongoing obsession with the tragedy in Benghazi. As Brian Beutler notes for Salon, conservatives are working furiously to \u201cskew\u201d the narrative for Hillary Clinton, who they assume will be the Democratic presidential nominee:\n\nIn the conservative bubble, the only thing diving toward impact faster than Obamacare is Hillary Clinton\u2019s expected presidential candidacy, which is apparently doomed by a Senate Intelligence Committee report\u2019s finding that the Benghazi attack could have been prevented. [\u2026]\n\nIn Rubin\u2019s telling, this is \u201cbridge gate times 1000 for Hillary\u201d who\u2019ll never be able to turn the page, unlike Chris Christie, who already has.\n\nIn the real world, \u201cBenghazi\u201d means little to the broader public, and has done little to diminish Clinton\u2019s standing with the public. To wit, in the latest (meaningless) poll of the 2016 race, the former Secretary of State leads all competitors, including New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.\n\nBut let\u2019s say that the real world reflected the conservative fantasy. Let\u2019s say that, yes, the public was aware of Benghazi, and took it seriously as a political scandal. And let\u2019s also say that this persisted through the midterm elections, and into the presidential primaries, so that\u2014by 2016\u2014Hillary Clinton was thoroughly identified with Benghazi. Would it mean anything for the presidential election? Would she be finished?\n\nI doubt it.\n\nNot only would Benghazi have to scare away the legions of Democratic donors in Clinton\u2019s camp, but it would have to tank her standing with Democratic policymakers, elected officials, party leaders\u2014local, state, and national\u2014and key constituencies. In short, it would have to make her less viable than every other competitor in the field. And if she made it to the general election, it would have to overcome any advantage she may gain from economic performance, the president\u2019s job approval, and other fundamentals.\n\nIn short, even in the GOP\u2019s dream scenario\u2014where \u201cBenghazi\u201d is as much a part of Hillary\u2019s political biography as Gennifer Flowers and \u201cWhitewater\u201d were a part of Bill\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s hard to imagine tremendous damage to her political career. And if economic conditions are good, and President Obama leaves with his popularity intact, then\u2014even with Benghazi on her saddle\u2014Clinton stands a good chance of winning the presidency.\n\nWhich is to make a point that, by now, should be obvious: Presidential elections are less about personalities and campaigns than they are about the economy. That\u2019s not to say the former don\u2019t matter\u2014a strong candidate with a good campaign is a good bet against a weak one with a bad campaign\u2014but that all things equal, broad conditions will affect the outcome more than controversies and scandals.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201401161945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Sorry Conservatives, Benghazi Wont Stop Clinton", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Even in the hypothetical world where the public cares about this scandal, it probably wouldn\u2019t harm a Hillary Clinton bid for the White House", "title": "Sorry Conservatives, Benghazi Won\u2019t Stop Clinton", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/16/sorry-conservatives-benghazi-won-t-stop-clinton.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/16/sorry-conservatives-benghazi-won-t-stop-clinton/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1390260256417.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "Even in the hypothetical world where the public cares about this scandal, it probably wouldn\u2019t harm a Hillary Clinton bid for the White House", "tags": "u_s_politics0", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-16T19:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/16/sorry-conservatives-benghazi-won-t-stop-clinton", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Sorry Conservatives, Benghazi Won\u2019t Stop Clinton\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/16/sorry-conservatives-benghazi-won-t-stop-clinton.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/16/sorry-conservatives-benghazi-won-t-stop-clinton/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46342008.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/16/sorry-conservatives-benghazi-won-t-stop-clinton\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-16T19:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a28\"", "article_summary": "In the real world, \u201cBenghazi\u201d means little to the broader public, and has done little to diminish Clinton\u2019s standing with the public.\nLet\u2019s say that, yes, the public was aware of Benghazi, and took it seriously as a political scandal.\nAnd let\u2019s also say that this persisted through the midterm elections, and into the presidential primaries, so that\u2014by 2016\u2014Hillary Clinton was thoroughly identified with Benghazi.\nBut let\u2019s say that the real world reflected the conservative fantasy.\nAnd if economic conditions are good, and President Obama leaves with his popularity intact, then\u2014even with Benghazi on her saddle\u2014Clinton stands a good chance of winning the presidency."}
