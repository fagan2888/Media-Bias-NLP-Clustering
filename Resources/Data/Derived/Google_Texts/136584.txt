How Good Nurses Make A Doctor's Job Easier

Good nurses make a doctor’s job easier – and help doctors to do their jobs better. Whether they work in the office, hospital or another care setting, physicians rely on excellent nursing to ensure that patients receive the best care.By advocating, providing education and keeping an eye out for red flags, excellent nurses can play a critical role in keeping patients safe and healthy. Here are 6 ways that nurses help doctors to do their jobs better:1.We all know that “little things”—whether it is a smile, a conversation, answering a question, a fluffed pillow, getting a cup of ice water, or being kind to a family member—can make a big difference in a patient’s perception of quality care. That perception has been shown to help with better outcomes, too! Good nurses take care of all of these “little things” and much more. They keep patients happy and comfortable so they can recuperate faster.Nurses are the heartbeat of any doctor’s office, hospita,l or long-term care facility. They know what is going on with their patients, personally and health-wise. Patients often tell nurses things that they might not share with a doctor, which can help nurses to identify potential patient problems or issues and bring them to the attention of the doctor.Good nurses help doctors prioritize which patients should be seen first—a huge time-saver. They give doctors a heads up when a patient has specific questions so the doctor can be prepared with an answer. And, they inform doctors of other issues that patients might not be willing to discuss, such as family or personal problems and embarrassing symptoms or side effects (see No. 2). If you are nice to them, they will go out of their way to help you and make you look good.
