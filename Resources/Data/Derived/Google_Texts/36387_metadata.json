Ships got its SUP in December 2011, shortly after the city council passed the Lower Greenville Planned Development District Ordinance requiring city-stamped OKs for all liquor-sellers with late-night hours. Ships\u2019 SUP was good for four years, and time\u2019s up.\n\nThe City Plan Commission was scheduled to talk Ships last week, but pushed it to next month, when it will likely sail through. But \u2026 then what? When will it reopen?\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d says Audra Buckley, the veteran zoning consultant working with owner RGC Properties LLC and its president Stephen Schwartz.\n\nAnd when it does reopen, who will run it? Same answer: Says Buckley, there\u2019s \u201cno new proprietor in place.\u201d And Schwartz hasn\u2019t returned phone calls.\n\nThe only thing certain is that longtime owner Charlie Hunt is out.\n\nThe man better known as Charlie Red, who\u2019s owned Ships since 1980, said Friday that Schwartz \u201crun up on the rent so high\u201d he had no choice but to close this summer. When he last-called it a day in July, running out of beer before chasing off the pool-playing stragglers, Hunt said he thought it would be closed for about a month. On Friday he said he really believed then he wouldn\u2019t be gone long. He even left all his stuff inside.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s still in there, locked up,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI told [Schwartz] if he made me a deal, I\u2019d let him have some of it.\u201d\n\nHunt said he\u2019s been talking to other bar and restaurant owners about taking over and keeping the place just the same. Buckley says that whenever it does reopen, \u201cIt\u2019s going to look the same, as far as I know.\u201d Hunt says the owner of a very nearby indoor-but-mostly-outdoor-eat-n-drinkery is eyeing the place. That\u2019s been the word for months. And so far, that\u2019s all it is. But messages have been left; emails, sent.\n\nAll we do know: Ships remains closed. Charlie Red\u2019s out. And he\u2019s \u201cabsolutely\u201d busted up over how it came to this.\n\n\u201cThey had a lot of rough stuff going on around there when I took over, but within a year they got word: Don\u2019t go around there trying to start trouble,\u201d Hunt says. \u201cThat\u2019s the deal \u2014 them bullies. That\u2019s what happened on Lower Greenville for a while, they were lettin\u2019 them dopers come in and mess up those joints. I told \u2019em, \u2018You better go on down the road. Ain\u2019t gonna happen.\u2019 I can handle myself better than they thought I could. I put a couple of \u2019em in the hospital there, and they didn\u2019t come back. Place ran smooth as a whistle.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to walk away after 35 years. I sure hate it badly that it happened like that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL3NoaXBzLWxvdW5nZS1vbmUtb2YtZGFsbGFzLWZpbmVzdC1kaXZlLWJhcnMtcmVtYWlucy1kcnktZG9ja2VkLWZvci1mb3Jlc2VlYWJsZS1mdXR1cmUuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Four months after its sudden closure, Ships Lounge -- the 62-year-old dive bar on Lowest Greenville Avenue -- remains closed, despite earlier promises its shuttering would be temporary and short-lived.\u2026", "title": "Ships Lounge, one of Dallas\u2019 finest dive bars, remains dry-docked for foreseeable future", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/11/ships-lounge-one-of-dallas-finest-dive-bars-remains-dry-docked-for-foreseeable-future.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2015/11/Ships1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-11-14T09:23:30Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s what happened on Lower Greenville for a while, they were lettin\u2019 them dopers come in and mess up those joints.\nFour months after its sudden closure, Ships Lounge \u2014 the 62-year-old dive bar on Lowest Greenville Avenue \u2014 remains closed, despite earlier promises its shuttering would be temporary and short-lived.\nShips got its SUP in December 2011, shortly after the city council passed the Lower Greenville Planned Development District Ordinance requiring city-stamped OKs for all liquor-sellers with late-night hours.\nThe City Plan Commission was scheduled to talk Ships last week, but pushed it to next month, when it will likely sail through.\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d says Audra Buckley, the veteran zoning consultant working with owner RGC Properties LLC and its president Stephen Schwartz."}
