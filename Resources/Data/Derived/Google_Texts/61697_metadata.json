almost $8 million a week\n\nUpdated\n\nThe closure of a loophole allowing childcare providers to receive subsidies for minding their own children is saving taxpayers almost $8 million a week, new data shows.\n\nKey points: Government saving $7.7m a week in subsidy claims\n\nOnly those rorting the system are being targeted, Education Minister says\n\nChild care crackdown also includes increasing compliance checks, recovering incorrect payments\n\nThe so-called \"child swapping\" loophole was closed by the Federal Government in October, and statistics from the Education Department showed this move was saving the Government $7.7 million a week, with weekly subsidy claims plummeting to just over $500,000.\n\nMinister for Education and Training Simon Birmingham said too many people were making invalid claims.\n\n\"It was never intended, nor envisaged, that family day care operators would be being paid in effect to look after their own children and what we should be looking to do is ensure that child care is as accessible and affordable as possible for those families who are most reliant on it to juggle work and family,\" Senator Birmingham said.\n\nFigures provided by the Federal Government showed a 92 per cent drop in the number of parents who engaged in the practice since the new rules came into effect.\n\nIn the week ending on October 11, 11,100 parents had claimed the subsidy when they were \"child swapping\".\n\nAt the end of November, after the legislation had passed through Parliament, that number had dropped to 925.\n\nThe biggest drop has been in Victoria, where the amount claimed has dropped from almost $4 million per week to $220,000 per week.\n\nState Total paid Oct 11 Total paid Nov 29 Change Pc drop since legislation ACT $132,324.33 $1,711.78 -

child swapping, are drafted very carefully to ensure that we take into consideration any other impacts where there might be legitimate cause for certain practices and where people are in remote circumstances or where children may have special needs that warrant the care of a different family day care provider,\" he said.\n\n\"That's permitted under the changes that we've brought in.\"\n\nThe loophole's closure coincides with a widespread crackdown, including an increase of compliance checks and the recovery of incorrect childcare payments, tipped to save another $283 million.\n\nSenator Birmingham has promised the overhaul will help keep costs down, amid predictions fees will rise by 14 per cent by July 2017.\n\nThe Department of Social Services expects the costs of long day care to increase 6.5 per cent this financial year, and 7.3 per cent by July 2017.\n\nThat would mean fees for a handful of day care centres in Sydney could hit $200 a day, and $150 a day in parts of inner Melbourne.\n\nBut Senator Birmingham said most other centres would be much cheaper.\n\n\"And if they are being charged in some instances, they are clearly outliers and that's why I would encourage parents to scrutinise very carefully what they're being charged and to quiz those sorts of service providers,\" he said.\n\n\"Overall though, we are going, in our reforms, to apply an hourly fee limit of $11.50.\"\n\nTopics: community-and-society, family-and-children, child-care, government-and-politics, federal-government, australia\n\nFirst posted", "article_metadata": {"DC.identifier":
