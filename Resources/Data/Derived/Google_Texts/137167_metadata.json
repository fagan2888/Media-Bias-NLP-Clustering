They didn\u2019t sit on the sidelines until the thing sorted itself out.\u201d\n\nThe patients, however, turned out to be much costlier than expected. Moda took another financial hit this fall, when the federal government drastically cut into the millions of dollars it was expected to send Moda to help with Affordable Care Act expenses.\n\nLast week, Moda announced it was pulling out of the Washington and California health care markets.\n\nModa officials declined to talk in detail with the Oregonian about the loan and said the company is not in financial jeopardy and will repay the debt.\n\nMeanwhile, the Affordable Care Act has proved a financial boon for OHSU. Furnstahl said the university brought in $70 million more than expected in 2014 and 2015 largely because more of its patients were covered by insurance, which reduced the amount of charity care.\n\nOHSU, which is funded in part with tax money, has never loaned its investment funds before. It previously made seven investments in outside companies, none near the size of the Moda deal.\n\nThe largest was a $7.8 million equity stake in Life Flight, the air ambulance company.\n\nThe OHSU board of directors unanimously approved the loan to Moda, which is unsecured and has few strings attached, at a December meeting closed to the public. OHSU officials said minutes weren\u2019t taken.\n\nOHSU transferred the $50 million to Moda on Dec. 15.\n\nModa is to make quarterly payments of $500,000 over 10 years, and has remained current on the debt. The next payment is due Dec. 15.\n\nFurnstahl said that in recognition of the risky nature of the transaction, OHSU, for accounting purposes, considers the Moda loan now to be worth $33.5 million \u2014 a loss of about $16.5 million. He said, however, OHSU still expects full repayment.\n\nThe motivation for the loan was less about investment returns and more about health care transformation, university officials said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "PORTLAND -- Oregon Health & Science University pumped $50 million into struggling insurer Moda Health Plan Inc. in what turned out to be a risky move.", "application-name": "", "og": {"site_name": "The Columbian", "description": "PORTLAND -- Oregon Health & Science University pumped $50 million into struggling insurer Moda Health Plan Inc. in what turned out to be a risky move.", "title": "Report: OHSU secretly loaned Moda Health Plan $50 million", "url": "http://www.columbian.com/news/2015/nov/06/report-ohsu-secretly-loaned-moda-health-plan-50-million/", "image": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/columbian_c_200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "columbian.com", "site": "@thecolumbian", "card": "summary", "title": "Report: OHSU secretly loaned Moda Health Plan $50 million"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3A5B7C", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 1256005586, "app_id": 122928857737763}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/windows-tiles/square-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thecolumbian", "section": "Business,Health,health-wire", "published_time": "2015-11-06 17:47:46"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A APORTLAND \u2014 Oregon Health & Science University pumped $50 million into struggling insurer Moda Health Plan Inc. in what turned out to be a risky move.\nOHSU officials say they made the loan in part because Moda accepted people gaining access to insurance under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\nThe motivation for the loan was less about investment returns and more about health care transformation, university officials said.\nLast week, Moda announced it was pulling out of the Washington and California health care markets.\n\u201cModa, like OHSU, stepped forward and played a critical role in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Lawrence Furnstahl, OHSU chief financial officer."}
