Additionally, this industry is also one of the few that enjoys a net trade surplus, significantly boosting U.S. exports around the globe,\u201d the letter stated.\n\nThis 2.3 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers in Obamacare has, as the DC put it, \u201csparked panic within the medical devices industry.\u201d Indiana-based Zimmer Holdings, which manufactures hip replacement implants, laid off 450 workers in 2012 in anticipation of $60 million in taxes. Michigan-based Stryker Corp., which also produces hip implants, laid off 5 percent of its workers in a bid to compensate for the $100 million it will pay in taxes in 2013.\n\nThe letter was signed by Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Al Franken of Minnesota, Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Chuck Schumer of New York, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Patty Murray of Washington, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and then-Senator elect Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and others, all of whom have now voted down Republican efforts to actually do something about the problem.\n\nObamacare\u2019s negative impact on jobs and employment isn\u2019t limited to medical device manufacturers, for other industries see our articles \u201cCEOs Start Layoffs Saying We Told You This Would Happen\u201d of November 2012 and our pre-election article \u201cHow Dumb Does Obama Think Americans Are?\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s an apocalypse afoot it isn\u2019t due to the cancellation of the Air Force-Navy football game \u2013 it will happen if Republicans cave-in and allow the economic disaster portended by all these tax increases to become reality.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ConservativeHQ.com", "title": "Apocalypse NOT"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6f4\"", "article_summary": "Opposition to these job-killing taxes is not just a political ploy by Republicans \u2013 many Democratic Senators (particularly those up for re-election in 2014) have opposed them as well.\nMcCain\u2019s comments came when he also told reporters that the cancelation of the Air Force-Navy game would be the \u201cdefining moment\u201d of the shutdown.\n\u201cThe medical technology industry directly employs over 400,000 people in the United States and is responsible for a total of two million high-skilled manufacturing jobs.\nThe cancellation of a football game as the \u201cdefining moment\u201d in this great constitutional battle?\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the $2,500 per year presidential candidate Barack Obama pledged on June 5, 2008, that a \u201ctypical\u201d American family would save."}
