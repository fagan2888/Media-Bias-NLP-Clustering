From HuffPost's Elise Foley:

Sarah Palin delivered a biting, folksy speech to close out the Conservative Political Action Conference Saturday, going after GOP consultants, the NSA, Obamacare, liberals and the media.

Many of her digs in the 30-minute speech were targeted squarely at President Barack Obama, whom she criticized for his leadership and mocked for his "hope and change" 2008 campaign messages.

"That 'hope and change,' it went from a catchy campaign slogan to a reality, and along the way, 'hope and change,' 'yes we can,' it became 'no, you can't,'" she said. "No, you can't log onto the website. No, you can't keep your health care."
