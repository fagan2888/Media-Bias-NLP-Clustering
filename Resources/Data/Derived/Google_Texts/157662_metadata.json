Student athletes playing at 600 feet or more above sea level have 31 percent fewer concussions than competitors at sea level, according to a study co-written by Dawn Comstock, associate professor of epidemiology at the University ofColorado School of Public Health.\n\nBecause of increasing concerns about football, the study broke out that sport for more analysis and also found a 30 percent drop in concussions at higher altitudes, Comstock said.\n\nThe 600-foot cutoff was used because it was the statistical median height of all the schools used in the study. It\u2019s too early to tell if benefits of altitude increase above 5,000 feet.\n\nThe study did not define a medical reason for the difference, but suggests that it may be tied to the \u201cedema\u201d or mild swelling of brain vessels and tissues at higher altitudes. That allows the brain to fit more tightly in the skull, and to bounce less with a violent collision.\n\nComstock, paired with Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital on the study published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports, said researchers want to expand to professional sports injuries.\n\nComstock said researchers were struck that very few major equipment improvements have been made for decades in the \u201chelmeted\u201d sports like football, lacrosse and hockey. Some basic lab research holds promise in fixing the equipment, she noted.\n\nA study of rats showed that when mild pressure was placed on a jugular vein to increase brain pressure, concussion injuries fell 83 percent.\n\nMichael Booth: 303-954-1686, mbooth@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mboothdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "High-altitude athletes have fewer concussions, CU research shows", "title": "High-altitude athletes have fewer concussions, CU research shows", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/09/high-altitude-athletes-have-fewer-concussions-cu-research-shows/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131209__wes-welkerp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131209__wes-welkerp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-09T12:30:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T12:14:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A study of rats showed that when mild pressure was placed on a jugular vein to increase brain pressure, concussion injuries fell 83 percent.\nHigh school students competing at high altitude have fewer concussions than sea-level athletes, according to a new study co-authored by the Colorado School of Public Health.\nThe 600-foot cutoff was used because it was the statistical median height of all the schools used in the study.\nThat allows the brain to fit more tightly in the skull, and to bounce less with a violent collision.\nComstock, paired with Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital on the study published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports, said researchers want to expand to professional sports injuries."}
