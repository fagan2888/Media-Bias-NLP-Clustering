Now that the two major medical centers CIMA and Clinica Biblica have expanded to Guanacaste, some medical tourists are intrigued by the expat lifestyle. As foreign residents of Costa Rica, expats can actually enjoy free medical treatment and medications through La Caja.\n\nContrary to what some foreigners in Costa Rica think, the nation\u2019s public health care system does not limit its services to those born here. La Caja is a truly universal and all-inclusive health care system; no one is denied services, but patients need to either be active contributors or be in need of lifesaving emergency care in order to get medical attention for free.\n\nContributions to La Caja are actually expected of foreigners in Costa Rica who intend to become residents. There are eleven categories that residents can obtain temporary residence in, from marriage-based immigration to investment-based residency, and they all require registration in La Caja as well as contributions. The monthly contribution amount is based on a percentage of earnings; non-earners pay a nominal amount between $25 and $30 per month; this is all it takes to access a world of free health care and 653 prescription medications.\n\nForeigners who become indigent for any reason in Costa Rica are entitled to free medical care at La Caja as long as their immigration status is legal. Lifesaving medical care is always free, and so is acute care for children regardless of their immigration condition.\n\nForeigners who are not registered with La Caja and wish to receive services may do so at clinics and hospitals that can accept payments (EBAIS primary care centers are not usually set up for this purpose).\n\nFor example, an expat in Guanacaste who suffers a sprained ankle can go to Dr. Enrique Baltodano Briceno in Liberia and get x-rays to rule out fractures, a splint, a prescription along with corresponding medications, and a follow-up visit for about 22,000 colones (less than $45).
