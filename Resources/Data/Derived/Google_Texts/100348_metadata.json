So he called to offer the tickets to a family that really loved the Broncos.\n\nImmediately, the staff thought of Amanda, a 15-year-old Wellington girl who\u2019s been in isolation since her transplant six months ago.\n\nOnce Amanda\u2019s doctor have her the medical good-to-go, Brent\u2019s Place arranged for her to meet the donor.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a huge fan,\u201d family services manager Allen Browning said. \u201cShe came down with her toenails painted blue and orange, wearing her Broncos hat and jersey.\u201d\n\nCommunity engagement manager Rachel Wool said the teen was just thrilled by the gift \u2014 once she opened the envelope and confirmed the two tickets were real.\n\n\u201cNo one is a bigger fan,\u201d Wool said. \u201cShe\u2019s been through so much. For six months, she and her mom have been away from everyone.\u201d\n\nThe donor came away beaming.\n\n\u201cThey think they\u2019re so lucky. But I really feel like I\u2019m the lucky one,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel so grateful that I was able to meet her. She\u2019s got to be an incredibly strong person, and it\u2019s a good chance for her to get outside. I was so happy it almost made me cry.\u201d\n\nColleen O\u2019Connor: 303-954-1083, coconnor@denverpost.com or twitter.com/coconnordp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda3f\"", "article_summary": "A teenage girl recovering from a bone marrow transplant gets to break her long-stay in isolation at the AFC Championship game Sunday, thanks to a man who couldn\u2019t make the game.\nImmediately, the staff thought of Amanda, a 15-year-old Wellington girl who\u2019s been in isolation since her transplant six months ago.\nSo he called to offer the tickets to a family that really loved the Broncos.\nShe\u2019s got to be an incredibly strong person, and it\u2019s a good chance for her to get outside.\nOnce Amanda\u2019s doctor have her the medical good-to-go, Brent\u2019s Place arranged for her to meet the donor."}
