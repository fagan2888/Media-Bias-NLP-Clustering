Harwell's announcement of the 3-Star Healthy Project task force is welcome news for hospitals, job creators and community members who look forward to continuing the conversation about much-needed health coverage solutions for hundreds of thousands of hard-working uninsured Tennesseans. The task force will meet here in Knoxville today, and it is important to highlight some critical issues to consider as these conversations continue.\n\nFirst, any solution should be comprehensive. Our neighbors, friends, veterans and others are struggling without access to affordable health coverage, and solutions should be designed to reach each and every one of them. Aside from the obvious benefit of enabling people without coverage to access necessary health care services, a comprehensive solution would also positively affect Tennessee's economy, local communities and hospitals.\n\nMost people engaged in this debate are already aware of projections by the University of Tennessee's Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research, which estimates that Insure Tennessee \u2014 Gov. Bill Haslam's proposal to bring access to health care to an estimated 280,000 Tennesseans in the Medicaid gap \u2014 would result in more than $1.1 billion in new health care spending, approximately $909 million in new income for Tennessee residents and 15,000 full-time jobs. However, the benefits of a comprehensive solution go further. Research from other states finds improved health outcomes for residents, slower growth in Medicaid spending and even new revenue for state coffers.\n\nSecond, it is essential that recommendations pass muster with the federal government. Tennessee's hospitals are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year in Medicare reimbursements as a result of cuts in the Affordable Care Act. Currently, those dollars are redirected to states like California and New York. Without federal approval of a Tennessee-created coverage solution, those dollars will continue to be sent to other states. In fact, our state's hospitals stand to lose $292 million in 2016 and $8.2 billion by 2024.\n\nIf Insure Tennessee, or a similarly comprehensive solution, were approved, those dollars would be returned to Tennessee and used to benefit our residents and communities.\n\nThe task force has been directed to provide recommendations to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in June. We need to rally around a homegrown plan crafted for Tennesseans, by Tennesseans that is consistent with conservative Tennessee values such as personal responsibility and individual choice. I am hopeful the task force will be able to create such a plan.\n\nThis issue is not about giving a free ride; it is about giving hardworking Tennesseans a fresh start. Those who would be eligible are those who make too much to qualify for TennCare but too little to afford coverage through other avenues. These are servers in restaurants, florists and carpenters, and even veterans who have bravely served our country.\n\nWe need the right conservative solution for our state. We welcome the work of this task force and hope its recommendations will both be comprehensive and bring Tennessee dollars back to our state. Tennessee's uninsured citizens, hospitals and local economies are relying on this task force to make progress in securing the future of our state.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Task force must find health care solutions", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/opinion/columnists/task-force-must-find-health-care-solutions-331f93e0-cb06-7535-e053-0100007fe3db-380000321.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-200.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "The solutions must be comprehensive and pass muster with the federal government.", "title": "Task force must find health care solutions"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-200.png", "description": "The solutions must be comprehensive and pass muster with the federal government.", "card": "summary", "title": "Task force must find health care solutions"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcccb1\"", "article_summary": "The task force has been directed to provide recommendations to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in June.\nThe task force will meet here in Knoxville today, and it is important to highlight some critical issues to consider as these conversations continue.\nWe welcome the work of this task force and hope its recommendations will both be comprehensive and bring Tennessee dollars back to our state.\nI am hopeful the task force will be able to create such a plan.\nOur neighbors, friends, veterans and others are struggling without access to affordable health coverage, and solutions should be designed to reach each and every one of them."}
