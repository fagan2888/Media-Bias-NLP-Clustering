Drew Bledsoe Is Scoring Touchdowns (In The Vineyards)

Our Boston-area listeners might know Drew Bledsoe as a onetime quarterback for the New England Patriots. (Among many other NFL teams, of course). But the famed football great has lately turned his attention to his home state of Washington for a different kind of game: the vineyard battle.

Bledsoe is owner of the Doubleback Winery in Walla, Walla, WA, and he joined us during our August 28 show on the state of the American wine industry. His vineyard is successful — they’ve received favorable notices in many major wine publications — and Bledsoe told host Tom Ashbrook it all has something to do with the climate and soil of the Walla Walla region, which is usually known for their famed sweet onions.

Have you ever tried a bottle of Bledsoe’s Doubleback Winery vintage? Was it good? Where do you turn for excellent American wines these days?
