That\u2019s really important to me,\u201d says Mustard, a Charles City resident.\n\nCarson says by strengthening the private sector and eliminating federal hand outs, issues like Mustard\u2019s concerns would be handled.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons that the government has mushroomed is because of the the way it\u2019s taken on a lot of the responsibilities that used to be the private sector responsibilities,\u201d says Dr. Ben Carson. \u2018It\u2019s relationships that actually solve our problems. It is not bureaucracy that solves our problems.\u201d\n\nWhile Mustard says she is not sure what to expect during her first ever caucus, her and her kids are looking for a change in America.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted, they really want to see our countrythat we would change for the better and really love to see people bringing good moral values back into this country.\u201d says Mustard. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s important to both of them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Neurosurgeon and Republican Presidential Candidate Dr. Ben Carson spoke to a standing room only crowd at Dave's Restaurant in Charles City.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411539697", "og": {"site_name": "KIMT 3", "description": "Neurosurgeon and Republican Presidential Candidate Dr. Ben Carson spoke to a standing room only crowd at Dave\u2019s Restaurant in Charles City.", "title": "Catching Dr. Carson in Charles City", "url": "http://kimt.com/2016/01/16/republican-presidential-candidate-dr-ben-carson-in-ni/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvkimt.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/ben-carson.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Neurosurgeon and Republican Presidential Candidate Dr. Ben Carson spoke to a standing room only crowd at Dave\u2019s Restaurant in Charles City.", "title": "Catching Dr. Carson in Charles City", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkimt.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/ben-carson.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@KIMTNews3", "site": "kimtnews3", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Iowa & Minnesota - Breaking News & Weather for Rochester, Mason City, Austin, Albert Lea, Charles City", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.kimt", "fb": {"pages": 89871599854}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kimt.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/7287d35464b7baee8309485b59e054fe?s=16", "application-name": "KIMT 3", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KIMTNews3", "published_time": "2016-01-16T23:31:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-19T19:56:58+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "2i99Fl0hVU3wt8IF02PBCq2ak6-ypocTZjG02s19_M8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "CHARLES CITY, Iowa- Neurosurgeon and Republican Presidential Candidate Dr. Ben Carson spoke to a standing room only crowd at Dave\u2019s Restaurant in Charles City where about 300 onlookers listened to what Carson stands for.\nThat\u2019s really important to me,\u201d says Mustard, a Charles City resident.\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s important to both of them.\u201d\nCarson says by strengthening the private sector and eliminating federal hand outs, issues like Mustard\u2019s concerns would be handled.\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s really important that people want to protect children and the right to be born and I really believe that he stands for."}
