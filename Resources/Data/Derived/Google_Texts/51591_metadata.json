With the focus also including underserved areas, a broad group of primary care providers has been assembled, including Methodist Primary Care Group, UT Family Medicine, University Clinical Health and Christ Community Health Services.\n\n\"Limited access to primary care, poor primary care infrastructure and poor patient engagement in both primary care and self care serve to compound the disproportionate suffering experienced by individuals in these underserved communities,\" Bailey said in a statement.\n\nThe funding will be spread over about four years.\n\nParticipants in the text messaging part of the study will work with members of their primary care team. For the look at health coaching, participants will schedule visits with diabetes wellness coaches.\n\n\"We anticipate that health coaching will be the best for the most medically and socially complex patients,\" Bailey said in a media release. \"But text messages tailored to patients' interests will work just as well for most patients, and both coaching and texting will improve patient self-care more than distribution of standard educational materials.\"\n\nResearchers plan to enroll 1,000 patients and follow them for a year for the study. The PCORI award has been approved, but is still subject to a review and formal contract, according to UTHSC officials.", "article_metadata": {"title": "$5.2M study in Memphis will test texting, coaching to control diabetes", "og": {"url": "http://www.commercialappeal.com/business/medical/52-millon-study-in-Memphis-will-test-texting-coaching-to-control-diabetes-370300631.html", "image": {"width": 768, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/Dr.+Jim+Bailey.jpg", "height": 1118}, "type": "article", "description": "A medical study of how text messaging and health coaching may help African Americans with uncontrolled diabetes will be launched in Memphis.", "title": "$5.2M study in Memphis will test texting, coaching to control diabetes"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/memphisnews", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/Dr.+Jim+Bailey.jpg", "description": "A medical study of how text messaging and health coaching may help African Americans with uncontrolled diabetes will be launched in Memphis.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "$5.2M study in Memphis will test texting, coaching to control diabetes"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ca-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"Limited access to primary care, poor primary care infrastructure and poor patient engagement in both primary care and self care serve to compound the disproportionate suffering experienced by individuals in these underserved communities,\" Bailey said in a statement.\nFor the look at health coaching, participants will schedule visits with diabetes wellness coaches.\n\"We anticipate that health coaching will be the best for the most medically and socially complex patients,\" Bailey said in a media release.\nParticipants in the text messaging part of the study will work with members of their primary care team.\nWith the focus also including underserved areas, a broad group of primary care providers has been assembled, including Methodist Primary Care Group, UT Family Medicine, University Clinical Health and Christ Community Health Services."}
