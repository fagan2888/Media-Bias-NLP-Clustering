Authorities say a suburban Kansas City music instructor charged with child molestation has removed his ankle bracelet and disappeared.

The Kansas City Star reports that 28-year-old Sean Dow went missing early Saturday morning from a relative's Overland Park home. Overland Park Sgt. Kelly Hasz says Dow was staying there while the Johnson County Sheriff's Office monitored him with the ankle bracelet.

Hasz says Dow left a note for his relatives telling them that he was leaving.

Dow was charged in April with three counts of aggravated indecent liberties with a child under the age of 14. The incidents reportedly occurred at Funky Munky Music in Shawnee. The families of the children have been notified of his disappearance.

Dow's attorney didn't immediately return a phone call from The Associated Press.
