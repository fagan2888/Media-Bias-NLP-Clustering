U.S. Marshals arrived at Tyree’s home early Friday to serve him a federal probation warrant but he allegedly refused to open the door, NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said. That’s when authorities went to an upstairs neighbor to get a key into the apartment.

It made breaking news bulletins and headlines across the country when a reputed gang member allegedly shot a firefighter who came to rescue him:

When they opened the door, they saw smoke inside and called firefighters to the scene, Boyce said. FDNY Lt. James Hayes spoke briefly with Tyree then the suspect went silent. Thinking perhaps the man became unconscious from the smoke filling his apartment, Hayes went inside and was shot twice in his lower body, Boyce said. The 53-year-old father of two was taken to a hospital and listed in stable condition, police said. His injuries are not life-threatening, FDNY Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said.

The ensuing six hour standoff ended in a shootout that left the suspect, Garland Tyree, 38, dead. The late Mr. Tyree had an extensive criminal record.

Soopermexican of The Right Scoop took a look at his website and discovered that Mt. Tyree apparently was a Young Democrats activist (in addition to being a member of the Bloods street grang). Here are some of the images he found:

Now it’s time to apply the Tea Party Test – you know, the one where whenever somebody shoots up a school or a movie theatre, MSM reporters immediately look for that name somewhere on a tea party site. As Brian Ross did at the Aurora, CO theatre shooting and reported that a tea party activist was responsible.

Ask yourself if the MSM would ignore this evidence if it were the tea party, not the Democratic Party, involved.
