Bush, launched by Pres\u00adid\u00adent Bill Clin\u00adton, and ex\u00adpan\u00added by Pres\u00adid\u00adent George W. Bush faces drastic cuts un\u00adder Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama, pos\u00ading a new threat to his leg\u00adacy.\n\nRe\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans in Con\u00adgress are tak\u00ading an ax to the budgets of the Ameri\u00adCorps fam\u00adily of pro\u00adgrams, and Obama seems un\u00adable or un\u00adwill\u00ading to pro\u00adtect them. More broadly, the cul\u00adprit is a cul\u00adture in Wash\u00ading\u00adton that ab\u00adhors com\u00adprom\u00adise\u201d\u201da Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party that won\u2019t raise taxes and a Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Party that won\u2019t tame en\u00adti\u00adtle\u00adment spend\u00ading to jointly lower na\u00adtion\u00adal debt while pro\u00adtect\u00ading vi\u00adtal pub\u00adlic pro\u00adjects.\n\nIn short: The prob\u00adlem is short-sighted, cow\u00adardly lead\u00ader\u00adship.\n\nCaught in the middle is a bi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan suc\u00adcess called the Cor\u00adpor\u00ada\u00adtion for Na\u00adtion\u00adal and Com\u00admunity Ser\u00advice, which over\u00adsees Ameri\u00adCorps and scores of oth\u00ader pro\u00adgrams that pay na\u00adtion\u00adal-ser\u00advice work\u00aders small sti\u00adpends. Those pro\u00adgrams in\u00adclude Teach for Amer\u00adica, Hab\u00adit\u00adat for Hu\u00adman\u00adity, City Year, and Vista. (Dis\u00adclos\u00adure: My eld\u00ader daugh\u00adter was a mem\u00adber of the City Year corps in De\u00adtroit, and I re\u00adceived an award from the ser\u00advice com\u00admunity in 2014 for writ\u00ading about this top\u00adic.)\n\nEach pro\u00adgram com\u00adpetes for fed\u00ader\u00adal money, meas\u00adures and re\u00adports res\u00adults, and raises private-sec\u00adtor con\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtions to match gov\u00adern\u00adment grants. In ad\u00addi\u00adtion to re\u00adceiv\u00ading sti\u00adpends that help pay tu\u00adition and make ends meet, the mostly young work\u00adforce learns the value of serving oth\u00aders for a great\u00ader good.\n\nIt\u2019s a bar\u00adgain for tax\u00adpay\u00aders: For every fed\u00ader\u00adal dol\u00adlar in\u00adves\u00adted, na\u00adtion\u00adal-ser\u00advice mem\u00adbers de\u00adliv\u00ader as much as $3 in ser\u00advices. In the bru\u00adtal new eco\u00adnomy, non\u00adprofit or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtions are strug\u00adgling to meet people\u2019s needs, and the Cor\u00adpor\u00ada\u00adtion for Na\u00adtion\u00adal and Com\u00admunity Ser\u00advice fills the gaps, win\u00adning praise from Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan law\u00admakers, in\u00adclud\u00ading those now poised to gut the pro\u00adgram. GOP na\u00adtion\u00adal se\u00adcur\u00adity ex\u00adperts and re\u00adtired mil\u00adit\u00adary lead\u00aders con\u00adsider the fed\u00ader\u00adal spend\u00ading a small in\u00advest\u00adment in fur\u00adther\u00ading a na\u00adtion\u00adal eth\u00ados of ser\u00advice.\n\nAmong the pro\u00adgram\u2019s suc\u00adcesses: im\u00adprov\u00ading aca\u00addem\u00adic per\u00adform\u00adances in the na\u00adtion\u2019s poorest schools and help\u00ading vet\u00ader\u00adans with the trans\u00adition from war to peace\u00adtime.\n\nAnd yet, a GOP-led House Ap\u00adpro\u00adpri\u00adations sub\u00adcom\u00admit\u00adtee is pro\u00adpos\u00ading to slash the ser\u00advice cor\u00adpor\u00ada\u00adtion\u2019s budget by one-third, from $1.05 bil\u00adlion to $687.8 mil\u00adlion. That is 42 per\u00adcent less than Obama re\u00adques\u00adted, and would force the elim\u00adin\u00ada\u00adtion of more than 40,000 of Ameri\u00adCorps\u2019 75,000 po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtions.\n\nThat\u2019s dra\u00adconi\u00adan. Dur\u00ading his first pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial race, Obama pledged to \u201cex\u00adpand and fund Ameri\u00adCorps\u201d from 75,000 to 250,000 po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtions, put\u00adting ser\u00advice-minded mil\u00adlen\u00adni\u00adals to work on the na\u00adtion\u2019s toughest prob\u00adlems. Un\u00adder Bush, the pro\u00adgram had grown from 50,000 slots.\n\nAfter just three months in of\u00adfice, Obama signed the Ed\u00adward M. Kennedy Serve Amer\u00adica Act au\u00adthor\u00adiz\u00ading the ex\u00adpan\u00adsion of the pro\u00adgram to the goal of 250,000. He had kept his prom\u00adise, Obama bragged, and he de\u00adclared 2009 the dawn of a \u201cnew era of ser\u00advice.\u201d\n\nBut the dawn nev\u00ader broke. Con\u00adgress nev\u00ader fun\u00added the quarter-mil\u00adlion hires, not even when Demo\u00adcrats con\u00adtrolled both cham\u00adbers from 2009 to 2010. En\u00adroll\u00adment nev\u00ader crept above 80,000.\n\nOf all his broken prom\u00adises, this might hit closest to home for Obama, a former com\u00admunity or\u00adgan\u00adizer with a spe\u00adcial af\u00adfin\u00adity for Ameri\u00adCorps. As I\u2019ve writ\u00adten be\u00adfore, it also re\u00adflects a fa\u00admil\u00adi\u00adar pat\u00adtern of his pres\u00adid\u00adency: Raise hopes for big change, watch dogged rivals crush those hopes, and hear Demo\u00adcrats gripe about his strategy or re\u00adsolve.\n\nWhen I asked An\u00adnMaura Con\u00adnolly on Thursday morn\u00ading what the White House was do\u00ading to counter the GOP cuts, the pres\u00adid\u00adent of Voices for Na\u00adtion\u00adal Ser\u00advice said with more than a hint of frus\u00adtra\u00adtion: \u201cThat would be a good ques\u00adtion to ask them. I have been email\u00ading the White House with aban\u00addon today with no luck so far.\u201d\n\nI also emailed a White House spokes\u00adman. No reply yet.\n\nEasi\u00ader to reach was the sub\u00adcom\u00admit\u00adtee chair\u00adman, Rep. Tom Cole, an Ok\u00adlahoma Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan. (Dis\u00adclos\u00adure: my young\u00adest daugh\u00adter in\u00adterned for Cole last sum\u00admer.) He called the pro\u00adposed cuts a mat\u00adter of \u201cpri\u00ador\u00adit\u00adies, not an\u00adti\u00adpathy.\u201d\n\nIn the same bill, the GOP-con\u00adtrolled pan\u00adel is pro\u00adpos\u00ading budget in\u00adcreases for the Na\u00adtion\u00adal In\u00adsti\u00adtutes of Health, the Cen\u00adters for Dis\u00adease Con\u00adtrol, and edu\u00adca\u00adtion ser\u00advices for spe\u00adcial-needs chil\u00addren. In many cases, Cole said, those pro\u00adgrams\u201d\u201dlong fa\u00advor\u00adites of the Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Party\u201d\u201dwould get more money than Obama put in his own budget.\n\nCole\u2019s coun\u00adter\u00adparts in the Sen\u00adate are also ex\u00adpec\u00adted to slash Ameri\u00adCorps budgets, though not quite as much. Ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00adations with the White House will likely lead to changes in the bills, Cole said, but he held out little hope for Ameri\u00adCorps sup\u00adport\u00aders. \u201cIf I had more money,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d put it in\u00adto early child\u00adhood edu\u00adca\u00adtion,\u201d an\u00adoth\u00ader pro\u00adgress\u00adive cause.\n\nSome con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives have been crit\u00adic\u00adal of Ameri\u00adCorps, as\u00adso\u00adci\u00adat\u00ading it with Clin\u00adton and ques\u00adtion\u00ading the mer\u00adits of even a mod\u00adest sti\u00adpend. Cole said those per\u00adcep\u00adtions are \u201ca factor, not a big factor\u201d in the pro\u00adposed cuts.\n\nHe said law\u00admakers are ham\u00adstrung by a tight budget, and blamed Obama for passing up a chance to strike a \u201cgrand bar\u00adgain\u201d on the budget after his reelec\u00adtion, when Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans were bow\u00ading to de\u00admands to raise taxes on the wealthy. That may be, but the White House has good reas\u00adon to point the fin\u00adger back at Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans, who seem un\u00adwill\u00ading to com\u00adprom\u00adise on taxes bey\u00adond let\u00adting Bush-era tax cuts ex\u00adpire.\n\nTruth is, they\u2019re both at fault. Due to a vari\u00adety of polit\u00adic\u00adal and so\u00adcial trends, there is little in\u00adcent\u00adive for the two ma\u00adjor parties to co\u00adoper\u00adate, little room to lead. Un\u00adtil the GOP raises rev\u00aden\u00adue and Demo\u00adcrats trim spend\u00ading, parts of the budget not \u201cen\u00adtitled\u201d to pro\u00adgrams like Medi\u00adcare and So\u00adcial Se\u00adcur\u00adity will con\u00adtin\u00adue shrink\u00ading\u201d\u201dsqueez\u00ading out suc\u00adcess\u00adful \u201cdis\u00adcre\u00adtion\u00adary\u201d pro\u00adgrams dear to both lib\u00ader\u00adals and con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives.\n\nPro\u00adgrams like the Bush-Clin\u00adton-Bush na\u00adtion\u00adal-ser\u00advice mis\u00adsion, all rooted in the first Bush\u2019s \u201cPoints of Light\u201d ini\u00adti\u00adat\u00adive.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to tell that to John Bridge\u00adland, a found\u00ading mem\u00adber of the ser\u00advice co\u00adali\u00adtion who ran the young\u00ader Bush\u2019s do\u00admest\u00adic policy team and na\u00adtion\u00adal-ser\u00advice ini\u00adti\u00adat\u00adive.\n\n\u201cCon\u00adgress hasn\u2019t lived up to its part of the bar\u00adgain in re\u00adcog\u00adniz\u00ading the power of na\u00adtion\u00adal ser\u00advice to heal our broken cit\u00adizen\u00adship,\u201d said Bridge\u00adland, a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan.\n\nHe ticked off the hor\u00adrors: \u201cSo\u00adcial trust in one an\u00adoth\u00ader is half of what it was a gen\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion ago, in\u00adclud\u00ading among mil\u00adlen\u00adni\u00adals.
