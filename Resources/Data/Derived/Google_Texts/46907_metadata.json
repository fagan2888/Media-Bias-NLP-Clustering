Gary Peters left Lansing for a 15-day tour of the Persian Gulf.\n\nPeters, a Ensign in the Navy, flew to Bahrain, two years into a nearly 15-year stint as a Navy reservist.\n\n\u201cI think about the training that I had as a Seabee \u2014 it\u2019s very helpful for me in public service and the U.S. Senate,\u201d Peters, currently a Democratic U.S. Representative, told a crowd earlier this month at American Legion Post 426 in Trenton.\n\nThis was the second stop on a two-day tour of Michigan in which Peters allowed a reporter to tag along as he talked to voters, and in this case, veterans.\n\n\"One of our missions was to build bridges,\" said Peters, who is from Bloomfield Hills. \"I like to say: We learned how to build bridges while getting shot at. It\u2019s kind of a metaphor for Washington: people are constantly taking shots but we've got to be able to build bridges, we got to bring people together...it's about being a practical problem solver.\"\n\nAnd now, Peters wants to bring his six years of experience in the U.S. House to one of the highest elected offices: the U.S. Senate.\n\nPeters has traveled across Michigan several times and made a tour focusing on veterans issues earlier this month. At stops in Metro Detroit, Jackson, Battle Creek, Flint and Grand Rapids, Peters spoke about several pieces of legislation he introduced, including bills to invest in suicide prevention and business funding mechanisms for veterans. He called the recent at the \"unacceptable\" situation at the VA.\n\nMonths before the general election, Peters is gearing up for one of the most watched races in the state. Neither Peters nor his Republican opponent, former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land, have primary challengers, but both have been campaigning hard for the general election in November.\n\nThe candidates have raised and spent millions of dollars and outside interest groups have spent millions more. Several televisions ads are running at any time across the state.\n\nRelated: Mark Schauer taps Obama database, 'special sauce' in bid to beat Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder\n\nTime in the Navy Reserves\n\nTraveling on the bus between visits, Peters chatted with veterans who joined him. They shared experiences about boot camp and training, as well as had some fun with the rivalries between branches.\n\nPeters first joined the U.S. Navy Reserve as a drilling reservist in 1993, just weeks before he turned 35, the age limit for enlisting.\n\n\u201cI felt like it was something I really needed to do,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIt\u2019s either now or never.\u201d\n\nPart of that desire to join the military comes from his family history: Peters\u2019 father was a World War II veteran; his great-grandfather a Civil War soldier and an earlier forefather was in the Virgina militia in the Revolutionary war.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something my father instilled in me,\u201d Peters said. \u201cMilitary service is an important responsibility of citizenship.\u201d\n\nPeters had left the reserves to spend more time with his wife and three children. But after the Sept. 11 attacks, Peters re-joined.\n\n\u201cI went to my wife and said \u2018I have to get back in the reserves,\u2019\u201d Peters said. \u201cHere I am, I\u2019m a fully trained officer in the U.S. Navy.\u201d\n\nPeters was a Seabee Combat specialist, which is an engineer responsible for various construction projects, including bridges, roads and airstrips for combat troops. He rose to the rank of Lt. Commander and was an expert marksman with a 9 mm pistol and M16 rifle. He was honorably discharged in 2008.\n\nPeters said decisions Congress makes related to the military and foreign policy are some of its most important work.\n\n\u201cThe most difficult decision a member of Congress can possibly make is to send men or women into harms way,\u201d Peters said. \u201cI take that to heart and remember the fine men and women I served with\u2026I will always have that as a frame of reference.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Confused about the August primary? Check out MLive's voter guide.\n\nOn the tour that day was Andy Linko, who served under Peters in the reserves and is now running to be a state representative in the 23rd district.\n\n\"You never accept failure, you never blame anybody else,\u201d Linko said of his time with Peters in the reserves. \u201cIf you didn't get your mission accomplished, you had to answer to somebody. If you didn't have the right answers, you were back out there doing it.\u201d\n\nLinko reconnected with his former commander in 2002 when Peters ran for Attorney General. Republican Mike Cox won by just one-tenth of a percentage point.\n\nLinko says Peters' time in the service helps him in Congress.\n\n\u201cWe gave 110 percent\u2026I think the same thing goes for public service,\u201d Linko said.\n\nState of the race\n\nNational Republicans see the Peters/Land race as an opportunity to take control of the Senate. State Republicans see it as realistic chance to elect one of their own to the highest chamber for the first time since 2000, when Debbie Stabenow beat incumbent Spence Abraham. Democrats want to maintain the seat and elect a replacement to Levin.\n\nPeters has led in recent polls. The Cook Political Report says the race is a toss up, Real Clear Politics and Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call labels it leaning Democratic. This week, Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball moved it to Likely Democratic. Overall, Peters is leading by an average of 5.8 points, according to Real Clear Politics.\n\nIn fundraising, Land has raised a total of $8.55 million, more than Peters' $6.78 million. But Land has donated $2.9 million of her own money to the campaign. Peters has put none of his own money in the race.\n\nOutside groups and political action committees have also spent large amount of money in the election. According to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, independent organizations have spent $6.3 million on ads against Peters and $3.27 million attacking Land.\n\nAll of this makes for a hot election.\n\n\u201cThis U.S. Senate race is the most interesting race in the state,\u201d said TJ Bucholz, a longtime Lansing political consultant and founder of Vanguard Public Affairs.\n\n\u201cYou have two diametrically opposite candidates,\u201d Bucholz said. \u201cYou have Gary Peters, who is a traditional progressive, and Terri Lynn Land, who certainly Republicans are rallying behind but probably resonates more with the Tea Party wing of her party than the long-held establishment.\u201d\n\nThe candidates are taking two different approaches to campaign infrastructure, Bucholz said: Peters is doing more on an \u201cold school\u201d campaign, traveling from county to county, visiting various organizations and participating in forums.\n\nLand, on the other hand, is spending money on more digital media options and support for outside groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a ground game versus an air game,\u201d Bucholz said.\n\nThe Land campaign has attacked Peters on several fronts, including his 2010 vote for the Affordable Care Act as well as his time working in the financial industry.\n\n\u201cI think that everybody who is going to vote on Obamacare has already made up their minds and are already voting that way,\u201d said Bernie Porn, a pollster at EPIC-MRA.\n\nRecent polling numbers give an indication about what can happen in the race. If Peters continues to lead in the polls and, if after Labor Day takes a double digit lead, Porn said there could be drop off of outside money from Republicans.\n\nA bipartisan issue\n\nDuring each speech on the statewide veterans tour, Peters mentioned the importance of veterans issues and how it\u2019s something both parties can get behind.\n\nIt could be considered a step to build those bridges.\n\nAnd that was viable during the last stop of the day: American Legion Post 298 in Battle Creek. Brian Ellis, a Republican running against incumbent U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, was at the event. Also there was the Republican chair of the Calhoun County Republican Party and a GOP state representative candidate.\n\nIt\u2019s not common to have members from one party show up for an event held by the other party.\n\nEllis said heard it was a veterans event and didn\u2019t know it was a Peters event. The other two said they were aware it was a Democratic event.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was a Peters thing,\u201d said Art Kale, who is running in the Republican primary for state representative. \u201cWe have as much interest in the veterans as anyone else.\u201d\n\nCalhoun County Republican Party Chairman David Mead added: \u201cWhen a guy puts on a uniform, it doesn\u2019t have a 'D' or an 'R' on it.\u201d\n\nCorrection July 26: a previous version of this story had the incorrect Navy rank that Peters had.\n\nEditor's note: MLive spent a full day with the Peters campaign and has requested a similar experience with the Land campaign. We'll have detailed profiles of each candidate later this year in the run-up to the fall election.\n\nFritz Klug is a news buzz reporter for MLive. Contact him at fklug@mlive.com or 269-370-0584.
