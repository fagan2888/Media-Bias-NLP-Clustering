According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it\u2019s the leading cause of disability, a major contributor to global disease, and it leads to suicide \u2014 and some people may be prone to it more than others.\n\nActor-comedian Robin Williams' recent suicide gave this idea some traction, that the disorder has a personality. Williams was a recovering addict diagnosed with depression, and he had recently sought out treatment after a relapse. Many a headline read that his career in comedy influenced this outcome, which isn't totally off-base. It's not totally right either.\n\n\u201cThe directionality [in a statement like this is] a little wrong,\u201d Dr. Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at California State University in Los Angeles, told Medical Daily in an e-mail. \u201cI sometimes opine that the tool of the comedian \u2014 to turn the dark or difficult or complex into something \u2018palatable\u2019 or funny \u2014 can lead to an association between depression and comedy, but being a comedian does not make someone depressed.\u201d\n\nDr. Moe Gelbart, executive director of the Thelma McMillen Center for Outpatient Chemical Dependency at Torrance Memorial Medical Center in Torrance, Calif., told Medical Daily depression and suicide are rooted in meaning. If a depressed patient commits suicide over their financial problems, it isn\u2019t actually because of their financial problems. It\u2019s because of the meaning they gave those problems, Gelbart said.\n\nBefore you can understand the types of people who may be prone to depression, it\u2019s important to understand what causes the disorder in the first place. WHO, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reported that the disorder is a complicated combination of different social, psychological and biological factors. Though, Gelbart breaks it down into two, basic categories: a chemical imbalance in the brain, which is what antidepressants are prescribed to correct, and a reaction to a stressful or traumatic event. The latter is where the idea depression has a personality comes from.\n\n\u201cWe know that individuals who are depressed tend to be higher in a personality trait labeled \u2018neuroticism.\u2019 which reflects a tendency to negative mood and worry,\u201d Durvasula said. \u201cThere may be a chicken-egg issue, that if we measure the personality of a person who is depressed then they are more likely to endorse more \u2018depressive\u2019 traits. But keep in mind while personality would never cause depression, it could be a risk factor, and perhaps result in more depressive reactions to stressful stimuli.\u201d\n\n12 Types Of People Prone To Depression\n\nA study published in the American Journal of Public Health found transgender people fit the minority stress model, which Medical Daily previously reported includes the health disparities among sexual minorities are a result of stressors induced by a hostile and homophobic culture. Transgendered participants expressed signs of clinical depression, anxiety, and somatization. \u201cA significant proportion of transgendered individuals have had histories of trauma, and often since an early age had to struggle with the isolation of gender identity issues, fear, and often prejudice, discrimination, and sometimes violence,\u201d said Durvasula. \u201cAll of these factors create a lifetime burden that can make them more vulnerable to depression.\u201d\n\nAfter transgendered people, teenagers who have had family in the military have been found to experience more depression, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts than their peers without family in the military. Veterans themselves are also predisposed to depression, namely those who have been deployed and find themselves having to integrate back into their previous life.\n\nThen, similar to Williams, creative types have been associated with an increased likelihood of developing depression. CNN reported Charles Dickens, Tennessee Williams, Eugene O\u2019Neil, Ernest Hemingway, Leo Tolstoy and Virginia Wolf appeared to all suffer from clinical depression. Sylvia Plath made several attempts at suicide, with her novel The Bell Jar believed to be heavily influenced by her personal struggle.\n\n\u201cIt is quite possible that some [creative types] may spring from making sense of the world in a unique way from an early age. However, it is not always easy to be a creative person,\u201d Durvasula said. \u201cIt is often not considered a \u2018safe\u2019 route and, as such, these individuals may not get familial or societal support for their career or educational choices. It can feel isolating since it is not a normative choice, and that lack of support or the feeling that one has to buck the tide to get to a goal. It may also place creatives at greater risk for depressive symptoms.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, a 2002 study published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research found 74% of introverts made up the depression population. And a perfectionist personality has too been linked to depression and anxiety.\n\nGenerally speaking, according to the CDC, women, African Americans, Hispanics, people with no more than a high school education, have been divorced, and are over the age of 45 are more likely to meet the criteria for major depression.\n\nSay No To Stigma\n\nDespite the evidence of some people and personality types being associated with depression, that doesn\u2019t mean those who don\u2019t fit in those categories won\u2019t develop depression. And if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s OK. \u201cDepression is an illness and it is nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d Durvasula said. \u201cYou cannot \u2018will yourself\u2019 out of it. A person cannot be \u2018blamed\u2019 for being depressed any more than you can blame them for having other diseases.\u201d\n\nPut another way: If a depressed person and non-depressed person were to run a marathon race, the depressed person is fully capable \u2014 they\u2019re just running with a 100-pound weight on their back, Gelbart said.\n\nThe stigma surrounding depression, and mental illness in general, has gotten better, but it\u2019s not completely gone. A larger reason for this, to Durvasula, is its historical connection to \u201cmadness.\u201d She still finds there is a tremendous lack of empathy for those who have received a diagnosis, in which people tell those depressed to \u201cjust get over it.\u201d It\u2019s an illness like breast cancer, and no person would even think to give a cancer patient that same advice.\n\nHowever, the real problem with the mental health stigma is that it prevents patients from seeking the treatment they need. As it stands, 60% of people who need mental health service don\u2019t get it. People suffering from depression, as believed by both Durvasula and Gelbart, can recover. At the very least, Gelbart adds, symptoms can lessen and occur with less severity if managed properly. A recent study Medical Daily reported on found that the best management is a combination of antidepressants and cognitive behavior therapy.\n\nMany times people ask Durvasula how they might help someone who is depressed. Her answer? Get them help. Depression, again, is manageable and does not have to be suffered in silence. It\u2019s not something that disappears after a great workout or good night\u2019s sleep or even great nutrition. It requires treatment. Patients with high blood pressure take pills to lower the numbers back in their favor \u2014 and depressive patients should be the same, Gelbart added.\n\nAs for the loss of Robin Williams, Durvasula and Gelbart take note of the conversation it\u2019s started. More people are discussing depression, suicide, and how each can be prevented. Though that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s a perfect conversation. \u201cOne of the more dangerous things I hear is, 'He had everything. Kids who loved him, a wife who loved him and lots of money',\" Durvasula said. \"Instead of giving the person 'something to live for,' it can actually leave them feeling more guilty, more worthless because despite all of that they still feel hopeless. Too often we try to 'cheer people up' who are depressed, but that\u2019s like trying to stop someone from bleeding using a joke. It just doesn't work.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "am, i, depressed, types, people, more, prone, depression", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Depending on your personality, you may be at an increased risk for developing depression.", "title": "12 Types Of People More Prone To Depression", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/am-i-depressed-types-people-more-prone-depression-299286", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/22/sad-woman-rainy-window.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Depending on your personality, you may be at an increased risk for developing depression.", "title": "12 Types Of People More Prone To Depression", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/am-i-depressed-types-people-more-prone-depression-299286", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/22/sad-woman-rainy-window.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/22/sad-woman-rainy-window.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-08-22T09:52:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-22T10:48:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Depending on your personality, you may be at an increased risk for developing depression."}, "article_summary": "Say No To StigmaDespite the evidence of some people and personality types being associated with depression, that doesn\u2019t mean those who don\u2019t fit in those categories won\u2019t develop depression.\nBefore you can understand the types of people who may be prone to depression, it\u2019s important to understand what causes the disorder in the first place.\nMore people are discussing depression, suicide, and how each can be prevented.\nThen, similar to Williams, creative types have been associated with an increased likelihood of developing depression.\nA person cannot be \u2018blamed\u2019 for being depressed any more than you can blame them for having other diseases.\u201dPut another way: If a depressed person and non-depressed person were to run a marathon race, the depressed person is fully capable \u2014 they\u2019re just running with a 100-pound weight on their back, Gelbart said."}
