What\u2019s the bottom line? Besides the world attention for keynote speakers Hillary Clinton and Sir Richard Branson, you get an economic infusion topping $50 million.\n\nThe four-day BIO International Convention ending June 26 \u201cwas expected to bring more than $56.3 million to San Diego\u2019s regional economy,\u201d a spokeswoman for the event said Monday. Hosted by the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the San Diego Convention Center event drew 15,667 people from all 50 states and some 70 nations, said Paige Nordeen, the local spokeswoman.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s BIO International Convention brought to San Diego leaders in industry, government and academia to help further the promise of biotechnology,\u201d said BIO President and CEO Jim Greenwood.\n\n\u201cFrom our outstanding keynote speakers, to the record number of partnering meetings, the 2014 Convention was a resounding success. This event continues to provide biotech leaders with the opportunity to showcase the best of our industry.\u201d\n\nBesides Virgin Group leader Branson and Former Secretary of State Clinton, more than 800 speakers and 160 sessions addressed the latest business opportunities, breakthroughs in medicine, diagnostics, the environment, energy production and food and agriculture.\n\nSession highlights have been posted at BIO\u2019s news site: www.biotech-now.org/#\n\n\u2013 Times of San Diego\n\nAirport Parking Plaza Given Go-Ahead\n\nThe board of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority has voted to direct staff to start construction of a long-awaited parking plaza adjacent to Terminal 2 at Lindbergh Field.\n\n\u201cOur need for more close-in parking is clear,\u201d said Airport Authority President/CEO Thella F. Bowens. \u201cOur single lowest customer satisfaction rating is for availability of parking. Building this plaza will enhance customer service, especially for the business traveler for whom convenient, close-in parking is a priority.\u201d\n\nAlthough the recent expansion of Terminal 2 added 10 new gates, it did not add any parking capacity. The current plan is to build a three-story parking structure with 3,000 spaces.\n\nThe parking plaza is also expected to have environmental benefits, by reducing total vehicle trips for passengers who park on site vs. being dropped off and picked up. And Smart Parking Technology will allow parkers to reserve spaces and pay before leaving, reducing circulating and idling times.\n\nAnother consideration is phasing during the anticipated replacement of Terminal 1 as part of the Airport Development Plan. While multi-year construction takes place, parking in front of Terminal 1 will be lost. The parking plaza will help offset that loss during construction. Also proposed as part of the ADP is a future on-airport roadway that would take airport traffic off of Harbor Drive.\n\nViaSat Signs Pioneering Agreement With Eutelsat\n\nViaSat Inc. and Paris-based Eutelsat have entered a pioneering agreement that will enable service access and roaming on each other\u2019s high-capacity satellite network. This is the first interconnection agreement between high throughput satellites, and will allow Eutelsat and ViaSat customers to roam between North America, Europe and the Mediterranean Basin.\n\n\u201cThis formalizes another step towards covering the high traffic areas of the world with the fastest, most affordable mobile broadband satellite connectivity,\u201d said Mark Dankberg, ViaSat chairman and CEO. \u201cExtending our long-standing relationship with Eutelsat enables us to provide the fastest in-flight Wi-Fi available on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201d\n\nRealtors Group to Hold Workshops\n\nOn Drought and Home Fire Safety\n\nThe Pacific Southwest Association of Realtors (PSAR will host \u201cPlan, Prepare, Prevent,\u201d a free workshop for Realtors and homeowners on drought and home fire safety from noon to 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday at the PSAR East County Service Center, 1150 Broadway, El Cajon. Attendees will learn fire prevention and safety information to share with their clients.

CommNexus began the incubator program in mid-2009 with its original space located in Sorrento Valley. A few years later, The Irvine Company provided EvoNexus with commercial office space to expand to Downtown San Diego and University City. The Irvine Company has now made space available for a third EvoNexus location at University Research Park, near UC Irvine. The space is about the same size as the EvoNexus space in Downtown San Diego, with room to house 15 to 20 startups. Companies selected for the EvoNexus program get rent-free space for as long as two years, depending on their progress, along with access to EvoNexus programs and mentors.\n\nFamily Health Centers Awarded $900,000 Grant\n\nFamily Health Centers of San Diego was awarded a $900,000 federal grant, part of $83.4 million handed out by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to help train resident physicians. The grants, funded by the Affordable Care Act, were provided to 60 health centers that will provide training for resident physicians during the 2014-15 academic year.\n\nResidents will be trained in family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, geriatrics, and general dentistry, according to HHS.\n\nThe nonprofit Family Health Centers of San Diego operates 18 primary care clinics, six dental clinics and four behavioral health clinics in central and southern San Diego County, serving uninsured and low-income patients.\n\nPeter Beetham Takes Helm at Cibus Global\n\nPeter Beetham, senior vice president of Cibus Global, a San Diego-based gene editing company, has been named head of the company, succeeding Keith Walker, who is retiring.

Since co-founding Cibus, Walker has overseen the research of new, patented trait tools, as well as the growth of Cibus\u2019 business initiatives, including global expansion with satellite offices in locations such as Minnesota and the Netherlands.\n\nGreg Gocal, the current vice president of research at Cibus has been promoted to senior vice president of research and development.\n\nNorth County Cities Seek Identity\n\nEstablishing an identity is a primary goal for the five North County cities along the Highway 78 corridor: Carlsbad, Oceanside, Vista, San Marcos and Escondido. They\u2019ve decided working together to attract businesses and jobs is likely to be more effective than competing with each other.\n\nMarket research carried out for a consortium of five cities suggests there are plenty of different ideas about what exactly makes up San Diego\u2019s North County. Does it include everything north of Highway 52? Is it the nine cities north of the city of San Diego? How about the unincorporated areas east of Interstate 15?\n\nThe cities commissioned a company, North Star Destination Strategies, to design them a common brand. North Star began with a survey. What they found was that only 30 or 40 percent of those questioned see Del Mar, Rancho Santa Fe or Poway as in North County, whereas more than 90 percent think of the five cities along the 78 corridor as North County.\n\n\u2013 KPBS\n\nRead more\u2026\n\nGoodwill Opening New Store in Lake Murray Area\n\nGoodwill Industries of San Diego County will open a new retail store and donation center in the Lake Murray neighborhood of La Mesa on Thursday, creating 28 new jobs. \u201cWe love this community, and when this space became available we jumped on it\u201d said Beth Forsberg, VP of operations.\n\nThe store at 6127 Lake Murray Blvd. will officially open on Thursday with a ribbon-cutting at 10 a.m.\n\nThe new location will be one of Goodwill\u2019s free electronics recycling centers.

Treatment typically takes 60 hours over a period of time and is free to community members.\n\nThe clinic, located at 135 Vallecitos De Oro, will be open fives days a week during the summer and two days a week during the academic year. Previously students worked out of a converted dorm room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to provide a high-quality educational experience for the students and also reaching out to the community,\u201d Nahrstedt said.\n\nThe university has nearly 75 students enrolled in its Master of Arts in Education with Communicative Sciences Disorders Option.\n\n\u2013 Times of San Diego", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "San Diego Metro Magazine", "title": "Daily Business Report \u2014 July 8, 2014 - San Diego Metro Magazine", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.sandiegometro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Speech-Clinic.jpg", "url": "http://www.sandiegometro.com/2014/07/daily-business-report-july-8-2014/", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "San Diego Metro Magazine", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.sandiegometro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BIO-300x223.jpg", "site": "@sandiegometro", "card": "summary", "description": "Biotech Convention Gave San Diego $56M Boost So 2,500 biotech CEOs gathered in San Diego for nearly a week.
