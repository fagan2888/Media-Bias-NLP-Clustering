They eat their young. They don\u2019t think. They don\u2019t allow people to think. They are bullies.\u201d\n\nAfter being questioned about the comments, Fayard did not deny making the statement, but rather said that she was making a case for the \u201cdivisiveness of campaigns\u201d at the time.\n\nFayard is the first female to jump in the US Senate race and the first Democrat to officially announce her run.\n\nDespite claiming that she was not a fan of President Obama, she said back in 2010 that Obamacare was a \u201cnet positive\u201d for the state.
