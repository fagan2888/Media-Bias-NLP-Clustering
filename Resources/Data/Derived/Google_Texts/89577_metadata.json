Furthermore, he has travelled the world, seeing firsthand the health care challenges people face every day. He represented to me the embodiment of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Doctor.\u201d\n\nBut in my humble opinion, the latest nominee for U.S. surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, does not qualify to be our nation\u2019s doctor. My criticism is based largely on Murthy\u2019s level of clinical experience. Murthy is 36 years old and, to his credit, received his medical degree from Yale School of Medicine, one of the most prestigious medical school programs in the country. This is certainly an achievement that I can\u2019t claim.\n\nBut a medical school does not a doctor make. To me, a doctor is a man or a woman that actively dedicates his or her life to the art of healing \u2013 and that cannot be achieved overnight.\n\nThe biggest responsibility of the U.S. surgeon general is to provide the American public with the best scientific information regarding disease prevention. But the surgeon general is also responsible for overseeing thousands of men and women in uniform, including the Medical Reserve Corp (MRC) \u2013 a group of volunteers responsible for promoting and advancing the health of our nation.\n\nIs Murthy qualified to run such an important health care oversight service? In my opinion, he would not even qualify to run a department at an academic medical center at this point in his career.\n\nMost university hospitals are split into multiple departments: medicine, surgery, anesthesiology, trauma, etc. Some of those departments contain two or three physicians, while others have hundreds of physicians and researchers working within their walls. Each of these departments is headed by a chairman or chairwoman \u2013 usually professors of medicine in their own specialties who have vast clinical experience. Those chairmen or chairwomen are picked by a selective committee of peers who look for credentials, experience and contributions in science.\n\nAt the ripe old age of 36, Murthy would not even come close to being picked to run any medical department, in any academic medical center in this country. This is not because he is a bad doctor, but simply because he has not contributed enough, published enough or healed enough to qualify him to be a medical leader.\n\nSince 2008, Murthy has dedicated his career to achieving a political agenda, forming groups like Doctors for America, which has lobbied heavily for ObamaCare. Miraculously enough, that political campaign seems to have now paid off and earned him this nomination.\n\nTo me, health care should be 80 percent science and 20 percent politics \u2013 not the other way around. I hope that the president reconsiders this nomination and instead chooses a doctor who better personifies the greatness of America\u2019s medical and scientific achievements. After all, the healing power achieved in America\u2019s hospitals is mimicked by hospitals around the world, and sought out by patients everywhere.\n\nAnd to Dr. Vivek Murthy: As we say in New Jersey \u2013 it\u2019s not personal, it\u2019s just business.\n\nDr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor.
