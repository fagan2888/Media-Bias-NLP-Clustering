They develop \u201cspecial skills and talents\u201d that help them succeed. They may feel isolated as individuals, but put all those individuals together, and you\u2019ve got a community 1 billion strong, accounting for 15 percent of the world population. That\u2019s a powerful economic engine that we ignore at our own peril, Ruttledge said.\n\nLook at Ruttledge herself. She was born with a partial facial paralysis \u2014 as well as legal blindness in her left eye \u2014 that had doctors confident she\u2019d never be able to speak or eat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very successful at both,\u201d Ruttledge laughed.\n\nShe rose above childhood teasing and trauma \u2014 and then grown-up employment discrimination stemming from her mild disfigurement \u2014 first to work as a teacher but ultimately to direct state agencies in Oregon and then Washington that seek disability inclusion and vocational rehabilitation. Eventually, she was tapped by the Obama White House not once or twice, but thrice \u2014 to manage a federal agency and to help develop policies that touch people across the country and all around the world.\n\n\u201cI got involved at a great stage\u201d in the evolution of new attitudes toward people with disabilities, she said. \u201cI wanted to be significantly involved in developing disability policy. This is big-time stuff.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t say no\n\nRuttledge, a Michigan native, settled in Vancouver because it was convenient to her job at the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation in Olympia and to her husband Ed\u2019s job in Portland. Ed eventually became human resources director for Intercity Transit in the Olympia area before his recent retirement; he is a frequent Columbian letter writer and independent blogger who made news recently by filing and then withdrawing a lawsuit against Clark County regarding employment policies and the controversial May 2013 hiring of state Sen. Don Benton as environmental services director.\n\nLynnae Ruttledge had been working in Olympia for four years when the Obama administration came calling with a heaven-sent job offer: commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration. That means administering $4 billion in federal money for more than 1 million Americans with significant disabilities.\n\nThe job offer required Ruttledge to endure much the same sort of vetting as other presidential appointees: financial disclosures, personal background checks, ethics probes and even a hearing before the U.S. Senate. \u201cWho are you, what have you done, and how are you perceived?\u201d is how she put it. Like her husband, she is mightily opinionated, she said, but these probes have convinced her never to blog and to be circumspect about her use of social media. You won\u2019t find even the most innocuous photos posted online of Lynnae Ruttledge at a party.\n\nShe was easily confirmed by the Senate \u2014 it wasn\u2019t exactly a judicial-nominee-style grilling, she said \u2014 on Christmas Eve 2009, and moved to an apartment in Washington, D.C., a week later. \u201cIt was an amazing job, and I had a marvelous time,\u201d she said. \u201cI met with the president, and I was able to have a real impact on policy.\u201d\n\nJust the same, deciding to leave again was easy. She missed the Pacific Northwest and her husband, who faced some unexpected health challenges. By January 2012, she was back in Vancouver, her government service behind her \u2014 or so she thought.\n\nThe White House thought otherwise. She\u2019d barely returned home when she was tapped to serve on the National Council on Disability, and while traveling on related business in Ireland she took a call asking if she also was available to fill a vacancy on the Commission on Long-Term Care.\n\nShe and Ed had been thinking about a leisurely retirement, she said \u2014 but they decided it could wait. \u201cYou don\u2019t say no to the president,\u201d Ruttledge said. More to the point: \u201cI believe so strongly in having an impact,\u201d she said.\n\nCatastrophic care\n\nManaging bureaucracies is one thing, but serving on advisory panels and commissions often is an exercise in purely partisan politics, Ruttledge said, with Republican and Democratic appointees usually voting in predictable blocs.\n\nFor example: The Commission on Long-Term Care made many important recommendations in a September 2013 report. But it ducked one huge riddle, Ruttledge said: how to pay for long-term and nursing care for people with chronic or catastrophic health conditions? Ruttledge\u2019s deeply Democratic belief is in sharing that cost across a public risk pool; she characterized the Republican position as resolutely in favor of private savings and individual responsibility. (Long-term care was dropped from Obamacare, the new Affordable Care Act, before it was implemented.)\n\n\u201cWe need a public policy about catastrophic insurance and Medicaid,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happens when you are a successful person in the middle of your career and you have a catastrophic accident?\u201d Currently, she said, you need to buy your own long-term care insurance \u2014 or spend down all your assets and \u201cbecome poor\u201d before any Medicaid benefits kick in.\n\nThe report was eventually approved by a majority of the 15-member commission; because it took no position on financing, Ruttledge joined the bloc of six \u201cno\u201d votes. The question of long-term care now moves to Congress.\n\nWar and wealth\n\nIn poor nations she\u2019s visited \u2014 both as a government representative and as a private consultant on inclusion and rights \u2014 war and disaster are chief causes of a whole \u201cculture of disability,\u201d Ruttledge said. That means too few resources, widespread misery and a focus on simple survival, she said.\n\nKuwait is different, because that nation has resources to lavish upon disabled citizens, she said. \u201cResources are not the problem\u201d in Kuwait, she said. According to the U.S. State Department, Kuwait is the eighth-richest country in the world per capita \u2014 placing just behind the United States, which is seventh.\n\nBut Kuwait is ahead of the U.S. in at least one respect, Ruttledge said: It has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The United States has not. President Barack Obama signed the convention in 2009, but the divided Senate, which has the power to ratify international treaties, declined. That\u2019s because of United Nations detractors who dislike the very idea of international treaties that appear to infringe on American sovereignty, Ruttledge said. (At present, 158 nations have signed the treaty and 138 have ratified it.)\n\nMeanwhile, Ruttledge said that wherever she goes, she finds the same sorts of disability issues that are just \u201clayered differently.\u201d Regardless of resources, she said, expectations about achievement and independence are almost always too low.\n\nIn Kuwait she met a young man named Abdulaziz Al-Mutairi, who grew up with muscular dystrophy and all the adaptive technologies and human help he could possibly want, she said. But when he became an exchange student at Syracuse University in New York state, his appetite for independence was seriously whetted. He didn\u2019t want to be treated like an overgrown child anymore.\n\n\u201cAbdulaziz was used to having everything done for him, but what he experienced in America was so much more enjoyable,\u201d Ruttledge said. \u201cHe learned to use public transportation, he learned to independently transfer from his wheelchair, he learned to depend on himself. He is now able to see his life (as) one that he controls. It\u2019s a tantalizing realization and grants him freedom that money doesn\u2019t buy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the overall message Ruttledge brings everywhere she goes, she said. \u201cCaring parents and families can provide a standard of living that makes life with a disability more comfortable,\u201d she said. But there\u2019s still a high price, she said, and that\u2019s a world that \u201csees you only as your disability,\u201d she said.\n\nThe better way, she said, is coupling crucial resources with high expectations.\n\n\u201cI have seen the power of people with disabilities learning their rights and discovering their gifts,\u201d Ruttledge said. \u201cMy disability has opened up more doors than anyone ever could have expected.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Lynnae Ruttledge may know better than anybody alive how limiting the term \"person with disabilities\" is, and how far such a person can go in the", "application-name": "", "og": {"site_name": "The Columbian", "description": "Lynnae Ruttledge may know better than anybody alive how limiting the term \"person with disabilities\" is, and how far such a person can go in the world of work and influence.", "title": "Improving life, choices for those with disabilities", "url": "http://www.columbian.com/news/2014/jan/03/improving-life-choices-for-those-with-disabilities/", "image": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/columbian_c_200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "columbian.com", "creator": "_ScottHewitt", "site": "@thecolumbian", "card": "summary", "title": "Improving life, choices for those with disabilities"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3A5B7C", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 1256005586, "app_id": 122928857737763}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/windows-tiles/square-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thecolumbian", "section": "Carousel,Latest News,Local News,News", "published_time": "2014-01-02 16:00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "(Long-term care was dropped from Obamacare, the new Affordable Care Act, before it was implemented.)\nFor example: The Commission on Long-Term Care made many important recommendations in a September 2013 report.\n\u201cI got involved at a great stage\u201d in the evolution of new attitudes toward people with disabilities, she said.\nThe question of long-term care now moves to Congress.\n\u201cCaring parents and families can provide a standard of living that makes life with a disability more comfortable,\u201d she said."}
