Federal election law requires that all candidates get equal time when it comes to broadcasts. So, Donald Trump’s appearance on “Saturday Night Live” is raising some ire with his fellow candidates who want their shot to be funny too. According to the FEC “…qualified candidates are entitled to the same quantity, day, part and price as their opponents’ for television broadcasts.” No word yet on what exactly a “qualified candidate” is in the GOP field.

On Friday night’s “Late Show,” notorious campaign finance nerd Stephen Colbert said, “invoking this law is pretty rare because it makes you seem petty and desperate for attention. So, five candidates have invoked it: John Kasich, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki, Mike Huckabee and Jim Gilmore.”

Colbert said that these five men are desperately trying to force Americans to look at them. “They’re like subway panhandlers. ‘Excuse me for bothering you. Ladies and gentleman, I am not a drug addict, however, I am running for president. If you can find it in your hearts to spare a small donation of the legal limit of $2,700 I promise I’ll use it to find a good job in Washington, D.C. Thank you. God bless. And now… doo-wop.'”

According to the demands, these five candidates are asking for 12 minutes and 5 seconds of airtime, which is what Trump got on “SNL.” While it might seem crazy, there’s actually precedence for this. Back in 2004, Rev. Al Sharpton hosted “SNL,” “so rival candidate Joe Lieberman got NBC to cough up 28 minutes which he used to broadcast reruns of a Lieberman town hall meeting.”
