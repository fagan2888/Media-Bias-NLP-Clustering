You can currently watch the first three episodes of the series here on BBC iPlayer.\n\nThis is a brilliant series produced by Brook Lapping for the BBC. They\u2019ve got some truly sensational behind-the-scenes footage. So, as they tell the story of Obama\u2019s presidency, they are able to show specific video of that event behind-the-scenes \u2013 advisers emerging from a crunch meeting or whatever. And they have a remarkable parade of players giving their retrospective view on events: from Rahm Emmanuel, Obama\u2019s chief of staff, to John Kerry, Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner and chief adviser David Axelrod.\n\nI\u2019ve just watched the second episode on the \u201cObamacare\u201d passing, following the \u201cFist 100 days\u201d episode about the economic crisis in 2008/2009. They both show a President with extraordinary nerve and calm negotiating two massive issues.\n\nThe programme shows how \u201cknife-edge\u201d the passing of the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d) was. In retrospect we can see what a huge achievement that was. Recently, there has been the 63rd unsuccessful attempt to repeal \u201cObamacare\u201d. Last week, Republican Ohio Governor and Presidential nomination candidate, John Kasich called the promise by the Republicans to repeal Obamacare \u201ca big joke\u201d and \u201ca stupid promise\u201d.\n\n* Paul Walter is a Liberal Democrat activist in Newbury and West Berkshire.
