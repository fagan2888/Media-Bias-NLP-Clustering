I didn\u2019t think so, which is why I wanted to draw your attention to this scintillating back and forth in Philadelphia Magazine between a couple of men who like to think of themselves as just two regular guys, ex-Gov. Ed Rendell and MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews.\n\nThey first knew each other when Matthews was working for Jimmy Carter and Rendell was backing Teddy Kennedy back in 1980:\n\nCHRIS: Teddy came to town, and he was eating Philly pretzels and meeting with the Cardinal. You could do that in those days. And Carter was in his Rose Garden because of the [Iranian] hostages. And I\u2019m handling Philly. These guys rolled us over. ED: But we only won by 7,000 votes statewide. It was almost a Pyrrhic victory. Because by the time [the nomination battle] reached New York and Pennsylvania, it was over.\n\nGood times. These two guys adore one another. Which is nice. Except for their politics.\n\nED: I think you\u2019re gonna have a divided government no matter who wins in \u201916. But I would say there are two people in the field who have the ability to maybe bring the Congress together: Hillary on the Democratic side, and Jeb Bush on the Republican side. Part of it, Chris, is just the interpersonal skills. I had a Republican legislature for six of the eight years [I was governor], and yet everything I talked about in the 2002 campaign, we made significant progress on. Because I knew how to sit down and horse-trade.\n\nVillagers and cynics love to mock liberals for \u201cGreen lantern-ism\u201d \u2014 the notion that the president has more power than he actually does \u2014 but the truth is that this centrist twaddle qualifies just as easily. Oddly, Rendell and company rarely get criticized for insisting that the president could have just gotten everyone in a room and knocked some heads together to solve everything once and for all. It\u2019s fair to say that this myth is just as pervasive as the so-called silly liberals\u2019 and it\u2019s believed in much more powerful circles than the comment section of Daily Kos.\n\nRendell gives the president only a C-plus, unfortunately, because, well, you know why:\n\nED: When I say C-plus, he came in with tremendous wind at his back, and he had the opportunity to do great things. He\u2019s failed to do the politics, small p, necessary to do the great things. Interestingly, I think he has a chance to change that legacy \u2014 ISIS has given him that. He did a brilliant job putting that coalition together. You\u2019ve got Arab jet-fighter pilots dropping bombs on other Muslims. That\u2019s a huge achievement. I think if he pivots off this, if after the election he gets immigration reform done, maybe cleans up a few things in the Affordable Care Act, and maybe his last year does the bargain on the debt \u2014 if he does all that, then he gets the A-minus.\n\nIt\u2019s nice that Rendell thinks ISIS is an \u201copportunity\u201d for the president to change his legacy and that it\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d that Arabs are dropping bombs on other Muslims but I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s just a little bit too darkly cynical for normal people. One assumes Rendell will be very impressed by this from his favorite potential GOP candidate, Jeb Bush, who gave the president an F-minus:\n\nBush compared keeping forces in Iraq to the post-World War II missions involving U.S. troops in Japan, Korea, and Europe, which \u201ccreated a security for the world and allowed people to rise up from poverty.\u201d According to Bush, those missions \u201cshould be something that we are really proud of,\u201d and not doing something similar in Iraq \u201ccreated a void that has allowed ISIS to emerge in Iraq as a force to be reckoned with. And not fulfilling the commitment of the red-line threat created a similar kind of situation in Syria.\u201d According to Bush, \u201cthere is a consistent foreign policy for our country that has worked\u201d since World War II under Democrats and Republicans alike, \u201cand it starts with saying that we lead the world. We\u2019re not part of the \u2018community of nations,'\u201d a term Bush said gave him nausea.\n\nWhat could be more sickening than the idea of a \u201ccommunity of nations\u201d? That\u2019s right up there with \u201cworld peace\u201d and \u201cglobal cooperation\u201d for sheer stomach-churning revulsion. (And I wonder if he asked his big brother why he signed that pesky status of forces agreement to withdraw from Iraq? Seems odd.)\n\nBut back to Jeb\u2019s biggest fan, Ed Rendell. It\u2019s the last part of his comment that\u2019s so revealing. After all the sturm und drang of the budget deals of the last few years and the unfortunate results, you\u2019d think the deficit scolds would give it a rest, if only for a little while. But no, there\u2019s Rendell still pushing the daft idea of a Grand Bargain to cut Social Security and veterans programs. One might wonder why they are so wedded to this concept even today, when it\u2019s quite clear that neither party nor the population at large is interested in kicking the legs out from under the incomes of seniors, veterans and the disabled at the moment. But perhaps that\u2019s because that old Upton Sinclair saying about how \u201cit\u2019s difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it\u201d applies in this case.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The MSNBC host and jolly pundit may play regular guys on TV -- but here's what they're really all about  VIDEO", "title": "Chris Matthews and Ed Rendell, working-class heroes \u2014 in their dreams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The MSNBC host and jolly pundit may play regular guys on TV -- but here's what they're really all about  VIDEO", "title": "Chris Matthews and Ed Rendell, working-class heroes \u2014 in their dreams", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/03/chris_matthews_and_ed_rendell_working_class_heroes_in_their_dreams/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/matthews_rendell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The MSNBC host and jolly pundit may play regular guys on TV -- but here's what they're really all about  VIDEO", "title": "Chris Matthews and Ed Rendell, working-class heroes \u2014 in their dreams", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/matthews_rendell.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Heather Digby Parton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7ef\"", "article_summary": "Ed Rendell and MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews.\nBut back to Jeb\u2019s biggest fan, Ed Rendell.\nBut no, there\u2019s Rendell still pushing the daft idea of a Grand Bargain to cut Social Security and veterans programs.\nED: I think you\u2019re gonna have a divided government no matter who wins in \u201916.\n(And I wonder if he asked his big brother why he signed that pesky status of forces agreement to withdraw from Iraq?"}
