(AP Photo/Hasan Jamali)\n\nProminent Bahraini human rights activist Nabeel Rajab accused Bahrain\u2019s ruling family of seeking to change Bahrain\u2019s demography by adopting a strategy similar to that used by the UK in the creation of Israel.\n\nTalking to Iranian news channel Press TV, Rajab said the systematic naturalization of foreigners and the deportation of locals after revoking their citizenships are proof that al-Khalifa family is implementing the same strategy that Britain implemented in Palestine.\n\nDozens of Bahrainis have had their citizenship revoked and several have also been deported since Bahrain adopted the Bahraini Citizenship Law last year stipulating that suspects convicted of \u201cterrorist\u201d acts could be stripped of their nationality.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cThe Bahraini authorities are running out of arguments to justify repression. They are now resorting to extreme measures such as jail sentences and revoking nationality to quell dissent in the country, rather than allowing people to peacefully express their views,\u201d said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East and North Africa deputy director.\n\n\u201cArbitrarily depriving these Bahrainis of their nationality and forcing them out of Bahrain renders them \u2018stateless\u2019 and goes contrary to Bahrain\u2019s international obligations,\u201d said Sahraoui.\n\nMoreover, the Bahraini ruling family have been naturalizing foreigners since 2012 in an attempt to change the demographics of the country.\n\nAccording to information Al-Akhbar received earlier this year, the Bahraini authorities have granted tens of thousands of people, with certain characteristics and from designated countries, Bahraini citizenship, in an attempt to create a new sectarian majority, which would deny the Shia their rightful representation in the state\u2019s institutions.\n\nThese tactics are similar to those used by the West to alter the demography of Palestine.\n\nKhalil al-Tafakji, a settlement and map expert in East Jerusalem, asserted to Al-Akhbar that Israel has been systematically working since 1967 to turn Jerusalem into a city with Jewish features. \u201cIn 1967, 70,000 Palestinians and not a single Israeli lived in [East] Jerusalem, whereas today 320,000 Palestinians and at least 200,000 Israelis are residing in the city.\u201d\n\nTafakji then said that \u201c125,000 Palestinians have been forced by the Israeli occupation forces to live behind the [apartheid] wall, which means only 195,000 Palestinians are currently living in East Jerusalem, making Zionist settlers the city\u2019s majority.\u201d\n\nThe roots of the Israel-Palestine conflict date back to 1917, when the British government, in the now-infamous Balfour Declaration, called for \u201cthe establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.\u201d\n\nIsrael occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank during the 1967 Middle East War. It later annexed the holy city in 1980, claiming it as the capital of the self-proclaimed Zionist state \u2013 a move never recognized by the international community.\n\nCrackdown\n\nMoreover, Rajab, director of the Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR) and co-founder of Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR), said that Britain has been supporting the Bahraini authorities, as well as other Gulf states, in their crackdown on pro-democracy protests.\n\nForeign military presence and military cooperation with Western countries are common in Gulf countries.\n\nBritain said on December 5 it had sealed a deal to open a new military base in Bahrain, its first permanent base in the Middle East since it formally withdrew from the Gulf in 1971, drawing concern from Bahraini opposition groups.\n\nBahraini Foreign Minister Khalid al-Khalifa considered the agreement to be a step that bolstered \u201cgrowing\u201d cooperation between his country and the UK.\n\nWashington is also a long-standing ally of the ruling al-Khalifa dynasty and Bahrain is home to the US Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet.\n\nDuring the Gulf War in 1991, the US military presence became firmly-established with permanent bases and a comprehensive support structure after signing \u201cprotective\u201d agreements with all the countries on the Western bank of the Gulf.\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf neighbors sent troops into Bahrain in March 2011 and reinforced a crackdown that led to accusations of serious human rights violations.\n\nWith Saudi Arabia\u2019s help, Bahrain crushed peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations that began on February 14, 2011.\n\nThe small nation has yet to resolve the conflict between the monarchy and the opposition, which argues that the country\u2019s Shia majority population is discriminated against.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Moreover, the Bahraini ruling family have been naturalizing foreigners since 2012 in an attempt to change the demographics of the country.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Al Akhbar", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Moreover, the Bahraini ruling family have been naturalizing foreigners since 2012 in an attempt to change the demographics of the country.", "title": "Bahrain Adopts Israel Strategy To Alter Demographics", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/bahrain-adopts-israel-strategy-alter-demographics/200245/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Mideast-Bahrain_Webf-9.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-26T19:02:38-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Moreover, the Bahraini ruling family have been naturalizing foreigners since 2012 in an attempt to change the demographics of the country.", "title": "Bahrain Adopts Israel Strategy To Alter Demographics", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Mideast-Bahrain_Webf-9.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Nabeel Rajab", "published_time": "2014-12-27T05:00:51-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-26T19:02:38-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfef7\"", "article_summary": "Bahrain Adopts Israel Strategy To Alter DemographicsThe Bahraini ruling family have been naturalizing foreigners since 2012 in an attempt to change the demographics of the country.\nMoreover, the Bahraini ruling family have been naturalizing foreigners since 2012 in an attempt to change the demographics of the country.\n(AP Photo/Hasan Jamali)Prominent Bahraini human rights activist Nabeel Rajab accused Bahrain\u2019s ruling family of seeking to change Bahrain\u2019s demography by adopting a strategy similar to that used by the UK in the creation of Israel.\nKhalil al-Tafakji, a settlement and map expert in East Jerusalem, asserted to Al-Akhbar that Israel has been systematically working since 1967 to turn Jerusalem into a city with Jewish features.\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf neighbors sent troops into Bahrain in March 2011 and reinforced a crackdown that led to accusations of serious human rights violations."}
