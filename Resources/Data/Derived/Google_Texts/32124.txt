On the 42nd anniversary of the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade, President Obama said Thursday that he is “deeply committed to protecting this core constitutional right” of abortion, and he criticized pro-life legislation approved by the House.

Mr. Obama called the high court’s ruling “a decision that protects a woman’s freedom to make her own choices about her body and her health, and reaffirms a fundamental American value: that government should not intrude in our most private and personal family matters.”

“I believe that efforts like H.R. 7, the bill the House considered today, would intrude on women’s reproductive freedom and access to health care and unnecessarily restrict the private insurance choices that consumers have today,” Mr. Obama said. “The federal government should not be injecting itself into decisions best made between women, their families, and their doctors.”

The House approved Thursday a ban on taxpayer funding for abortion through Obamacare or in other cases, after Republican leaders pulled a bill that would have prohibited abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

The president also said he is committed to reducing unintended pregnancies, supporting maternal and child health, promoting adoptions and minimizing the need for abortions.

“Today, as we reflect on this critical moment in our history, may we all rededicate ourselves to ensuring that our daughters have the same rights, freedoms, and opportunities as our sons,” the president said.
