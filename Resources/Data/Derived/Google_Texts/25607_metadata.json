Cupp discuss reform or repeal of Obamacare with Dr. Cornel West and The Weekly Standard's Bill Kristol.\n\n\n\n\n\nJONES: Welcome back. Here in Washington today, Senator Ted Cruz tried to get the Senate to defund Obamacare. It didn't work, but here's what I want to know. Whatever happened to compassionate conservatism?\n\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush used to talk about that. I remember when Jack Kemp used to go into black communities, talk about empowering people. In the CROSSFIRE tonight, Professor Cornel West and Bill Kristol.\n\n\n\nMr. Kristol, I do not understand how you guys expect to grow the GOP. You're attacking Obamacare. It's the only thing out there that's trying to help people get insurance. All I hear is about cantaloupe calves. All I hear is a Food Stamp president. I don't hear the compassion in this party. Does that worry you? How are you going to grow?\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: Well, no, I think Republicans need to grow, and I think, actually, the big mistake to the Romney campaign was not having an economic message that spoke enough to working-class and middle-class Americans and explained that we are -- that Republicans do have policy proposals to help grow wages, to help grow jobs and to help address health reforms. A big mistake of the Romney campaign not to put forth conservative health-care reform agenda.\n\n\n\nI think some conservatives are now talking about financial reform, so I'm for a populist middle class, working class Republicanism. I'm with you on that, but not -- but not -- not to have Republicans become like milquetoast Democrats.\n\n\n\nJONES: God forbid.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: I think that's an extremely good phrase that Cornel has here that we need to dwell on a little bit more. You know?\n\n\n\nJONES: Let me understand.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: They don't stand up for their appointees in the White House when they're a little controversial. They throw -- they throw a fine man like Larry Summers under the bus when he's --\n\n\n\nWEST: Fine man. Fine man. God bless him and be with him. But the problem is this. You see, that you have to have something that you're willing to fight for.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: I agree.\n\n\n\nWEST: If you've got single payer, people are willing to fight. You've got public option, people are willing to fight. But if you've got this middle-of-the-road position, you've got to try to get your troops out.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Well, I agree. Republicans -- Republicans -- Republicans need to give alternatives and not just be negative.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: Absolutely.\n\n\n\nCUPP: But let me turn this -- Van's question around. Because I was thinking about this, and I remember back during the campaign when Mitt Romney went into West Philadelphia. And Mayor Michael Nutter protested his visit and said, \"Why is this guy here?\" Mitt Romney was booed by the NAACP. I'm wondering: Is there an interest and a willingness among black Democrats to have a dialogue with white Republicans on any issue?\n\n\n\nWEST; Sure. Sure. I mean, my God, we black folk, we have been some of the most open-minded, forgiving and embracing people in the nation. In fact we've got Clarence Thomas. Clarence Thomas is within our own community. So it's not like we've got to go somewhere else to have conservatives.\n\n\n\nBut the issue is this: Look at the Republicans cutting Food Stamps. That's morally obscene and spiritually profane. Poor people, 4 million poor people may be being pushed into poverty.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: How much -- how much did Food Stamps go up in the last four years?\n\n\n\nWEST: They've gone up -- you know why?\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: They've doubled.\n\n\n\nCUPP: And how much poverty --\n\n\n\nWEST: Because this crisis of capitalism. Wages have been stagnant and going down.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: Wait. Who's been the president for the last four years? I thought the economy was roaring back under President Obama.\n\n\n\nWEST: But Brother Bill --\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: Republicans try to trim an overgrown entitlement program, and that's morally obscene?\n\n\n\nWEST: No, but when you've got neoliberal policy, then this is when neoliberalism goes hand in hand with your neoconservatism. Privatized militarized support big bank banks and big corporations result in what? Working class devastated. Middle class downward mobility. Escalation of poverty.\n\n\n\nSo yes, you're right, we've got a lot of Food Stamps increasing because of what? People are suffering.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: But Dr. West -- Dr. West --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK) KRISTOL: I feel I have to --\n\n\n\nWEST: It's not the president. It's the neoliberal politics of the whole Democratic party.\n\n\n\nCUPP: But Professor West, median -- median household income has dropped by more than $4,000 adjusted for inflation, since 2000; poverty rate is up.\n\n\n\nWEST: The top 1 percent, 95 percent of all income growth.\n\n\n\nCUPP: President Obama admitted that the folks in the middle and at the bottom haven't seen wage or income growth.\n\n\n\nWEST: Exactly.\n\n\n\nCUPP: That the folks at the top have.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nWEST: Absolutely. The larger tendency.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: Here's something I think we can agree on, probably. That actually I do think, honestly, the political party of 2016 has a -- addresses these problems. Which I agree: the Republicans haven't done as much as they should have. But I don't think honestly the Obama administration has done much on. That I think a political party, political candidate could win in 2016.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right.\n\n\n\nJONES: Let me talk to you about that. Because people are beating up on President Obama, but when I look at the last ticket. Do you agree with people like Mitt Romney, who says that 47 percent of Americans are takers and, worse, you have a Paul Ryan who says as many as 60 percent of Americans are takers, not makers. To get to that number, you have to include every single person who's on Social Security, every veteran, every disabled person. Do you believe, like apparently Paul Ryan, that 60 percent of Americans are takers and that being on Social Security makes you a taker, not a maker? Do you agree with that?\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: No. Well, I mean, I don't think that's quite fair to Paul Ryan, because I think he was trying to explain something more analytically. But no. I objected. When Romney said the 40 percent thing, I said he's probably lost the presidency. And it's a -- it's wrong. It's analytically wrong. It's foolish, and it was a mistake --\n\n\n\nCUPP: A mistake we will probably pay for for a while.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: And it's where Republicans have gone a little off the rails.\n\n\n\nWEST: But that part of the cold-hearted mean-spiritedness I'm talking about. You agree that that statement is cold-hearted and mean- spirited? KRISTOL: Well, I --\n\n\n\nWEST: Do you agree?\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: I'm cold-hearted and mean-spirited in a more enlightened way. No, that's not cold. It's just foolish; it's just silly.\n\n\n\nCUPP: It's bad message.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: But you can be tough-minded about reforming programs and improving them, targeting them, and not having Food Stamps double over four years without being cold-hearted and mean-spirited.\n\n\n\nWEST: But Brother Bill, though, your Judaism, which is one of the great moral breakthroughs in the human race in terms of weakness, vulnerability of a person accented, kindness to the stranger, the loving kindness to the oppressed, how do you reconcile that with your ties to big corporations for these cold-hearted mean-spirited formulations when it comes to poor working people?\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: I think the Republican Party should have fewer ties to big business and big corporations. I think the Obama administration is the one who's been in bed with that.\n\n\n\nWEST: But Mitt Romney? You supported Sarah Palin.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: She's not a big business, big corporation. She's a working person --\n\n\n\nWEST: In terms of her status, but in terms of her policies, my God.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: But you're just going to say --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nWEST: Bashing Obamacare. Bashing Obamacare every day.\n\n\n\nCUPP: But how can you not admire a woman like Sarah Palin who picked herself up by her bootstraps. Five kids, one fighting overseas, one born disabled. She made her way up from nothing through the good-old- boy network to become a mayor, city councilwoman, the first woman governor of Alaska, and vice-presidential candidate. How is she not the example of the kind of life you would want for most Americans?\n\n\n\nWEST: Because even given her upward social mobility, her sentiments and temperaments side with the well-to-do --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Because she's a Republican. That's it.\n\n\n\nWEST: No, no, no. Democrats side with the well-to-do, too. I think both parties, both parties need to be radically called into question. See, I am a thorough going leftist in the sense that I don't go out with the neoliberal Democrats, milquetoast conservatives, Republicans, mean-spirited. This is true on foreign policy. Drones. Killing innocent people. Innocent -- CUPP: Oh, you don't have to convince me that Obama's foreign policy has been --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nWEST: Even your attitude toward Rand Paul. Rand Paul for me is strong on this issue, and I agree with him on this issue.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, let me challenge you for a second.\n\n\n\nWEST: Absolutely. Absolutely. You deserve to be.\n\n\n\nJONES: You talk a lot about love and forgiveness and all that type stuff. And frankly, you are a great moral hero --\n\n\n\nWEST: I am a Jesus loving, free black man.\n\n\n\nJONES: Yes, you are. And a moral hero in our country. Do you think that you've shown enough love toward President Obama? I think there are people who feel like this critique that you extend is important. But they also wonder where is the love for this president? How would you answer that?\n\n\n\nWEST: I would say that I have a righteous indignation for any politician who uses the legacy of Fanny Lou Hamer, Martin Luther King Jr. to promote neoliberal policies that generate privatized education, that use drones that kill innocent people, innocent children, that side with Wall Street. Larry Summers, God bless him. God bless him. Is he tied to Wall Street more than Main Street? God love him.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: You know him better than I do. I don't know a lot about Larry.\n\n\n\nWEST: It's not a hatred. It's a matter of looking at the evidence.\n\n\n\nJONES: You're my mentor. You're my mentor. You're my friend. We taught at Princeton together.\n\n\n\nWEST: And I've learned so much from you, my brother.\n\n\n\nJONES: We all walk in your footstep, but I think when I listen to African-Americans, there is a concern that our greatest intellectual. You're going to be -- go down in history for this era. You've got the first black president, and where is the love? I understand the critique, but where is the love?\n\n\n\nWEST: No, because the love is first for the suffering people. See, that's the righteous indignation. That's what it means to go into the temple in Jerusalem and run out the money changers. Now I'm no Jesus. I'm a cracked vessel. But that's what it means to listen to Amos (ph).\n\n\n\nCUPP: And let me -- I think Van would like you to forgive the president for some of his ills.\n\n\n\nBut let me challenge you, Bill, my friend here on the right. I look at the Republican Party right now, and while, yes, it seems fractured, it also seems to me like a great opportunity. We have such intellectual diversity. Why can't we have a Chris Christie and a Rand Paul or -- and a Ted Cruz and have that be a wonderful thing instead of such a division?\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: Look, I think it's healthy. If you ask me, when I look at (ph) the Republican Party, with all due respect to these men, where individually you find them, Bob Dole and Mitt Romney and George H.W. Bush, and they were kind of just dominant, and no one was questioning anything and it was chugging along with the same policies of the last 10, 20, 30 years, I would be depressed.\n\n\n\nIn fact, we have a Republican Party with governors like Bobby Jindal and Chris Christie and Suzanna Martinez and Mike Pence. That's not even a bench. It's on the field.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Yes.\n\n\n\nKRISTOL: And governing. They're actually governing, and they're governing successfully, applying conservative principles. And people in Congress and the Senate like Tom Cotton and Paul Ryan and yes, Ted Cruz. I can't resist saying that. Just to get one last rise out of you.
