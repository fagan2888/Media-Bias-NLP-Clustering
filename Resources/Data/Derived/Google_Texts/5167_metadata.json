A baby born on American soil is the most expensive in the world, yet our newborns have a lower chance of surviving past infancy than those born in eight other developed nations. The Affordable Care Act has made health insurance more accessible to the poor, yet bills for medications and basic hospital procedures remain strikingly high.\n\nHere are 11 charts that show in embarrassing detail some of the many shortcomings of our healthcare system.\n\n1. Americans don\u2019t live as long as we should.\n\nIn terms of overall life expectancy, the United States ranks 26th out of 34 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries. Americans enjoy fewer years than Slovenians and Koreans, living just a tad longer than Czechs and Chileans, who used to rank far behind us.\n\nOECD Health At-A-Glance 2013\n\n2. But our country spends far more on healthcare and drugs than any other developed country.\n\nNearly a fifth of America\u2019s gross domestic product goes toward healthcare spending, putting us above the Netherlands, France, Germany, Canada and Switzerland, where actual health outcomes are much better.\n\nOECD Health At-A-Glance 2013\n\nOECD Health At-A-Glance 2013\n\n3. Many of us die from diseases that don\u2019t have to be fatal.\n\nAmericans are more likely to die from asthma than people than in Brazil or Costa Rica, even though the disease is equally prevalent in those countries.\n\nGlobal Initiative for Asthma, Global Burden of Asthma Report\n\n4. Americans with certain treatable diseases are more likely to end up in a hospital \u2014 and more likely to die.\n\nWe send more adult asthma sufferers to the hospital to be treated than any other developed country, coming in just under the Slovakian Republic. The soaring cost of asthma medication in the US (a Qvar brand inhaler, for example, costs 18 times more in the US than it does in Greece) is partially to blame for this problem, but access to preventative care also plays a role. Uninsured asthma patients are far more likely to die in the hospital than those with insurance.\n\nOECD Health At-A-Glance 2013\n\n5. Our life expectancy varies by skin colour.\n\nIn 2009, the average black American could expect to live to just 75, the same life expectancy white Americans enjoyed 30 years earlier in 1979. Today, Black Americans remain far more likely than white Americans to die from heart disease, cancer and diabetes, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCentres for Disease Control and Prevention, National Vital Statistics System\n\n6. It\u2019s too easy to opt out of vaccinations, leading to new cases of preventable diseases.\n\nLow vaccination rates can lead to outbreaks of diseases like measles and Hepatitis B, especially among susceptible populations such as the young and the elderly. A handful of wealthy southern California schools have lower vaccination rates than South Sudan \u2014 a troubling trend that extends to New York City private schools as well.\n\nOECD Health At-A-Glance 2013\n\n7. American doctors spend very little time with patients.\n\n\n\nIn comparison to physicians in the Czech Republic, New Zealand, France and Israel, doctors in the US spend far less time consulting with patients and do a far worse job explaining to them what\u2019s wrong.\n\nOECD Health At-A-Glance 2013\n\n8. Life-saving prescription drugs cost a fortune.\n\nThe US spends a huge chunk of its budget on pharmaceutical drugs. Unlike other countries, whose governments regularly haggle with pharmaceutical companies to reduce drug prices, Medicare is forbidden from engaging in such negotiations. This is why a cancer drug like Gleevec, which costs about $US1,000 in New Zealand and Canada, costs an average of $US6,214 in the US. Even the common pain medication Celebrex, which runs for $US51 in Canada, can cost anywhere from two to nine times that amount in the US.\n\nInternational Federation of Health Plans Comparative Price Report 2013\n\nInternational Federation of Health Plans Comparative Price Report 2013\n\n9. Standard lab tests are far pricier, too.\n\nAn MRI in the US, for example, can cost 10 times as much as it would in Switzerland.\n\nInternational Federation of Health Plans Comparative Price Report 2013\n\n10. American babies are the most expensive in the world.\n\nGiving birth in the US \u2014 including hospitalization and a normal delivery \u2014 costs an average of $US10,002, nearly five times more than the cost of birth in Argentina or Spain.\n\nInternational Federation of Health Plans Comparative Price Report 2013\n\n11. Yet babies born in the US are far less likely to survive past infancy than babies born in many other developed countries.\n\nIn 2004, the latest year that data are available for all countries, the US ranked 29th globally in infant mortality, with the same rate of infant death as Slovakia and Poland.\n\nCentres for Disease Control and Prevention, Recent Trends in Infant Mortality in the United States\n\nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=5; cycle=1", "publisher": "Business Insider Australia", "description": "The health of people in the United States is...", "application-name": "Business Insider Australia", "author": "Erin Brodwin", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_310_wide.png", "twitter": {"description": "The health of people in the United States is...", "title": "11 Charts That Should Make People Really Embarrassed About The US Healthcare System", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com.au/whats-wrong-with-healthcare-in-the-us-2014-9", "image": "http://static.businessinsider.com/image/5421dfe76da811980d708165/image.jpg", "site": "@BIAUS", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_70.png", "robots": "noarchive", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_310.png", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider Australia", "description": "The health of people in the United States is...", "title": "11 Charts That Should Make People Really Embarrassed About The US Healthcare System", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com.au/whats-wrong-with-healthcare-in-the-us-2014-9", "image": "http://static.businessinsider.com/image/5421dfe76da811980d708165-640/image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_144.png", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-24T07:21:46+10:00"}, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "OECD Health At-A-Glance 2013OECD Health At-A-Glance 20133.\nHere are 11 charts that show in embarrassing detail some of the many shortcomings of our healthcare system.\nOECD Health At-A-Glance 20132.\nOECD Health At-A-Glance 20138.\nOECD Health At-A-Glance 20137."}
