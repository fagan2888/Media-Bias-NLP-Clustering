From bringing a character to life in a school play to observing a physics club experiment that shows off a student\u2019s potential, out-of-class activities help students see the world through a wider lens than in-class activities provide.\n\nThis semester, yearbook coordinators in high schools across the state are handing out activity forms to seniors. The forms are innocuous; they list every group, club, and sports team the school offers followed by grade levels. The students circle which activity they participated in and year they did so. As a teacher of seniors, this can be the most saddening few minutes of the year. Too many students have gone through their entire high school careers and not taken advantage of these opportunities. They turn their sheets back in blank.\n\nThere may be reasons why a student has not participated in any of the dozens and dozens of activities provided. Students could be tasked with taking on a job to help support his or her family, or they may be responsible for the after-school care of younger siblings. It may be a breakdown in communication between the activity sponsors, students, or family. Myriad reasons may lead to this reality. However, this situation should be unacceptable.\n\nHigh school needs to be a time of exploration. Be it seeing the real-world applications of what is learned in Key Club or through witnessing the work ethic of students in Speech and Debate, extracurricular programs provide an abundance of opportunities for all students. In addition, student\u2019s can gain a healthy contrast to their peer group, exposing them to different values and perspectives.\n\nStudents should have a choice of what they participate in. However, they should not have the choice to not participate at all.\n\nGraduation requirements need to include involvement in at least one out-of-class activity per year.\n\nSchools across Colorado are currently changing their curriculum to adjust to the Common Core, a set of national standards for all schools. The mission statement of the Common Core says it aims to allow our \u201ccommunities to be best positioned to compete in the global economy.\u201d These new standards, despite several hearings in the state legislature calling for their delay, will likely be in full force next year.\n\nAs a teacher, I seldom take a macro \u201cglobal economy\u201d view into consideration when designing lesson plans. Instead, I believe, the best lessons not only teach the value of the topic but also make them relevant to the student\u2019s lives. Extracurricular activities, by their nature, make what is learned in school more applicable to the student\u2019s lives. Students need to see that learning is not just a classroom expectation.\n\nThe Common Core asks educators to reconsider and re-evaluate what is taught in the classroom. Despite its opposition, this should be a healthy activity for all schools. By reconsidering what is expected of students outside of the classroom, the entire high school experience can be enhanced.\n\nBy mandating one extracurricular activity per student, per year students would gain experience; they could decide what interests them through involvement and reflection. Far too often students allow school to happen, with this requirement they are forced to become active participants.\n\nInstead of being limited to school-based activities, all options could be pursued. Mechanically inclined students could count an internship at an auto shop. Denver\u2019s English Speaking Union provides essay-writing contests and a Shakespearian acting competition, a great fit for students of the arts. The Denver Natural History Museum provides volunteer opportunities, allowing science-minded students to gain valuable experience. If a student believes that his current job is preparing him for life outside of school, he need only explain why to receive credit.\n\nRequiring students to take advantage of the opportunities that a high school education offers does not ask them to do much more work. Instead, the students would be asked to make their work more valuable.\n\nWe cannot allow our students to simply attend high school; they need to participate in high school.\n\nBrian Kurz (bpkurz51@gmail.com, @brianpkurz) is a father of two and a teacher in the Cherry Creek School District.
