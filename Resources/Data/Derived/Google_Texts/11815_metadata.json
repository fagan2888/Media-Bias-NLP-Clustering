Moore, special to CNN\n\n(CNN) - On my Christmas list of gifts to buy my evangelical friends, there's a little book of prayers.\n\nThis is less predictable than it may seem, since the prayers aren't from a celebrity evangelical preacher, but from a morbid, quirky Catholic who spent her short life with pet peacocks and wooden-leg-stealing Bible salesman stories.\n\nBut I think Flannery O'Connor's newly published \"Prayer Journal\" is exactly what Christians need, maybe especially at Christmas.\n\nThe book, recently discovered in the writer's papers in Georgia and now published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, reproduces the handwritten notebook prayers scribbled down by O'Connor during her years as a student at the University of Iowa.\n\nThe prayers are jarring because they are so personal and raw, clearly not written to \"edify the saints\" in a published manuscript. They are, well, just prayers.\n\nPart of the rawness and authenticity of the prayers come with the way O'Connor refuses to sentimentalize her personal relationship with Jesus (thought it's clear she has one). She is here constantly aware of her own fallenness and of the seeming silence of the God to whom she pours out these little notes.\n\nO'Connor notes that her attention is \"fugitive\" in prayer. She confesses that hell seems more \"feasible\" in her mind than heaven because, \"I can fancy the tortures of the damned but I cannot imagine the disembodied souls hanging in a crystal for all eternity praising God.\"\n\nShe is constantly second-guessing whether her prayers for success as a writer are egocentric, or a genuine striving to use the gifts God has given her.\n\nMoreover, O'Connor is constantly aware that she is a sinner, and she can't get around that. Perhaps the most widely publicized sentence in the book is her confession that she \"proved myself a glutton, for Scotch oatmeal cookies and erotic thought. There's nothing left to say of me.\"\n\nEven when she's confessing sin, she seems aware of her sinfulness in doing that. She says of sin, \"You can never finish eating it nor ever digest it. It has to be vomited,\" but, she immediately concludes, \"perhaps that is too literary a statement; this mustn't get insincere.\"\n\nO'Connor's prayers are hardly \"inspirational,\" in the sense that many American Christians want: a model of the \"victorious Christian life\" where \"prayer changes things\" and we've got \"joy, joy, joy, down in our hearts, to stay.\" That's why we need them.\n\nAmerican evangelicalism, my own tradition, rightly emphasizes the biblical truth that the gospel is good news, that our sins are forgiven in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. We rightly emphasize that the believer now has a personal connection to God, accessible in prayer through the priesthood of Jesus himself.\n\nBut sometimes we forget how hard that is in this time between the times.\n\nSome of our worship services are so clean and antiseptic, led by grinning preachers and praise bands, talking about how happy Jesus makes us, that we forget that the Spirit prompts us to \"groan\" at our sin and the suffering all around us (Romans 8:22-23). This is especially true at Christmas, with so many evangelicals forgoing the dark longing of Advent to go straight to the tinsel-decked rejoicing of Christmas.\n\nSome Christians, then, can wonder if something's wrong with them when they feel as though God seems distant, or when, despite all the smiles at church, they still feel guilty for the way their hearts don't seem to match up with their hymns.\n\nBut the good news isn't that we are all put together. The good news is that though we're wrecked and fallen and freakish, Jesus loves us anyway and has made peace for us with God and with each other. That's not something we always feel. We see it by faith.\n\nO'Connor, elsewhere in her letters, writes of what it means to agonize over one's sin, to wonder \"if your confessions have been adequate and if you are compounding sin on sin.\" She concludes that this agony \"drives some folks nuts and some folks to the Baptists,\" while noting, \"I feel sure that it will drive me nuts and not to the Baptists.\"\n\nThose of us who were \"driven to the Baptists\" can benefit from a book of prayers that remind us that the Christian life is exactly what Jesus promised it would be - the carrying of a cross.\n\nWe can be reminded in prayers such as these to remind ourselves that between now and resurrection we will never be, in ourselves, anything other than sinners. That's why we need a Christ.\n\nIt's only when we grapple with the darkness of a fallen cosmos, only when we're honest about the fact that all our efforts look more like Herod's throne than Bethlehem's stable, that we can sing \"Joy to the World.\" Flannery O'Connor wasn't an evangelical Protestant, but we need her.\n\nWe need her, especially perhaps, as we pray for peace on earth, goodwill to men, for Christmas in a Christ-haunted world.\n\nRussell D.
