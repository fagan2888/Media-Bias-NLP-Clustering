And depending on how many months \u201cearlier\u201d that actually was, the book would have already been out of date in terms of predicting who was going to lead the GOP nomination.\n\nDonald Trump is hardly mentioned at all until a long section tacked on at the end. In other words, Coppins \u2014 like most of us \u2014 did not see Trump\u2019s rise in 2015 from a sideshow to a real candidate. Of course, most Americans are still unconvinced that Trump is more than a fun sideshow.\n\nNot surprisingly then, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and even Mitt Romney received a lot of attention from Coppins, as he must have sensed that each of these men would play an important role in the 2015 buildup. Even Rand Paul, Bobby Jindal and Chris Christie got a fair bit of mention.\n\nAnd, quite frankly, Coppins knows that most readers enjoy reading something about Sarah Palin (mentioned on 11 pages); not so much for George Pataki (not mentioned at all).\n\nBut Pataki is not alone in being snubbed. Lindsey Graham, Jim Gilmore and \u2026 Ben Carson(!) also failed to make even a single appearance in Coppins\u2019 material.\n\nOK, so it\u2019s not strange to find analysts who never saw Carson as a legitimate candidate. But to leave him out of the book entirely, that seems like an editorial oversight. Coppins should have tossed the names of these men into the book somewhere \u2014 even if just to say, \u201cBen Carson never had a chance.\u201d At least then he would have been in the index.\n\nIn real life, Romney cut himself out of 2016 talk fairly early, but Bush and Rubio indeed have been considered \u201ctop-tier\u201d since even before they launched. Plus, Coppins was wise to invest a lot of material into Rubio\u2019s story anyhow, as the senator from Florida won\u2019t be going anywhere even if he doesn\u2019t win the nomination itself. Wait, actually he is going somewhere \u2014 leaving the Senate and all \u2014 a fact that raises the question about what he will do post-primaries if he is not the nominee.\n\nFinally, Coppins dealt with the story of Ted Cruz in a good amount of pages, though a close reading would not indicate that the author saw Cruz as having a viable chance. So, with a Monday morning quarterback\u2019s knowledge of Cruz\u2019s fundraising abilities, we are now able to say that, yes, he does have a strong chance of winning the nomination. Cruz launched his campaign at Liberty University, sending a strong message that Evangelicals should get on board with his candidacy. But since the kickoff, he has also worked hard to remind his non-evangelical tea partiers who their man should be. And, for good measure, he has spoken a lot about \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d on the campaign stump, emphasizing his goal of pulling in \u201ciron workers in Ohio\u201d and people who know something about hard work.\n\nIn summary, Coppins\u2019 book was all I hoped it would be: fun and full of previously unknown stories that shed light on these GOP hopefuls.\n\nAnd we can all agree with his book-opening thoughts on the importance of the November 2016 election for the future of our country:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Over the weekend, I enjoyed reading McKay Coppins' new book, \"The Wilderness: Deep Inside the Republican Party's Combative, Contentious, Chaotic Quest to Take Back the White House.\" Coppins, senior political writer at BuzzFeed News, serves up a dish of anecdotes and analyses that comes from interviewing a ton (300-plus, according to Coppins) of political insiders and operatives.", "Author": "W.
