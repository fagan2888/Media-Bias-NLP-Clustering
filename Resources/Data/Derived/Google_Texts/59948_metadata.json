With fewer savings and smaller (if any) pensions, there\u2019s an understanding that most retirements now involve some sort of work and a close eye on budgeting.\n\nPlanners say that even with that understanding, those 50+ consumers known in the industry as \u201cpre-retirees\u201d still make a number of assumptions about their own retirements that are unrealistic. Confronting those assumptions, and adjusting them now, will ensure you\u2019re more satisfied once you hit those golden years.\n\nHere are 7 ways that Americans are unrealistic about their retirement plans.\n\n1. You won\u2019t really work till you die. Since it\u2019s so hard to save enough for retirement, a growing number of pre-retirees plan to just keep on working. More than quarter of workers now say they are going to work past age 70, and 10 percent say they\u2019ll never retire, according to a recent study by the Employee Benefits Research Institute. But planners say that unexpected events, such as a change in your or your spouse\u2019s health or a company layoff often derail such plans. The median age for retirement in America is still 62, which\u2014despite worker plans--hasn\u2019t changed in more than 20 years.\n\n2. Downsizing is easier said than done. Lots of pre-retirees plan on trading in the family home for a condo or apartment and living off of the additional equity. That\u2019 a great plan, but in many cases, the savings don\u2019t pan out. Retirees tend to sell their older homes for newer apartments with more modern amenities\u2014such units tend to cost more, which eats away at the potential savings.\n\nRelated: The Worst States For Retirement in 2015\n\nMore than half of pre-retirees don\u2019t end up downsizing with their final move, according to a recent report by Merrill Lynch, and 3 in 10 actually buy a larger home. If you really want to cut down on your living costs, consider moving to a cheaper location, where you can get a bigger or newer home for a lower price.\n\n3. You haven\u2019t saved enough for healthcare. Average out-of-pocket recurring medical expenses for retirees are around $1,855 per year, not including hospital stays or nursing home care, according to EBRI. Factoring in inflation, and that non-recurring expenses tend to increase with age, that amounts to some $40,000 per year for a 30-year retirement.\n\nA typical couple would need nearly $250,000 on hand to have a 90 percent chance of covering all their medical expenses in retirement. If you don\u2019t have that kind of cash set aside, be prepared to cut back on other lifestyle expenses in order to cover those growing bills.

Social Security isn\u2019t going to be much help. More than a third of Americans who haven\u2019t reached retirement age think that Social Security will be a major source of income in their post-work years despite the government program\u2019s ongoing funding problems, according to a recent Gallup poll. Currently Social Security provides an average benefit of about $1,260 per month, which is already not enough for most people to live on. If funding problems persist, those checks could shrink or kick in at a later age. \u201cFor most people, relying on Social Security just isn\u2019t going to get it done,\u201d says certified financial planner David Jackson.\n\nThe longer you wait to claim benefits, the higher your payment will be. Continuing to delay collecting Social Security after your full retirement age will net you 8 percent more a year.\n\n5. You\u2019re going to live longer than you expect. If you\u2019re not planning for at least a 30-year retirement, you may run out of money. Men who make it to age 65 have an average life expectancy of 86.6 years, and 65-year-old women will live until an average of 88.8 years, according to the Society of Actuaries. That means that there\u2019s a reasonable chance you\u2019ll live longer than that, especially if you\u2019re in good health and have a family history of longevity. \u201cWhat happens when you live to be 105 but run out of money at 97,\u201d asks Katie Libbe, Allianz Life vice president of consumer insights.\n\nRelated: 5 Things No One Ever Tells You about Retirement\n\n6. It\u2019s really hard to cut off your kids. Whether they\u2019re victims of a tough economy or they\u2019re just old-fashioned mooches, it\u2019s increasingly common for adults to rely on financial assistance from their parents well into their 20s and 30s. Part of the problem, planners say, is that Boomers just can\u2019t say \u201cno,\u201d even when it puts their own retirement security at risk. \u201cSometimes parents forget that they need to put themselves first,\u201d says Kathleen Hastings, a certified financial planner with FBB Capital Partners in Bethesda, Md.\n\nBaby boomers with financially independent adult children are more than twice as likely to be retired than peers who are still footing their kids\u2019 bills, according to financial research firm Hearts & Wallets.\n\n7. You\u2019re underestimating inflation. Even if you\u2019re accurately underestimating your costs in retirement, it\u2019s difficult for many pre-retirees to accurately gauge the impact inflation will have on those expenses. At an average 3 percent rate, your costs will double every 10 years. Failing to factor that into your savings can have a disastrous impact on your ability to maintain your lifestyle. \u201cYou don\u2019t notice inflation year-over-year, but it will build up over a 20-year retirement,\u201d says James Nichols, head of retirement income and advice strategy for retirement solutions at Voya Financial.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Most Americans have long ago come to the conclusion that retirement isn\u2019t going to be", "title": "7 Common Myths that Can Ruin Your Retirement", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/14/7-Common-Myths-Can-Ruin-Your-Retirement", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07232012_retiredcouple_abroad_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/14/7-Common-Myths-Can-Ruin-Your-Retirement", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07232012_retiredcouple_abroad_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@bethbrav"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Most Americans have long ago come to the conclusion that retirement isn\u2019t going to be", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Continuing to delay collecting Social Security after your full retirement age will net you 8 percent more a year.\n\u201cFor most people, relying on Social Security just isn\u2019t going to get it done,\u201d says certified financial planner David Jackson.\nPart of the problem, planners say, is that Boomers just can\u2019t say \u201cno,\u201d even when it puts their own retirement security at risk.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t notice inflation year-over-year, but it will build up over a 20-year retirement,\u201d says James Nichols, head of retirement income and advice strategy for retirement solutions at Voya Financial.\nThe median age for retirement in America is still 62, which\u2014despite worker plans--hasn\u2019t changed in more than 20 years."}
