In a very technical sense, the repeal measure is advancing one step farther now, since Republicans will use a reconciliation bill to overcome a filibuster, meaning the bill will be killed by a presidential veto rather than die in the Senate. The bigger picture is that the anti-Obamacare cause has never been in worse shape. The policy rationale for repealing the Affordable Care Act continues to disintegrate, while the political conditions to replace it with an alternative have collapsed entirely.\n\nIt is and always has been true that those who oppose the Affordable Care Act on principle \u2014 they philosophically disagree that government has a proper role regulating the insurance market and subsidizing access to health care through taxes and spending \u2014 have no reason to support it. But conservatives have never been willing to lean on the ideological case against the law. Instead, they have insisted fervently that the law will fail, (or is failing, or is about to fail) on its own terms. They have refused to give up this claim even in the face of an ever-higher mountain of evidence.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial page, touting the House\u2019s latest repeal vote, wanly insists that Obamacare really is failing, just as they have always said. \u201cLiberal spin can\u2019t disguise that the law is failing on every level other than expanding coverage \u2014 as if anyone ever argued that a new entitlement couldn\u2019t reduce the uninsured rate.\u201d First of all, the notion that the law is failing on its non-coverage goals is false. Aside from expanding coverage, Obamacare set out to finance the cost of coverage expansion with taxes and spending cuts, and hold down the long-term rise in the cost of of medical care. On all these measures, it is clearly succeeding. Health-insurance premiums remain far below initial forecasts, and the law is expected to cost the federal government more than $100 billion less than initially projected. National health-care spending is rising at its slowest rate in five decades. Just this week, two new studies confirm the law\u2019s success. One of them finds that people in states that participated in the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion enjoyed increased access to medical care and lower medical bills, confounding skeptics who claimed Medicaid would not help its beneficiaries. Another concludes that employers have not shunted their workers into part-time employment to skirt the law\u2019s coverage requirement, confounding another frequent prediction from critics. (The Journal itself insisted over and over and over again that this was happening.)\n\nMost amusing is the Journal\u2019s insistence that Obamacare\u2019s massive, historic reduction in the uninsured rate doesn\u2019t really count as a success since nobody doubted it would pull it off. In fact, lots and lots of conservatives insisted exactly this. Especially in the early days of the law\u2019s struggles, when conservatives proclaimed Obamacare a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d that would \u201ccollapse of its own weight,\u201d right-wing media was filled with stories projecting that it would throw more people off their insurance than would gain it. \u201cTop Health Economist Predicts Obamacare Will Ultimately Boost Number of Uninsured,\u201d blared a not-atypical 2014 headline in the Daily Caller. Obamacare, predicted Rand Paul, \u201cwill lead to less people having an insurance as they find out the insurance is so much more expensive than their current plan.\u201d The most esteemed conservative intellectuals endorsed this prediction. \u201cAt the end of the day, for all of the rhetoric and promises about what Obamacare would achieve, the health law\u2019s most ardent supporters have stuck to their guns because of one thing: coverage expansion,\u201d wrote Avik Roy, now an adviser to the Rubio campaign. But new data suggests that Obamacare may fail even to achieve this goal. Instead of expanding coverage to those without it, Obamacare is replacing the preexisting market for private insurance.\u201d Charles Krauthammer insisted it would result in \u201cessentially the same number of uninsured.\u201d\n\nThe Journal itself predicted in 2013 that \u201cThe insurance terminations and rollout fiasco could leave more people uninsured in 2014 than in 2013,\u201d which was wildly wrong. The next year, it gloated, \u201cThe predicted \u2018surge\u2019 of young beneficiaries [signing up for insurance in the exchanges] isn't materializing even as the end-of-March deadline approaches,\u201d which also turned out to be completely wrong. Today\u2019s Journal argument that reducing the uninsured rate among non-elderly Americans almost by half doesn\u2019t count as success because only a complete idiot doubted this would happen really ought to mention that the Journal itself sided with the complete idiots.\n\nObamacare\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d is a theological premise on the right, but events have continued to test the faith of the adherents. They need to supply specific policy failures in the law to justify the repeal crusade, but they cannot devise any solutions to problems that don't actually exist. They are left with their circular conviction that Obamacare is evil because it is Obamacare.\n\nPhoto: Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nIn Kentucky, newly elected governor Matt Bevin ran promising to destroy the hated law, which is working well in his state and demonstrably improving the health of its citizenry. Faced with a conflict between his ideology and reality, Bevin has chosen a bizarre compromise. He is turning the operations of Kynect, the popular, state-run insurance exchange, over to the federal government. And he is promising to put his state\u2019s government in charge of the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion. The background here is that Obamacare is designed to cover the poorest uninsured citizens by expanding Medicaid, a federal program, while offering coverage to more affluent people through state-run exchanges. Bevin is simply inverting that design out of sheer spite. Obamacare wants a federal program for the poor and a state program for the middle class? Well, then, he\u2019ll insist on putting his state in charge of the program for the poor and making the federal government run the program for the middle class!\n\nThere is no ideological reason why a Republican would prefer to federalize one of those programs but not the other. It is simply a demonstration of spite, allowing Bevin to posture against the law without having to live with the costs of actually forgoing its benefits. Kentucky is a vision of Obamacare repeal-and-replace in action \u2014 a body lurching forward and thrashing about after its head has been cut off.\n\n\n\nThe same trap awaits Republicans elsewhere. The House repeal vote, like every previous repeal vote, contained no alternative except the restoration of the cruel, bloated, dysfunctional system that predated the Affordable Care Act. As they have done since the health-care debate began in Congress nearly seven years ago, Republicans promise they will coalesce around a partywide alternative any day now.\n\nRepublicans understand that the status quo ante is too unpopular for them to formally endorse. On the other hand, actually voting for a single plan for which all Republicans can be held accountable \u2014 as opposed to a variety of half-written plans that they can gesture to as evidence that plans exist, without having to own the details \u2014 is political kryptonite. The GOP\u2019s best and only asset in the health-care fight is dissatisfaction with the status quo. But any Republican plan would disrupt the status quo more than Obamacare did.\n\nThe biggest single impediment facing Republicans in devising their replacement is finding a funding source. Every plan conservative policy entrepreneurs have devised has arrived at the same solution: Eliminate the tax deductibility of employer-sponsored insurance. Conceptually, this makes a great deal of sense. Economists agree that the deduction distorts employer decisions: It lets employers give their workers insurance tax-free, but taxes their wages, thereby encouraging them to spend more on insurance and less on wages. Obamacare actually took a step in the direction of curtailing this break by cutting off the deduction only for the most expensive health-insurance plans. This measure came to be known as the \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d for its limited focus on the costliest (i.e., Cadillac-like) plans.\n\nThat feature has perhaps proven to be the law\u2019s most unpopular element. It is so unpopular that Republican opponents in Congress have been joined by numerous Democrats in Congress, as well as the three Democratic presidential candidates, to denounce it. It has become hard to imagine how the Cadillac tax can survive.\n\nWhile the law has several other intact cost-control elements, this is a setback for Obamacare. It is far worse for the Republican proposals. The backlash against curtailing the tax deduction for employer-provided health insurance, while a painful cut for Obamacare, is a lethal wound for the prospects of replacing it. If scaling back the tax break for the most expensive insurance plans is too unpopular for Congress, then the full-scale elimination contemplated by conservative health-care experts is totally unthinkable.\n\nThe Journal acknowledged this dilemma several months ago. \u201cGOP reformers also recognize that the Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health plans is a heat shield that might let them solve some of the problems of the pre-2010 health finance status quo,\u201d noted an October editorial. \u201cSubstituting a cap on the tax-code subsidy that helps drive medical inflation is more politically plausible with the Cadillac tax in place than without.\u201d This is one thing \u2014 perhaps the only thing \u2014 the Obamacare-haters got right. The project of designing a conservative Obamacare replacement hinges on expanding the feature of Obamacare that is plunging into the political abyss.\n\nRepublican opposition to Obamacare works if and only if the party can identify itself as favoring some unstated alternative. Having an actual alternative, which would impose pain on identifiable constituencies, is politically worse than having nothing. The party has relentlessly paired its opposition to Obamacare with pledges to start fresh on an alternative. But what do you call it when government officials spend more than a half-dozen years promising something is just around the corner, and failing to deliver? You\u2019d call it exactly the kind of bureaucratic catastrophe they have falsely characterized Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "The Republican effort to repeal and replace health-care reform is a massive bureaucratic failure.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "The Republican effort to repeal and replace health-care reform is a massive bureaucratic failure.", "title": "Obamacare Repeal Is a Train Wreck", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/01/obamacare-repeal-is-a-trainwreck.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/01/07/07-obamacare.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Republican effort to repeal and replace health-care reform is a massive bureaucratic failure.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/01/07/07-obamacare.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Obamacare Repeal Is a Train Wreck", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, obamacare, wall street journal editorial page follies", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,obamacare,wall street journal editorial page follies", "published_time": "2016-01-07T13:33:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, obamacare, wall street journal editorial page follies", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf18c\"", "article_summary": "Aside from expanding coverage, Obamacare set out to finance the cost of coverage expansion with taxes and spending cuts, and hold down the long-term rise in the cost of of medical care.\nAnother concludes that employers have not shunted their workers into part-time employment to skirt the law\u2019s coverage requirement, confounding another frequent prediction from critics.\nThe project of designing a conservative Obamacare replacement hinges on expanding the feature of Obamacare that is plunging into the political abyss.\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial page, touting the House\u2019s latest repeal vote, wanly insists that Obamacare really is failing, just as they have always said.\n\u201cTop Health Economist Predicts Obamacare Will Ultimately Boost Number of Uninsured,\u201d blared a not-atypical 2014 headline in the Daily Caller."}
