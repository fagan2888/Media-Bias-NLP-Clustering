Planned Parenthood of Northern New England has agreed to pay a $30,000 penalty to settle a complaint filed by group known as Let Vermont Vote. The group said Planned Parenthood failed to register its Action Fund as a political action committee and file contribution reports. The complaint also said the PAC had accepted contributions bigger than the $2,000 per donor limit.\n\nThis story gets more interesting, as diligent blogger Jill Stanek notes, because this Planned Parenthood is supposed to be one of those super trustworthy Obamacare \u201cnavigators\u201d:\n\nIn August 2012 Planned Parenthood of Northern New England was one of three Planned Parenthoods to whom HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius awarded grants to serve as Obamacare \u201dnavigators\u201d to help people enroll in Obamacare.
