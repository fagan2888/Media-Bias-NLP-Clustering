Two new local foundations received thousands of dollars Saturday night. The money will allow these foundations to help others in need.

Saturday was the first annual Medical Equipment 4U and Back-Pak Outreach Gala at the Panama City Women's Club.

Medical Equipment 4U provides medical equipment for uninsured people and Back-Pak Outreach works with the Anchorage Children's Home to provide backpacks for homeless children.

Donations for the event came from sponsors and a silent auction.

"We want a place that we can take a child off the street to a safe environment for him or her and then be able to redirect them. And education, I'm very, very strong on making sure that they get educated," said Sue Watson, founder of Medical Equipment 4U and Back-Pak Outreach.
