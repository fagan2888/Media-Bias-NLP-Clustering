The second point means that a certain cultural restraint about trafficking in blasphemy is perfectly compatible with liberal norms, and that there\u2019s nothing illiberal about questioning the wisdom or propriety or decency of cartoons or articles or anything else that takes a crude or bigoted swing at something that a portion of the population holds sacred. Such questioning can certainly shade into illiberal territory \u2014 and does, all-too-frequently \u2014 depending on exactly how much pressure is exerted and how elastic the definition of \u201coffensiveness\u201d becomes. But our basic liberties are not necessarily endangered when, say, the Anti-Defamation League criticizes Mel Gibson\u2019s portrayal of the Sanhedrin in \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d or the Catholic League denounces art exhibits in the style of \u201cPiss Christ,\u201d any more than they\u2019re endangered by the absence of grotesque caricatures of Moses or the Virgin Mary from the pages of the Washington Post and New York Times. Liberty requires accepting the freedom to offend, yes, but it also allows people, institutions and communities to both call for and exercise restraint.\n\nIn this sense I disagree slightly with Jonathan Chait\u2019s formulation today that \u201cone cannot defend the right [to blaspheme] without defending the practice.\u201d If I devoted my next blog post to a scabrous, profanity-laced satire of the Buddha, I would not expect Chait or anyone else to immediately leap to my defense if the Times decided to delete the post and dismiss me from its ranks of columnists. If I ran a reactionary website that devoted itself to recycling pre-modern calumnies against Jewish law and ritual, my rights as an American would not be traduced if people picketed my offices and other journalists told me I had a moral obligation to desist. And similarly, in a cultural and political vacuum, it would be okay to think that some of the images (anti-Islamic and otherwise) that Charlie Hebdo regularly published, especially those chosen entirely for their shock value, contributed little enough to public discussion that the world would not suffer from their absence.\n\nBut we are not in a vacuum. We are in a situation where my third point applies, because the kind of blasphemy that Charlie Hebdo engaged in had deadly consequences, as everyone knew it could \u2026 and that kind of blasphemy is precisely the kind that needs to be defended, because it\u2019s the kind that clearly serves a free society\u2019s greater good. If a large enough group of someones is willing to kill you for saying something, then it\u2019s something that almost certainly needs to be said, because otherwise the violent have veto power over liberal civilization, and when that scenario obtains it isn\u2019t really a liberal civilization any more. Again, liberalism doesn\u2019t depend on everyone offending everyone else all the time, and it\u2019s okay to prefer a society where offense for its own sake is limited rather than pervasive. But when offenses are policed by murder, that\u2019s when we need more of them, not less, because the murderers cannot be allowed for a single moment to think that their strategy can succeed.\n\nIn this sense, many of the Western voices criticizing the editors of Hebdo have had things exactly backward: Whether it\u2019s the Obama White House or Time Magazine in the past or the Financial Times and (God help us) the Catholic League today, they\u2019ve criticized the paper for provoking violence by being needlessly offensive and \u201cinflammatory\u201d (Jay Carney\u2019s phrase), when the reality is that it\u2019s precisely the violence that justifies the inflammatory content. In a different context, a context where the cartoons and other provocations only inspired angry press releases and furious blog comments, I might sympathize with the FT\u2019s Tony Barber when he writes that publications like Hebdo \u201cpurport to strike a blow for freedom when they provoke Muslims, but are actually just being stupid.\u201d (If all you have to fear is a religious group\u2019s fax machine, what you\u2019re doing might not be as truth-to-power-ish as you think.) But if publishing something might get you slaughtered and you publish it anyway, by definition you are striking a blow for freedom, and that\u2019s precisely the context when you need your fellow citizens to set aside their squeamishness and rise to your defense.\n\nWhereas far too often in the West today the situation is basically reversed: People will invoke free speech to justify just about any kind of offense or provocation or simple exploitation (\u201cif we don\u2019t go full-frontal seven times on \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 tonight, man, the First Amendment dies\u201d), and then scurry for cover as soon as there\u2019s a whiff of actual danger, a hint that \u201cbold\u201d envelope-pushing might require actual bravery after all.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that the late Christopher Hitchens had a more positive view of blasphemy than the one I\u2019ve sketched above, and a more capacious view of the situations in which it\u2019s worth praising and defending. But on this point I\u2019m in complete agreement with these words of his, from a 2006 column that\u2019s made the rounds today:\n\nWhen Salman Rushdie published The Satanic Verses in 1988, he did so in the hope of forwarding a discussion that was already opening in the Muslim world, between extreme Quranic literalists and those who hoped that the text could be interpreted. We know what his own reward was, and we sometimes forget that the fatwa was directed not just against him but against \u201call those involved in its publication,\u201d which led to the murder of the book\u2019s Japanese translator and the near-deaths of another translator and one publisher. I went on Crossfire at one point, to debate some spokesman for outraged faith, and said that we on our side would happily debate the propriety of using holy writ for literary and artistic purposes. But that we would not exchange a word until the person on the other side of the podium had put away his gun.\n\nThe emphasis is my own, because that\u2019s the crucial point. Must all deliberate offense-giving, in any context, be celebrated, honored, praised? I think not. But in the presence of the gun \u2014 or, as in the darker chapters of my own faith\u2019s history, the rack or the stake \u2014 both liberalism and liberty require that it be welcomed and defended.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150107160043, "BN": "douthat", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/douthat", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/douthat/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 7, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1420664443, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/rossdouthat/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-01-09T03:19:48-05:00"}, "keywords": "Earnest Josh,Hitchens Christopher,Cartoons and Cartoonists,Comedy and Humor,Freedom of Speech and Expression,Freedom of the Press,Hate Crimes,Anti-Defamation League,Catholic League,Charlie Hebdo,Roman Catholic Church,France,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/douthat/The Blasphemy We Need ( 20150107 )", "description": "On Charlie Hebdo, and why offenses that provoke violence are the ones most worth defending.", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "douthat", "sourceApp": "blogs", "per": "Earnest, Josh;Hitchens, Christopher", "twitter": {"description": "On Charlie Hebdo, and why offenses that provoke violence are the ones most worth defending.", "title": "The Blasphemy We Need", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/the-blasphemy-we-need/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@DouthatNYT", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003435783, "news_keywords": "Anti Defamation League,Cartoons,Catholic Church,Catholic League,Charlie Hebdo,Christopher Hitchens,France,Freedom of speech,Freedom of the press,Hate crime,Josh Earnest", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 7, 2015", "org": "Anti-Defamation League;Catholic League;Charlie Hebdo;Roman Catholic Church", "geo": "France", "utime": 20150109031948, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150107, "pdate": 20150107, "des": "Cartoons and Cartoonists;Comedy and Humor;Freedom of Speech and Expression;Freedom of the Press;Hate Crimes", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Ross Douthat", "description": "On Charlie Hebdo, and why offenses that provoke violence are the ones most worth defending.", "title": "The Blasphemy We Need", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/the-blasphemy-we-need/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/the-blasphemy-we-need/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Blasphemy We Need", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb428\"", "article_summary": "The first point means that laws against blasphemy (usually described these days as \u201crestrictions on hate speech\u201d) are inherently illiberal.\nIn the wake of the vicious murders at the offices of the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo today, let me offer three tentative premises about blasphemy in a free society.\nWe are in a situation where my third point applies, because the kind of blasphemy that Charlie Hebdo engaged in had deadly consequences, as everyone knew it could \u2026 and that kind of blasphemy is precisely the kind that needs to be defended, because it\u2019s the kind that clearly serves a free society\u2019s greater good.\nBut when offenses are policed by murder, that\u2019s when we need more of them, not less, because the murderers cannot be allowed for a single moment to think that their strategy can succeed.\n1) The right to blaspheme (and otherwise give offense) is essential to the liberal order."}
