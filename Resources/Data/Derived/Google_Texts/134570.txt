During a discussion Thursday on ABC’s “The View,” host Barbara Walters bemoaned the fact that most politicians use a Bible when taking the oath of office.

The ladies on the program where discussing a new political ad by U.S. Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., who is up for reelection next year and is feeling the heat for his support of Obamacare.

In the ad, Pryor is pictured holding a Bible as he declares his belief in God — it’s only “Bible-thumping” when a conservative does it.

“The basic tenet in America is the separation,” Walters offered. “And it’s very important. And it’s very important, the separation of church and state.”

Secular progressives continue to perpetuate the myth behind the separation of church and state, manipulating the expression to push a political agenda, and Walters proved she was up to the task.

When cohost Jane Seymour said “it’s really unfortunate when you have to bring religion into politics,” Walters replied:

“That is very true but it starts almost with the oath of office which usually ends with “so help me God. “Now, most presidents swear on a Bible before taking office, even though we have the separation between church and state. You see it again and again. You don’t have to use a Bible.”

“We talk about the separation between church and state and almost every president ends up saying so help me God,” Walters further grumbled.

Walters fails to mention that the words “separation”, “church” and “state” do not appear in the First Amendment, or that when Thomas Jefferson first referenced the expression in a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association of Connecticut, the wall he spoke of was to protect the church from the state.

Perhaps Walters, 83, should move up that retirement date.
