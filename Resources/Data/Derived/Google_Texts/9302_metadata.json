For most consumers, the exchange said, it could verify citizenship or immigration status electronically with a federal data hub.\n\nHowever, Peter Lee, the exchange's executive director, said Thursday that about 100,000 people must still submit proof of eligibility or risk losing coverage in October. He estimates that most of the people affected are legal residents.\n\nPeople living in the U.S. illegally aren't eligible for health law coverage. The issue is particularly acute in California, which has a large immigrant population.\n\nLast week, U.S. officials said the federal exchange serving 36 other states had more than 300,000 people who had not documented their citizenship or residency and risk losing coverage.\n\nLee said Covered California has been trying to clear up these inconsistencies and has already processed 600,000 documents to prove eligibility. The state will start sending notices to affected consumers early next month and follow up with more communication.\n\n\"If individuals are not able to provide that proof by late September or October, we will have to terminate their coverage,\" Lee said at an exchange board meeting Thursday. \"This is not something we want to do.\"\n\nConsumer advocates emphasized the need to communicate clearly in the government notices and offer information in many languages.\n\n\"We need to make sure those notices go out in clear language,\" said Carla Saporta, health policy director at the Greenlining Institute, a nonprofit group.\n\nLee said he welcomed outside input to avoid potential confusion. He attributed much of the problem to paperwork issues, not evidence of fraud.\n\n\"We are quite confident where people have not provided information it's not because they are not citizens,\" Lee said. \"Rather, it's a challenge of getting the information to us.\"\n\nThe need to resolve these paperwork issues has led the exchange to pull service center workers away from taking customer calls. As a result, the exchange reported, call center performance has suffered.\n\nIn July, the state said, only 38% of calls were answered within 30 seconds, well short of the state's 80% goal. Nearly a third of callers abandoned their calls, according to exchange data. Long wait times have been a persistent problem for Covered California.\n\nThe top query at the call center came from people asking about the status of their application for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program for lower-income residents. California is still sorting through about 400,000 Medi-Cal applications.\n\nEnrollment in Medi-Cal is open year round. The next enrollment window for individual health insurance starts Nov. 15.\n\nchad.terhune@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Without proof of citizenship, residency, 100,000 could lose Obamacare", "date": "2014-08-21", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "About 100,000 Californians who haven't yet proved their citizenship or legal residency in the U.S. face losing their Obamacare coverage in October, state officials said.", "title": "Without proof of citizenship, residency, 100,000 could lose Obamacare", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-obamacare-citizen-proof-20140822-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53f696a6/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-citizen-proof-20140822", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "healthcare, Obamacare, Covered California, citizenship, legal residency", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81147781", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "healthcare, Obamacare, Covered California, citizenship, legal residency", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "About 100,000 Californians who haven't yet proved their citizenship or legal residency in the U.S. face losing their Obamacare coverage in October, state officials said.
