Sara. Nel, CC BY 2.0\n\nWe all carry stress at one point or another. The feeling of being overwhelmed with responsibilities, to the point where our central nervous system begins to turn on us, is simply a part of life. Now new research suggests men and women tend to respond in markedly different ways.\n\nScientists from several international universities found that men under stress generally respond by becoming more withdrawn and acting more as an individual. Women, on the other hand, become prosocial. They share their stress with others, hoping to elicit empathy, and expect to be relied on when other members in their group are stressed, too. Where men become more self-centered, thinking their emotions are universally shared, women often become more compassionate, the team argues.\n\n\"There's a subtle boundary between the ability to identify with others and take on their perspective \u2014 and therefore be empathic \u2014 and the inability to distinguish between self and other, thus acting egocentrically,\u201d explained researcher Giorgia Silani, according to Science Daily.\n\nConsider the husband who comes home from work short-tempered and unhappy. He notices the house is a mess \u2014 the final push over the edge. Quietly, he picks dirty clothes up off the floor, stewing all the while, and freezing his wife out of conversation. To his mind, he\u2019s being prosocial: He\u2019s making the family\u2019s house more presentable. But to his wife, he\u2019s withdrawing, holed up inside his own head.\n\nStress, in this case, drives a wedge between the husband and wife. Both people recognized the stress that was present, but reacted in two different ways. As the researchers point out, people either manage stress by reducing the internal load of \u201cextra\u201d resources, or they seek support from external resources. But that\u2019s not what the team initially expected to find.\n\n\"Our starting hypothesis was that stressed individuals tend to become more egocentric,\u201d said co-author Claus Lamm, from the University of Vienna. \u201cTaking a self-centered perspective in fact reduces the emotional/cognitive load. We therefore expected that in the experimental conditions people would be less empathic.\"\n\nWhat they found, however, was that only males tended toward this behavior. When given tests that put them under motor, emotional, and cognitive stress \u2014 each test designed to make subjects mimic other people \u2014 women\u2019s performance soared, while men\u2019s suffered. The researchers considered several factors for this difference.\n\nComparisons of men and women as they relate to behavioral or emotional responses tend to get lost in the spectrum of learned behavior and that which is \u201chard-wired.\u201d Late last year, scientists created a map of men and women\u2019s neural circuitry, illuminating in full color just how different the two sexes are wired. The scans surprised scientists in how much they upheld stereotypes, such as men excelling in spatial reasoning and technical work and women in socializing and multitasking. Whether these skill sets arise from some evolutionary advantage, or a social machine that favors the stereotypes, is another issue: The observed differences are the same.\n\nThere\u2019s also the chemical theory, which recruits hormones to influence behavior. \u201cAt a physiological level, the gender difference might be accounted for by the oxytocin system,\u201d said Silani. \u201cOxytocin is a hormone connected with social behaviors, and [previous research] found that in conditions of stress women had higher physiological levels of oxytocin than men.\"\n\nOther research suggests that when stress reaches too high a threshold, all humans tap into their need to become social. A 2000 study points toward a more primitive model of understanding why men become solitary while women seek solidarity.\n\n\"Perhaps these gender differences are adaptive with acute stressors,\" said University of California Santa Barbara psychologist, Nancy Collins, in a statement. \"But when you think of longer term stressors, such as hunger, it doesn't make sense to have these gender differences. Men and women need social networks to work it out.\"\n\nSource: Tomova L, von Dawans B, Heinrichs M, Silani G, Lamm C. Is stress affecting our ability to tune into others?
