That business acuity, says Oberweis, is his strongest asset.\n\n\u201cWhat this campaign is about is how to get the economy moving and growing faster,\u201d he says.\n\nAt their first debate and throughout the campaign Oberweis has called his opponent Dick Durbin a 32 year veteran who is out of touch with everyday people and in touch with Washington.\n\nBut Oberweis is no stranger to politics.\n\nTwo years ago he won the Illinois Senate seat for the 25th District. It was his 6th attempt to win office. Since 2002, Oberweis has tried but lost races for U.S. Senator, Congressman and Governor.\n\nHe has learned to tap into support beyond his traditional republican roots and into the African American community. It\u2019s raised a lot of eyebrows but Oberweis says he\u2019s gotten the endorsements of a dozen African American pastors on the South Side because, he says, he shares their priority: Getting jobs.\n\nHere is where he stands on some key issues. With ISIS, the U.S. should not rule out ground troops. On minimum wage, Oberweis supports a hike only for adults 26 years or older. those no longer covered by parents under ObamaCare. Oberweis is against same sex marriage but won`t fight laws which support it. On immigration, he supports the Dream Act but is against amnesty for all undocumented people.\n\nAt the debate, Durbin accused Oberweis of being the Tea Party candidate, something Oberweis vehemently denies. He\u2019s confident about support downstate, but the battle elsewhere, is the key.\n\n\u201cI don`t think we have to win in Chicago. I think if we get 25 percent in Chicago, if we do that, I\u2019ll be your next U.S. Senator.\u201d\n\nOberweis is a multi-millionaire who has contributed close to $2 million dollars of his own money in the U.S. Senate race.\n\nThe election is Nov 4.", "article_metadata": {"description": "68-year-old Jim Oberweis is a state senator, a millionaire businessman and grandfather to 19.
