The forever-young Minneapolis Institute of Arts is turning 100, having opened with a trumpet flourish and speeches on Jan. 7, 1915. Instead of trumpets and talk, the modern MIA is touting special brunches (Jan. 1-4, $20 adults), a free display of glorious art-inspired cakes from eight local bakeries, pop-up performances by the Twin Cities Gay Men\u2019s Chorus and theater troupe Savage Umbrella, birthday-themed gallery tours, discounts at the shop, do-it-yourself New Year\u2019s resolution fun and a surprise exhibition of all-American treasures. Like this charming 1887 \u201cBirthday Party\u201d painting by John Singer Sargent that\u2019s part of the MIA collection (but currently on loan), the four-day festivities are a sweet beginning to a year of celebrations. So grab a party hat and join the fun. (10 a.m.-9 p.m. Thu., 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Fri.-Sat., 11 a.m.-5 p.m. next Sun. Free unless noted. 2400 3rd Av. S., Mpls. 612-870-3000, www.artsmia.org)\n\nMary Abbe", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The forever-young Minneapolis Institute of Arts is turning 100, having opened with a trumpet flourish and speeches on Jan. 7, 1915.", "title": "Art spotlight: Minneapolis Institute of Arts kicks off 100th birthday year", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/art-spotlight-minneapolis-institute-of-arts-kicks-off-100th-birthday-year/286799191/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141945657386390.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141945657386390.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The forever-young Minneapolis Institute of Arts is turning 100, having opened with a trumpet flourish and speeches on Jan. 7, 1915.", "title": "Art spotlight: Minneapolis Institute of Arts kicks off 100th birthday year", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/art-spotlight-minneapolis-institute-of-arts-kicks-off-100th-birthday-year/286799191/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141945657386390.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141945657386390.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The forever-young Minneapolis Institute of Arts is turning 100, having opened with a trumpet flourish and speeches on Jan. 7, 1915."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e1b\"", "article_summary": "The forever-young Minneapolis Institute of Arts is turning 100, having opened with a trumpet flourish and speeches on Jan. 7, 1915.\nFree unless noted.\nMIA\u2019s 100th birthdayThursday-next Sunday: Yep.\nSo grab a party hat and join the fun.\nLike this charming 1887 \u201cBirthday Party\u201d painting by John Singer Sargent that\u2019s part of the MIA collection (but currently on loan), the four-day festivities are a sweet beginning to a year of celebrations."}
