(Photo: Submitted)\n\nAcadia Healthcare's stock outperformed over the last year other Nashville-area companies in a local exchange-traded fund called NASH.\n\nThe ETF \u2014 a fund that is open to people who want to invest on the New York Stock Exchange \u2014 is dominated by health care companies.\n\nAcadia provides patient behavioral health and addiction dependency care for children, teens and adults of all ages. The Franklin-based company topped the list for performance in the ETF's second year. Nashville based hospital operator HCA is the top performer over the fund's life.\n\nThe 10-year-old company has transformed since 2010.\n\nOver a four year stretch Acadia nearly quintupled its revenue, going from $333 million in 2011 to $1.67 billion in 2014. Its portfolio grew from 29 to 208 facilities in the same period.\n\nSeveral factors, including increased awareness about mental health care and addiction recovery, legislative support and better access to care, are combining to make the next few years a time of opportunity in the industry, said Brent Turner, president.\n\n\"These all support patients' access to patients,\" Turner said. \"If there\u2019s a need out in the communities we want to be there to fill it.\u201d\n\nThe in-patient behavioral health hospital market is projected to grow to $18.4 billion by 2020 from about $15.9 billion in 2014, according to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a department of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAbout 2.4 million people were opioid dependent in 2013, according to the federal report. The majority, 79 percent, were painkiller dependent; just over a fifth were heroin dependent. Tennessee has one of the highest rates of painkiller prescriptions in the country.\n\nOver the last decade federal reforms \u2013 particularly the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 and the Affordable Care Act \u2014have improved access to mental health care.\n\nThe 2008 law prohibits employers and health insurance companies from putting stricter limits on mental health care than other conditions. The ACA has helped millions of people across the country get insurance.\n\nJoey Jacobs, chairman and CEO, has been at the helm since February 2011, the year Acadia started its fast-track growth.\n\nTurner, who also joined in the same month as Jacobs, said the company\u2019s success is a result of the people in the executive suite in Franklin as well as the people in the facilities.\n\n\u201cIt takes everybody working to do what we do. We\u2019ve got a good formula,\u201d he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1NfZ0in", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Acadia Healthcare's stock\u00a0outperformed over the last year\u00a0other Nashville-area companies in a local exchange-traded fund called NASH.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Acadia Healthcare's stock\u00a0outperformed over the last year\u00a0other Nashville-area companies in a local exchange-traded fund called NASH.", "title": "Acadia rises above other stocks in Nashville ETF", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/health-care/2015/08/07/acadia-healthcare-rises-above-other-stocks-nashville-etf/31285555/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Acadia Healthcare's stock\u00a0outperformed over the last year\u00a0other Nashville-area companies in a local exchange-traded fund called NASH.", "title": "Acadia rises above other stocks in Nashville ETF", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f785a2ee87d6e915eda12b757de4c62ad037cef/c=1154-0-3554-2400&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/07/Nashville/Nashville/635745518236893379-Joey-Jacobs-2011.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/byhollyfletcher"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/Acadia Healthcare", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Companies/Acadia Healthcare", "title": "Acadia rises above other stocks in Nashville ETF", "author": "Holly Fletcher", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/industries/health-care", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/270e26a401826c881077686e1ee15fc623a4366f/c=1574-0-3374-2400/local/-/media/2015/08/07/Nashville/Nashville/635745518236893379-Joey-Jacobs-2011.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/345f2f06490bc02327394707a2381782f1e797d1/c=1154-0-3554-2400/local/-/media/2015/08/07/Nashville/Nashville/635745518236893379-Joey-Jacobs-2011.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/15e66e824d95b3044e1b732b67b4f69c1c5fde62/c=413-0-3605-2400/local/-/media/2015/08/07/Nashville/Nashville/635745518236893379-Joey-Jacobs-2011.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b19212305f2034f4292d802fb5cfcdec82441d48/c=0-96-3605-2133&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/08/07/Nashville/Nashville/635745518236893379-Joey-Jacobs-2011.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-07T18:10:37.007000-05:00", "shorthed": "Acadia outperforms peers in local stock fund", "articleid": 31285555, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d7c95829c91c54f55fc6861ef85f114831f3886f/c=0-96-3605-2133/local/-/media/2015/08/07/Nashville/Nashville/635745518236893379-Joey-Jacobs-2011.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d35743e07f550d8d9ed49798c4cc79ad88b54ed/c=1830-0-3174-2400/local/-/media/2015/08/07/Nashville/Nashville/635745518236893379-Joey-Jacobs-2011.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "acadia healthcare, joey jacobs, painkiller addiction in tennessee, nash etf, exchange traded fund nashville, etf nashville, addiction center company nashville"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba9d\"", "article_summary": "The 2008 law prohibits employers and health insurance companies from putting stricter limits on mental health care than other conditions.\nThe ETF \u2014 a fund that is open to people who want to invest on the New York Stock Exchange \u2014 is dominated by health care companies.\nAcadia provides patient behavioral health and addiction dependency care for children, teens and adults of all ages.\nOver the last decade federal reforms \u2013 particularly the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 and the Affordable Care Act \u2014have improved access to mental health care.\nJoey Jacobs, chairman and CEO, has been at the helm since February 2011, the year Acadia started its fast-track growth."}
