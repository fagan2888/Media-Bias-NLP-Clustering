Bill Cosby gave a brief interview to Page Six on Friday, where he addressed journalistic standards and his wife's reaction to the flood of rape accusations.

The 77-year-old star says he only expects the black media to exhibit excellence in journalism by maintaining a neutral mind.

He also says that his wife, Camille Cosby, has relied on love and the strength of womanhood to weather the ongoing public scrutiny.

Cosby has remained largely silent in light of the more than two dozen women who have come forward to accuse him of having drugged and raped them.

The Page Six interview ended abruptly when Cosby said that he wasn't supposed to talk to the media.

Representatives for Cosby did not immediately respond to the AP's request for comment.
