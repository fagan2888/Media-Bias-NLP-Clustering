He outlined specific policy proposal based his principles as a fearless progressive - not based on polling.\"\n\nAnother Clinton rival, Bernie Sanders, agreed on Tuesday, backing Chapter 9 protections and adding, \"Our goal must be not only to give Puerto Rico the flexibility it needs to restructure its debt, but to make sure that it can rebuild its economy, create good-paying jobs and expand its tax base.\"\n\nJeb Bush also said in April that he supports giving Puerto Rico \"the same rights as the states\" when it comes to addressing debt. But critics say that changing the law would amount to a bailout.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal told the New Hampshire Union Leader on Tuesday that he opposes the Chapter 9 move, saying that his message to Puerto Rico is to \"get your act together.\"\n\nClinton alluded to those critics in her statement Tuesday, saying \"We're not talking about a bailout, we're talking about a fair shot at success.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clinton argued that Puerto Rico, which faces $72 billion in public debt, should be given the option to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Clinton argued that Puerto Rico, which faces $72 billion in public debt, should be given the option to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Pushes 'Fair Shot' For Debt-Saddled Puerto Rico", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/hillary-clinton-pushes-fair-shot-debt-saddled-puerto-rico-n387966", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_28/1110181/479120980_eab6345e80b00901ec09c69ab0b0b779.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Clinton argued that Puerto Rico, which faces $72 billion in public debt, should be given the option to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Pushes 'Fair Shot' For Debt-Saddled Puerto Rico - NBC News", "image": {"src": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_28/1110181/479120980_eab6345e80b00901ec09c69ab0b0b779.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "creator": "NBCNews", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-07", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/hillary-clinton-pushes-fair-shot-debt-saddled-puerto-rico-n387966", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Politics,2016 Election"}, "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton on Tuesday called on Congress and the Obama administration to give Puerto Rico \"a fair shot at success\" as it struggles with crushing debt.\n\"The challenge is multi-faceted, and will ultimately require Puerto Rico to find a way to pay back its debtors in an orderly fashion,\" she said.\nJeb Bush also said in April that he supports giving Puerto Rico \"the same rights as the states\" when it comes to addressing debt.\nClinton alluded to those critics in her statement Tuesday, saying \"We're not talking about a bailout, we're talking about a fair shot at success.\"\nIn a statement, Clinton argued that Puerto Rico, which faces $72 billion in public debt, should be given the option to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which - as a commonwealth - it's currently barred from doing."}
