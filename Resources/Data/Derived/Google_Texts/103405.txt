The immigration reduction group Numbers USA has launched a new ad campaign in a number of states with tight Senate races highlighting the loss of jobs to immigrants.

Numbers USA’s ad asks simply, who should get the jobs: citizens and legal immigrants already here or new immigrants? It encourages people to see where their senator stands on the issue.

Their ad notes that since 2000, nearly all the job growth in the U.S. has gone to immigrants.

“We’re urging every citizen to ask a very simple question of their Senators — and of anybody who wants to be a Senator,” NumbersUSA President Roy Beck said. “Who should get the next jobs? Do they think their constituents who are looking for work should have priority for jobs? Or are they committed to catering to special-interest groups and helping corporate lobbyists continue to flood the labor market with new foreign workers who, through no fault of their own, depress the wages and job prospects for workers already here?”

The new ads, according to a spokeswoman, are backed by a seven-figure buy and will air in Kentucky, Arkansas, North Carolina, Alaska, Georgia, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Iowa, Michigan, and Kansas over the coming weeks.

“Polling shows that most Americans believe annual legal immigration should be reduced to improve the jobs and wages for American workers,” Beck said. “But many in Congress don’t agree.”

The ad encourages people to go to Number USA’s website to see how their senator scores based on the group’s immigration criteria. For example, Sen. Kay Hagan (D-NC) has an F, Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR) boasts a D, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) has an F, Sen Mark Begich (D-AK) has an F, and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has a B+.
