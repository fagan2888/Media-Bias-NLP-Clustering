New Jersey officials claimed they complied with all applicable federal requirements in their selection of CGI.\n\nBut state officials \u201cdid not procure services and products for its system in accordance with federal procurement standards or comply with all federal cost principle requirements for supporting salary and wage compensation,\u201d the IG said in a report made public late Friday.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, it did not prepare an independent cost estimate and analysis before awarding the system contract to the only responsive bidder. It also did not ensure that option years were awarded competitively and included provisions in its request for quotation that restricted competition,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cFurther, it did not ensure that software was purchased competitively and that the winning contractor had adequate documentation to support labor costs charged by its employees,\u201d it said.\n\nThe process appeared to have been designed to ensure CGI would win the contract. The state\u2019s request for bids \u201crequired potential contractors to complete a rate schedule that had predetermined labor categories matching those of CGI Federal and had predetermined labor hours, which restricted competition,\u201d the IG said.\n\n\u201cOf the 26 predetermined labor categories included in the State\u2019s schedule, 22 of them matched the exact wording of labor category titles from CGI Federal\u2019s authorized price-list on the U.S. General Services Administration\u2019s web site.\u201d\n\nSimilar problems marked the process by which CGI won the Healthcare.gov contract. The Washington Examiner reported in 2014 that federal officials were \u201ctight-lipped about why CGI was chosen or how it happened. They also refuse to say if other firms competed with CGI, or if there was ever a public solicitation for building Healthcare.gov, the backbone of Obamacare\u2019s problem-plagued web portal.\u201d\n\nThe Healthcare.gov contract went to CGI because federal officials \u201cused what amounts to a federal procurement system loophole to award the work to the Canadian firm,\u201d the Examiner said.\n\nCGI also lost a major contract from a Canadian province in 2012 after missing multiple deadlines in designing an online medical registry.\n\nThe New Jersey contract may be the next big government contract at risk for CGI because the IG recommended that HUD\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for grant programs determine whether the entire award should be cancelled and bidding re-opened.\n\nFollow Mark on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
