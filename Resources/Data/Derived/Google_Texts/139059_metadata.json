A federal watchdog is afraid so.\n\nThe National Airspace System that controls America\u2019s airports and air traffic control centers is vulnerable to cyber attacks \u2013 and the Federal Aviation Administration has not done enough to address the weaknesses.\n\nRelated: Cyber Security Office Deemed Dysfunctional\n\nThis could set up a potentially dangerous situation for pilots and passengers,\n\nsince hackers could gain access to the system and tamper with or disrupt air traffic control operations, a disturbing new report out Monday from the Government Accountability Office says.\n\nThe GAO reviewed the security of the FAA\u2019s massive National Airspace System (NAS) and found that the agency failed to use strong password controls, leaving the system with \u201csignificant security control weaknesses.\u201d\n\nIn their 42-page report, the auditors added, \u201cAs a result, FAA is at increased risk that accounts could be compromised and used by unauthorized individuals to access sensitive information or systems.\u201d\n\nThe GAO said the FAA\u2019s security systems didn\u2019t meet federal standards. Its strategic cyber security plan has also not been updated in at least five years. Since it\u2019s outdated, it doesn\u2019t account for newer technology used to launch cyber hacks.\n\nRelated: The Coming Cyber Attack That Could Ruin Your Life\n\n\u201cThese shortcomings put the national airspace systems at increased and unnecessary risk of unauthorized access, use, or modification that could disrupt air traffic control operations,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe GAO also faulted the agency for not properly training its cyber security workers to respond in the event of a breach. It said some workers \u201cmay not recognize and respond appropriately to potential security threats and vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nThough the GAO credited the agency for making several improvements, it stressed it must go further. \u201cAlthough FAA has taken steps to safeguard its air traffic control systems, significant security control weaknesses remain in NAS systems and networks threatening the agency\u2019s ability to adequately fulfill its mission.\u201d\n\nThe watchdog made 17 public recommendations, including improving the training of cyber security employees, more clearly identifying and resolving issues, and strengthening security controls and agency protocol. Additional recommendations about specific security problems and 168 actions that should be taken by the agency to address those have not been made public.\n\n\u201cThe agency is fully cognizant of the vital requirement to secure the National Airspace System cyber environment as part of the nation's critical infrastructure,\u201d Acting Assistant Secretary for the FAA, Keith Washington, wrote in response to the GAO\u2019s findings.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Could your airplane be hacked?
