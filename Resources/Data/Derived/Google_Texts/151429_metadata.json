From our government, we even see the outlawing of the name of Jesus from public prayers, especially from the military, which owes all victories to Him.\n\nAnd there are also those, such as my family and me, who immigrated to this blessed land and long for the original America\u2014the America as envisioned by the founding fathers.\n\nI came to this country because, as a boy living under the tyranny of dictatorship and socialism, I longed to be free. I read the writings of America\u2019s founders and dreamed of breathing the air of freedom\u2014the air that was purchased with the blood of many American patriots.\n\nThat desire echoes the desire of the silent majority of millions of immigrants who legally came here, or were brought by their forebears. People who valued America and could never take it for granted because they had experienced oppressive political systems in their home countries.\n\nIn my article series, The Price of Liberty, I described what those millions of legal immigrants want. It is a refrain that goes something like this:\n\nWe want the America that feared God.\n\nWe want the America whose foundation was the Bible.\n\nWe want the America of which George Washington said: \u201cIt is impossible to rightly govern the world without God and the Bible.\u201d\n\nWe want the America of which Abraham Lincoln said: \u201cThe only assurance of our nation\u2019s safety is to lay our foundation in morality and religion.\u201d\n\nWe want the America of the Founding Fathers who said: \u201cWhen the importance of religion is diminished \u2026 so is the effectiveness of government.\u201d\n\nWe want the America of which the Supreme Court in 1844 said: \u201cThe Bible, and especially the New Testament [should] be read and taught as divine revelation in the [schools, otherwise] \u2026 where can the purest principles of morality be learned so clearly or so perfectly as from the New Testament?\u201d\n\nWe want the America of which New York Supreme Court Chief Justice Kent said in 1811: \u201cWe are a Christian people, and the morality of the country is deeply engrafted upon Christianity, and not upon the doctrines or worship of those imposters [other religions].\u201d\n\nWe want the America of which the Supreme Court of New York in 1811 also said: \u201cWhatever strikes at the root of Christianity tends manifestly to the dissolution of the civil government \u2026 because it tends to corrupt the morals of the people, and to destroy good order.\u201d\n\nWe want the America of which Daniel Webster said: \u201cThe principles of all genuine liberty and of wise laws and administrations, are to be drawn from the Bible and sustained by its authority. The man, therefore, who weakens or destroys the divine authority of that book may be an accessory to all of the public disorders which society is doomed to suffer.\u201d\n\nToday we are seeing Webster\u2019s prophetic words come to life; we are witnessing all the \u201cpublic disorders\u201d of which we are now \u201cdoomed to suffer.\u201d\n\nThis race to the bottom must stop. We want the old America back.\n\nWe want the America that reflects the beliefs of most of the country, not the vocal and belligerent minority. We want an America of those earlier courts, not the courts of the last fifty years that have been busy striking at the Christian cornerstone of our nation.\n\nAs we celebrate America\u2019s birth, let us not become weary of praying and working for our Judeo-Christian foundation to be reestablished.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Millions of Americans who have known \u201cthe old America\u201d\u2014the one they were born in and grew up in\u2014feel a deep disappointment that their grandchildren will not grow up to know the country that valued morality and biblical ethics..05/26/2016 19:27:41PM EST.", "author": "Michael Youssef", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Millions of Americans who have known \u201cthe old America\u201d\u2014the one they were born in and grew up in\u2014feel a deep disappointment that their grandchildren will not grow up to know the country that valued morality and biblical ethics.", "title": "- This Legal Immigrant Wants the Old America", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelyoussef/2014/06/29/this-legal-immigrant-wants-the-old-america-n1856595", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2011/121/24e40e56-055a-44d6-bb81-5721e8b6acbf@news.ap.org.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Millions of Americans who have known \u201cthe old America\u201d\u2014the one they were born in and grew up in\u2014feel a deep disappointment that their grandchildren will not grow up to know the country that valued morality and biblical ethics.", "title": "- This Legal Immigrant Wants the Old America", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelyoussef/2014/06/29/this-legal-immigrant-wants-the-old-america-n1856595", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2011/121/24e40e56-055a-44d6-bb81-5721e8b6acbf@news.ap.org.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "This Legal Immigrant Wants the Old America, Michael Youssef, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "People who valued America and could never take it for granted because they had experienced oppressive political systems in their home countries.\nWe want the America that reflects the beliefs of most of the country, not the vocal and belligerent minority.\nMillions of Americans who have known \u201cthe old America\u201d\u2014the one they were born in and grew up in\u2014feel a deep disappointment that their grandchildren will not grow up to know the country that valued morality and biblical ethics.\nWe want the America whose foundation was the Bible.\nIn my article series, The Price of Liberty, I described what those millions of legal immigrants want."}
