It must have happened after I left,'' the Sydney real estate agent said.\n\n\"It was a great night.\"\n\nPartygoers left a sea of rubbish behind and Yarra Council faces a $30,000 clean-up bill.\n\nOne man was knocked unconscious and suffered facial fractures when he was punched in the face.\n\nThe Noble Park man, 31, was partying on the northern side of the park when he noticed a scuffle and was approached by another man and attacked.\n\nThe offender - a thin man in his early 20s with black hair - disappeared into the crowd.\n\nThe victim, who lost several teeth in the attack, is awaiting surgery at St Vincent's Hospital.\n\nPolice had only deployed 12 officers to patrol the park, despite warning signs on social media of a large crowd and a similar-sized party last year.\n\nThey struggled to contain the wild party and it was not until extra police flooded the park in the early hours of the morning that they were able to close down the \"illegal dance parties\" and disperse the crowd.\n\nBut by then 20 people had been treated for serious cuts from glass on the ground and intoxication, and the council tennis courts had been vandalised.\n\nGilbert said it was the second time he had promoted the event on social media.\n\nBut so great was the paramedics' workload they were forced to set up a makeshift triage centre at the edge of the park were they treated people for serious cuts from the glass on the ground and intoxication.\n\nAmbulance Victoria operation manager Paul Holman slammed the Edinburgh Gardens partygoers for tying up resources with \"self-inflicted wounds\".\n\nOne female police officer was allegedly punched in the face at the park. A 17-year-old boy was arrested and is assisting police with their inquiries.\n\nVictoria Police deputy commissioner Tim Cartwright admitted police had learnt from the trouble at Edinburgh Gardens and would work closely with council to increase infrastructure next year.\n\n\"We did have a police contingent there but all I can say is that we have learnt and if there is an event there next year it will be much better controlled,\" he said.\n\n\"We will be working very hard with council to make sure that happens.\"\n\nRubbish littered the gardens yesterday morning, with Yarra councillor Roberto Colanzi tweeting several photos of the carnage.\n\nHe tweeted: \"Edinburgh Gardens a sea of crap this am\".\n\nVictoria police also criticised the lack of organisation from Yarra Council on the night.\n\nBut Yarra Council Mayor Jackie Fristacky said many residents' had told her there was a \"good atmosphere\" and it was \"great night\".\n\n\"It is just a shame that there was so much litter,\" she said.\n\nShe said the council's response needed to better control the crowds while still ensuring people were able to enjoy the night.\n\nMore than half-a-million revellers made their way to central Melbourne to enjoy the fireworks.\n\nBut with the huge party came a huge amount of rubbish: 12 tonnes were collected on the night with Melbourne City Council estimating the clean-up bill at $212,000.\n\nA police officer was bit on the shoulder as he responded to reports of an affray at Hosier Lane.
