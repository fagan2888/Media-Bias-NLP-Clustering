Finally Obama is doing something for the poor and unemployed. He's fining them.

Roughly one million low-income Americans will pay a fine under Obamacare, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

The CBO estimated that four million people would pay the individual mandate penalty for not having health insurance by 2016 as a result of the president’s health care law.

“An estimated $4 billion will be collected from those who are uninsured in 2016."

200,000 of those paying the penalty earn less than 100 percent of the poverty line. An additional 800,000 are considered low-income, earning between 100 and 199 percent of the poverty level.
