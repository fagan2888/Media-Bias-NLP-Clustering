We conducted our own unscientific poll about drinking that golden goodness with your favorite presidential candidate, and now here I am writing about Hillary Clinton\u2019s bladder on account of her delayed return to the Democratic debate stage on Saturday.\n\nNow, apparently, a reason has been given for Clinton\u2019s brief disappearance. The Boston Globe reports that the former secretary was stuck waiting on a caffeine-addled Martin O\u2019Malley staffer to rid her body of coffee and thus made her late to the stage:\n\nWhat viewers didn\u2019t know was the sole women\u2019s bathroom was a little further than the men\u2019s room from the stage. And when the debate went to a long commercial break Clinton lost out to Lis Smith, the caffeine-guzzling deputy campaign manager for former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley, who beat her to the restroom. Smith declined to comment for the story. A top Clinton staffer who was strategically posted outside the bathroom (presumably to avoid these kinds of situations) gave Smith a verbal OK to make a quick pit stop, according to one person familiar with the ladies\u2019 line.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that the ladies bathroom did have multiple stalls and that a Clinton spokesperson said there was no security issue concerns related to a potential group piss event during a commercial break.\n\nPreviously, Clinton had some urinary tact issues during the first Democratic debate in October and told Anderson Cooper that \u201cit does take me a little longer, and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.\u201d Girl. Either this is a brilliant strategy to shift the focus back to the former Obama cabinet member or Clinton should seriously consider just wearing a diaper.\n\nOther politicians have undoubtedly gone the diaper route and not just David Vitter in his off time. Ted Cruz must\u2019ve been working with a fat stack of Depends during his infamous bullshit Obamacare filibuster where he read Green Eggs and Ham and ruined even more of what America holds dear.\n\nIf the next debate isn\u2019t sponsored by either an adult diaper or an overactive bladder medication, I\u2019ll know this country has truly failed. Don\u2019t let us down, Hillz.\n\n[Boston Globe | NYDN | YouTube mirror via YouGotNews]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pisspiracy continues.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "The pisspiracy continues.", "title": "Hillary Clinton should probably wear a diaper", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/274563/hillary-clinton-should-probably-wear-a-diaper/", "image": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-21-at-11.32.39-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The pisspiracy continues.", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "news", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-21T13:13:20Z", "modified_time": "2015-12-23T13:05:24Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "We conducted our own unscientific poll about drinking that golden goodness with your favorite presidential candidate, and now here I am writing about Hillary Clinton\u2019s bladder on account of her delayed return to the Democratic debate stage on Saturday.\nEither this is a brilliant strategy to shift the focus back to the former Obama cabinet member or Clinton should seriously consider just wearing a diaper.\nOther politicians have undoubtedly gone the diaper route and not just David Vitter in his off time.\nIf the next debate isn\u2019t sponsored by either an adult diaper or an overactive bladder medication, I\u2019ll know this country has truly failed.\nAnd when the debate went to a long commercial break Clinton lost out to Lis Smith, the caffeine-guzzling deputy campaign manager for former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley, who beat her to the restroom."}
