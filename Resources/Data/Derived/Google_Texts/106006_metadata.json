(AP) - Nebraska lawmakers agreed Wednesday to set aside even more money for property tax relief amid predictions that state revenue will grow faster than expected.\n\nThe budget that advanced to a final vote would boost the funding by $8 million, for a total of $408 million over two years. The money will go into the state\u2019s property tax credit fund, which reduces what taxpayers owe to local counties, school districts and natural resources districts.\n\nThe Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board predicted last month that the state would collect more money than expected, giving senators an additional $9.7 million.\n\nThe Legislature\u2019s budget committee recommended that lawmakers put $8 million of the extra money into the property tax fund.\n\n\u201cThe Appropriations Committee felt this was a responsible and sustainable increase in direct property tax relief,\u201d said Sen. Heath Mello, the committee chairman.\n\nThe rest of the surplus revenue will help replace a public-broadcasting antenna that fell off a tower in Alliance, and provide money for rural economic development bills.\n\nThe state forecasting board projected last month that state revenue will grow 5 percent during the fiscal year that starts on July 1 and 4.3 percent in the following year. Prior to the board meeting, many lawmakers had speculated that state revenues would decline and force them to make cuts in the $8.7 billion budget to avoid a deficit.\n\n\u201cThese were funds we didn\u2019t know we were going to have, and quite truthfully, I think all of us are thankful that we ended up on the plus side of things,\u201d said Sen. Beau McCoy, of Omaha. \u201cI think the right place to put these funds is in the property tax credit relief fund.\u201d\n\nGov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, urged lawmakers last month to use the surplus revenue on tax cuts.\n\nOn Monday, lawmakers gave initial approval to a separate property tax bill aimed at farmers and business owners.\n\nThe measure would allow business owners to exempt the first $10,000 worth of tangible property used in their operations, for an average tax savings of $162. The bill would apply to farm equipment such as irrigation pivots and tractors, and business equipment such as rail cars, pipelines and factory machines.\n\nLawmakers also voted to withdraw about $28 million from the cash reserve fund to pay for renovations to the Capitol\u2019s heating, ventilation and air conditioning system. The full project is expected to cost $106 million, including the expense of restoring windows, moving Capitol offices across the street and a more efficient geothermal heat pump system. The withdrawals would take place over eight years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nebraska lawmakers agreed Wednesday to set aside even more money for property tax relief amid predictions that state revenue will grow faster than expected.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/6/new-nebraska-budget-boosts-property-tax-relief-to-/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Nebraska lawmakers agreed Wednesday to set aside even more money for property tax relief amid predictions that state revenue will grow faster than expected.", "title": "New Nebraska budget boosts property tax relief to $408M"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nebraska lawmakers agreed Wednesday to set aside even more money for property tax relief amid predictions that state revenue will grow faster than expected.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "New Nebraska budget boosts property tax relief to $408M"}, "Author": "GRANT SCHULTE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd216c\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - Nebraska lawmakers agreed Wednesday to set aside even more money for property tax relief amid predictions that state revenue will grow faster than expected.\n\u201cThe Appropriations Committee felt this was a responsible and sustainable increase in direct property tax relief,\u201d said Sen.
