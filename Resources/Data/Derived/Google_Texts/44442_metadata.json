The answer is up to the individual\u2019s way of thinking and has nothing to do with his plumbing, according to the Office of Personnel Management, CNS News reported.\n\nGay and lesbian rights are so pass\u00e9. Move over for transgender rights.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management\u2019s \u201cGuidance Regarding the Employment of Transgender Individuals in the Federal Workplace\u201d spells it all out.\n\n\u201cTransgender individuals are people with a gender identity that is different from the sex assigned to them at birth,\u201d it says. \u201cSomeone who was assigned the male sex at birth but who identifies as female is a transgender woman. Likewise, a person assigned the female sex at birth but who identifies as male is a transgender man.\u201d\n\nSo gender assignment has nothing to do with the criteria all members of the animal kingdom have used to determine sex for millennia \u2014 it\u2019s all in the head. And the classification can change at any time on a whim, apparently.\n\n\u201cSome individuals will find it necessary to transition from living and working as one gender to another,\u201d the document said.\n\nCNS reported:\n\nThe guidelines say the last phase in this transition is called \u201creal life experience.\u201d \u201cAs the name suggests, the real life experience is designed to allow the transgender individual to experience living full-time in the gender role to which he or she is transitioning,\u201d say the guidelines. \u201cCompletion of at least one year of the real life experience is required prior to an individual\u2019s being deemed eligible for gender reassignment surgery.\u201d The guidelines call for the government to take certain steps to accommodate a federal worker going through a transition.\n\nTransgender employees should be allowed to dress according to their preferred gender identity, and their coworkers should use pronouns appropriate to the transgender employees\u2019 identity, according to the guidelines.\n\nSarah Palin takes an awkward call from \u2018Vlad Putin\u2019 on The Tonight Show\n\nBut the biggie, of course, is the bathroom issue.\n\n\u201cFor a transitioning employee, this means that, once he or she has begun living and working full-time in the gender that reflects his or her identity, agencies should allow access to restrooms and (if provided to other employees) locker room facilities consistent with his or her gender identity,\u201d the guidelines say. \u201cWhile a reasonable temporary compromise may be appropriate in some circumstances, transitioning employees should not be required to have undergone or to provide proof of any particular medical procedure (including gender reassignment surgery) in order to have access to facilities designated for use by a particular gender.\u201d\n\nI may be a bit old-fashioned, but could we all just get back to the birds and the bees, please?
