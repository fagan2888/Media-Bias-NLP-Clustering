AURORA — Mulugeta Hailu moved from Ethiopia to Denver over two decades ago seeking an escape from political persecution.

The move meant leaving his homeland and rich culture behind as he left for greener pastures. But now, after all those years, he’s a part of a growing Ethiopian community in Colorado of more than 27,000 whose size and closeness was clear here Sunday at a festival celebrating the Ethiopian New Year.

In a way, a bit of the African nation moved to Colorado with Hailu.

“We’re trying to teach our kids,” said Hailu, who has three young children. “Some of them don’t even speak our language.”

Organizers expected about 1,000 people to attend the celebration at Del Mar Park where red, yellow and green Ethiopian flags hung from the trees. There was music, food and the happy shouts of playing children who danced around their parents, gathered in the shade and shielding themselves from the summer sun’s last rays.

“This is very important because this is not just a holiday for a specific church or mosque,” said Shifferan Hajito, who runs the Ethiopian Community of Colorado, which organized the event. “This is regardless of religion, regardless of color.”

The majority of Ethiopians living in Colorado escaped religious and cultural prosecution in their homeland, settling in the Denver area because the setting “looks like home,” Hajito said.

The Ethiopian New Year, which actually happened Thursday, is based off the country’s 13-month calendar. Because of the extra month, it is actually only 2007 in Ethiopia.

“It definitely connects me here with my roots,” said 29-year-old Helen Tekle, who moved to the United States from Ethiopia when she was 7. “People here who grew up like me and other teenagers tend to forget.”
