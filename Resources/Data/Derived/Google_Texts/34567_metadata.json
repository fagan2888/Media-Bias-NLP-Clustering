Lassoing the powers of language, literature, and the law, the movement dubbed \u201cPC\u201d initially worked toward the good goal of greater inclusiveness for marginalized communities. Eventually, however, bloated by the riches of the ivory tower of academia and provoked by the excesses and exclusivity of the good-ol\u2019-boy culture of Wall Street, political correctness morphed into a tyranny of speech codes, sensitivity training, and book banning. Its reach lingers still, most recently exemplified in the decision by a state panel in Nevada not to name a cove after Mark Twain because of the author\u2019s racist 19th-century views toward Native Americans.

Now, instead of challenging the status quo by demanding texts that question the comfort of the Western canon, students are demanding the status quo by refusing to read texts that challenge their own personal comfort.\n\nIn the foreword to Amusing Ourselves to Death, his iconoclastic jeremiad on entertainment culture, Neil Postman invokes George Orwell\u2019s 1984 and Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World. In noting the contrast between their two dystopian visions of the future, Postman notes, Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think. What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell envisioned an external form of control that becomes internalized\u2014essentially, political correctness. Huxley envisioned an internal form of control that becomes externalized\u2014empathetic correctness. And Postman thinks Huxley\u2019s was the more accurate prediction. The most jaw-dropping display of empathetic correctness came in a recent New York Times article reporting on the number of campuses proposing that so-called \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d be placed on syllabi in courses using texts or films containing material that might \u201ctrigger\u201d discomfort for students. Themes seen as needing such warnings range from suicide, abuse, and rape to anti-Semitism, \u201cmisogynistic violence,\u201d and \u201ccontrolling relationships.\u201d Astonishingly, some of the literary works advocates claim need warning labels for adult college students are often read by high school students, such as The Great Gatsby and The Merchant of Venice. The purpose of these trigger warnings, according to one Rutgers student calling for them, is to permit students to either plan ahead for \u201ctackling triggering massages\u201d [sic] or to arrange \u201can alternate reading schedule with their professor.\u201d The student, a sophomore and, surprisingly, an English major (once upon a time, English majors clamored for provocative books) advocates professors warning students as to which passages contain \u201ctriggering material\u201d and which are \u201csafer\u201d so that students can read only portions of the book with which \u201cthey are fully comfortable.\u201d He explains, For many students, trigger traumas are daily, painful experiences \u2026 However, by creating trigger warnings for their students, professors can help to create a safe space for their students \u2014 one that fosters positive and compassionate intellectual discussion within the collegiate classroom. He contends that \u201cmany of our students enter\u2014and exit\u2014our University with serious traumas, which can cause emotional or psychological distress within our own classrooms.\u201d Thus, a similar proposal under consideration at the University of California, Santa Barbara, would allow students who might be traumatized by challenging material to miss classes containing such material without a grade penalty. How can empathy even be cultivated apart from a willingness to have our preconceptions and our very comfort challenged? I\u2019m not entirely unsympathetic. As an English professor, I had a student\u2014a rape survivor\u2014express feeling traumatized by classroom discussion of Thomas Hardy\u2019s Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles. I learned about her difficulty only following her repeated absences from class. A trigger warning might have prevented\u2014or perhaps merely ensured\u2014these absences. But a person traumatized by reading a Victorian novel is a person in need of help, and the entire episode brought about the small crisis which resulted in a more important outcome: getting her connected with a college counselor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The movement for \"trigger warnings\" in college classrooms is part of a troubling trend toward protecting people from their own individual sensitivities.", "author": "Karen Swallow Prior", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The movement for \"trigger warnings\" in college classrooms is part of a troubling trend toward protecting people from their own individual sensitivities.", "title": "'Empathetically Correct' Is the New Politically Correct", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/05/8674003754_8e293320a4_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/05/empathetically-correct-is-the-new-politically-correct/371442/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda787\"", "article_summary": "When I was attending graduate school in the late 1980s and early 1990s, political correctness reigned supreme.\nA trigger warning might have prevented\u2014or perhaps merely ensured\u2014these absences.\nOrwell envisioned an external form of control that becomes internalized\u2014essentially, political correctness.\nRelated Story How Novels Widen Your Vision But it seems political correctness is being replaced by a new trend\u2014one that might be called \u201cempathetic correctness.\u201d While political correctness seeks to cultivate sensitivity outwardly on behalf of those historically marginalized and oppressed groups, empathetic correctness focuses inwardly toward the protection of individual sensitivities.\nPlease consider disabling it for our site, or supporting our work in one of these waysThe movement for \"trigger warnings\" in college classrooms is part of a troubling trend toward protecting people from their own individual sensitivities."}
