Continuing to urge Americans to sign up for Affordable Care Act coverage before the March 31 deadline, President Obama today turned to the woman who’d broken his re-tweet record, Ellen DeGeneres. Obama appears on her syndicated The Ellen DeGeneres Show via live shot from the White House — his first appearance on the show since being elected to the White House. “I thought it was a pretty cheap stunt myself,” the president says of Ellen’s Oscar selfie, “Getting a bunch of celebrities in the background…you feeding them pizza.”

It’s been about a week since Obama appeared on the Funny or Die web series Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis to tout the benefits of Obamacare; some members of the media had a field day with that one, but they’re pretty busy now with the missing Malaysia Airlines plane story so you may not see so much hair-tearing about today’s appearance, in which POTUS discusses his having eaten carrot sticks with potato chips while FLOTUS Michelle Obama is in China with their daughters; his Practically Perfect Tattoo Deterrent for his two teenagers; and how life at the White House is not nearly so sexy as it’s played in House Of Cards and Scandal. (Check out the video below.)

DeGeneres caused a brief service issue with Twitter when her selfie with about a dozen A-listers in the Dolby Theatre during the Oscars and broke the record for most retweets – 3 million-plus. In under an hour, DeGeneres selfie beat the re-tweet record Obama achieved on November 6, 2012, when he posted a photo of himself and Michelle Obama with the text: “Four more years.” “We just broke Twitter,” DeGeneres announced during the Oscarcast after word got out. She got mixed reviews for her hosting gig but it clocked record ratings.
