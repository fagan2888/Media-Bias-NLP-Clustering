Nineteen percent of the nation\u2019s farms are operated by those 65 and over.\n\n\u2014 The midpoint acreage of the U.S. farm in 1982 was 589 acres. By 2007, the average size was 1,105 acres.\n\n\u2014 The amount of corporate-owned farmland has grown more than 18 percent in the last 15 years.\n\nWhile one generation remains hard at work on the farm, the question becomes what happens when that generation is ready to pass on the ag baton? When there\u2019s no one in the family to carry on?\n\nWhat happens to the family farm?\n\nTerra Brockman, founder and director of the farmland programs for the Land Connection, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting farmland and training sustainable and organic farmers, knows there\u2019s an emotional tie to the land, a bond that city folk can\u2019t always understand.\n\n\u201cPeople need an informal way to talk about the future of their farm,\u201d she said.\n\nSo Brockman\u2019s group has set up a series of roundtables to facilitate those discussions. The next one is planned at the Peoria County Farm Bureau, 1716 N. University St., from 6 to 8 p.m. on Sept. 23.\n\n\u201cWe often hear people say, \u2018I know I should think about our farm\u2019s future but I\u2019m just not sure how to get started,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nAt the roundtable, the Land Connection will help folks get started with worksheets and exercises to assist with a self-assessment on succession.\n\n\u201cBefore going to an estate planner or an attorney for a resolution, we\u2019re saying consider other options that might allow farming to continue on the land,\u201d said Brockman.\n\nShe suggested that the question people need to ask themselves is \u201cWhat would you really like to have happen on your farm?\u201d\n\nBrockman said the opportunity exists for a win-win where farm families, old and new, could both benefit in a succession plan.\n\nCara Cummings, the Land Connection\u2019s executive director, noted that the group held its first farm transition roundtable in February. \u201cWe had a terrific response. People found the roundtable an easy way to start the important conversation about options for their farm,\u201d she said.\n\nSeats at the roundtable are limited and advance registration is required. For more information, call (217) 840-2128 or visit thelandconnection.org. The $20 registration fee covers a light supper featuring local foods.\n\nSteve Tarter is Journal Star business editor.
