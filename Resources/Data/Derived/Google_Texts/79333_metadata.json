It grew so acrimonious that House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) was forced to yank it from the floor until cooler heads prevailed.\n\nIronically, it came on the same day that the South Carolina state House completed its own gut-wrenching debate before voting to remove the Confederate battle flag from the state Capitol grounds, just weeks after a self-styled white supremacist shot and killed nine African Americans in an historic black church in Charleston.\n\nLast month\u2019s massacre prompted an extraordinary emotional outpouring of grief across the country and renewed reflection on the nation\u2019s persistent racial divide. Yet the Republican-controlled Congress and many of the GOP Republican presidential candidates have been relatively silent on the issue of gun violence and a flag symbolic of both Civil War rebellion but also southern resistance to the civil rights moment in the \u201860s and \u201870s.\n\nAs part of the ongoing debate over new spending bills, House Democrats offered amendments to ban Confederate flags from federal cemeteries and prevent the U.S. Park Service from doing business with shops that sell the flag. Southern Republican lawmakers threatened to sink an Interior Department spending bill if those amendments were included. They were concerned that Congress was trying to paint over history.\n\nRelated: South Carolina\u2019s Leaders Unite to Call for Removal of Confederate Flag\n\nAccording to Politico, GOP leaders were already struggling to stitch together enough support to pass an Interior Department spending bill, and the protest by lawmakers over the flag issue likely could have caused the appropriations bill to fail. Several Republicans complained that Democrats were trying to make Republican lawmakers look like racists.\n\n\u201cI strongly oppose the inclusion of this amendment, which was slipped into the bill in the dead of night with no debate,\u201d Rep. Steven Pallazzo (R-MS) said in a statement. \u201cCongress cannot simply rewrite history and strip the Confederate flag from existence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Confederate battle flag is nothing more than a symbol of racial hatred and oppression,\" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a black Democrat from New York. \"I stand here with chills next to it.\"\n\nWith the House in an uproar and many Republicans fearing they had egg on their faces, Boehner pulled the Interior bill from the floor.\n\n\u201cI want members on both sides of the aisle to sit down, let\u2019s have a conversation about how to address about what, frankly, has become a very thorny issue,\u201d Boehner said.\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) would have none of that, and insisted on a vote on another measure that would require the removal of all symbols of the Confederacy from the Capitol -- including state flags like the one from Mississippi that includes an image of the Confederate flag.\n\nOn a vote of 238 to 176, Republicans tabled Pelosi\u2019s amendment.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The temperature in Washington, D.C.", "title": "Now It\u2019s Congress in an Uproar Over the Confederate Flag", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/09/Now-It-s-Congress-Uproar-Over-Confederate-Flag", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/confederate%20flag.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/09/Now-It-s-Congress-Uproar-Over-Confederate-Flag", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/confederate%20flag.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The temperature in Washington, D.C.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCongress cannot simply rewrite history and strip the Confederate flag from existence.\u201d\u201cThe Confederate battle flag is nothing more than a symbol of racial hatred and oppression,\" said Rep.
