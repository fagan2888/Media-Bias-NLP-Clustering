Source: Matt Sanctis, "More Parents Opting Out of Vaccines for Children," springfieldnewssun.com, Dec. 2, 2011 While no US federal laws mandate vaccination, all 50 states require certain childhood vaccinations for children entering public schools. Most states offer medical and religious exemptions; however, 19 states provide philosophical exemptions, raising the issue of whether laws should be changed to make certain vaccines mandatory for all children.
