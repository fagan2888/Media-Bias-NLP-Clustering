Motorists can expect significant delays approaching Pittsburgh from the west through Monday morning.

As part of the Parkway West (Interstate 376) reconstruction, the inbound highway will be closed from Interstate 79 through the Fort Pitt Tunnel until 6 a.m. Monday. Swank Construction Co. plans to pave the highway, including the ramp to northbound Route 51.

In addition, the southbound ramp to Route 51 and the far right lane on Banksville Road will close from 9:30 a.m. Sunday to 6 a.m. Monday.

Two other ramps also will be closed for dam replacement work through 6 a.m. Monday: the northbound Route 51 ramp to the westbound I-376/Banksville interchange and the flyover ramp from the I-376/Banksville interchange to the inbound Parkway West.

On the outbound side, there will be single-lane restrictions in various areas for work on overhead signs from 9 to midnight tonight.

The work is part of a three-year, $72 million reconstruction of the parkway between the tunnel and I-79 that will include a new outbound lane approaching the interstate interchange.
