It also would advance its goal of taking the capital itself, thereby endangering thousands of Americans who might need a quick evacuation.\n\nSEE ALSO: Chemical weapons now in ISIL\u2019s hands: Iraqi ambassador\n\n\u201cISIL is ultimately going to assault Baghdad and probably close down Baghdad International Airport within the next couple of weeks,\u201d said Larry Johnson, a former State Department counterterrorism official. \u201cThey are moving methodically, consolidating their gains and reinforcing positions \u2014 not just trying to go running around with their hair on fire.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson said the Iraqi security forces are not competent enough to defend the airport on their own.\n\n\u201cThere is genuine concern we would not be able to get our people out of there,\u201d he said.\n\nSEE ALSO: ISIL vows conquest of Rome: \u2018Soldiers of the Islamic State, fight, fight!\u2019\n\nA former Pentagon official who visits Iraq said the Islamic State may decide the best way to close the airport is through artillery and mortar barrages.\n\nIraq could counter with helicopter strikes and perhaps use the Soviet-designed Sukhoi attack jets that arrived last month.\n\n\u201cThe airport is very vulnerable to artillery [and] mortar,\u201d the former official said, adding that such attacks would have a deep psychological effect on residents of Baghdad and force air traffic to come to a halt.\n\nAirport security is provided by Interior Ministry forces who, the source said, are likely to stand and fight but would need reinforcements.\n\nThe Islamic militants\u2019 lightning sweep across northern and western Iraq in the past month has heightened tensions between the country\u2019s Shiite majority and Sunni minority. At the same time, splits have grown between the Shiite-led government in Baghdad and the Kurdish autonomous region in the north.\n\nIn an address Wednesday, Mr. al-Maliki accused the Kurdish zone of being a haven for the Islamic State and other Sunni insurgents, The Associated Press reported. He did not provide any evidence, and the claims are likely to further strain Baghdad\u2019s ties which the Kurds, whose fighters have been battling the militant advance in the north.\n\nThe men\u2019s bodies, all of them with gunshot wounds, were found in the predominantly Shiite village of Khamissiya, outside the city of Hillah, which is some 60 miles south of Baghdad, said military spokesman Brig. Gen. Saad Maan Ibrahim.\n\nThe dead men were ages 25 to 40, and it appeared they had been killed a few days earlier and their bodies dumped in the remote area, said a local police officer and a medical official. Many of them were blindfolded and had their hands bound.\n\nThe Islamic State, which an intelligence source says has at least 3,000 fighters in Iraq, now effectively controls the Iraq side of border crossings into Jordan. It does not have the firepower to confront Jordan\u2019s armed forces loyal to King Abdullah.\n\nBut it is now in a better position to execute terrorist attacks and foment revolt.\n\n\u201cJordan is their next stated objective,\u201d said retired Army Gen. John M. Keane, an architect of the 2007 U.S. troop surge that greatly damaged ISIL\u2019s predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThink about the problem the Jordanians have,\u201d Mr. Keane said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a 350-kilometer border on one side with Syria and a 175-kilometer border on the other side with Iraq, and both areas are controlled and influenced by ISIL. Jordan is facing a very real threat.\u201d\n\nSaid Mr. Johnson: \u201cJordan still has a very effective army. The concern throughout the region is nobody trusts the United States. They don\u2019t trust the United States anymore to act in an appropriate manner to protect their interests.\u201d\n\nA landlocked, mostly Sunni kingdom bordering the Arabian Peninsula, Jordan is one of only two Arab nations that have signed a peace agreement with Israel. The other is Egypt.\n\nAsked whether Jordan is next for the Islamic State militants, a U.S. intelligence official said, \u201cISIL\u2019s goal includes establishing an Islamic caliphate and fighting the United States, according to its own spokesperson.\u201d\n\nMr. Keane said the Islamic State will follow a blueprint it executed in Mosul: months of methodical terrorist attacks and assassinations.\n\n\u201cISIL will not march on Jordan as they did in northern Iraq. The Jordanian air force would blow them off the road,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will return to terrorist activities and recruit and exploit radical Islamist movements inside of Jordan.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll connect to those movements in Jordan and pump new recruits into them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll cross the borders and conduct terrorist activities themselves from the sanctuaries of Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. military is flying about 50 surveillance flights daily over Iraq, using manned and unmanned craft, to assess the Islamic State and map targets.\n\nAn assessment team made up mostly of U.S. special operations forces has nearly completed a report to the Pentagon on the readiness of the Iraqi security forces. Many members fled when Islamic State militants broke out of Mosul a month ago and started taking villages and towns.\n\n\u201cThe assessment will likely be pretty dire,\u201d said Robert Maginnis, a retired Army officer. \u201cAfter all, half of the divisions already crumbled, and what little political confidence there was for al-Maliki is rapidly evaporating. I see little hope Iraqi forces can recapture the lost territory without help.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The al Qaeda-inspired terrorist army in Iraq ultimately wants to capture Baghdad International Airport and begin a campaign to destabilize neighboring Jordan, an important U.S. ally, analysts say.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The al Qaeda-inspired terrorist army in Iraq ultimately wants to capture Baghdad International Airport and begin a campaign to destabilize neighboring Jordan, an important U.S. ally, analysts say.", "title": "Islamic militants aim to take Baghdad airport", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/9/islamic-militants-aim-to-take-baghdad-airport/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/09/7_9_2014_mideast-iraq-28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/09/7_9_2014_mideast-iraq-28201.jpg", "description": "The al Qaeda-inspired terrorist army in Iraq ultimately wants to capture Baghdad International Airport and begin a campaign to destabilize neighboring Jordan, an important U.S. ally, analysts say.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Islamic militants aim to take Baghdad airport"}, "Author": "Rowan Scarborough", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, Iraq, Jordan, Nouri Al Maliki"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e97\"", "article_summary": "Many members fled when Islamic State militants broke out of Mosul a month ago and started taking villages and towns.\nIn an address Wednesday, Mr. al-Maliki accused the Kurdish zone of being a haven for the Islamic State and other Sunni insurgents, The Associated Press reported.\nI see little hope Iraqi forces can recapture the lost territory without help.\u201d\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\nSEE ALSO: ISIL vows conquest of Rome: \u2018Soldiers of the Islamic State, fight, fight!\u2019A former Pentagon official who visits Iraq said the Islamic State may decide the best way to close the airport is through artillery and mortar barrages.\nThe Islamic State organization \u2014 formerly the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2014 is attempting to move within striking distance as Iraqi officials in Baghdad on Wednesday reported discovering the bodies of 50 men in a possible sectarian massacre."}
