Inland school districts are trying to figure out what to do about new federal health care rules that call on them to give benefits to some substitute teachers.

Concerned about the cost, Hemet schools have already started limiting how many days substitutes can work in an attempt to avoid paying benefits.

Hemet Unified School District appears to be the largest local district to prevent subs from working full-time hours. A few districts, such as Riverside Unified School District, will pay the insurance.

Hemet Unified School District board President Paul Bakkom said the board didnât direct administrators how to deal with the topic, but he understands their financial motivation.

âWe donât want to step into a hole we canât step out of,â he said.

Large employers, such as almost every Inland school district, will face penalties if they donât offer health insurance to full-time employees in 2015. The law, often called Obamacare, defines anyone who regularly works more than 30 hours a week or 130 hours a month as a full-time employee entitled to the employerâs health insurance plan. However, the law asks employers to average each employeeâs hours over a period ranging from three to 12 months.

âFULL-TIMEâ SUBS

Most substitutes work seven hours a day, but a sub working five days a week, or 35 hours, might not be considered full-time because he or she doesnât work that much every week. Substitute teachersâ pay varies by district, ranging from about $100 to $140 per day.

Most districts have a regular pool of subs, who may work full-time some weeks but not at all other weeks.

School district officials say they have no idea how many substitutes may be eligible and what the insurance might cost. Most are now studying substitutesâ pay records.

To keep substitutes from working full-time, Hemet district administrators asked principals to consider using other subs instead of someone who already worked four days that week, Assistant Superintendent LaFaye Platter said.

âWeâre making these decisions on a case-by-case basis,â she said, depending on whether another substitute can handle that classroom.

Inland district officials say they are looking back at substitutesâ hours and averaging them over three months. They are trying to gather that information to plan their 2014-15 budgets, which must be adopted in June.

California Teachers Association board member Don Bridge said he believes the numbers of substitute teachers who work full-time is very small.

âI donât think weâre talking a lot of dollars like the districts are making it out to be,â said Bridge, a Chino Hills teacher.
