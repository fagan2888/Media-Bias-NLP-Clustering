Construction of structures would wait, Begley said, until tenants are secured.\n\nAlso on the project site \u2014 referred to as the second phase of Candlewood Hills commercial development, which is anchored by Costco \u2014 is a walking trail, a new access road and a drainage corridor that feeds into a so-called wetlands.\n\nIt was largely discussions over how to deal with the government-protected drainage corridor and wetlands that held up the second phase, said Blumkin lawyer Larry Jobeun. Ultimately, the site plan was redesigned so as not to disturb them.\n\nWhile the resulting commercial layout was downsized \u2014 less office and retail space and a less substantial north-south connecting road \u2014 it is as good as could be without continued debate and negotiations, Jobeun said.\n\nFinally, he said, the big dirt lot off of West Dodge appears ready to be transformed.\n\n\u201cWe're hopeful to eliminate that dirt pile soon,\u201d he said.\n\nThe saga of Candlewood Hills dates to 2006 when the Omaha Planning Board swiftly endorsed a plan for a large, multiphase commercial development to be anchored by Costco.\n\nIn 1948, the site had been purchased by Rose Blumkin, founder of Nebraska Furniture Mart.\n\nAfter Mrs. B died in 1998 at age 104, the land was held by four trusts that benefit the families of her four children.\n\nCostco was erected after the Blumkin \u201cbig house,\u201d as the family called it, was torn down in April 2007. Trees and farm buildings around the big house also were cleared.\n\nToday, a chunk of property in front of Costco along the West Dodge frontage road remains vacant and available for tenants.\n\nDeveloping the second phase \u2014 the western 27 acres \u2014 has been tougher.\n\nJobeun told the Planning Board last week that the area could not be built as originally intended largely because of the drainage corridor and wetlands that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers claims jurisdiction over. (He said the corps considers it a \u201cWater of the United States.\u201d)\n\nThe drainage ditch runs south-north and feeds the triangular wetlands formed when the man-made Lake Candlewood was dredged in the late 1990s. The swampy material was laid out at the future project site to dry out, recalled Jay Noddle of Noddle Cos., who was heavily involved in the early stages of the commercial development.\n\nFed by storm water drainage, plant life grew to become what now has been designated a wetlands, Noddle said. \u201cBefore we knew it, plants were growing,\u201d Noddle said. \u201cIt's crazy.\u201d\n\nJobeun said much time has been spent seeking different ways around the protected corridor and wetlands. He said it would be more time-consuming and costly to continue to battle.\n\nThe corps project manager involved in the discussions was unavailable for comment Friday.\n\nTo preserve the corridor and wetlands, a once-proposed main south-north road through the property has been removed from the layout. A smaller road closer to Costco now is to connect Burt Street to the campus.\n\nDiscussions with Costco about that road caused further delay, Jobeun said.\n\nJobeun and the developer also met with neighbors in the Lake Candlewood residential area, who were concerned about increased traffic. Jobeun told the Planning Board that he'd work further with area residents and city engineers on improvements.\n\nThe Planning Board gave the green light to the redesigned project, given certain conditions, including sidewalks and confirmation of walking trails. The redesign now goes to City Council, and Jobeun is confident it's moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe tried to make the best of a tough situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hasn't been an easy road.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "A long-delayed commercial and housing project to be built on what's left of Blumkin family property northwest of 122nd Street and West Dodge Road has revved up again.", "title": "Redesign revs up plan for West Dodge project", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/money/redesign-revs-up-plan-for-west-dodge-project/article_ecbab8d4-6433-574e-a84c-63cafb380485.html", "image": {"width": 694, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/93/093ac65a-8b33-51f1-bd10-b6e5c8c1c110/5331ac365b697.image.jpg", "height": 759}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A long-delayed commercial and housing project to be built on what's left of Blumkin family property northwest of 122nd Street and West Dodge Road has revved up again.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "money", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "money"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda099\"", "article_summary": "A long-delayed commercial and housing project to be built on what's left of Blumkin family property northwest of 122nd Street and West Dodge Road has revved up again.\nToday, a chunk of property in front of Costco along the West Dodge frontage road remains vacant and available for tenants.\nIt was largely discussions over how to deal with the government-protected drainage corridor and wetlands that held up the second phase, said Blumkin lawyer Larry Jobeun.\nFinally, he said, the big dirt lot off of West Dodge appears ready to be transformed.\nThe Planning Board gave the green light to the redesigned project, given certain conditions, including sidewalks and confirmation of walking trails."}
