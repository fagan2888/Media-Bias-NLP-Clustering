Thumbs down to the school for dropping a student production of \"American Idiot\" after the call for auditions went out. The drama club will instead put on the much tamer \"Little Shop of Horrors.\"\n\nEnfield High's drama coach said that \"American Idiot,\" a Broadway musical based on the 2004 rock opera album by the popular band Green Day, worried some parents. It does include swearing, sex scenes and drug use. But the band's front man, Billie Joe Armstrong, politely argued on Instagram for putting on the less explicit high school rendition \u2014 instantly launching Enfield into the national spotlight.\n\nThe show should go on \u2014 the high school version, of course. But Enfield officials have a knack for such regrettable vetoes, as when town leaders canceled a 2011 library showing of Michael Moore's \"Sicko,\" a documentary on health care reform \u2014 which The Nation magazine promptly labeled \"a blatant display of censorship.\"\n\n\u2022\n\nThumbs down too to administrators at Ansonia High School, who recently turned over to police a 15-year-old who substituted \"ISIS\" for \"the United States of America\" while reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Another thumbs down to the police, who turned the case over to the Department of Homeland Security. Sure, the kid acted like an obnoxious wiseacre, but what he needed was a trip to the principal's office, not a federal investigation. Overreacting does not enhance security.\n\n\u2022\n\nThumbs up to Glastonbury High School, which after decades of having the men wear black or blue graduation gowns and the women wear white, has decided that all students \u2014 male and female alike \u2014 will wear blue gowns with white sashes. Although the school's principal officially changed the policy, the idea was generated by students and faculty, who didn't see the point of gender-specific graduation gowns. \"We are all one school,\" a former GHS principal said. Good point; students aren't separated by sex in classes, so why do so at commencement?\n\n\u2022\n\nThumbs up to Access Health CT for enrolling more than 100,000 people in health insurance plans since Nov. 1. The point of the Affordable Care Act was to get everyone coverage, and Connecticut has served as a national model for getting people signed up. The enrollment deadline for those who still lack insurance is Jan. 31. The penalty is getting steep \u2014 $695, or up to 2.5 percent of your adjusted gross income, whichever is greater. Go to accesshealthct.com if you're still without insurance.\n\n\u2022\n\nCongratulations to New Britain for raising its Standard & Poor's Ratings Services grade to A-plus, the highest since 2008. The Hardware City was rated BBB by S&P just a year ago. The city under Mayor Erin Stewart has done good work getting the budget to balance without raiding reserves or resorting to one-time revenue gimmickry. Thumbs up.\n\n\u2022\n\nThumbs up to Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin's appointment of Bonnie J. Malley, a top Phoenix Companies executive, as the city's chief operating officer. Ms. Malley, who lives downtown, has the financial experience that will help the city avoid fiscal pitfalls. She will leave the Phoenix once its merger with Nassau Reinsurance is complete.\n\n\u2022\n\nThumbs up to the Connecticut Airport Authority and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who \u2014 with some deal-sweeteners \u2014 have persuaded American Airlines to restore nonstop service from Bradley International Airport to Los Angeles. In addition, United Airlines will offer nonstop flights to Denver starting in May. More flights are good news not just for the traveling public, but for the state, which collects a fee every time a plane lands at Bradley.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Thumbs Down To Enfield High For Dropping Green Day Play", "date": "2016-01-27", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Hartford Courant", "author": "Hartford Courant", "og": {"site_name": "courant.com", "description": "Enfield High, what were you thinking?
