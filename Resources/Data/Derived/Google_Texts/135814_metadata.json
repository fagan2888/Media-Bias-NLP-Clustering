(AP) - J.J. Avila scored 28 points, had 14 rebounds and ignited a scrum in the second half that led to several technical fouls and an ejection in Colorado State's 92-87 win over rival Air Force on Saturday.\n\nThe Rams were leading 52-36 with 17:34 remaining in the first half when Avila went over Zach Kocur's back for an offensive rebound and when both players went to the floor, Avila had Kocur in a headlock. Matt Mooney rushed up and punched Avila in the back, and a pushing battle ensued.\n\nThe game was delayed 17 minutes as referees handed out three technicals, ejected Mooney for a flagrant foul and administered the free throws, with both teams making three.\n\nAvila scored on the ensuing possession to make it 57-39.\n\nThe scuffle brought Air Force (8-7, 1-3 Mountain West) to life, and the Falcons cut the Rams' lead to 84-81 with 50.5 seconds remaining after a Hayden Graham 3-pointer. Colorado State (15-2, 2-2) responded by making eight of 10 free throws down the stretch to escape with the narrow victory.\n\nGian Clavell chipped in 13 for the Rams, and Joe De Ciman had 12.\n\nMax Yon led Air Force with 25 points, while Marek Olesinski added 20 and Justin Hammonds had 13 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nColorado State turned a 40-30 rebounding advantage into 12 second-chance points, and the Falcons shot just 58 percent (11 of 19) from the free-throw line. The teams combined for 38 fouls in the intensely physical battle.\n\nAir Force was able to keep the game close thanks to a season-high 16 3-pointers and had 25 assists on 30 baskets.\n\nColorado State used a 17-5 run late in the first half to build a double-digit advantage and led 48-28 at the break. The Rams shot 61 percent from the field in the first half, while Air Force hit just 37 percent of its attempts.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "J.J.
