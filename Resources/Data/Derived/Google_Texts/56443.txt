Legendary Restaurant Brands CEO Mangiamele Goes on Offensive on Behalf of Franchisees





Legendary Restaurant Brands Chairman & CEO Paul Mangiamele was invited to appear on FOX Business Channel’s “Mornings with Maria” program on Dec. 1 to talk about ways to improve the business climate for small business owners. Mangiamele offered a forceful argument, on behalf of franchisees and other small businesses, against over-regulation, higher taxes, higher minimum wages, Obamacare and other job-killing, margin-shrinking policies emanating from Washington. He also offered his take on the 2016 Presidential race and the ticket he thinks would be best for U.S. business, and all Americans.
