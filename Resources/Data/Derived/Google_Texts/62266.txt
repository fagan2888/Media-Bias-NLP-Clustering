Comedian Jay Leno canceled his upcoming speaking engagement at the Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor, Trade show in January, 2015 after the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV) launched a shame campaign against him.

CSGV said there was nothing funny about a comedian speaking at the SHOT Show and that Leno, in particular, was “helping to legitimize a crass commercialization which values profit over human lives.”

The press announcement for the shame campaign, CSGV said: “The SHOT Show is the largest firearms trade show in the world. Its sole purpose is to allow manufacturers to market their wares; and it provides no voice to those whose lives have been destroyed by a loosely-regulated industry.”

They recounted how Adam Lanza stole and then misused guns nearly two years ago at Sandy Hook Elementary and made clear the fact that the SHOT Show is sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF)–a group dedicated to defending the Second Amendment and the exercise of the rights protected by that amendment.

In response, Leno threw in the towel. On November 19, Mother Jones reported that Leno called NSSF and told them he wished to cancel his speaking engagement at the event.
