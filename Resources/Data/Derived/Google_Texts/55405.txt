The Milwaukee Bucks signed guard Jorge Gutierrez to a multi-year contract, general manager John Hammond announced Tuesday.

The 6-foot-3 Gutierrez, a star player at Abraham Lincoln High School in Denver, averaged 3.6 points and 2.1 rebounds in seven games for the Bucks earlier this season. He was playing for the Canton Charge in the NBA D-League, averaging 13.5 points, 5.1 assists, 4.4 rebounds and 1.7 steals.

In his NBA career, he played with Brooklyn before being traded to Philadelphia on Dec. 11, 2014. He was subsequently waived by the 76ers.

Gutierrez played with the Mexican national team in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup where he was one of three former Lincoln players on the team.
