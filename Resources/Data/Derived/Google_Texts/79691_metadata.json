But the kinds of weapons going to those countries \u2014 Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and others \u2014 have shifted dramatically.\n\nThe earlier deals focused largely on longer-term investments, maintaining existing equipment, and building up weapons stocks. The more recent ones have been largely for tactical equipment: bombs, missiles, tanks, armored trucks and antitank weapons needed on the battlefield today, according to documents and U.S. government officials.\n\nRelated: Putin: Turkey Buys Oil from ISIS, and Erdogan Knows All About It\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly the political will inside the U.S. government to ensure that our partners have what they need as quickly as they can get it,\u201d Gregory Kausner, deputy assistant secretary of state for regional security and security assistance, said in an interview late last month. Kausner, a Navy reservist, stepped down from his position at State last week because he is deploying.\n\nSince the U.S.-led coalition began bombing ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria in August 2014, the State Department and the Defense Department, which facilitate arms deals with allies and partners, have approved more than $5.4 billion worth of equipment for Iraq alone. That\u2019s actually down from $13.8 billion in the previous time span, but many of those prior deals (such as a $6.1 billion deal for Apache attack helicopters) were never put on contract by then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki\u2019s government.\n\nState has also OKed more than $24 billion to Saudi Arabia, up from $15.5 billion, and more than $4.2 billion to the United Arab Emirates, down slightly from $4.8 billion. (A caveat: that $45.8 billion represents deals that have been approved and announced \u2014 but not necessarily finalized. Many a proposed deal has fallen apart even though it received the necessary permissions.)\n\n\u201cDefinitely, the demand signal has increased,\u201d Kausner said. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition from our partners that they need capability [and] they need it now.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Job Now: Fight ISIS All-In as Turkey Plays Both Sides\n\nLast month, the U.S. approved a $1.29 billion deal with Saudi Arabia for more than 22,000 precision-guided bombs, the same type being used by the U.S. and allies to strike ISIS in Iraq and Syria. In October, State signed off on an $11 billion deal for new Saudi warships. Also approved: $313 million in Hellfire missiles for the United Kingdom, Egypt, Lebanon and France.\n\nThere are anti-tank missiles for Morocco and Lebanon, rockets for Jordan and upgrades for Saudi\u2019s AWACS command planes. Attack planes for Lebanon have also been OKed, as have air-to-air missiles for Turkey.\n\nFor Iraq, whose government has complained about how slowly it gets American arms, the U.S. has approved Abrams tanks, armored Humvees, ammunition, and sustainment and logistics work.\n\n\u201cEverybody is certainly working longer hours, there\u2019s higher caseloads, but I think that there is also a recognition that \u2026 this is really a core part of our national security strategy at this point to build the capacity of our partners,\u201d Kausner said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to require us to answer the call.\u201d\n\nRelated: With ISIS Making Millions, U.S. Boosts Its Attacks on Oil Fields\n\nStill, William LaPlante, who stepped down as Air Force acquisition chief Monday, said last month that he feared theU.S. was moving too slowly to fulfill arms requests by countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE. China, he noted, is selling drones in the region.\n\n\u201cWe need to do something about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s urgent \u2026 Do you think China has an interagency process like us to buy [drones]?\u201d\n\nWhile the U.S. and allies have conducted airstrikes againstISIS in Iraq, Syria and even Libya, American officials have stressed the need to better train and arm forces in the countries that the militants directly threaten.\n\n\u201cThere is a recognition that the threat is such that requires our partners to build up their legitimate defense capabilities,\u201d Kausner said. \u201cThat\u2019s everything from a desire to improve institutional capacity, to ground forces, to [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance], to precision strike.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Fight Against ISIS Has New Price Tag: $5 Billion and Counting\n\nAdded Kausner: \u201cWe have an opportunity now to really build true capability from the ground up. That capability will certainly in the medium-to-long-term equip our partners to truly share some of the burden with us.\u201d\n\nBeyond arms sales, State is looking more broadly at how it aligns assistance funding for foreign militaries through regional funding as opposed to a specific country, Kausner said.\n\n\u201cTypically, the way we\u2019ve allocated foreign military financing is: we\u2019ve planned for specific bilateral lines and many of those bilateral lines are required by Congress, so we\u2019re not in any way circumventing those mandates,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the space where there is flexibility, instead of in some instances planning for strict bilateral accounts, we\u2019ve pooled the resources in regional pots. Those regional funds enable us to draw down in the year of execution and allocate the funding toward priority areas.\u201d\n\nThat way if a situation like ISIS pops up, State could rapidly shift money to multiple countries in a region.\n\n\u201cIt allows us to move the money toward those priority areas very, very quickly,\u201d Kausner said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on DefenseOne.
