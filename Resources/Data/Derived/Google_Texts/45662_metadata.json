Marco Rubio visited Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, Monday, the site where nine African-American parishioners were shot and killed in June.\n\nThe GOP presidential candidate visited the church without any media in tow during a swing through the early primary state, according to an Associated Press report. Rubio\u2019s visit came ahead of a town hall meeting where he spoke to an audience of roughly 1,000 people.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAt that town hall meeting, Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott mentioned Rubio\u2019s visit to the church, but Rubio did not discuss it in his remarks.\n\nThe Florida senator did, however, praise the \u201cextraordinary forgiveness\u201d shown by the families of some of the shooting victims, who announced in court during an initial hearing that they had forgiven alleged shooter Dylann Roof.\n\nRoof, arrested in North Carolina the day after the shooting, confessed to the Emanuel AME shooting and said the attack was an attempt to incite a race war. Among the nine victims of the massacre was South Carolina State Sen. Clementa Pinckney, the church\u2019s pastor.\n\nAlso Monday, Rubio dove into the issue of the large number of Syrians trying to flee their nation, saying he\u2019d be open to accepting some of them in the United States. Speaking in an interview on Boston Herald radio, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve always been a country that\u2019s been willing to accept people who have been displaced, and I would be open to that.\u201d\n\nRubio qualified the remark by saying he would want to guarantee that terrorists were not among the migrants.\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed, Rubio also said a long-term strategy would provide for, certain populations, such as Syrian Christians, to ultimately be able to return to their land.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The GOP contender visits Charleston for a town hall meeting.", "title": "Rubio visits site of South Carolina church shootings", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/marco-rubio-2016-emanuel-ame-church-visit-213389", "image": "http://static.politico.com/65/fd/c6f8927244fbaab303297de7a6d1/150907-marco-rubio-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The GOP contender visits Charleston for a town hall meeting.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf24\"", "article_summary": "AP Photo Rubio visits site of South Carolina church shootings The GOP contender visits Charleston for a town hall meeting.\nFlorida Sen.
