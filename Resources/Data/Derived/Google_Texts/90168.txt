Secretary of State John Kerry ripped into doubters of climate change Sunday, dismissing such people as members of the “Flat Earth Society̶1; who are “simply burying their heads in the sand.”

Kerry, who has framed global warming as a centerpiece of his diplomatic agenda, kicked off a tour in Jakarta, Indonesia devoted to climate change.

"We should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts," Kerry told students at the U.S. Embassy-run American Center. "Nor should we allow any room for those who think that the costs associated with doing the right thing outweigh the benefits."

"The science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply burying their heads in the sand," he added. "We don't have time for a meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society.”

The Obama administration has launched a new campaign to warn of the dangers of global warming, as President Obama traveled to California Friday to link the state's historic drought to climate change.

Obama also trumpeted new Environmental Protection Agency regulations that would force power plants to cut down on their carbon emissions, controversial rules that will lead to a flurry of court challenges in coming months and years.

And Kerry on Sunday framed increasingly volatile weather as an issue of national security.
