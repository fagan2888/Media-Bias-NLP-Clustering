As we reported, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice joined Grammy-nominated concert violinist Jenny Oaks Baker in an Amazing Grace duet. Apparently, BET is under the impression that Rice did this after being inspired by Obama singing at the funeral of Rev. Clementa Pinckney in Charleston.

“Rice’s single comes on the heels of President Barack Obama performing the timeless hymn at the funeral of Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who was one of the victims of the Charleston Massacre.”
