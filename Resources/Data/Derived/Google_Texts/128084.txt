700 physicians to form ACO in Portland

The Portland (Ore.) InterHospital Physicians Association has announced plans to launch a new accountable care organization called Care Connect Northwest. Twelve physician organizations, with approximately 700 primary care physicians and specialists, plan to participate in the new ACO.

"This new effort is at the heart of health reform as framed by the Affordable Care Act," said Care Connect Northwest Manager Stephen Townsend in a statement. "We are helping physician groups move away from the traditional fee-for-service structure to a more value-based model of reimbursement."

Portland IPA is formalizing contracts with two payers and expects to announce the partnership next week, according to coverage in the Portland Business Journal.

According to the report, the group has launched a quality committee to help physician groups gain accreditation from the National Committee for Quality Assurance and has implemented an electronic referral system so physicians can connect and share patient's EHR information.
