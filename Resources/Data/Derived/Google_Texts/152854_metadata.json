His response, via The Oklahoman\u2019s Darnell Mayberry:\n\n\u201cYou guys really don\u2019t know (expletive). \u201cTo be honest, man, I\u2019m only here talking to y\u2019all because I have to. So I really don\u2019t care. Y\u2019all not my friends. You\u2019re going to write what you want to write. You\u2019re going to love us one day and hate us the next. That\u2019s a part of it. So I just learn how to deal with y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nHis latest comments came a day after he told reporters during Friday\u2019s all-star media availability that players, not media, should be the ones who vote on NBA awards \u2014 even though media voted for him as the league\u2019s most valuable player last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 26 years old so I\u2019m in my mid-20s, almost to 30,\u201d Durant said. \u201cMy first few years in the league I was just finding myself. I think most of the time I reacted based off of what everybody else wanted and how they viewed me as a person. And I\u2019m just learning to be myself and not worry about what anybody says. I\u2019m going to make mistakes. I just want to show kids out here that athletes, entertainers, whoever, so-called celebrities, we aren\u2019t robots. We go through emotions. We go through feelings. And I\u2019m just trying to express mine and trying to help people along the way. But I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you that I\u2019m just this guy that got programmed to say the right stuff all the time and politically correct answers. I\u2019m done with that. I\u2019m just trying to be me and continue to grow as a man.\u201d\n\nWhile his teammate Russell Westbrook has a lengthy history of not wanting to deal with media, Durant\u2019s stance came to light last year, when he spoke to USA Today\u2019s Sam Amick:\n\n\u201cI just realized that I\u2019m just trying to be myself,\u201d Durant said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m upset, now I feel comfortable being upset. It\u2019s cool that I can be upset. I may cuss one time in an interview, or I may yell at my teammates. And it\u2019s all right. I understand that it\u2019s cool for me to be that way because that\u2019s me. I\u2019m human, and I have times when I\u2019m upset. I think that\u2019s what people didn\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nAnd when asked about his withdrawal from Team USA last summer:\n\n\u201cSeriously, to be honest, I was like \u2018(expletive) \u2019em.\u2019 You can write that, too. Seriously, though. I\u2019m just going to be me, man, and that\u2019s how I felt.\u201d\n\nAfter Durant\u2019s tirade, Wizards guard John Wall was asked for his thoughts on the media and the players\u2019 interaction with reporters.
