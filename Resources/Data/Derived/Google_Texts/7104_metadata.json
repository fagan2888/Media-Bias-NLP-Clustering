That\u2019s nearly one third of Americans.\n\nIn addition to the millions who lost their coverage last year, millions more recently learned their existing health insurance plan will be cancelled by year\u2019s end. New and/or renewed plan options are at least triple the cost due to premium and deductible increases, some by 400 percent. Nearly 66 percent of those employed by small businesses will lose their health coverage within one year.\n\nDemocrats voted into law the ACA\u2019s numerous regulations, penalties, and taxes imposed on the healthcare industry, effective Jan. 1, 2015, which will:\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nEliminate most existing health insurance plans by December 31, 2014,\n\nEliminate access and affordability to doctors patients have seen for years,\n\nEliminate care for nearly 60 percent of seniors dependent on Medicare (the ACA cut over $200 billion from Medicare),\n\nEnroll nearly 75 percent of Obamacare subscribers into Medicaid, which most doctors no longer accept,\n\nProvide no health insurance to people who need it the most: the unemployed who are uninsured,\n\nCreate a greater number of uninsured who cannot afford and don\u2019t qualify for health insurance.\n\nObama\u2019s claim, \u201cIf you like your private health insurance plan, you can keep your plan. Period\u201d (PolitiFact\u2019s 2013 \u201clie of the year\u201d) delivered on Obama\u2019s campaign promise of \u201cchange you can believe in.\u201d\n\nCONSIDER LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT.\n\nIf your Senator or Congressman is a Democrat, ask them why they did not implore Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to even acknowledge the more than 300 bills on his desk (many of which relate to job creation) he\u2019s refused to consider.\n\nAmerica\u2019s economy is no longer wage-based. Only 58 percent of working-age Americans are working, and wages account for only 44 percent of the economy. This has created an economic crisis on par with the Great Depression.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nToday, one quarter of Obama\u2019s America has been out of work for over one year. The actual 2014 long-term unemployment is 25 percent (September 2014 U-3 and U-6 rates), exactly the same as it was in 1933 during the Great Depression.\n\nCongress repeatedly chose not to extend long-term unemployment benefits throughout 2014. Americans who paid into the system who not only deserve, but also really need their insurance money, were brutally ignored and forgotten.\n\nCONSIDER YOUR DEBT vs. CONGRESSIONAL BAILOUTS.\n\nObama and your Senator or Congressman chose not to include eliminating your credit card or mortgage debt when they gave $182 billion to AIG\u2013the company primarily responsible for the mortgage crisis in 2008\u2013and gave $1.2 trillion to Wall Street banks, which by all accounts would be insolvent for their fiscally negligent investments resulting in total loss of their assets. And don\u2019t forget GM\u2019s failed bailout.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, which is not a federal institution, unexplainably lost $9 trillion of federal money and has no solution to recover it. What are your Senators or Congressmen doing about this?\n\nCONSIDER YOUR SAFETY AND FREDOM.\n\nDo you live in one of 17 states where your neighbors are Islamists training at a Jamaat ul-Fuqra jihad camp? If so, what are your Senators or Congressmen doing about this? And why have these Islamists not been deported?\n\nDid your Senator or Congressman work with Obama to send $8 billion to the Muslim Brotherhood? Does it bother you that your tax dollars are funding terrorists?\n\nDoes your Senator or Congressman support Agenda 21? This initiative became a \u201csoft law\u201d under President Clinton. With Secretary Hillary Clinton\u2019s support, Agenda 21 incorporates an Arms Trade Treaty, which authorizes the United Nations to confiscate Americans\u2019 private property and guns.\n\nBy all accounts, Americans are far worse off under President Obama than ever before. As Russian Xavier Lerma said:\n\n\u201cObama was elected [twice] by an illiterate society and is ready to continue his lies of less taxes while he raises them. He gives speeches of peace and love in the world while he promotes wars in Egypt, Libya, and Syria. He plans his next war with Iran as he fires or demotes his generals who get in the way. \u201cO\u2019bomber even keeps the war going along the Mexican border with projects like \u2018fast and furious\u2019 and there is still no sign of ending it. He is a Communist without question promoting the Communist Manifesto without calling it so. \u201cHis cult of personality mesmerizes those who cannot go beyond their ignorance. They will continue to follow him like those fools who still praise Lenin and Stalin in Russia. Obama\u2019s fools and Stalin\u2019s fools share the same drink of illusion.\u201d\n\nTherefore voters have an immediate opportunity to fire every incumbent and every politician who voted in favor of Obama\u2019s disastrous policies, and has contributed to the lowest approval rating of Congress of 7 percent.\n\nAmericans must demand constitutional amendments and ballot initiatives in their states, mandating term limits, a balanced budget, and fiscal transparency.\n\nOtherwise, Lerma and many others, including Mark Twain, will be proven right. They assess that Americans are \u201ca horde of ignorant, self-complacent simpletons who failed at [working]\u201d and got swept up by sensationalism promoted by the media \u201con their way to the poorhouse.\u201d\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vote out incumbents, politicians supporting Obama policies causing Depression-era devastation", "author": "Bethany Blankley", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Vote out incumbents, politicians supporting Obama policies causing Depression-era devastation", "title": "2014 Performance Evaluation Of Congress: You\u2019re Fired.", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1258, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/congress.jpg", "height": 800}, "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/2014-performance-evaluation-congress-youre-fired/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vote out incumbents, politicians supporting Obama policies causing Depression-era devastation", "title": "2014 Performance Evaluation Of Congress: You\u2019re Fired.", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/congress.jpg", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-03T17:28:55-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Expose Obama", "tag": "United Nations U.N.", "published_time": "2014-11-03T17:28:55-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "bailouts, xavier lerm, jamaat ul-fuqra jihad camp, , 2014 midterm elections, barack obama, congress, health, obamacare, terrorism, unemployment, united nations u.n., politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "In addition to the millions who lost their coverage last year, millions more recently learned their existing health insurance plan will be cancelled by year\u2019s end.\nThe Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, was President Obama\u2019s single legislative accomplishment, passed solely by Democrats.\nObama\u2019s claim, \u201cIf you like your private health insurance plan, you can keep your plan.\nAdvertisement - story continues belowThis election, are you better or worse off than you were before President Obama took office?\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues belowPresident Obama knew in 2010 that nearly 93 million Americans would lose their existing health insurance plans."}
