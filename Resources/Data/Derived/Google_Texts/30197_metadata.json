In fact, it\u2019s literally a class-action trial under way in a federal district court in Oakland, California.\n\nRELATED LINKS The lawsuit contends the NCAA should permit former and current college basketball and football players to profit from the use of their names, likeness and images in television broadcasts, video games and other media. The case\u2019s origins go back to a lawsuit first brought by former UCLA basketball player Ed O\u2019Bannon after he saw his likeness in a video game. It\u2019s evolved into a much bigger suit against the NCAA, with potentially bigger implications.\n\nToday, NCAA president Mark Emmert took the stand.\n\nWe\u2019re joined now by Michael McCann. He is director of the Sports and Entertainment Law Institute at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nMichael McCann, welcome back to the NewsHour.\n\nSo, tell us, at its core, what is this case about?\n\nMICHAEL MCCANN, University of New Hampshire School of Law: Sure.\n\nSo, at its core, the Ed O\u2019Bannon case is about whether or not Division I men\u2019s basketball and football players, so students at the highest level, should be able to negotiate for their name, image and likeness, when they\u2019re on television, when they\u2019re in archival video, when they\u2019re on Web video, when they\u2019re in video games, when they\u2019re somehow related to apparel or eve trading cards.\n\nAnything using their name, image and likeness, they\u2019re arguing they should be able to negotiate money for that, some type of compensation. Now, under NCAA rules, they are barred from doing so. The NCAA has a system called amateurism, which focuses on a stark distinction between professional and amateur sports.\n\nO\u2019Bannon argues that distinction is flawed and it\u2019s in violation of antitrust law. And the basic antitrust theory is this. The NCAA and its members have purportedly joined hands, so the NCAA conferences, individual colleges, to prevent them from negotiating, and that\u2019s an anti-competitive market and they should be able to negotiate.\n\nAnd they hope that Judge Wilken will issue an injunction allowing them to do so.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So they\u2019re arguing the antitrust provision is their way \u2014 it\u2019s their way in, in this argument?\n\nMICHAEL MCCANN: That\u2019s right, Judy.\n\nTheir way in is the antitrust argument, the idea that there\u2019s a cartel, they have called it, a conspiracy, others who are making money off of their name, image and likeness and denying them the opportunity to even negotiate. The athletes have said, look, we\u2019re not asking for millions. We just want to have an opportunity to negotiate.\n\nNow, the NCAA \u2014 in fairness to the NCAA, it has a number of arguments, including the fact that they have had this institution for years and that they believe college sports would be harmed if student athletes were quasi-professional, as they have described them.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: How do they argue they would be harmed?\n\nMICHAEL MCCANN: Well, the NCAA believes that some schools would cut their sports programs. If student athletes, specifically men\u2019s basketball and football players, are able to negotiate for their name, image and likeness, some of that money would have gone to their colleges, will now go to them.\n\nSo that could require schools to lose some money, and it could be more expensive to have sports, so the fear is that, if this system comes about, some schools will cut their sports programs, or more likely cut some aspects of their sports programs, and there\u2019s another area of law that we know is called Title IX that would prevent schools from just cutting women\u2019s teams so the women\u2019s teams would remain, but the men\u2019s teams that are, say, golf, tennis, maybe baseball, lacrosse, other sports that are not typically generating revenue would be axed from the program.\n\nAnd the NCAA believes that once you allow student athletes to be essentially professionals \u2014 now, the O\u2019Bannon team would say that is untrue, but let\u2019s just go with that \u2014 that fans would become less interested in college sports, less money would go into it, and as a result schools would be more inclined to downsize their sports programs.\n\nSo that\u2019s the central thesis.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And how does the plaintiff, how does Ed O\u2019Bannon himself and the people who are bringing this suit who represent his point of view, how do they counter that argument?\n\nMICHAEL MCCANN: Well, part of the argument, Judy, is they argue that that\u2019s just not true, that college sports fans would still like sports in college even if student athletes were able to negotiate for their name, image and likeness.\n\nAnd they would likely do so not individually, but through a trade association. So the idea that there would be sports agents on campus negotiating contracts, that could be true for some of the elite college athletes, but it\u2019s unlikely to be true, at least O\u2019Bannon argues, for the mainstream basketball and football player.\n\nSo they believe that the parade of terribles that might occur really isn\u2019t true. And they have also argued, regardless of whether it\u2019s true or not, that doesn\u2019t mean that antitrust law is violated by the system, that a system where they\u2019re denied an opportunity to negotiate because of a \u2014 quote, unquote \u2014 \u201cconspiracy\u201d or \u201ccartel,\u201d that that\u2019s illegal, regardless of the effect it would have on college sports.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Now, finally, Michael McCann, whatever the judge rules, this is an argument that goes on, and there are other efforts to change the relationship between college athletes and the sports they play, are there not?\n\nMICHAEL MCCANN: Yes, that\u2019s exactly right, Judy.\n\nSo, as a starting point, let\u2019s say O\u2019Bannon wins. There will be an appeal. And an appeal will likely take years. It would have to go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and then potentially to the United States Supreme Court, so there won\u2019t be a resolution in this case for some time.\n\nBut, like you mentioned, there are other litigations going on. There\u2019s an argument brought by Kain Colter, a football player at Northwestern University, who argues that he\u2019s an employee, that college football players are employees, and they should be able to unionize. That\u2019s before the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThere\u2019s a separate case over whether or not college scholarships for sports are illegal. The NCAA is being attacked with a number of cases. And it would have to run the table to keep it the way it is. And that seems unlikely to happen.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will continue to watch this trial under way in California.\n\nFor today, Michael McCann, we thank you.\n\nMICHAEL MCCANN: Thank you, Judy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A class-action lawsuit by former UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon contends that the NCAA should permit former and current college basketball and football players to profit from the use of their names, images, or likenesses in media like video games or TV broadcasts.
