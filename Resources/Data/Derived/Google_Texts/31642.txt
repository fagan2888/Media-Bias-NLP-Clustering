A Canadian’s passionate defense of Barack Obama offered a rare boost to the Democratic president after the Republican wave in last week’s election. That Canadian just can’t understand why American’s don’t like Obama as much as Canadians.

A letter to the editor at the Detroit Free Press (titled “America doesn’t know how good they have it with Obama”) from Richard Brunt, of Victoria, British Columbia, had a strong message for Americans who disapprove of their president.

“When you are done with Obama, could you send him our way?”

Brunt began the letter, saying, “Many of us Canadians are confused by the U.S. midterm elections.”

He credited Obama with lower the unemployment rate and lower gas prices.

“America is leading the world once again and respected internationally — in sharp contrast to the Bush years,” the letter said. “Obama brought soldiers home from Iraq and killed Osama bin Laden.”

“So, Americans vote for the party that got you into the mess that Obama just dug you out of? This defies reason,” Brunt wrote.

The Christian Science Monitor characterized the letter as becoming highly popular in both the United States and Canada, and pointed to Obama’s past popularity in Canada.

Canada’s National Post previously called Obama, “Canada’s American President.”

The Globe and Mail newspaper did a poll in 2012 that found Obama would have beaten Republican Mitt Romney with 65 percent of the vote.

Brunt’s letter has spread among progressive circles, as much of the left had expressed disappointment in the president before the election, the Christian Science Monitor reported.

“[H]e’s right,” John Prager of Americans Against the Tea Party wrote of Brunt’s letter. “Apathetic and delusional voters alike allowed Republicans like hog-castrating psychopath Joni Ernst to rise to a position of authority, Mitch McConnell to keep his job, and a majority that seems to believe the best and only solution to our nation’s problems is to rid itself of the Affordable Care Act.”
