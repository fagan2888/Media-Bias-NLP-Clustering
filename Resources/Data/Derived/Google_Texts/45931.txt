A popular Philadelphia Kosher bakery suddenly closed after more than 50 years of business.

Hesh’s Bakery, located on 7721 Castor Avenue in the Rhawnhurst section of the city, posted the following message on its doors and website over the weekend.

“It is with a very sad and heavy heart to tell you that Hesh’s Bakery is now closed and will not be reopening. We thank you for your patronage. We will miss you.”

The owners of the bakery have not yet revealed why they suddenly closed.

The bakery, which opened in 1959, provided Kosher products for families and synagogues in the Greater Philadelphia region.
