He\u2019s a big part of our future.\u201d\n\nNurkic is the headliner of what can be viewed as the Nuggets International Movement. Thirty-five percent of the Denver roster is international \u2014 Nurkic (Bosnia), Danilo Gallinari (Italy), Nikola Jokic (Serbia), Emmanuel Mudiay (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Joffrey Lauvergne (France).\n\nAll have proven they can play in the NBA. But the question many have is: Can the Nuggets win big with them? The team\u2019s front office is betting that answer is yes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always taken the approach that we don\u2019t want to be jaded toward any region or any type of players,\u201d said Nuggets general manager Tim Connelly. \u201cWhether he\u2019s from Kansas or Kaunas (in Lithuania), we want to use the same healthy objective eye in seeing who would most fit in Denver.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets didn\u2019t make a concentrated effort to go heavy internationally, Connelly said, but there has been a focus to find talent that others might overlook, wherever that might take them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put a lot of emphasis in international scouting. \u2026 We want to be very well informed with any player in the world,\u201d Connelly said. \u201cCertainly the more well informed we are, hopefully we make better decisions. It just so happens that when we\u2019ve selected guys, signed guys, traded for guys, we\u2019ve had a pretty big international influence.\u201d\n\nMalone needs no convincing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care where you\u2019re from,\u201d Malone said. \u201cIf you can play, I\u2019m a fan of yours.\u201d\n\nOthers do need convincing. On one hand, teams are speaking through their signings. There were 100 international players from 37 countries and territories on opening-day NBA rosters this season, the second season in a row of at least 100 foreign players. On the other hand, there has been a lot of questions in basketball circles as to whether rosters heavy on international talent are the best way to build a championship contender.\n\nStepping on a stereotype of international basketball players\n\n\n\nTeams such as the Spurs provide a case for optimism. San Antonio won the 2014 championship with nine international players. On the other hand, none of the past 19 international players selected in the NBA draft have made even one all-star appearance.\n\nAnd, though the number of international players on opening- day rosters has risen from 83 in 2009 to 100, the biggest, most impactful international stars are aging. Dallas\u2019 Dirk Nowitzki, arguably the greatest international player ever, is in the twilight of his career, as are Chicago\u2019s Pau Gasol and San Antonio guards Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.\n\nThe success of those stars over the past decade led more and more teams to draft outside the country, but there haven\u2019t been many standout players following in their footsteps. That could be about to change. Boos that rained down on draft night last summer have already given way to chants of \u201cPorzingis! Porzingis!\u201d from the crowd at Madison Square Garden. Fans there have been transformed into believers that Kristaps Porzingis, the fourth overall pick last year, will be The Next Big Thing.\n\nMudiay has been the headliner in Denver, but internal excitement over Jokic\u2019s future is high. It took one week at the beginning of the July for Malone to fall in love with Jokic\u2019s skill set. More than two months into the season, not only has nothing changed, Malone\u2019s belief in Jokic\u2019s future in the NBA has strengthened.\n\n\u201cFor a long time the stereotype was most international players were soft,\u201d Malone said.\n\nIt\u2019s a stereotype that former Nuggets draft pick Evan Fournier said is \u201csuper hard\u201d to shake.\n\n\u201cYou have to fight from Day One,\u201d said Fournier, a native of France who is third on Orlando in scoring this season. \u201cSo let\u2019s say you have a bad ankle, and it\u2019s really a bad ankle. It\u2019s like, \u2018Ah, he\u2019s not used to this level, blah, blah blah.\u2019 No, I just hurt myself. That\u2019s it. But you\u2019ve got to go through it. You have to establish yourself, you have to prove that you can play. That makes you stronger.\u201d\n\nMalone insists the toughness of his international players shouldn\u2019t be questioned.\n\n\u201cYou look at our team \u2014 Nurkic is not soft, Joffrey Lauvergne is not soft,\u201d he said. \u201cJokic looks like the little kid next door, but he has a competitive fire about him. I think international players are more skilled, I think they have a better feel for the game. That\u2019s a credit to the coaching they get at a young age, where it\u2019s not just AAU basketball. They\u2019re actually being taught how to play the game.\u201d\n\nNuggets have one of NBA\u2019s top international scouting staffs\n\n\n\nSeven of the Nuggets\u2019 10 draft day picks and acquisitions since 2011 were international players. That\u2019s the biggest percentage of any NBA team during that time period. Four of them were signed by the current management team, which has been in place since 2013. Only one of those, guard Nikola Radicevic, isn\u2019t with the team now, but he might come over in the next couple of seasons.\n\nConnelly cut his teeth early in his career as an international scout, and Nuggets assistant general manager Arturas Karnisovas is a former FIBA Europe player of the year. Toss in savvy young international scout Rafal Juc, and the Nuggets have a well respected group.\n\n\u201cRafal is young but very well connected,\u201d said Can Pelister, director of scouting for NBGeneration, a scouting service and website that helps professional and college teams. \u201cHaving Karnisovas is also a big advantage for them in opening doors. Connelly spent a lot of time traveling and scouting outside the U.S. So they just don\u2019t have Rafal, who is great, but a great group of people who are well connected around the world with a knowledge about basketball. They are for sure one of the top three, four international scouting staffs in the NBA.\u201d\n\nInsiders have praised the Nuggets on the foresight to grab Jokic in the second round of the 2014 draft, because the big man probably would have been a first-round draft pick in 2015.\n\nBut projections are only as good as the realized expectations. And the Nuggets (13-24) are struggling as their young talent learns the NBA game.\n\n\u201cA team can be competitive if you find the right players and put them in a good system,\u201d Pelister said. \u201cThere are not international and U.S. players. There are good and bad players. And a system you play.\n\n\u201cIf you have good players and good system, you will win.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nCHARLOTTE AT DENVER\n\nWhen: 6 p.m. Sunday\n\nTV/Radio: ALT2/NBA; 104.3 FM\n\nSpotlight on Kemba Walker:\n\nHe struggled Saturday in a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, but this has been Walker\u2019s best season as a professional. He leads the team with a career-high 19.3 points per game and is also experiencing career highs in field-goal percentage, 3-point field-goal percentage and free-throw percentage.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets:\n\nThis is the start of a season-long, eight-game homestand. And that\u2019s good and bad for the team, which is 5-11 at the Pepsi Center this season. \u201cOn paper, you say \u2018eight-game homestand, that\u2019s going to be great for us,\u2019 \u201d coach Michael Malone said. \u201cBut then two things hit me: A) We\u2019ve struggled at home, and B) I think we\u2019re playing all playoff teams.\u201d The Nuggets are looking to snap a four-game home losing streak, their last win coming Dec. 14.\n\nHornets:\n\nCharlotte lost its sixth consecutive game Saturday, 97-83 to the L.A. Clippers. So while this is technically a back-to-back set for the Hornets, they were in town Saturday night, able to get a full night\u2019s sleep. \u2026 Nicolas Batum did not play in Saturday\u2019s contest, missing his fourth consecutive game with a sprained right second toe.\n\nChristopher Dempsey, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets general manager Tim Connelly thinks highly of international players, has top international scouting staff", "title": "Nuggets general manager Tim Connelly thinks highly of international players, has top international scouting staff", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/09/nuggets-general-manager-tim-connelly-thinks-highly-of-international-players-has-top-international-scouting-staff/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160109__ec5ce350a1d303018d0f6a7067009c24p1.jpg", "height": 507}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160109__ec5ce350a1d303018d0f6a7067009c24p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-09T14:08:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:26:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s a big part of our future.\u201dNurkic is the headliner of what can be viewed as the Nuggets International Movement.\nI think international players are more skilled, I think they have a better feel for the game.\nOn the other hand, none of the past 19 international players selected in the NBA draft have made even one all-star appearance.\nAnd, though the number of international players on opening- day rosters has risen from 83 in 2009 to 100, the biggest, most impactful international stars are aging.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put a lot of emphasis in international scouting."}
