The first poll there since Trump\u2019s dominant performance in the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary on Monday shows that he has extended his lead in the Palmetto State ahead of its \u201cfirst in the South\u201d primary scheduled for Feb. 20.\n\nThe poll, conducted on behalf of the Augusta Chronicle, Fox News 5 Atlanta and Morris News Service, showed Trump with 36.3 percent support among likely voters in the GOP primary, up from 32 percent that last time the poll was in the field a month ago.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump: \u2018I Always Carry a Gun\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s gain did not come at the expense of his nearest rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who took 19.6 percent, up from 18 percent in January. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also gained, going from 11 percent to 14.6.\n\nThe biggest winner, though, was Ohio Gov. John Kasich. After a strong second place showing in New Hampshire, the poll found that his support in South Carolina had tripled, from 3 percent to 9 percent.\n\nThe news wasn\u2019t as good for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who had been polling at 13 percent in January after receiving the endorsement of South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. Following relatively weak performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bush is looking to rebound in South Carolina, but the poll suggests his momentum has been blunted, showing his support falling to 10.9 percent.\n\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a one-time Republican frontrunner, continues to fade from the race. After polling at 9 percent in South Carolina a month ago, he garnered only 5 percent this time.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If the Republican establishment wants to slow Donald Trump\u2019s momentum, it has its work cut out for it in South Carolina.", "title": "Trump, Kasich Get a Bump in Latest South Carolina Poll", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/12/Trump-Kasich-Get-Bump-Latest-South-Carolina-Poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-electiony-trump_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/12/Trump-Kasich-Get-Bump-Latest-South-Carolina-Poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-electiony-trump_3.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If the Republican establishment wants to slow Donald Trump\u2019s momentum, it has its work cut out for it in South Carolina.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Jeb Bush, who had been polling at 13 percent in January after receiving the endorsement of South Carolina Sen.
