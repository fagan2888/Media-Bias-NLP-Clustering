She was not a part of the failed raid that resulted in Brown\u2019s execution for treason.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Tubman worked with the Union Army in South Carolina and became the first woman to lead a combat assault, the Combahee River raid in 1863.\n\nAfter the war, Tubman worked for suffrage, dying seven years before the Tennessee General Assembly\u2019s vote ratified the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote in all elections.\n\nTubman\u2019s life reflects the fight for liberty that Americans should celebrate, and the narrative of that life is far more amenable to modern America than the complexity that Jackson presents.\n\nBut is it more reflective of who we are and how we came to be that way?\n\nI agree with Sen. Lamar Alexander\u2019s observation that, \u201cUnited States history is not Andrew Jackson versus Harriet Tubman. It is Andrew Jackson and Harriet Tubman, both heroes of a nation\u2019s work in progress toward great goals. It is unnecessary to diminish Jackson in order to honor Tubman.\u201d\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\nThe campaign to put a woman on a Federal Reserve note inevitably led supporters to diminish the stories of Jackson and Alexander Hamilton, whose portrait is on the face of the $10 bill.\n\nOriginally, the Treasury planned to replace Hamilton because the $10 bill was due for a redesign to upgrade security features, but the nation's first Treasury secretary got a public relations boost when the Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d became a hit.\n\nThe Jackson story, however, embodies Ronald Reagan's observation, \u201cIf you are explaining, you\u2019re losing.\u201d And Jackson\u2019s story needs a lot of context to be appreciated in the 21st century.\n\nWe know a lot of the bad, especially that Jackson owned slaves and that, as president, he supported and signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which led to the horrific \u201cTrail of Tears\u201d forced resettlements of Native Americans from their ancestral homelands to reservations west of the Mississippi River beginning in 1831.\n\nJackson\u2019s life embodies some of the worst aspects of our history, but as Jon Meacham of Nashville wrote in his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography \"American Lion\":\n\n\u201c\u2026 Of the early great presidents and Founders, Andrew Jackson is in many ways the most like us. In the saga of the Jackson presidency, one marked by both democratic triumphs and racist tragedies, we can see the American character in formation and in action.\"\n\nJackson\u2019s father died three weeks before his son was born along the North Carolina-South Carolina border in 1767; his mother died when he was 14 while nursing American prisoners on a ship in Charleston harbor.\n\nLike Tubman, he was driven to change his circumstances.\n\nHe became a frontier lawyer, land speculator, a founding father of the state of Tennessee, a war hero, and was elected the seventh president of the United States in 1828.\n\nIrony\n\nJackson did not support the concept of a national bank and vetoed the re-chartering of the Second Bank of the United States, and his requirement to pay for land sales with gold or silver instead of bank drafts played a significant role in the financial panic of 1837.\n\nBut when the Federal Reserve system was created in 1913, Jackson\u2019s portrait was selected for the $10 bill (Hamilton\u2019s portrait was featured on the $1,000 bill). In 1928, the Treasury put Jackson on the $20 bill and Hamilton on the $10.\n\nWe should embrace the complexity of our history, and maybe put Jackson back on the $10 bill.\n\nReach Frank Daniels III at 615-881-7039 and on Twitter @fdanielsiii.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1SC4HuM", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The debate over who should grace the $20 bill, Harriet Tubman or Andrew Jackson,  illustrates how easily we lose sight of our history.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "The debate over who should grace the $20 bill, Harriet Tubman or Andrew Jackson,  illustrates how easily we lose sight of our history.", "title": "We live in the America that Andrew Jackson fostered", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/frank-daniels/2016/04/23/we-live-america-andrew-jackson-fostered/83410440/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The debate over who should grace the $20 bill, Harriet Tubman or Andrew Jackson,  illustrates how easily we lose sight of our history.", "title": "We live in the America that Andrew Jackson fostered", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7776231d9b9b21b92f06dec3a9a7d3f4d07e3645/c=0-143-1673-1816&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/22/Nashville/Nashville/635969493081824839-Harriet-Tubman-Civil-War-Woodcut-copy.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Harriet Tubman", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Harriet Tubman", "title": "We live in the America that Andrew Jackson fostered", "author": "Frank Daniels III", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/frank-daniels", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e2579f24c3b3ce5580addc294296d383c99a21bd/c=0-145-1673-2376/local/-/media/2016/04/22/Nashville/Nashville/635969493081824839-Harriet-Tubman-Civil-War-Woodcut-copy.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/961a1bf1a57e664ad2bcd3bed5fe6b21e3b86e78/c=0-143-1673-1816/local/-/media/2016/04/22/Nashville/Nashville/635969493081824839-Harriet-Tubman-Civil-War-Woodcut-copy.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ef041b6df1be97da9de30377844b2b25098a7ac/c=0-20-1673-1278/local/-/media/2016/04/22/Nashville/Nashville/635969493081824839-Harriet-Tubman-Civil-War-Woodcut-copy.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9087e1619c6630844a7a82f303a294a7c254e9b7/c=0-0-1673-945&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/04/22/Nashville/Nashville/635969493081824839-Harriet-Tubman-Civil-War-Woodcut-copy.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-23T20:47:20.500000-05:00", "shorthed": "We live in the America that Andrew Jackson fostered", "articleid": 83410440, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/29d0b59b5e908cc80066aa8a0d59cd5201a909f2/c=0-0-1673-945/local/-/media/2016/04/22/Nashville/Nashville/635969493081824839-Harriet-Tubman-Civil-War-Woodcut-copy.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9901c3cb1f84f5f6fd111ccb50502436e798fedd/c=85-0-1593-2692/local/-/media/2016/04/22/Nashville/Nashville/635969493081824839-Harriet-Tubman-Civil-War-Woodcut-copy.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Harriet Tubman $20 bill, Andrew Jackson $20 bill, Andrew Jackson, Frank Daniels III"}, "article_summary": "It is Andrew Jackson and Harriet Tubman, both heroes of a nation\u2019s work in progress toward great goals.\nI agree with Sen.
