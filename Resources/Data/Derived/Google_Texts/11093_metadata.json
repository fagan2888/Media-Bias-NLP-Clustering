The question now is whether the system will be as much of an industry disruptor as CEO Stephen Klasko, MD, has promised.\n\n\u201cJefferson Health is truly different, because now patients can choose an organization that marries the nationally recognized and renowned academic medical center of Thomas Jefferson University with the outstanding clinical reputation and community connectedness of Abington,\u201d said Klasko.\n\nJefferson Health, with a medical school and five hospitals, is pursuing a mission of education, research and advanced medicine. It\u2019s on a slightly smaller scale than competitor Penn Medicine, which is researching diseases and treatments with $409 million in NIH funding, and offering access to clinical trials and new treatments through a soon-to-be five-hospital system with the planned acquisition of Lancaster General Health on the horizon.\n\nJefferson Health has been designed to extend the expertise of Jefferson clinicians to suburbanites through telehealth, urgent care centers and Abington\u2019s three community hospitals and clinics, rather than set up a regional referral network for an academic medical center to keep doing its best work at an urban hospital complex, Klasko said.\n\n\u201cThis new urban-suburban hub-and-hub model we believe is the first in the country,\u201d Kasko said. \u201cIf you look at a lot of mergers, it\u2019s a hub and spoke, an academic medical center in the city, and people have to travel and it increases the costs.\u201d\n\nJefferson Health\u2019s goal, Klasko said at a press conference, is \u201cgoing from a Blockbuster model to Netflix model, bringing Jefferson care and Jefferson and Abington care to the patients as close as they can be.\u201d\n\nThe new system, spanning Philadelphia and its northern suburbs, features five hospitals (including Abington Memorial on the edge of the city and Jefferson\u2019s downtown 950-bed University Hospital), nine outpatient centers and four urgent care centers, all staffed by 19,000 employees and 3,370 physicians. Among the executives at the new health system are Praveen Chopra, chief information and transformative innovative environment officer; Anne Boland Docimo, MD, chief medical officer; and John Ekarius, chief strategy officer. The board includes 11 trustees from the old Jefferson, 11 from the old Abington, plus two independent members.\n\n[Also: Tracking 2015 mergers and acquisitions]\n\nKlasko said Jefferson and Abington did not really have to combine to survive. Among the dozen-plus health systems and independent hospitals in metropolitan Philly, both were in solid financials prior to the merger. Jefferson had a net income of $103 million on $2.1 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2014, while Abington brought in $17.6 million on $774 million in revenue.\n\nBut last summer, when Klasko dined with Larry Merlis, Abington\u2019s CEO and COO of the new system, there was a connection that suggested the two organizations shared a vision for the future. \u201cAfter the glass of wine, it became more obvious that Jefferson and Abington would be a great fit,\u201d Klasko said.\n\nThe Netflix model\n\nA 61-year-old OB-GYN, MBA and Philly native, Klasko has done quite a bit in stoking Jefferson\u2019s brand in his two years on the job as CEO. He lambasts the arcane, dysfunction aspects of American healthcare \u2014 from the six-figure debt for patients to phone call scheduling systems,\u2014 and points to consumer technology as inspiration. \u201cWhy can I be in my pajamas the day after Thanksgiving watching Game of Thrones and doing all my holiday shopping, but if I have a stomach ache, I still have to get on the phone and hopefully somebody will see me two days from now?\u201d Klasko said in an interview earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI see this as an absolutely seminal moment in healthcare,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're going to change the DNA of healthcare one physician at a time,\" he also said in a TEDx Talk, outlining a vision for \u201cJefferson 3.0.\u201d\n\n[Also: M&A strong in 2014]\n\nKlasko has been saying that American healthcare needs to change for the better part of a decade, since he was head of the University of South Florida College of Medicine. His record there was mixed. One former colleague told Philadelphia Magazine that Klasko\u2019s \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d agenda was seen as \u201cjust disruptive.\u201d\n\nAt the Villages retirement community, Klasko spearheaded a $4 million USF medical clinic with the goal making it \"America's Healthiest Hometown.\" USF pulled out the project last June, taking a $5 million loss. Another initiative, the $38 million Center for Advanced Medical Learning and Simulation, lost $2 million for the 2013-14 fiscal year, but is still seen as part of needed changes in the ways medical students learn to become doctors, nurses and caregivers.\n\nCompeting in Philly\n\nAt Jefferson, Klasko said he has a mandate to evolve the enterprise, which \u201cmeans everything from literally changing how we select and educate students\u201d to \u201cchanging the most expensive place to can get care, the urban academic medical center,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that 65 percent or so of patients who end up in a hospital\u2019s emergency rooms don\u2019t need to be there, and not just because it could not just be five hours of a patient\u2019s life but $1,500 of their deductible.\u201d\n\nThe hub-and-hub health system can be the way to \u201cget patients to the most efficient and effective place for them to get care,\u201d Klasko said. \u201cThat might be their home with telehealth. That might a Jeff Connect urgent care center. That might be a freestanding ER, or if they\u2019re really, really sick, they should go to the most expensive, high acuity ER at the hospital.\u201d\n\nWhether Klasko\u2019s ideas and Jefferson\u2019s vision translate into more affordable healthcare remains to be seen, said Robert Field, a Drexel University health researcher who writes the Field Clinic column in the Philly Inquirer. For one thing, Field said, neither Jefferson nor any other regional provider system has made headway in improving patient billing, although the region\u2019s largest insurer, Independence Blue Cross, is trying to make progress on the price shopping front.\n\nJefferson is also not the only area health system looking to create an integrated health network spanning the suburbs and center city Philadelphia. Jefferson bought the naming rights to a downtown train station, but all across the region, residents are beckoned with advertising for systems such as Temple Health, Einstein Healthcare Network, Main Line Health, Doylestown Health, Jefferson and Penn Medicine. The competition between Penn Medicine and Jefferson as the largest and second largest academic medical centers in the region has been explicit, though still friendly, said Field, who worked in management at the Penn\u2019s health system in the late 1990s.\n\nJefferson and Abington have a slight advantage on the retail clinic approach. Like other metro areas, Philly has dozens of urgent-care clinics, though only a few are operated by major hospital systems.\n\nThat, along with the expanded telehealth options Jefferson is rolling out with the American Well on-demand telemedicine company, could put Jefferson ahead in an area that Klasko thinks is growing more quickly than some healthcare executives might like to acknowledge.\n\n[Also: See how one hospital went green]\n\nIn 2010, Klasko and a group of academic medical center leaders were at a conference when Walgreens announced the launch of its walk-in clinics. Klasko remembered many of the deans laughing it off: \u201cWhat a stupid business model. Who\u2019s going to go to a drugstore to have their kid be seen with an earache?\u201d\n\nBillions of dollars later, Klasko said, retail primary and urgent care clinics are one of the fastest growing parts of healthcare, and some providers complain that they are taking away high-margin, low-acuity services.\n\n\u201cThe reason isn\u2019t because everybody was excited about going to the drugstore to have their kid be seen. The reason was, back then, if your kid had an earache you would be told by your pediatrician in many places that we could see you in two days,\u201d Klasko said. \u201cWell by then, your kid was either better or had gone to the emergency room.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/jefferson-health-forms-merger-closes-sets-aggressive-innovation-plans", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/TJUH.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The system is designed to extend the expertise of Jefferson clinicians to suburbanites through telehealth, urgent care centers and Abington's three community hospitals and clinics.", "title": "Jefferson Health forms as merger closes, sets aggressive 'innovation' plans"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/TJUH.png"}, "description": "The system is designed to extend the expertise of Jefferson clinicians to suburbanites through telehealth, urgent care centers and Abington's three community hospitals and clinics.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jefferson Health forms as merger closes, sets aggressive 'innovation' plans"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals and Abington Health System have completed their merger, forming Jefferson Health to compete with Philadelphia\u2019s University of Pennsylvania Health System, the largest in the city.
