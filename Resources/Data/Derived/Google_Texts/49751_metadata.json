John McCain of Arizona says people\u2019s anger with politicians in Washington has him running \u201cas hard as I\u2019ve ever run in my entire political career.\u201d\n\nMcCain said Sunday in Phoenix that voter\u2019s anger with Washington that is fueling the presidential momentum of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders is having a similar effect for his campaign as he seeks a sixth term in office in November.\n\n\u201cThere is an anger and dissatisfaction with Washington out among millions of Americans, Republicans as well as Democrats,\u201d he said.\n\n[RELATED: Bush bust as Cruz, Rubio, Clinton get million-dollar boosts]\n\n[SPECIAL SECTION: Race for the White House]\n\n\"This is the most tumultuous and unpredictable (national) campaign I\u2019ve ever seen,\" McCain added.\n\nMcCain is expected to face strong primary opposition from the Tea Party.\n\nOn another issue, McCain said mismanagement complaints at the Veterans Affairs Hospital join a list of 500 other veterans cases pending in his office.\n\n\u201cWe have handled thousands of cases of veterans ranging from they didn\u2019t get their medals they deserve to problems with disability,\u201d he said.\n\nSurgeries at the VA Hospital are expected to resume on Monday. We first reported information on Thursday about how VA insiders say they brought a dust concern to their attention months ago and nothing was done about it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inexcusable,\u201d McCain said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge bureaucracy. There are so many problems.\u201d\n\n[RELATED: No response from VA about mismanagement complaints]\n\nHe added, however, there have been some improvements, like more hiring, among other things.\n\n\u201cWe do have veterans able to go out with a choice card and see a health provider of their choice,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWe have seen some more hiring. But we have got a long way to go. The key is to make the choice card apply to every veteran so that veterans can go to the VA or go to a health care provider of their choice.\u201d\n\nMcCain calls for removing the geographic limit placed on the program.\n\nMcCain said of the VA\u2019s problems, nobody is holding people responsible.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been series of problems,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there will be more problems. The people that work there are wonderful people. The system is broken. This continues to be a hard slog.\u201d\n\nMcCain also weighed in the government\u2019s battle with Apple to allow the FBI hack into an encrypted iPhone used by the gunman in December's mass shootings in California.\n\n\u201cSuppose there was some information in someone\u2019s home that could lead to the prevention of an attack on the U.S.,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThe standard procedure would be to go to federal judge and get a court order to allow law enforcement to go in there and get that information.\n\n\u201cThis is the same kind of thing,\u201d McCain said. \u201cShould we allow information that would prevent an attack on the U.S. that our law enforcement and national security people would not have access to? We need to sit down and work this out with the high-tech community. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re unpatriotic. But they are in business.\u201d\n\n[RELATED: US would let Apple keep software to help FBI hack iPhone]\n\nMcCain called for a commission to come up with recommendations.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, there will be another attack on the U.S. and that\u2019s what the director of the national intelligence told the armed services committee a week and a half ago,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThat\u2019s because with this flood of refugees, ISIS is sending people into Europe and telling them to come to the U.S.\u201d\n\nMcCain said the No. 1 change that needs to happen is \u201cto screen every person coming into this country who is a refugee.\u201d\n\nAs for the fight to stop ISIS, \u201cThis president has failed,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThis president is the worst president in history on this issue.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
