No politician wants to mention \u201credistribution\u201d because it conjures up images of worthy \u201cmakers\u201d forced to hand over hard-earned income to undeserving \u201ctakers.\u201d\n\nBut as low-wage work proliferates in America, so-called takers are working as hard if not harder than anyone else, and often at more than one job.\n\nYet they\u2019re still not making it because the twin forces of globalization and technological change have reduced their bargaining power and undermined their economic standing \u2014 while bestowing ever greater benefits on a comparative few with the right education and connections (and whose parents are often best able to secure these advantages for them).\n\nBetter education and training for those on the losing end is critically important, as will several of the other proposals the President listed. But they will only go so far.\n\nThe number of losers is growing so quickly, and so much of the economies\u2019 winnings are going to a small group at the top \u2014 since the recovery began, 95 percent of the gains have gone to the richest 1 percent \u2014 that some direct redistribution of the gains is necessary.\n\nWithout some redistribution, the losers are likely to react in ways that could hurt the economy. They\u2019ll demand protection from global markets they believe are taking away good jobs, and even from certain technological advances that threaten to displace them (rather than smash the machines, as did England\u2019s 19th-century Luddites, they\u2019ll seek regulations that preserve the old jobs).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right shudders at the thought, but soon low-wage workers won't have enough money to keep the economy going", "title": "Memo to Obama: Don\u2019t be afraid of \u201credistribution\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The right shudders at the thought, but soon low-wage workers won't have enough money to keep the economy going", "title": "Memo to Obama: Don\u2019t be afraid of \u201credistribution\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/07/dear_obama_dont_be_afraid_of_redistribution_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The right shudders at the thought, but soon low-wage workers won't have enough money to keep the economy going", "title": "Memo to Obama: Don\u2019t be afraid of \u201credistribution\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/obama.jpg", "creator": "@rbreich", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Reich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Inequality, Redistribution, RobertReich.org, Social Mobility, U.S. Economy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd303\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Inequality, Redistribution, RobertReich.org, Social Mobility, U.S. Economy, News, Politics NewsThe President\u2019s speech yesterday on inequality avoided the \u201cR\u201d word.\nWithout some redistribution, the losers are likely to react in ways that could hurt the economy.\nBetter education and training for those on the losing end is critically important, as will several of the other proposals the President listed.\nBut they will only go so far.\nThey\u2019ll demand protection from global markets they believe are taking away good jobs, and even from certain technological advances that threaten to displace them (rather than smash the machines, as did England\u2019s 19th-century Luddites, they\u2019ll seek regulations that preserve the old jobs)."}
