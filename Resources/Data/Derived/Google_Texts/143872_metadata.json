Ramos, who interrupted a press conference with Donald Trump in Dubuque, Iowa to make statements rather than ask a question, continued to say his role is one of a journalist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a reporter,\u201d Ramos said, which was met with basic lesson on ethics in journalism by host Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cYou\u2019re an activist.\u201d\n\nRamos said he though \u201cO\u2019Reilly was the last person to lecture\u201d him when he uses the majority of the time on the O\u2019Reilly Factor to give his opinion, which again, was exactly O\u2019Reilly\u2019s point.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can, I\u2019m a commentator,\u201d O\u2019Reilly fired back. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just become like me\u2013a commentator. You\u2019re not a news man anymore. You\u2019re an advocate now.\u201d\n\nRamos also repeated the oft-made claim that the number of illegal immigrants pouring accross the border has stabilized at 11 million. That, of course, is false. According to a recent report by the U.S. Census, the number of illegal and legal immigrants surged by 4.1 million from the second quarter of 2011 to the second quarter of 2015, including 1.7 million in just the last year. Much of the increase has been fueled by Mexican immigration.\n\nhas been widely reported that net migration from Mexico (the number leaving vs. the number coming) fell to zero, something seems to have changed in the last 18 months. The quarterly data shows an increase of 740,000 from the second quarter of 2014 to the same quarter of this year. The average of estimates of the illegal immigrant population from DHS, the Pew Research Center, and the Center for Migration Studies (CMS), suggests that the illegal population was likely 12.4 million in 2015.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bill O'Reilly, Jorge Ramos, Fox News, Univision, Immigration, O'Reilly Factor, Video", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "Bill O'Reilly schooled Univision anchor Jorge Ramos on basic journalistic ethic, telling the immigration advocate he \"is not\" a reporter, but \"an activist.\"", "title": "Bill O\u2019Reilly to Jorge Ramos: You\u2019re Not a Reporter, You\u2019re an Activist", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bill-oreilly-jorge-ramos.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/video/2015/09/03/bill-oreilly-to-jorge-ramos-youre-not-a-reporter-youre-an-activist/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bill O'Reilly schooled Univision anchor Jorge Ramos on basic journalistic ethic, telling the immigration advocate he \"is not\" a reporter, but \"an activist.\"", "creator": "@PPDNews", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bill-oreilly-jorge-ramos.jpg", "title": "Bill O'Reilly to Jorge Ramos: You're Not a Reporter, You're an Activist | People's Pundit Daily", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/video/2015/09/03/bill-oreilly-to-jorge-ramos-youre-not-a-reporter-youre-an-activist/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/29855", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/29855", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "keywords": "Bill O'Reilly, Jorge Ramos, Fox News, Univision, Immigration, O'Reilly Factor, Video", "article": {"section": "Video", "tag": "media bias", "published_time": "2015-09-03T08:53:25-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesPunditDaily"}, "description": "Bill O'Reilly schooled Univision anchor Jorge Ramos on basic journalistic ethic, telling the immigration advocate he \"is not\" a reporter, but \"an activist.\""}, "article_summary": "The quarterly data shows an increase of 740,000 from the second quarter of 2014 to the same quarter of this year.\nBill O\u2019Reilly Schools Jorge Ramos on Basic Ethics of JournalismWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.comUnivision anchor Jorge Ramos appeared on the O\u2019Reilly Factor to advocate against punishment for illegal immigrants Wednesday, and was given the chance to be upfront with viewers.\n\u201cI\u2019m just a reporter,\u201d Ramos said, which was met with basic lesson on ethics in journalism by host Bill O\u2019Reilly.\nYou\u2019re an advocate now.\u201dRamos also repeated the oft-made claim that the number of illegal immigrants pouring accross the border has stabilized at 11 million.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said."}
