Recall that O'Reilly claimed to see soldiers \u201cgunning down\u201d Argentine civilians with \u201creal bullets.\u201d\n\nHere's the actual video report he filed:\n\nAlthough O'Reilly has admitted he was never actually in the Falkland Islands where the military conflict occurred, he claimed that the \u201ccombat situation\u201d he was in involved at least violent protests in Argentina where killings occurred. The video clip above makes no mention of lethal violence in protests or a massacre that O'Reilly later claimed happened. He does mention that \u201csome journalists behind the line were hurt\u201d and the footage includes images of tear gas being used, but what is shown is similar to protests in the United States. In other words, there may have been heavy-handed use of police force, but there were no massacres, and it certainly wasn't the military combat zone O'Reilly later claimed it was.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Fox News pundit simply has no answer for Mother Jones' explosive report -- or this audio footage VIDEO", "author": "Zaid Jilani", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Fox News pundit simply has no answer for Mother Jones' explosive report -- or this audio footage VIDEO", "title": "The incontrovertible proof Bill O\u2019Reilly is a serial liar about his past", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/08/the_incontrovertible_proof_bill_oreilly_is_a_serial_liar_about_his_past_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/bill_oreilly3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Fox News pundit simply has no answer for Mother Jones' explosive report -- or this audio footage VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/bill_oreilly3.jpg", "title": "The incontrovertible proof Bill O\u2019Reilly is a serial liar about his past", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The incontrovertible proof Bill O\u2019Reilly is a serial liar about his past", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Bill O'Reilly, Fox News, JFK, Media Matters, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0be2\"", "article_summary": "Video Of O'Reilly Reporting From Falklands' \u201cWar zone\u201dMother Jones' David Corn and Daniel Schulman unearthed the original 1982 CBS News video featuring Bill O'Reilly reporting from Argentina.\nThe video clip above makes no mention of lethal violence in protests or a massacre that O'Reilly later claimed happened.\nIn other words, there may have been heavy-handed use of police force, but there were no massacres, and it certainly wasn't the military combat zone O'Reilly later claimed it was.\nBut a pair of new investigations provides the most damning evidence yet that O\u2019Reilly outright lied about several events in his career, severely undermining whatever credibility he has left.\nO\u2019Reilly and his bosses at Fox have tried to explain away these apparent lies as simply matters of semantics, for example, claiming that he simply meant he viewed photographs of the assassinated nuns."}
