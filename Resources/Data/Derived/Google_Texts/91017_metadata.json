In 2013, the biggest growth came in temporary jobs.\n\nExperts think Mississippi will end the year with 1.4 percent growth in its gross domestic product, which would be slightly lower than the 1.6 percent growth in 2013, Webb said.\n\nIn Mississippi and other parts of the nation, many young people are slow to marry and form new households, partly because they\u2019re leaving college with a significant amount of debt, he said. That, in turn, is affecting the demand for housing.\n\nMississippi has long been one of the poorest states in the nation, and the Delta, which relies largely on agriculture, has been the poorest part of the state for generations. Sen. Willie Simmons, D-Cleveland, asked Webb for ideas about improving the Delta\u2019s economic standing.\n\n\u201cI get asked the question all the time: \u2018What\u2019s the magic bullet?'\u201d Webb said. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic bullet.\u201d\n\nMississippi\u2019s economy suffers because of relatively low levels of health and education and high levels of births outside marriage, Webb said.\n\n\u201cUntil we improve on these measures, we will continue to face the same problems year after year,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "ACROSS MISSISSIPPI \u2014 The state's economy is gradually growing stronger, but the state still has 44,0...", "title": "Economist: State's economy expanding, but jobs are not", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://msbusiness.com/files/2014/09/economy-changes-affect-your-sales-funnel-270x300.jpg", "url": "http://msbusiness.com/2014/10/economist-states-economy-expanding-jobs/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mbjournal", "section": "NEWS", "tag": "Willie Simmons", "published_time": "2014-10-05T10:51:28-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "ACROSS MISSISSIPPI \u2014 The state\u2019s economy is gradually growing stronger, but the state still has 44,000 fewer jobs now than it did before the recession, state economist Darrin Webb told legislative budget writers Friday.
