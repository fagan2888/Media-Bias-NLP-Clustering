Maybe not quite that quick, but Denver Comic Con officials say they spent all year working on a plan to speed the process of getting fans into the Colorado Convention Center.\n\nPhotos: Denver Comic Con 2014\n\nOn its opening day Friday, the lines were moving quickly.\n\nOn the first day of the event last year, a line of about 15,000 people wrapped around the complex. After waiting in the queue for hours, about 6,000 people were turned away by the fire marshal and convention staff.\n\n\u201cWe knew that was the biggest thing we were dinged on last year and we spent the entire year with that as the No. 1 focus,\u201d said Michael Newman, ticketing and registration director for the convention. \u201cThe No. 1 priority was to make sure that worked well this year.\u201d\n\nNewman said the plan included having separate lines for people in different categories, more signs and better organization. Doors also opened at 10 a.m. Friday, five hours earlier than on the first day the year before.\n\n\u201cWe processed 2,600 people in 40 minutes. When doors opened at 10, the entire line of people with badges waiting at the door was cleared in 25 minutes,\u201d he said.\n\nMichelle Provolt, of Colorado Springs, said she and her friends were able to simply walk right into the Con without having to wait in line.\n\nDenver Comic Con playlist: Listen to the best video game songs\n\n\n\nOn its opening day Friday, the lines were moving quickly.\n\n\u201cGetting in was phenomenal this year,\u201d she said. \u201cLast year we waited forever. This year was great.\u201d\n\nThere were more than 60,000 people in attendance last year and officials are expecting about 75,000 fans this year.\n\nArtist Ben Templesmith, best known for his work on \u201c30 Days of Night,\u201d has been a guest at the convention since its first year and said he\u2019s not surprised by its growth.\n\n\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s a city hungry for the arts,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just pop culture, but the arts.\u201d\n\nHours of Denver Comic Con are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nFor more information, go to www.denvercomiccon.com.\n\nJoe Nguyen: jnguyen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joenguyen", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Faster lines \u201cNo. 1 priority\u201d at 2014 Denver Comic Con", "title": "Faster lines \u201cNo. 1 priority\u201d at 2014 Denver Comic Con", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/13/faster-lines-no-1-priority-at-2014-denver-comic-con/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613__comicconcrowdp1.jpg", "height": 489}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613__comicconcrowdp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-13T14:28:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:28:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0cf1\"", "article_summary": "Denver Comic Con playlist: Listen to the best video game songsOn its opening day Friday, the lines were moving quickly.\nPhotos: Denver Comic Con 2014On its opening day Friday, the lines were moving quickly.\n\u201cNot just pop culture, but the arts.\u201dHours of Denver Comic Con are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.\nMaybe not quite that quick, but Denver Comic Con officials say they spent all year working on a plan to speed the process of getting fans into the Colorado Convention Center.\nAfter waiting in the queue for hours, about 6,000 people were turned away by the fire marshal and convention staff."}
