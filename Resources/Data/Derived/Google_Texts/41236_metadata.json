It takes three readings for an ordinance to go into effect, but with the year ending and Monday\u2019s meeting being the last scheduled of 2015, an emergency meeting may be called to vote on the ordinance.\n\nIn other action\n\nAn ordinance approving the request to rezone approximately 54 acres adjacent to 4104 Kolbe Road from residential 1-A to residential Planned Unit Development was rejected by an 8-2 vote. Councilman Daniel Given abstained from voting due to his direct involvement with the proposal. Council at large members Joseph Koziura and Frank DeTillio supported the project.\n\nFlooding, sanitary sewer and traffic concerns were raised at a public hearing in November when representatives from Perpetual Development LLC approached Council with a $40 million, 151-home housing development proposal for the acreage. The number of homes was changed to 110, but despite the reduction, Council still rejected the proposal.\n\nIf passed, homes would have been sold for about $200,000 to $300,000 with 100 percent tax abatements for the first 10 years and 75 percent for the next five years.\n\nCouncilman Josh Thornsberry, I-8th Ward, said there were not enough answers given to Council\u2019s questions in November regarding the project.\n\nThornsberry said despite Council rejecting the project, he expects the developer to return with a new set of plans, and hopefully answers to flooding, sanitary sewer and traffic concerns.\n\n\u201cHomes are OK, but (ideas) look better on paper, and we need answers,\u201d Thornsberry said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chronicle-Telegram", "description": "LORAIN \u2014 In a 7-4 vote, City Council\u2019s ordinance to establish compensation, benefits and terms of employment for all elected officials of the city was recommended for a second reading.
