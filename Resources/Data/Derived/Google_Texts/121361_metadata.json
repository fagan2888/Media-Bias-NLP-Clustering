Clinics wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the influx \u2026 They\u2019re stretched to the limit already.\u2019 Patricia Smith state representative, D-Baton Rouge\n\nThe controversy is just the latest in a long string of conservative policies on women\u2019s health pushed by Jindal and legislators in Louisiana \u2014 both Republican and Democratic. In 2014 a bill that requires that information on the supposed mental health effects of abortion be distributed to women seeking the procedure was passed, along with Jindal-endorsed House Bill 388, which mandates that the state\u2019s five abortion clinics have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, a requirement that clinic operators say would effectively shut them down. HB388, sponsored by Democrat Katrina Jackson along with 50 co-authors, was modeled in part on the 2013 Texas regulation that has so far shuttered 22 of the 41 clinics there. The Louisiana law, which was written in concert with two anti-abortion organizations, clarifies that existing \u201cinformed consent\u201d procedures \u2014 including a pamphlet depicting fetal development, an enforced 24-hour waiting period for the patient and information on the long-term risks of an abortion \u2014 must be administered to all women seeking the procedure, whether administered surgically or with pharmaceuticals. To date, HB388 has been blocked from implementation by a federal court injunction, and all five of the state\u2019s clinics remain open. But Jessie Nieblas, a co-founder of the New Orleans Abortion Fund, a nonprofit that provides financial assistance for low-income women seeking abortions, said that the law\u2019s passage has nonetheless had an effect on Louisiana\u2019s women. \u201cAll of these attacks really do contribute to this culture of stigma and fear around seeking an abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some people wonder if it\u2019s still legal, wonder if there is going to be violent protesters at the clinics.\u201d Nieblas said that since April 2013, her organization has provided assistance to over 400 women across Louisiana and in neighboring Mississippi. According to survey data collected by the organization, the average age of its aid recipients is 26. About 70 percent already have children, and 1 in 5 is Catholic. \u201cAbortion can\u2019t be separate from other portions of people lives. It\u2019s related to education, income, equal pay, access to primary care \u2026 All these other issues go into whether or not someone makes a decision to have an abortion,\u201d she said. A recent study by The Associated Press found that Louisiana was one of only two states where abortions have increased in recent years, rising 12 percent from 2010 to 2014.\n\nUndercutting sex education\n\nJindal has built a reputation as a staunch promoter of abstinence-only sexual education programs in schools, declaring in-depth discussions about sexual health are best left to families. \u201cThere is a religious contingency in this state that says it\u2019s the parents\u2019 responsibility to teach their kids about this stuff,\u201d said Cindy Bishop, a representative of the Louisiana School\u2013based Health Alliance, which receives state grants to provide preventive and mental health care to low-income students. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing it, obviously, because the children are getting pregnant and we have very high STD rates.\u201d She said Louisiana laws prevent school-based clinics from distributing or discussing contraception with students under any circumstance. \u201cEven if we have a girl that comes in and says, \u2018I\u2019m 15, and I\u2019ve already had two kids. How do I stop from getting pregnant?\u2019 we are not allowed to discuss contraceptives.\u201d Louisiana is one of 27 states that do not mandate any substantive sexual health education in school. But the state provides curriculum support to schools through the Governor\u2019s Abstinence Education Program, which focuses on abstinence until marriage and includes claims that condoms are on average only 85 percent effective against pregnancy. State officials note that local school districts are able to build more comprehensive sex education programs on their own. In reality, though, building more robust programs is difficult at cash- and resource-strapped schools and can still draw political opposition. \u201cMany [teachers and administrators] are not aware of the sex education laws in Louisiana,\u201d said Rheneisha Robertson, the chief operating officer of the Institute of Women and Ethnic Studies, a health education and advocacy nonprofit that teaches HIV- and teen-pregnancy-prevention programs in New Orleans schools. \u201cThey are not aware of what can and cannot be taught.\u201d Earlier this year, state Rep. Wesley Bishop, D-New Orleans, proposed two bills that would mandate comprehensive sex education and allow schools to survey students on risky sexual behavior. Even though the measures applied only to schools in New Orleans, the state legislature voted it down. He said that while many Republican representatives admitted in private that they supported his bills, they could not \u201cbring that vote home with them.\u201d But he\u2019s optimistic he can get legislation passed once a new governor comes into office next year, \u201cas opposed to a governor that will put his head in the sand and act like there is no need to treat this,\u201d he said.\n\nMedicaid, private hospitals", "article_metadata": {"description": "As election approaches to pick new governor, legacy of eroding health care system persists", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/10/19/louisiana-bobby-jindal-healthcare-agenda.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/10/19/louisiana-bobby-jindal-healthcare-agenda/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.jindal_gov.1445034270810.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "As election approaches to pick new governor, legacy of eroding health care system persists", "title": "For Louisiana\u2019s Bobby Jindal, Planned Parenthood is just part of problem"}, "LastModifiedDate": "Mon, 19 Oct 2015 06:59:14 GMT", "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/10/19/louisiana-bobby-jindal-healthcare-agenda/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.jindal_gov.1445034270810.jpg", "description": "As election approaches to pick new governor, legacy of eroding health care system persists", "card": "summary", "title": "For Louisiana\u2019s Bobby Jindal, Planned Parenthood is just part of problem"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Public Health, Politics, New Orleans, Louisiana, Health Care, Election 2016, U.S., Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "To date, HB388 has been blocked from implementation by a federal court injunction, and all five of the state\u2019s clinics remain open.\nUndercutting sex educationJindal has built a reputation as a staunch promoter of abstinence-only sexual education programs in schools, declaring in-depth discussions about sexual health are best left to families.\n\u201cAll of these attacks really do contribute to this culture of stigma and fear around seeking an abortion,\u201d she said.\nHow do I stop from getting pregnant?\u2019 we are not allowed to discuss contraceptives.\u201d Louisiana is one of 27 states that do not mandate any substantive sexual health education in school.\nEven though the measures applied only to schools in New Orleans, the state legislature voted it down."}
