Rock County Human Services director retiring

Charmian Klyve

JANESVILLE—The department head who helped Rock County through radical changes in human services programming is retiring.

Rock County Human Services Director Charmian Klyve plans to retire July 1, according to a news release from the Rock County Administrator's Office.

“Rock County will miss Charmian's extensive knowledge of human services programs and her commitment to our clients,” said Josh Smith, Rock County administrator.

Klyve has led the human services department for almost 16 years. Before that, she served as deputy corporation counsel for the county for six years.

The human services department provides services to abused and neglected children, people with mental health issues, the frail elderly, juveniles that have been through the court system, and low-income people seeking services and benefits.

The human services department uses about 31 percent of county's $194 million budget.

“Klyve successfully led the human services department during times of high caseloads, reduced funding and ever-changing state and federal requirements,” the news release said. “During her tenure … Klyve reorganized the department to integrate the child protective services and juvenile justice divisions, established Rock County as the lead administrative agency in a seven-county consortium to deliver economic support programs, implemented the Affordable Care Act and oversaw the opening of the Aging and Disabilities Resource Center and the planning for Family Care,” the news release said.

The county has started the recruitment process for a new human services director, the news release said.
