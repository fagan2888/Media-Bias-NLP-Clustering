Later adding \u201cGruber was not the architect of Obamacare,\u201d but rather \u201ca paid consultant by a man who saw that insurance companies were ripping off regular people, a man who passed a law to try to get people covered, and this guy [Gruber] was an economist to help crunch the numbers and people did get covered, and the man who passed the law was named Mitt Romney.\u201d Fugelsang did admit Gruber was a \u201cconsultant.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHe did downplay the meaning of Gruber\u2019s comments to the larger debate, arguing that many other people, such as advertisers, think Americans are stupid and stating \u201cit may get some of your viewers really riled up and then they\u2019ll see nothing\u2019s going to come of it because there\u2019s no scandal here. This guy thought that, but the individual mandate is not what liberals wanted. Liberals wanted single payer. Democrats wanted public option. Barack Obama enacted the conservative plan conceived by the Heritage Foundation.\u201d\n\nPirro and Fugelsang concluded by debating whether or not the fine assessed against individuals who do not have insurance was a tax or a penalty, Fugelsang argued it wasn\u2019t any different from an officer making someone pay a ticket for not having auto insurance, to which Pirro that the US Supreme Court said the fines were taxes and that Gruber admitted that they wanted to prevent the CBO from scoring the fines as taxes, which Fugelsang seemed to agree with. He concluded by saying \u201cin terms of lies I\u2019ve heard about Obamacare, this comes somewhere below, \u2018it\u2019s a government takeover,\u2019 [and] \u2018it\u2019ll cover illegal immigrants.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Fugelsang: \u00e2\u0080\u0098No Scandal,\u2019 But 'Gruber Is Stupid\u2019\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "John Fugelsang: \u00e2\u0080\u0098No Scandal,\u2019 But 'Gruber Is Stupid\u2019\"", "title": "John Fugelsang: \u00e2\u0080\u0098No Scandal,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But 'Gruber Is Stupid\u00e2\u0080\u0099 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/11/15/Fugelsang%20Thumbnail.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/11/15/john-fugelsang-no-scandal-but-gruber-is-stupid/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Fugelsang: \u00e2\u0080\u0098No Scandal,\u2019 But 'Gruber Is Stupid\u2019\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/11/15/Fugelsang%20Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "John Fugelsang: \u00e2\u0080\u0098No Scandal,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But 'Gruber Is Stupid\u00e2\u0080\u0099 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Mitt Romney, Supreme Court, Twitter,Breitbart TV,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-11-15T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think Mr. Gruber is stupid and that\u2019s something progressives and conservatives can agree on\u201d he said.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERComedian and radio host John Fugelsang argued that Jonathan Gruber\u2019s comments about American voters were \u201cstupid,\u201d but that \u201cthere\u2019s no scandal here\u201d in an interview on Saturday\u2019s \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\nThis guy thought that, but the individual mandate is not what liberals wanted.\nHe concluded by saying \u201cin terms of lies I\u2019ve heard about Obamacare, this comes somewhere below, \u2018it\u2019s a government takeover,\u2019 [and] \u2018it\u2019ll cover illegal immigrants.\u2019\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\nLiberals wanted single payer."}
