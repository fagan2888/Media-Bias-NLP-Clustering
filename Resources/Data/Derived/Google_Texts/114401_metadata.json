The new regulation calls for a 30 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 2030. Congress failed to pass so-called \u201ccap and trade\u201d legislation that would enable such a move, so Obama is using the regulatory authority he claims the EPA already has to regulate carbon. But the president cannot just ignore the will of Congress. To do so assumes that Congress is irrelevant. Apparently, this is what President Obama believes.\n\nObama\u2019s Organizing for America website brags that the new EPA regulations are \u201cthe strongest action ever taken by an American president to tackle climate change.\u201d Most media outlets are echoing Obama, heralding the new EPA rule, while downplaying or ignoring the calamitous effects it will have on the economy. CBS called it \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d The Christian Science Monitor calls it \u201cbold, signature, and controversial.\u201d CNN called it \u201cthe boldest step yet,\u201d characterizing prior U.S. positions as \u201chypocritical.\u201d\n\nABC News cited a new poll claiming that 70 percent of Americans think something should be done about global warming. This, of course, follows numerous polls that indicate just the opposite. A Gallup poll published in The Washington Post last year indicated that most people do not consider global warming a serious threat. An ABC poll found only 18 percent ranked global warming as their highest priority. Sixty-eight percent of respondents ranked the economy as the number one priority. A Pew poll found only 42 percent believed global warming to be caused primarily by human activity.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nMedia outlets dismissed concerns over the rule\u2019s impact on the economy, but it will have devastating effects. Called the \u201cObamacare for climate change,\u201d the EPA rule claims huge savings down the road; but, as President Obama put it, this \u201cwill require tough choices along the way.\u201d Tough indeed. It will raise energy costs nationwide at a time when our economy struggles to recover from the deepest recession since the Great Depression. A recent study projects the damages:\n\nAverage annual $51 billion reduction to U.S. Gross Domestic Product through 2030\n\nAn average 224,000 fewer U.S. jobs every year through 2030\n\nU.S. consumers will pay $289 billion more for electricity through 2030\n\nLower total disposable income for U.S. households by $586 billion through 2030\n\nAnd just as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) claims Obamacare\u2019s unstated but overt goal is to destroy the private healthcare market, this new EPA rule is ultimately designed to destroy the coal industry.\n\nSome states have already vowed to fight against these regulations. Indiana Governor Mike Pence (R) said, \u201cIndiana will oppose these regulations using every means available.\u201d Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett (R) promised to \u201cfight these regulations every step of the way.\u201d Many other U.S senators and representatives have expressed similar sentiments. West Virginia and Wyoming are considering legislation to block the regulations. As Wyoming Senator John Barrasso (R) noted, \u201cThe costs are real, the benefits are theoretical.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) called it \u201ca dagger in the heart of the American middle class.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nFacing tough reelection campaigns in coal states, many Democratic politicians have also broken ranks to voice their opposition. Rep. Nick Rahall (D-WV) called the new rules \u201cdisastrous.\u201d Democratic West Virginia U.S. Senate candidate Natalie Tenannt stated, \u201cI will stand up to President Obama, Gina McCarthy and anyone else who tries to undermine our coal jobs\u2026\u201d Running against incumbent Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes promised, \u201cI will fiercely oppose the President\u2019s attack on Kentucky\u2019s coal industry because protecting our jobs will be my number one priority.\u201d\n\nCoordination\n\nLawsuits and legislation may ultimately prevent this regulation from going forward; however, state and local governments have a simpler and more effective tool at their fingertips: \u201ccoordination.\u201d Coordination is a little-known feature embedded in numerous environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970, the Endangered Species Act, and other laws.\n\nCoordination requires the EPA and all other federal agencies to consider all effects of environmental regulations. These effects include:\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\necological (such as the effects on natural resources and on the components, structures, and functioning of affected ecosystems), aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health, whether direct, indirect, or cumulative. Effects may also include those resulting from actions which may have both beneficial and detrimental effects, even if on balance the agency believes that the effect will be beneficial. (emphasis added).\n\nThe federal agency must prepare an \u201cenvironmental impact\u201d statement that includes impacts on the human environment. This refers specifically to all those aspects listed above. According to the law, \u201c\u2018Human environment\u2019 shall be interpreted comprehensively to include the natural and physical environment and the relationship of people with that environment.\u201d The agency is only exempt if the proposed regulation has \u201cno significant impact.\u201d\n\nSince these new carbon regulations will have a devastating effect on multiple aspects of the human environment, the EPA cannot unilaterally apply them as proposed. The EPA must negotiate with state and local governments\u2014they only have to ask. Not only will conventional energy sources be gravely weakened, but our nation will be set on a course to use more and more solar, wind, and other exotic power generation. These are three to four times more expensive than traditional energy, and will send residential electricity rates through the roof. If you recall, candidate Obama promised this very thing back in 2008, saying that \u201celectricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.\u201d Obama added, \u201cSo, if somebody wants to build a coal plant, they can\u2014it\u2019s just that it will bankrupt them, because they are going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that\u2019s being emitted.\u201d\n\nSolar and wind facilities require huge amounts of space to generate even tiny amounts of electricity. For example, the Ivanpah solar farm in southern California provides 1.1 percent of California\u2019s residential energy needs, but requires five square miles of ground. And every bit of those five square miles is filled with moving, tilting mirrors that follow the sun. High maintenance costs are assured. A solar farm scaled up to serve all California homes\u2014never mind industry\u2014would require 500 square miles, an area almost half the size of Rhode Island.\n\nBoth solar and wind are deadly to the environment. For environmental purposes, the Ivanpah land essentially becomes a five square mile parking lot. Focusing the sun\u2019s rays on a single point as this facility does raises the temperature near the central tower as high as 1,000 degrees F, incinerating any birds that fly through. The Bundy Ranch showdown came about because multiple solar energy farms are planned for Clark County, Nevada; and land surrounding the ranch property is intended for \u201cmitigation,\u201d i.e. to replace habitat for the endangered desert tortoise destroyed by solar facilities.\n\nModern wind turbines slaughter more birds than Perdue. At California\u2019s Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area, one of the first major wind generation facilities constructed in the U.S., the Audubon Society estimates that 4,700 birds die annually, including 75 to 110 Golden Eagles, 380 Burrowing Owls, 300 Red-tailed Hawks, and 333 American Kestrels. According to Smithsonian.com, nationwide, wind turbines kill between 140,000 and 328,000 birds every year.\n\nSolar and wind energy projects cannot survive on their own, requiring massive, unsustainable government subsidies to make them economically viable. Across the United States, 15,000 wind turbines already stand abandoned; and throughout Europe, wind and solar energy are being reconsidered as problems mount and governments abandon the subsidies. In Spain, one study found that renewable energy jobs cost about 571,000 Euros, or more than $776,000 each. At the same time, for each renewable energy job generated, the economy lost 2.2 jobs elsewhere. Wind generation has failed in Denmark, Spain, Greece, Portugal, and elsewhere. Stephan Kohler, Germany\u2019s energy chief, says that conventional power plants will be necessary until at least 2050 and calls Germany\u2019s Renewable Energy Act \u201cpure insanity.\u201d\n\nFleecing the Taxpayers\n\nWhile Obama, the Democrats, and some Republicans have raised the specter of catastrophic global warming, the real \u201cgreen\u201d they seek is greenbacks. Even a cursory look into the backers of \u201cgreen energy\u201d projects reveals a who\u2019s who of the Democratic Left. Everyone from Al Gore to Bill Clinton to Barack Obama and their many friends, associates, and supporters have all lined up to cash in on \u201cgreen\u201d energy. The idea is to use government subsidies to make the investments viable. As long as subsidies persist, the companies make money. But this can\u2019t last forever. Government subsidies must eventually end, as they are doing now in Europe and already did at many locations in the U.S. But by the time this happens, investors have long since cashed out, leaving taxpayers holding the bag. The EPA rule, however, envisions an entirely new paradigm. Instead of subsidizing these green energy firms, the Obama administration intends to simply destroy the competition.\n\nJames Simpson is an economist, businessman and investigative journalist.
