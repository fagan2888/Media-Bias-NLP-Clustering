Eight months later, it purchased Bend, Oregon's 10 Barrel Brewing, again not disclosing the terms, but with some industry insiders pegging the cost at about $50 million.\n\n\n\nThe company opened its wallet again in January of this year, this time buying Seattle's Elysian Brewing, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe purchase of Elysian gave a slight pause to many who thought there may be a regional craft acquisition strategy at work, with the presumption being Anheuser-Busch was looking for a craft brewing presence in each region.\n\nFor Steinman, the purchases of 10 Barrel and Elysian went beyond just giving Anheuser Busch a beachhead in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\n\n\"They've both been very weak markets for Anheuser-Busch, they have a very low market share there,\" he said. \"If you look at the IRI data, the hottest craft brewer last year was 10 Barrel in Portland, and in Seattle, it was Elysian. So they can get a couple share points and hot brands in markets where they are struggling.\"\n\n\n\nThe spending spree has certainly gotten the attention of the beer business, with craft breweries looking at Anheuser-Busch's involvement with trepidation\u2014a fear Goeler says is misguided.\n\n\"The number one principle is to make sure that we let them maintain their culture, their authenticity, so we're not buying them to make them into Anheuser-Busch companies,\" he said. \"We're buying them for who they are and what they've achieved and what they've done in the world of beer.\"\n\nGoeler said his company's activity in the craft space benefits both the craft beer segment and the beer business as a whole.\n\n\n\n\"We are getting craft beers to more consumers than probably anybody in the U.S.,\" said Goeler. \"We are able to bring resources to these companies and help them reach and get more people interested in the industry.\"", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Anheuser-Busch has spent an estimated $200 million dollars buying craft breweries to add to its already extensive brand portfolio-and it's not done yet.", "author": "Tom Rotunno", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Anheuser-Busch has spent an estimated $200 million dollars buying craft breweries to add to its already extensive brand portfolio-and it's not done yet.", "title": "Inside Anheuser-Busch\u2019s craft beer deals", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/24/inside-anheuser-buschs-craft-beer-deals.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/11/13/102182938-goose-island-budweiser-beer.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Anheuser-Busch has spent an estimated $200 million dollars buying craft breweries to add to its already extensive brand portfolio-and it's not done yet.", "title": "Inside Anheuser-Busch\u2019s craft beer deals", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/24/inside-anheuser-buschs-craft-beer-deals.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/11/13/102182938-goose-island-budweiser-beer.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@TomRotunno", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Beer, Wine & Spirits, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Food and Beverage, Beverages, Brewers, Anheuser Busch Inbev SA, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-07-26T16:00:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Beer, Wine & Spirits", "modified_time": "2015-07-26T16:02:39-0400", "tag": "Anheuser Busch Inbev SA"}, "pageNodeId": 102837171, "news_keywords": "Anheuser-Busch Inbev, craft beer, mergers, aquisitions, deals"}, "article_summary": "Goeler said his company's activity in the craft space benefits both the craft beer segment and the beer business as a whole.\nThe spending spree has certainly gotten the attention of the beer business, with craft breweries looking at Anheuser-Busch's involvement with trepidation\u2014a fear Goeler says is misguided.\nEight months later, it purchased Bend, Oregon's 10 Barrel Brewing, again not disclosing the terms, but with some industry insiders pegging the cost at about $50 million.\nThe company opened its wallet again in January of this year, this time buying Seattle's Elysian Brewing, for an undisclosed amount.\n\"We're buying them for who they are and what they've achieved and what they've done in the world of beer.\""}
