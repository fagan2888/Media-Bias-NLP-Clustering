The Main Library in Jersey City will be closed today as major construction continues in the building.

"We apologize for any inconvenience," said Library Director Priscilla Gardner. "And we expect the Main Library to open again on Monday at 9 a.m."

The 115-year-old library, which is located at 472 Jersey Ave., is currently undergoing a renovation that will be split into two main phases and completed over the next five years.

The building will be closed today due to the demolition of the first floor restrooms, officials said.
