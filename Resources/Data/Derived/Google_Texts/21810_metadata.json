It\u2019s no secret that caffeine can improve people\u2019s moods, but scientists have long wondered how. Is there a chemical process involved? Or maybe it\u2019s just the simple pleasure of sitting down with a cup of coffee in hand, sometimes with friends, too. In a new study, an international team of scientists are saying it\u2019s the former.\n\nResearchers from Portugal, the United States, and Brazil discovered that mice given caffeine were better able to handle stress than mice subjected to stressful situations sans caffeine. The reason: While caffeine usually blocks adenosine receptors from activating sleep processes, it also prevents the receptors from reacting to, and causing a stress response, including a bad mood, memory problems, and an enhanced susceptibility to depression, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cWhat caffeine is doing is not making the system work better; what caffeine is doing is avoiding the system going into the wrong way of working,\u201d Rodrigo Cunha, an associate professor at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, told ABC News Australia. \u201cSo it\u2019s a prevention of a deterioration rather than an improvement.\u201d\n\nStress is a normal human response that can help a person push themselves harder in the face of challenges. However, it begins to affect a range of bodily processes over an extended period of time. For this reason, it\u2019s been linked to insomnia, obesity, and mental health disorders. Thirty-three percent of Americans never discuss ways to manage it with a health care provider either, according to the American Psychological Association.\n\nFor the study, researchers gave some mice caffeine in their drinking water while others received plain water. The mice were exposed to sudden, stressful situations three weeks after starting this caffeine regimen, which included damp bedding, sharing living space with other mice, being deprived of food and water, cold baths, and having cages tilted at 45-degree angles. The researchers found only mice that went without caffeine experienced stress-induced changes to their brains and behavior. What\u2019s more, the same changes occurred when the mice were given a drug meant to block adenosine receptor activity, as well as when all genes for adenosine receptors were deleted.\n\nWhile Cunha says the link between caffeine and better management of stress is causal \u2014 because they \u201cdidn\u2019t go to the coffee shop\u201d or \u201cspend more time with each other\u201d \u2014 the fact remains that the experiments were only conducted on mice. Future studies will determine whether these effects are similar in humans, and whether drugs can be developed to target adenosine receptors in order to \u201calleviate the consequences of chronic stress on brain function,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nSource: Kaster M, Machado N, Silva H, et al.
