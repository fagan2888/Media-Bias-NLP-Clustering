The administration of Governor-elect Charlie Baker is expected to search for a permanent replacement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYang, who served in the post since January 2013, said her departure from the $179,243-a-year job represented a mutual decision among herself and the staffs of Patrick and Baker.\n\n\u201cThis is very consistent with my personal long-term trajectory,\u201d she said, adding that she was leaving the Connector \u201cin a solid place.\u201d\n\nYang made national headlines early last year when she broke down in tears at a meeting of the Connector Board, describing the staff\u2019s frustrations with a failed website and a pile of 50,000 health insurance applications waiting to be typed into a computer. The website had to be updated in 2013 to comply with the federal Affordable Care Act, but the software performed poorly, leaving thousands unable to sign up for coverage.\n\nYang and others later defended her display of emotion as evidence of how deeply she cared. And on Tuesday, her staff pointed to her personal involvement in this year\u2019s more successful effort, saying she attended enrollment events around the state and worked one-on-one signing up consumers.\n\n\u201cPersonally, it has been a most rewarding experience,\u201d she said of her time at the Connector, where she served as chief financial officer before becoming executive director.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking at a telephone press briefing, Yang said she was not sure what she would do next, because conflict-of-interest rules made it difficult to look for a job while working for the state. But she hinted she would stay in health care. \u201cThis is a very, very exciting time for health care, especially in this market,\u201d Yang said.\n\nYang, who holds a master of business administration degree from Harvard Business School, had been a health care management consultant and worked at Tufts Health Plan before joining the Connector.\n\nIn a statement, Patrick praised Yang\u2019s service, noting that more people are covered and more insurers are doing business in the state since she took over.\n\n\u201cI appreciate Jean\u2019s tenacity and determination under challenging circumstances and her service to the people of the Commonwealth,\u201d Patrick said.\n\nNancy Turnbull, a member of the Connector board, said in a statement that Yang provided \u201csteady, thoughtful, and classy leadership.\u201d\n\nCohen said he is not in the running to be executive director permanently and expects to leave state government when open enrollment ends Feb. 15, or soon after. He said he will continue to draw the same $127,336 salary that he was receiving as a Patrick aide before he was tapped to lead the Connector\u2019s recovery from its disastrous 2013 rollout.\n\nPatrick described Cohen as \u201cdiligent, methodical, and unflappable\u201d and a \u201csuperb problem-solver.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd as he solves problems,\u201d the governor said, \u201che sees the people behind the policies.\u201d\n\nRelated coverage:\n\n\u2022 Health care site has a few glitches\n\n\u2022 Editorial: Connector glitches mar sign-up, undermine promises\n\n\u2022 Nearly 50,000 pay for care through Health Connector\n\n\u2022 1 in 10 hit snag on Mass.
