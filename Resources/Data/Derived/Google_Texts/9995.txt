Kentuckians for Strong Leadership, a super political action committee, released a radio ad on Friday linking Senate hopeful Alison Lundergan Grimes to Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, in his support of both Obamacare and the “War on Coal.”

“Grimes is trying to fool Kentuckians — serving up platitudes on Obamacare and coal while getting ready to raise cash in Las Vegas with Harry Reid, the chief defender of Obamacare and the War on Coal,” said Riggs Lewis, board member of Kentuckians for Strong Leadership. “Alison Grimes has two new middle names: Harry Reid — and everyone in Kentucky is going to know it.”

In the past two weeks, Mr. Reid has blocked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, on measures to protect the people of Kentucky from Obamacare and the loss of jobs through the “War on Coal,” a press release from the super PAC said.

The radio ad, released across the state, says Mr. McConnell is not giving up on these fights for the people of his home state.

“The choice is clear: Grimes and Reid, pushing Obamacare on us while Members of Congress get a bailout. Or Mitch McConnell, a fighter for Kentucky,” the ad says.

Mrs. Grimes is a liberal running for Senate in 2014. She is currently serving as Kentucky’s Secretary of State.
