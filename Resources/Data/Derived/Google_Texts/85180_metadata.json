Sharing painful moments and insights \u2014 \u201cI just realized: she once had to let me go into the big wide world. Now I have to let her go the same way\u201d \u2014 Simon broke ground in the uses of social media. He was alone with his mother for most of those days at the hospital. Yet millions sat vigil with him, sobbing and laughing at the life and wisdom of 84-year-old Patricia Lyons Simon Newman.\n\nNow, with \u201cUnforgettable,\u201d Simon reveals not the possibilities of social media but its limits. However intimate those 140-character bursts, they seem inadequate compared with the skilled unspooling of this memoir about growing up alongside his mother in their beloved Chicago and of caring for her in the final breaths.\n\nSimon, host of NPR\u2019s \u201cWeekend Edition Saturday,\u201d has not just filled in the story \u2014 he has told a new one. His tweets were about a man\u2019s love for his mother in the face of inevitable death; his book is about a mother\u2019s love for her son in the face of unavoidable loneliness.\n\n\u201cMy mother was glamorous,\u201d Simon explains. She modeled for hairspray and Chevys; she worked in nightclubs and dated mobsters; she sold clothes at upscale Michigan Avenue shops; she was an ad agency receptionist in the \u201cMad Men\u201d era. At the same time, \u201cmy mother was a Working Girl,\u201d he writes. She was divorced and single; she and Simon shared a cramped one-bedroom apartment; she skipped meals for herself so she could make the rent, give her boy plenty of snacks and throw him James Bond-themed birthday parties.\n\nShe did it on her own because her former husband, Simon\u2019s father, had been a comedian intent on drinking himself to death. They had a \u201creckless kind of romantic kamikaze love,\u201d Simon recalls, but there had come a moment when Patti had to leave, and take Scott, if they were to survive. Instead, she filled their lives with truly great friends and mostly good men.\n\nPatti\u2019s female friends \u2014 Simon\u2019s \u201caunties\u201d \u2014 were hostesses, dancers, lounge singers, women linked by their \u201cmistakes, good times, lonely nights and hard-won laughs.\u201d Simon recalls the sights, sounds and smells of their impromptu parties: \u201cevenings with lots of snorts and laughs, olives and cheddar cheese on rye crackers, the stroke of matches, the tinkle of ice, compact makeup mirrors folded with a snap, high heels under the coffee table, crinkled cocktail napkins with lipstick smudges, earrings pulled out and resting on a coaster, Tony Bennett on the turntable.\u201d\n\nThese women taught him to be a \u201cclassy guy\u201d \u2014 perhaps because they\u2019d met more than a few classless ones. \u201cThey passed what they learned on to me,\u201d Simon writes. \u201cThey gave me something to steer toward.\u201d\n\nPatti married twice more, an Irish mother with three Jewish husbands. After Simon\u2019s father died came a Lincoln scholar, whom she outlived, and a retired furniture executive, whom she did not. In between, Patti attracted plenty of attention. \u201cFor most of my boyhood,\u201d Simon recalls, \u201cmy mother was unmarried, pretty, funny, and popular.\u201d\n\nThis book is about family secrets revealed \u2014 not because they don\u2019t matter anymore, but because a moment arrives when they\u2019re all that matter and secrecy no longer does.\n\nAs Patti slips her bonds, she speaks out: \u201cHelp. Me.\u201d Simon leaps from his mat. \u201cIn that horrifying and exquisite moment, I held my mother as I have held my own children. I tried to look without blinking into her bottomless brown eyes. I told her, \u2018I\u2019m here. Look at me. Give me everything. Every fear, every pain. Leave them with me. I\u2019m your son.'\u201d\n\nThis is when you realize that the tears have been flowing for some time, easing your way through a book that matches its title.\n\nMEMOIR: GLAMOUR MOM\n\nUnforgettable: A Son, a Mother, and the Lessons of a Lifetime\n\nby Scott Simon (Flatiron)", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Review: \u201cUnforgettable: A Son, a Mother, and Lessons of a Lifetime\u201d by Scott Simon", "title": "Review: \u201cUnforgettable: A Son, a Mother, and Lessons of a Lifetime\u201d by Scott Simon", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/26/review-unforgettable-a-son-a-mother-and-lessons-of-a-lifetime-by-scott-simon/", "image": {"width": 260, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150326__20150329_E8_BK29REVIEWUNFORGETTABLEp1.jpg", "height": 393}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150326__20150329_E8_BK29REVIEWUNFORGETTABLEp1.jpg?w=240", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-26T18:04:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:42:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0253\"", "article_summary": "MEMOIR: GLAMOUR MOMUnforgettable: A Son, a Mother, and the Lessons of a Lifetimeby Scott Simon (Flatiron)\nWhen Scott Simon began tweeting pain, love and conversation from his mother\u2019s deathbed in an intensive-care unit in July 2013, he turned personal grief into collective emotion.\n\u201cThey passed what they learned on to me,\u201d Simon writes.\nThey had a \u201creckless kind of romantic kamikaze love,\u201d Simon recalls, but there had come a moment when Patti had to leave, and take Scott, if they were to survive.\nYet millions sat vigil with him, sobbing and laughing at the life and wisdom of 84-year-old Patricia Lyons Simon Newman."}
