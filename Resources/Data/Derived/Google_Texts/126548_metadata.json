According to the source, the two sides agreed to hike spending beyond the caps by $50 billion in 2016 and $30 billion in 2017. The budget caps would not only remain in place under the deal but would be extended to 2025, which will force Congress to constantly seek savings every time it raises spending levels, likely through \"mandatory entitlement programs,\" the source said.\n\nRepublicans also won an Obamacare concession from Democrats. If the deal becomes final, it would eliminate the health care law's auto enrollment for workers, which currently forces them into employer-sponsored health care coverage whether or not they want it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An imminent budget deal between Republicans, Democrats and President Obama would raise federal spending beyond mandated caps for two years in exchange for significant reform to Social Security Disability Insurance.\nThe deal, which is not final, would also suspend the nation's borrowing limit until March of 2017, according to a source familiar with the developing accord.
