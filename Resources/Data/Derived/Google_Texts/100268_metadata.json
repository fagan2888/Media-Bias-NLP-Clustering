If you\u2019re struggling to understand the logic behind the move, you might want to pick up a copy of New York magazine reporter Kevin Roose\u2019s new book, Young Money: Inside the Hidden World of Wall Street's Post-Crash Recruits. A chronicle of the experiences of eight twentysomethings who began their careers on Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Roose\u2019s book (out from Grand Central Publishing in mid February) offers some timely insights for those trying to follow the fortunes of the big investment banking franchises themselves.\n\nAs Roose wryly notes early in the book, \u201cIn 2009, a bit of stability was all a twenty-two-year old on Wall Street could reasonably ask for.\u201d A bit of stability was pretty much all that Washington, Main Street and Wall Street itself were hoping for, too, in the months that followed the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the forced sales of Bear Stearns and the near-collapse of Merrill Lynch and other major institutions.\n\nRelated: Women on Wall Street \u2014 Brainy, Brave and All Business\n\nWhile profitability at the likes of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase bounced back sharply in 2009 and 2010, it came with extra-intensive regulatory scrutiny. Two of the young bankers that Roose follows are employed at Goldman Sachs and seem to struggle with the gap between the bank\u2019s rhetoric and the reality they encounter, even before accusations surface that Goldman and its employees had defrauded their clients. (Goldman Sachs eventually reached a settlement with regulators on the allegations; former trader Fabrice \u201cFabulous Fab\u201d Tourre was found liable by a jury last summer and currently is lobbying for his fine to be set at around $65,000.)\n\nIn the midst of all the hullabaloo, Roose recounts the experience of Jeremy, who unexpectedly finds himself wrestling with ethical conflicts. He \u201cwanted to believe that a bank didn\u2019t have to exist solely for its own preservation and enrichment \u2014 that all that stuff he\u2019d heard in recruiting about being a \u2018trusted advisor\u2019 to clients wasn\u2019t just marketing fluff. But now, he was starting to wonder whether he\u2019d been fooled.\u201d\n\nHaving spent about as many years watching the financial world as \u201cJeremy\u201d has spent on earth, I found myself chuckling slightly at his naivet\u00e9. But then I stopped myself short. Shouldn\u2019t people like Jeremy \u2014 and those higher up \u2014 be pushing for Wall Street institutions to live up to some of that \u201cmarketing fluff\u201d? Or if not, to at least explain why the disconnect exists, and offer their youngest employees \u2014 the people they\u2019d like to entrust the bank\u2019s future to \u2014 some reason to believe that they aren\u2019t just there to line their own pockets at the expense of what Wall Street folks casually refer to as the \u201cdumb money\u201d?\n\nMost young professionals undergo a baptism by fire, so Roose\u2019s chronicle of late hours, strained relationships and exhaustion came as no surprise. Ask any young doctor or lawyer about their first years on the job and you\u2019ll hear similar tales. In the case of medicine and law, however, the hapless victims of this rite of passage can at least console themselves that they\u2019re actually toiling away in pursuit of some loftier goal, such as the rule of law or helping suffering humanity.\n\nBankers? Not so much, despite Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s best efforts to convince the rest of us that he and his colleagues are \"doing God's work\" by helping companies raise capital. Clearly, that claim rings as hollow in the ears of the young men and women Roose follows over the course of the book as it did to the rest of us at the time.\n\nRelated: Where Innovation Is Happening on Wall Street Now\n\nAnd yet, these same twentysomethings should have been true believers. Roose \u2014 who made a name for himself by publishing The Unlikely Disciple, his account of a semester at Liberty University, founded by fundamentalist Christian preacher Jerry Falwell \u2014 compared Wall Street to a religion. Like any faith, Wall Street has its rules, regulations and norms; it \u201cconverts new employees over the course of a two-year cultural baptism that encompasses every aspect of their lives,\u201d Roose writes. In the case of most of those profiled in the pages of Young Money, Blankfein, Jamie Dimon, et al. seem to make singularly ineffective proselytizers, however.\n\nHere is where Roose and I part company (reluctantly, for my part, as I find his observations sharp and witty, while his prose is crisp and colorful). Roose predicts that Wall Street will never again be as indiscriminate in its hiring as it was in the glory days before 2008. The best and the brightest are looking elsewhere, too. In 2006 alone, Roose notes, nearly half of Princeton\u2019s graduating seniors who had a job were bound for the financial sector. The data suggests that he\u2019s right: Only 11.5 percent of Princeton\u2019s graduating seniors were bound for Wall Street in 2012.\n\nIn part, that\u2019s self-selection; in part, it\u2019s due to the buzz and energy surrounding the technology arena. It\u2019s also partly due to lackluster hiring efforts on the part of big Wall Street firms, who are busily downsizing. Like Barclays, they want to hang on to their proven rainmakers \u2014 the bankers, traders and others who have proved invaluable in generating revenue and profits \u2014while cutting back overall.\n\nRelated: For Ivy League Grads, Wall Street Is So Last Season\n\nIf, as Roose predicts, the reduced pace of hiring by Wall Street leads to fewer \u201cdilettantes\u201d being scooped up by big banks, I, at least, think that could end up having some unfortunate side effects. I\u2019ll agree with Roose that toiling away in the bowels of a Citigroup or Morgan Stanley for two impressionable years isn\u2019t always pleasant. It may even, as he argues, produce young people who \u201cwere slower to smile and quicker to criticize,\u201d and more prone \u201cto talk about the world in a transactional, economized way.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a downside to only recruiting die-hard finance geeks, however. First, even if the banks don\u2019t end up employing many of these twentysomethings long-term, there\u2019s a whole coterie of entrepreneurs and business people \u2014 or even non-profit administrators \u2014 with insight into the world of finance, for whom \u201cWall Street\u201d no longer holds any mystique. That\u2019s a loss, and it means that the kind of \"young money\" that Roose chronicles won't have the chance to experience the good, the bad and the ugly of Wall Street before moving on to whatever other businesses \u2014 technology startups, regional retailers \u2014 they prefer.\n\nBut Wall Street banks have already squandered an even bigger opportunity. When they hired this group of twentysomethings profiled by Roose, they had the chance to shape the next generation of Wall Street leaders in a different way, in light of whatever lessons they learned from the events of 2007 and 2008. His book suggests that little or nothing has changed, and that recent attempts to dial back hours and improve working conditions at Citigroup and a handful of other firms are just modifications to the existing regime.\n\nThe harsh truth remains that \u201cJeremy\u201d and his fellow Wall Street newbies gave their employers a kind of free pass: Despite the headlines, they were willing to be convinced that Wall Street could serve a bigger, broader social good. By restricting their hiring to finance club members and other fans, the big banks will face no pressure from within to change and will also ensure that there are fewer Americans out there who real understand how the Wall Street machine works. That\u2019s a pity.\n\nWhile some of Roose\u2019s subjects may have cause to regret their years on the Street, readers of his new book aren\u2019t likely to bemoan the loss of a few hours spent reading it.
