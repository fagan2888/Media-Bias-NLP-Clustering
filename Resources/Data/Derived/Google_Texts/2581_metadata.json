Johnson, sophomore Wesley Iwundu and freshman Malek Harris.\n\nHow It Happened:\n\n\u00b7 The Wildcats came out the gate firing, opening the game on a 12-1 run. Foster and Nigel Johnson combined for three 3-pointers, while senior Thomas Gipson and Edwards pitched in a free throw and layup, respectively. Also starting for the \u2018Cats was Jevon Thomas, who racked up the Wildcats\u2019 first five assists of the game \u2013 he would go onto finish with a game-high eight dimes on the afternoon.\n\n\u00b7 Back-and-forth action soon followed with the Ichabods pulling to within three, 14-11, at the 10:45 mark. The \u2018Cats would respond though, sparking a 10-0 run thanks to contributions from Foster, Edwards, Johnson and Gipson. The run helped K-State to a 32-22 lead at halftime.\n\n\u00b7 Scoring only five points in the first six minutes of the second half, newcomers Tre Harris and Hurt along with Johnson extended K-State\u2019s lead to 45-32 with just under 12 minutes left in the game. Hurt, who transferred from Northwest Florida Junior College last year, dazzled in his debut, finishing the afternoon with 12 points on 5-of-6 shooting to go along with three rebounds and two blocks.\n\n\u00b7 From there, the Ichabods would never get closer than eight points with K-State matching Washburn basket-for-basket. In fact, after extending their lead to 54-44 with 6:09 remaining thanks to an Edwards\u2019 layup, the Wildcats closed out the game scoring 14 points to Washburn\u2019s 12.\n\nBeyond the Boxscore:\n\n\u00b7 K-State is now 56-18 (.756) all-time in exhibition play, including 38-9 at Bramlage Coliseum.\n\n\u00b7 The Wildcats have now won 16 consecutive exhibition games dating back to 2004.\n\n\u00b7 K-State is 4-0 in exhibition play under head coach Bruce Weber.\n\n\u00b7 K-State is now 5-0 vs. Washburn in exhibition play.\n\n\u00b7 In addition to Edwards and Hurt, three other players made their first appearances in a Wildcat uniform, including sophomore Brandon Bolden and freshmen Tre Harris and Mason Schoen.\n\nQuotable:\n\n\u00b7 \u201cWe cannot have as many turnovers,\u201d said head coach Bruce Weber on where the team needs to get better heading into Friday\u2019s opener. \u201cWe have to rebound better, and just to make an improvement. We had some good possessions. I have talked with the guys about maturity all along. Part of maturity is when you get up 10, or 12, now you get a couple of stops and you come down and work them, break the game open. Every time we got up 10 or 12, I thought we tried to make plays on our own. Then we did not get back to the intensity on defense that kept allowing them back in the game. I hope we get better at that.\u201d\n\nUp Next\n\n\u00b7 K-State officially opens the 2014-15 season on Friday, as the Wildcats play host to Southern Utah in the second game of a doubleheader at Bramlage Coliseum.
