Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), argued publicly that the Affordable Care Act has provisions that will decide \u201cwhether a group of people live or die.\u201d\n\nThe Alabama Republican added that for Americans with life-threatening ailments, \u201cthey\u2019re gonna tell you to get your affairs in order because they\u2019re not gonna provide coverage and you\u2019re gonna die.\u201d\n\nAll of this, in reality, was complete nonsense , but it served as a disheartening reminder that, even now, the \u201cdeath panels\u201d garbage persists in some far-right circles. Fortunately, Obama administration officials are ignoring ridiculous right-wing myths and moving forward with a sensible and responsible policy on end-of-life care.\n\nMedicare said Wednesday it plans to pay doctors to counsel patients about end-of-life care, the same idea that sparked accusations of \u201cdeath panels\u201d and fanned a political furor around President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law six years ago. The policy change, to take effect Jan. 1, was tucked into a regulation on payments for doctors. It suggests that what many doctors regard as a common-sense option is no longer seen by the Obama administration as politically toxic. Counseling would be entirely voluntary for patients.\n\nDr. Patrick Conway, CMS Principal Deputy Administrator and Chief Medical Officer, said yesterday, \u201cToday\u2019s proposal supports individuals and families who wish to have the opportunity to discuss advance care planning with their physician and care team, as part of coordinated, patient- and family-centered care.\u201d\n\nAnd what\u2019s wrong with that? In reality, nothing. For some unhinged partisans, everything.\n\nAs we discussed in April, the irony is that end-of-life counseling was one of the more bipartisan elements of the entire reform initiative. The idea couldn\u2019t be simpler: doctors would be reimbursed through the Affordable Care Act for helping guide seniors through their end-of-life care options.\n\nOne of the idea\u2019s more notable champions was Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) who explained back in 2010 that having advance directives or a living will \u201cempowers you to be able to make decisions at a difficult time rather than having the government making them for you.\u201d\n\nThe right didn\u2019t care. A certain former half-term Alaska governor started throwing around the phrase \u201c death panels \u201d; some policymakers who knew better embraced the lie ; and the worthwhile idea was quietly scrapped, chalking up a victory for mindless propaganda over sensible policymaking.\n\nNow, however, officials are moving forward with the exact same idea. The NBC News report added, \u201cMedicare is using a relatively new term for end-of-life counseling: advance care planning. That\u2019s meant to reflect expert advice that people should make their wishes known about end-of-life care at different stages of their lives\u2026. The counseling aims to discern the type of treatment patients want in their last days, with options ranging from care that\u2019s more focused on comfort than extending life to all-out medical efforts to resuscitate a dying patient.\u201d\n\nSo far, I haven\u2019t seen much in the way of Republican apoplexy, which is a promising sign \u2013 perhaps the madness fever has passed. Indeed, Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush has not only endorsed the idea , he\u2019s actually gone further than the Obama administration, suggesting advance care planning should be mandatory.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Obama administration officials are ignoring ridiculous right-wing myths and moving forward with a sensible and responsible policy on end-of-life care.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ignoring-nonsense-medicare-cover-advance-care-planning", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Obama administration officials are ignoring ridiculous right-wing myths and moving forward with a sensible and responsible policy on end-of-life care.", "title": "Ignoring nonsense, Medicare to cover 'advance care planning'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ignoring-nonsense-medicare-cover-advance-care-planning", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/gettyimages-469064134-edit.jpg?itok=99Luyf9U", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ignoring-nonsense-medicare-cover-advance-care-planning", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/gettyimages-469064134-edit.jpg?itok=YPbIoCCc", "height": 553}, "title": "Ignoring nonsense, Medicare to cover 'advance care planning'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Obama administration officials are ignoring ridiculous right-wing myths and moving forward with a sensible and responsible policy on end-of-life care."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-09T10:53:13-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care,health-care-policy,medicare,obamacare,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Ignoring nonsense, Medicare to cover 'advance care planning'", "published": 1, "date": "07/09/2015 10:53:13 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ignoring-nonsense-medicare-cover-advance-care-planning"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Obama administration officials are ignoring ridiculous right-wing myths and moving forward with a sensible and responsible policy on end-of-life care.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Affordable Care Act, Health Care, Health Care Policy, Medicare, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3ef\"", "article_summary": "The NBC News report added, \u201cMedicare is using a relatively new term for end-of-life counseling: advance care planning.\nFortunately, Obama administration officials are ignoring ridiculous right-wing myths and moving forward with a sensible and responsible policy on end-of-life care.\nThat\u2019s meant to reflect expert advice that people should make their wishes known about end-of-life care at different stages of their lives\u2026.\nIndeed, Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush has not only endorsed the idea , he\u2019s actually gone further than the Obama administration, suggesting advance care planning should be mandatory.\nThe idea couldn\u2019t be simpler: doctors would be reimbursed through the Affordable Care Act for helping guide seniors through their end-of-life care options."}
