Rod Blagojevich.\n\nRepublican candidates for governor of Illinois, from left to right, Bill Brady, Dan Rutherford, Kirk Dillard, and Bruce Rauner prepare to speak a a public form at the David and Reva Logan Center for the Arts at the University of Chicago in Chicago on Tuesday. (Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune)\n\nThe comments came as Rauner, Dillard, Brady and state Treasurer Dan Rutherford marked two weeks until Election Day with a debate \u2014 one of the final three ahead of the March 18 primary.\n\nThe hour-long forum was co-sponsored by WMAQ-TV Ch. 5, the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics and the Harris School of Public Policy. It was broadcast from the university\u2019s Logan Center for the Arts' Performance Hall.\n\nBoth Dillard and Brady have been actively vying to become the chief alternative to Rauner in the minds of Republican voters. But each has acknowledged they have some catching up to do after Rauner dominated fundraising and TV airtime while they have struggled for attention.\n\nRauner has put $6 million of his personal wealth into the race while raising another $8 million, an amount far exceeding what his opponents have generated combined.\n\nDillard, a state senator from Hinsdale, said he believed there was a \u201chealthy medium\u201d between raising outside money and self-funding a political campaign.\n\n\u201cBut what Mr. Rauner has done is he\u2019s just made it obscene,\u201d Dillard said. He lashed out at Rauner\u2019s contention that he, Brady and Rutherford were merely career politicians.\n\n\u201cWhen Bruce stands here and says the three of us are part of the problem \u2014 all three of us are (civilian) legislators,\u201d said Dillard, a lawyer. \u201cWe all have private sector experience and I\u2019m not part of the problem.\u201d\n\nBrady, the 2010 GOP governor nominee who defeated Dillard by 193 votes in the primary, took his criticism of Rauner even deeper \u2014 comparing him to Blagojevich, the disgraced and imprisoned former governor.\n\n\u201cThe more I hear Bruce Rauner speak, the more he sounds like Rod Blagojevich. That\u2019s the way he (Blagojevich) came to Springfield. You have to bring people together. But you have to be decisive. You can\u2019t be divisive,\u201d said Brady, a state senator from Bloomington making his third consecutive bid for governor.\n\n\u201cMr. Rauner continues to berate the legislature and the experience of the legislature like Rod Blagojevich did. That didn\u2019t solve our problems. We need a leader.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-chicagotribune", "description": "Republican governor candidates Kirk Dillard and Bill Brady on Tuesday sought to sully front runner Bruce Rauner, contending the wealthy venture capitalist was spending an \u201cobscene\u201d...", "title": "Rivals rip Rauner during Republican governor debate", "url": "http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-03-05/news/chi-rivals-rips-rauner-during-republican-governor-debate-20140304_1_2010-gop-governor-nominee-bruce-rauner-governor-debate", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53168804/turbine/chi-rivals-rips-rauner-during-republican-gover-001/2048/2048x1379", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818}, "description": "Republican governor candidates Kirk Dillard and Bill Brady on Tuesday sought to sully front runner Bruce Rauner, contending the wealthy venture capitalist was spending an \u201cobscene\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Rod Blagojevich.\nRivals rip Rauner during Republican governor debateBut Rauner continued to attack his rivals as \u201ccareer politicians\u201d and said his proposed constitutional amendment for legislative term limits had 275,000 of the 300,000 signatures needed as a first step to put the measure on the ballot.\n\u201cThe more I hear Bruce Rauner speak, the more he sounds like Rod Blagojevich.\nRauner continues to berate the legislature and the experience of the legislature like Rod Blagojevich did.\nBoth Dillard and Brady have been actively vying to become the chief alternative to Rauner in the minds of Republican voters."}
