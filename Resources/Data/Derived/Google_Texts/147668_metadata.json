They first faced elimination more than seven weeks ago when they lost their first three postseason games to San Jose, but followed up that landmark comeback with two more seven-game series victories.\n\nThe Kings stayed on a tightrope in the Cup finals, winning the first two games in overtime before missing their first chance to finish the series in Game 4 on Wednesday. Back home in front of their grateful fans, Los Angeles rallied from a third-period deficit and played more than 94 minutes of nail-biting hockey in Game 5.\n\nAfter innumerable chances for both teams in two nail-biting extra periods, Martinez started the final rush with a pass to Kyle Clifford, who dropped it to Tyler Toffoli for a shot. The rebound went straight to Martinez, and the depth defenseman buried it for his fifth goal of the postseason.\n\n\u201cAfter it went in, I think I blacked out,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nMartinez is becoming a late-game playoff legend after also scoring in overtime in Game 7 against Chicago in the Western Conference finals, but the Kings all see themselves as part of something bigger. After finishing third in the Pacific Division and falling behind 3-0 to San Jose in the first round, coach Darryl Sutter\u2019s Kings passed every test with togetherness and level heads.\n\n\u201cThe playoffs are a very emotional time, and with all the highs and lows we\u2019ve gone through, obviously it\u2019s a really revved-up environment,\u201d said Martinez, whose goal was his only point of the finals. \u201cSo it\u2019s important to stay at an even keel, and this is a testament to the character and leadership in our room. I couldn\u2019t be happier for these guys.\u201d\n\nMarian Gaborik scored a tying power-play goal in the third period, and Jonathan Quick made 28 saves in his second Cup-clinching victory. Williams, the Conn Smythe Trophy winner, scored an early goal as Los Angeles added a second title to its 2012 championship, the first in the franchise\u2019s 47-year history.\n\n\u201cWhat we went through in 2012 (versus) what we went through this year, huge difference,\u201d said Williams, a three-time Cup champion after scoring 25 points. \u201cWe really earned it.\u201d\n\nAfter his skate with the Cup, Brown swiftly handed it to Robyn Regehr, the veteran defenseman and first-time NHL champion who never got back in the Kings\u2019 lineup after his May 3 knee injury. Regehr handed off to Gaborik, the goal-scoring dynamo and late-season acquisition who led the playoffs with 14 goals to win the first title of his 13-season NHL career.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Crown them: Gutsy LA Kings win Stanley Cup again", "title": "Crown them: Gutsy LA Kings win Stanley Cup again", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Crown them: Gutsy LA Kings win Stanley Cup again", "title": "Crown them: Gutsy LA Kings win Stanley Cup again", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/14/crown_them_gutsy_la_kings_win_stanley_cup_again/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/aptopix-stanley-cup-rangers-kings-hockey.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Crown them: Gutsy LA Kings win Stanley Cup again", "title": "Crown them: Gutsy LA Kings win Stanley Cup again", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/aptopix-stanley-cup-rangers-kings-hockey.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Greg Beacham", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "After 45 years spent mostly as a hockey punch line and a Los Angeles afterthought, the Kings have won the Stanley Cup twice in the last three seasons.\nAlthough the electric moment had a familiar feel to the Los Angeles Kings and their fans, all this success is still a bit surreal to anybody who loves this long-struggling club.\n\u201cWhat we went through in 2012 (versus) what we went through this year, huge difference,\u201d said Williams, a three-time Cup champion after scoring 25 points.\nBack home in front of their grateful fans, Los Angeles rallied from a third-period deficit and played more than 94 minutes of nail-biting hockey in Game 5.\nWilliams, the Conn Smythe Trophy winner, scored an early goal as Los Angeles added a second title to its 2012 championship, the first in the franchise\u2019s 47-year history."}
