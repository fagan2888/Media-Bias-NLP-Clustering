It would carry up to 800,000 barrels of oil daily from the Alberta oil sands\u2014and now, as it turns out, the Bakken oil fields\u2014to refineries farther south in the U.S., as far away as the Gulf of Mexico in Texas.\n\nOn Sunday more than 60 Native and non-Native opponents of the pipeline will ride into Fort Pierre, South Dakota, on horseback from the four directions, \u201cnorth, south, east and west, to show their collective resistance to the Keystone XL pipeline certification in South Dakota,\u201d the Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN) announced on Friday July 24.\n\nThe group is hoping that the riders will be greeted by hundreds of people when they arrive at the intersection of highways 83 and 14, the starting point for a march across the Missouri River Bridge. The march will end at Steamboat Park in Pierre, with a water blessing and rally led by leaders of the pipeline opposition.\n\n\u201cOrganized to show the solidarity in opposition to the South Dakota Public Utility Commission\u2019s (SD PUC) certification of the Keystone XL pipeline permit, these actions are a culmination of years of collective resistance in South Dakota,\u201d the IEN said.\n\nThe protests coincide with the July 27 start to the PUC\u2019s weeklong evidentiary hearing on TransCanada\u2019s permits for constructing the pipeline. On July 22 the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) finalized the rules on who could testify in the hearings that are designed to determine whether TransCanada\u2019s original permit can be recertified or whether the company must resubmit it from scratch. South Dakota law mandates review of a project application if construction does not begin within four years of its approval, and TransCanada received approval in 2010. Numerous tribal and environmental witnesses who wanted to testify were turned down on the grounds that their testimony and objections did not directly pertain to the conditions in the permit. Opponents of the project argue that the plans have changed significantly enough to require a complete reapplication, rather than merely recertification of the original.\n\nRELATED: Climate Scientist James Hansen Shut Out of Keystone XL Hearings in South Dakota\n\nEven though many of the witnesses who would have voiced concerns over such things as climate change (which was ruled out as an issue, since it was not addressed in the original permit) and the source of the oil (TransCanada has added extra-flammable Bakken oil fields crude to the list of what would be transported) were closed out, they said it is important to continue publicizing the issues.\n\n\u201cThe whole process is pretty atrocious at how the PUC has decided to bend to the will of TransCanada through this whole process,\u201d said Dallas Goldtooth, who heads the IEN\u2019s anti\u2013Keystone XL campaign. \u201cAt the same time it\u2019s not surprising. There have been numerous times we\u2019ve seen public officials play to the wanton whims of the energy industry. We know that there\u2019s a lot of pressure, we know that it\u2019s an uphill battle.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said, the stakes are high, and not just for Indigenous Peoples.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t good for the future of south Dakota, for our land, our water, our people,\u201d Goldtooth told Indian Country Today Media Network. \u201cAnd we\u2019re just doing the best we can to encourage the commissioners to be wiser to what\u2019s best for the future of South Dakota and for our community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis project poses too much risk to the people, lands and water for it to be approved,\u201d said Paul Draper, Dakota Rural Action board member, in the IEN statement. \u201cI hope the commissioners listen with open hearts and minds to the concerns we will be putting forth.\u201d\n\nIn addition, such fights are integral to the bigger picture, Goldtooth said.\n\n\u201cFrom an indigenous rights perspective it\u2019s bigger than this one rights issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our greater struggle to assert our rights as indigenous people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indigenous Environmental Network will hold a horseback ride and rally to protest the Keystone XL pipeline before hearings in South Dakota.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/25/keystone-xl-horse-riders-four-directions-join-protest-pierre-sd-161186", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/keystone_xl_protest_poster-indigenous_environmental_network.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Keystone XL: Horse Riders From the Four Directions Join in Protest in Pierre, SD"}, "abstract": "Indigenous Environmental Network will hold a horseback ride and rally to protest the Keystone XL pipeline before hearings in South Dakota.", "keywords": "Environmental Protests, Keystone XL, Keystone XL Pipeline, Dallas Goldtooth, Indigenous Environmental Network, South Dakota", "dc": {"title": "Keystone XL: Horse Riders From the Four Directions Join in Protest in Pierre, SD"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/25/keystone-xl-horse-riders-four-directions-join-protest-pierre-sd-161186", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-07-25T10:30-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Keystone XL: Horse Riders From the Four Directions Join in Protest in Pierre, SD"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd352\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOrganized to show the solidarity in opposition to the South Dakota Public Utility Commission\u2019s (SD PUC) certification of the Keystone XL pipeline permit, these actions are a culmination of years of collective resistance in South Dakota,\u201d the IEN said.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t good for the future of south Dakota, for our land, our water, our people,\u201d Goldtooth told Indian Country Today Media Network.\nSouth Dakota law mandates review of a project application if construction does not begin within four years of its approval, and TransCanada received approval in 2010.\nThe march will end at Steamboat Park in Pierre, with a water blessing and rally led by leaders of the pipeline opposition.\nIndigenous voices may have been largely quelched in the hearing room, but they will be vociferous outside it when evidentiary proceedings begin on July 27 in South Dakota over TransCanada\u2019s application to route the Keystone XL pipeline through the state."}
