He was a member of the maintenance crew that services the pass, CDOT said in a news release Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cDave was a doer and just a tremendous man,\u201d said David Vialpando, CDOT maintenance superintendent in Alamosa. \u201cEveryone has a story about David; he was that type of coworker and friend. He touched everyone he knew.\u201d\n\nMorris is survived by his wife, daughter and son.\n\nAccording to the State Patrol, the accident happened in an active construction zone where temporary signaling devices were in place, alternating east and westbound traffic.\n\nAn 18-wheel tractor-trailer traveling eastbound on U.S. 50 failed to stop at the signal and crossed into westbound lanes, colliding with three vehicles, including a CDOT truck being driven by Morris.\n\nThe truck driver was seriously injured. The State Patrol is investigating.\n\n\u201cDavid was on his way to serve the public when this terrible accident happened,\u201d said CDOT executive director Shailen Bhatt. \u201cEveryone who puts on the orange realizes they put themselves at risk when they go on the road. If not for David\u2019s presence and sacrifice, yesterday\u2019s tragedy may have been even worse. We are incredibly grateful for his service to CDOT and the residents of Colorado.\u201d\n\nCDOT said that since 1929, 58 employees have died in the line of duty, the last occurring in 2009.\n\nContributions in David Morris\u2019 memory may be sent to CDOT\u2019s Helping Hands, a program to assist CDOT families in need.
