A March 9 Quinnipiac University poll had Trump leading Cruz 48 percent to 40 percent among Tea Party voters in Florida, while Cruz led Trump with 38 percent to Trump's 33 percent in Ohio.\n\n\"Trump has tapped into Tea Party emotions, gaining the support of many of the most hacked off and motivated voters out there,\" said Republican strategist Ford O'Connell. \"It was a brilliant move.\"\n\nThe influence of the amorphous Tea Party has waned nationally, but it remains a potent force in many states through its thousands of committed grassroots activists.\n\nFor conservative purists, Cruz checks all the right ideological boxes of limited government and lower taxes.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, says he would maintain government programs such as Social Security and has called for higher taxes on the most wealthy Americans. In 2008, he voiced support for the government's rescue package for major banks.\n\nAfter Trump's strong showing in a string of states on \"Super Tuesday\" last month, Jenny Beth Martin -- co-founder of a national umbrella group called Tea Party Patriots - lambasted him as a conservative of convenience.\n\n\"Trump is about love of himself. But the Tea Party is about love of country and the love of our Constitution,\" she said at this month's Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nNed Ryun, founder of American Majority, a group that trains conservative grassroots activists, said Trump's outsider persona is key to his appeal to Tea Party activists.\n\n\"Cruz people feel they can work within the status quo,\" said Ryun. \"Trump people say screw the status quo, we're sick of it.\"\n\nCOURTING ACTIVISTS, DELEGATES\n\nThe billionaire has quietly maintained contacts with the movement since at least 2011, when he was flirting with a presidential run in the 2012 election.\n\nMore recently he has courted activists, focusing on prospective delegates. Trump broadened his appeal among Tea Party members in January when he secured the endorsement of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, who commands strong loyalty among many in the movement.\n\nAt the South Carolina Tea Party convention in January 2015 in Myrtle Beach, Trump spent 45 minutes with eight Tea Party activists, test-marketing themes like immigration, according to attendees.\n\nThe effort brought converts. One of those present, Gerri McDaniel, ran Trump's grassroots efforts in South Carolina. Another, Jeanne Seaver, did the same in Georgia. He won both states' primaries.\n\nAtlanta Tea Party co-founder Debbie Dooley also attended that meeting and aims to be a Trump delegate.\n\nOn the first ballot of the Republican convention in July she would be obliged to back him, but says she would continue to back him if voting goes to a second round when delegates become free to vote for whichever candidate they choose.\n\n\"I'll back Trump to hell and back,\" Dooley said.\n\nIn Michigan, New Hampshire and Nevada, Trump's successful efforts were helped by state directors formerly employed by Americans for Prosperity, a group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers that has courted Tea Party groups for years.\n\nHis Florida field director Ken Mayo held the same post at Americans for Prosperity.\n\nTrump tapped a local Tea Party leader -- Rob Scott -- to run his campaign in Ohio. Of Trump's 21 delegates from New Hampshire -- the first primary he won -- 13 have Tea Party links or affiliations.\n\nDelegate lists for Florida and Michigan -- another state that votes on Tuesday -- are not yet available because those states pick delegates at conventions after their primaries. In Ohio, candidates submit delegate lists in advance.\n\nTrump still trails Cruz on get-out-the-vote efforts, strategists and activists say.\n\nJune Pitts, a Tea Party activist in Illinois, said in previous elections she has worked at campaign offices. But Trump doesn't have one in Chicago, so Pitts is making calls herself ahead of the state's March 15 vote.\n\nIn Tiffin, Ohio, Trump delegate Jim Green said he spent $700 of his own money on yard signs before the campaign began sending him paraphernalia for free.\n\nGlenn Newman, a Trump delegate and activist in southeastern Ohio, has also been left to his own devices.\n\nTrump's campaign \"is being put together like a puppy chasing a pickup truck,\" Newman said. \"They're just playing catch-up.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Justin Madden and Amy Tennery; editing by Stuart Grudgings)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump's appeal divides Tea Party loyalties in crucial states - Reuters News:     By Nick Carey    .05/27/2016 8:17:46AM EST.", "author": "Reuters News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "By Nick Carey    (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner", "title": "Reuters News - Trump's appeal divides Tea Party loyalties in crucial states", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/03/15/trumps-appeal-divides-tea-party-loyalties-in-crucial-states-n2134031", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "By Nick Carey    (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner", "title": "Reuters News - Trump's appeal divides Tea Party loyalties in crucial states", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/03/15/trumps-appeal-divides-tea-party-loyalties-in-crucial-states-n2134031", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Trump's appeal divides Tea Party loyalties in crucial states, Reuters News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "(Graphic showing Trump Ohio delegates with Tea Party links:http://tmsnrt.rs/1Xr3aZw)TAPPING TEA PARTY EMOTIONSRecent polls have shown Trump performing well among voters who identified as Tea Party supporters.\nAt the South Carolina Tea Party convention in January 2015 in Myrtle Beach, Trump spent 45 minutes with eight Tea Party activists, test-marketing themes like immigration, according to attendees.\nJune Pitts, a Tea Party activist in Illinois, said in previous elections she has worked at campaign offices.\nOf Trump's 21 delegates from New Hampshire -- the first primary he won -- 13 have Tea Party links or affiliations.\nBut the Tea Party is about love of country and the love of our Constitution,\" she said at this month's Conservative Political Action Conference."}
