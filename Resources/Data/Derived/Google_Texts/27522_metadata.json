Lee and other Confederate leaders in New Orleans, the Georgia Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans have called for a boycott of the Louisiana city.\n\n\n\nThe New Orleans City Council voted on Dec. 17 to remove the monuments depicting Davis, Lee and General P.G.T. Beauregard. On Thursday, the Georgia division said in a news release: \u201cthe Georgia Division encourages its members and their families \u2013 as well as all Southerners \u2013 to drop plans to visit or do business in New Orleans until such time as the citizens and businesses of \u2026 (New Orleans) apply sufficient pressure to rescind the decision of the current administration.\u201d\n\nThe Confederate heritage organization strongly condemned New Orleans and terms the vote an action of \u201chate and contempt aimed directly at the history and heritage of New Orleans and the Southern people.\u201d The news release also stated that, SCV members are offended by the action as descendants of Confederate soldiers and termed the vote a \u201cperfect example of the divisive and contentious actions\u201d that \u201cseek to bring discord and division to the people of\u201d the United States.\n\nThe release also stated there is \u201cabsolutely no difference between the terrorist actions\u201d of the New Orleans leaders and \u201cthose of the Taliban and ISIS in their on-going endeavor of the destruction of cultural and historical heritage.\u201d\n\nThe wording of the release reflected that in a resolution issued by Jack Bridwell, Georgia SCV division commander, on Thursday.\n\nJefferson Finis Davis is the major Confederate figure who has the strongest ties to Coweta County. He was born on a Kentucky plantation in 1808. He served in the military and was a congressman and senator, as well as secretary of war, before the nation split over the issue of slavery in 1861.\n\nHe served as president of the Confederacy from Feb. 22, 1862\u2013May 10, 1865. Davis reviewed troops at Palmetto \u2013 in his role as commander-in-chief \u2013 on Sept. 25, 1864.\n\nDavis spoke from the back of a train in Newnan on April 30, 1886, and received a floral tribute from a group of Newnan women.\n\nLocal legend also maintains Jefferson and Varina Davis and their daughter, Winnie, were once guests at the Virginia House Hotel in downtown Newnan. Davis reportedly made a speech from a balcony \u2013 which no longer exists \u2013 on the Washington Street side of the hotel. The building now houses offices and shops.\n\nJefferson Davis was first married briefly to Sarah Knox Taylor, daughter of Gen. Zachary Taylor. The Davises contracted malaria as newlyweds. He recovered, but she died three months after they married.\n\nTaylor was serving at the 12th president of the United States when he died at the White House in 1850. Zachary Taylor's first cousin was the great-great-grandfather of Newnan artist Martin Pate, and the Lee family from Lone Oak, south of Grantville, also has genealogical ties to Taylor.\n\nDavis died in 1889 at the home of a friend in New Orleans. He was initially buried there, but was reinterred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Va., where he is buried next to his second wife, Varina Howell Davis.\n\nThe bronze memorial to the Confederate president stands at Canal Street and Jefferson Davis Parkway. It was dedicated Feb. 22, 1911.\n\nIn 2004, a graffiti artist spray painted the words \u201cslave owner\u201d on the base of the massive statue.\n\nThe December vote came after months of impassioned debate. Four preservation groups have filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to stop the city from taking down the monuments by challenging the city's removal process, according to the Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Newnan Times-Herald", "description": "In the wake of a vote to remove statues of Jefferson Davis, Robert E.
