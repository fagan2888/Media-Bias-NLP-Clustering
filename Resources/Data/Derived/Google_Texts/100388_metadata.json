Speaking this month in Washington before the so-called Values Voter Summit, he said, \"Obamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery. And it is ... in a way, it is slavery.\"\n\nAt one level, the comment is sadly unremarkable. Carson is only obeying commandments that are evidently chiseled on a stone tablet somewhere for all the extreme right to follow:\n\nThou shalt not understate.\n\nThou shalt not be thoughtful.\n\nThou shalt not make a lick of sense.\n\nAccordingly, it has become common for the extremes to liken health care reform to slavery. This juxtaposition, asinine on its face, has been embraced by New Hampshire state legislator Bill O'Brien, Rep. John Fleming and Rush Limbaugh, among others. Again: not surprising. Hyperbolic nonsense is the water in which the extremes swim.\n\nBut, of course, the claim carries a different weight coming from Carson by dint of the fact that he is black. It becomes a gift to the white right, inoculating them \u2014 or so they will surely feel \u2014 against charges of racism or racial insensitivity when they say the same stupid thing. That Carson would give that gift suggests an unseemly obsequiousness, an eagerness to please at all costs, even if that cost is one's own soul.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, should it need saying, might be a bad law, might be a good law, might be something in between. But it is assuredly not \"the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\"\n\nIn making that claim to the enthusiastic approval of a room full of white conservatives, Carson is, ironically, reminiscent of those slaves who identified so fully with \"marse\" and \"ole miss,\" craved their approval so desperately that they lost their very selves.\n\nIt is one thing for white conservatives to sing \"nobody knows de trouble I'se seen\" and proclaim themselves victims of slavery. It is quite another for a black man who, by definition, should know better, to second that delusion and thereby lend their racism a sheen of respectability.\n\nThe question of why he would so fully betray heritage is best left between Carson and his mirror \u2014 or, perhaps, between Carson and his mental health professional. The effects of that betrayal are, however, easy enough to enumerate.\n\nIt calls into question Carson's grasp of basic history. It further damages the GOP \"brand\" and the party's professed goal of outreach.\n\nWorse, it trivializes one of the great sins of the last millennium, urinates on the unmarked graves of ancestors for a cheap rhetorical stunt. As such, the statement is beneath contempt.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"site": "@columbiatribune", "description": "In 1865, American slavery ended with the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Courthouse and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ben Carson sinks to new low"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "og": {"url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/opinion/columnists/ben-carson-sinks-to-new-low/article_ade3b638-385d-11e3-8720-10604b9f6eda.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "description": "In 1865, American slavery ended with the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Courthouse and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.", "title": "Ben Carson sinks to new low"}, "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "ben carson,social issues,values voter summit,african slave trade,republican party,patient protection and affordable care act", "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "In 1865, American slavery ended with the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Courthouse and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1767\"", "article_summary": "But it is assuredly not \"the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\"\nSo says Ben Carson, celebrated neurosurgeon and newly minted star of the extreme political right.\nThe question of why he would so fully betray heritage is best left between Carson and his mirror \u2014 or, perhaps, between Carson and his mental health professional.\nBut, of course, the claim carries a different weight coming from Carson by dint of the fact that he is black.\nIt is one thing for white conservatives to sing \"nobody knows de trouble I'se seen\" and proclaim themselves victims of slavery."}
