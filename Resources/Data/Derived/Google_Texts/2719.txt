The results of the CDC data find a total of 76,251 abortions were reported in New York City in 2011, which represents a rate of 42.2 percent. Of the babies aborted, 35,188, or 46.1 percent of the total number, were black, and 23,959, or 31.4 percent, were Hispanic. White babies aborted totaled 9.550, or 12.5 percent.

Most women who had abortions in New York City that year were in the 20-24 year-old and 25-29 year-old age groups, at 30.2 percent and 25 percent, respectively.

As CNSNews.com reports, New York City’s total number of abortions surpasses the number of abortions of any state’s reports, according to CDC. In the state of Texas, 71,658 abortions were reported in 2011.

Breitbart News reported in February that a New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene report found more black babies were killed by abortion in the city than were actually born there in 2012.

Nevertheless, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) has pledged to partner with Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers to expand their businesses with “city-sponsored space” and wipe out pro-life pregnancy centers, which he referred to as “sham” clinics that do not provide “legitimate health care.”

De Blasio also said that, in order to ensure a sufficient number of abortionists to meet the high demand, he would continue to force doctors who train in city hospitals to perform abortions as a routine part of their training. The mandate is a NARAL-backed program that began under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one which de Blasio referred to as “groundbreaking.”

In addition, de Blasio has pledged to use ObamaCare to expand state-funded abortion coverage to more New York City women.
