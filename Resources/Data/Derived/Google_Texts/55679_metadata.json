He didn\u2019t even fumble his championship crustacean. For once, his victory celebration was as perfect as his performance on the track.\n\nHe completed a flawless weekend at New Hampshire Motor Speedway and won Sunday under a green-white checkered finish. Keselowski followed up Saturday\u2019s Nationwide Series victory with his first Sprint Cup win at New Hampshire, dominating in the No. 2 Ford for his third victory of the season.\n\nThe 2012 Sprint Cup champion is now tied with Jimmie Johnson for the series lead in wins.\n\n\u201cThis was just such a phenomenal weekend and these don\u2019t happen that often,\u201d he said.\n\nKeselowski had been in a slump with, of all things, his Victory Lane fun.\n\nHe needed four stitches to close a wound he received during his Victory Lane celebration in the Sprint Cup race at Kentucky. He tried to open the bottle of champagne by hitting it against a podium, and the bottle broke and cut his hand.\n\nKeselowski dropped the American flag out of his No. 22 Ford on Saturday and it was retrieved by an official to let the frivolity continue.\n\nHe joked he brought Kevlar-reinforced gloves that were touted as cut-proof.\n\nGood thing. The New Hampshire winner traditionally receives a live lobster in Victory Lane.\n\n\u201cApparently, I\u2019ve got to win more and I\u2019ll get better at it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think everybody got to hold the lobster. We\u2019re looking forward to eating the lobster later this week. I hear they\u2019re going to overnight the meat.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll get a taste of Loudon the Lobster \u2014 yes, that\u2019s its name \u2014 a 20-pounder caught off the coast of New Bedford, Massachusetts.\n\nAnd Keselowski won driving the Redd\u2019s Apple Ford Fusion, truly making the win a Redd Lobster photo opp.\n\nKeselowski keeps pilling up wins and has proved he may be even better than he was during \u201912 championship run.\n\n\u201cI think in a lot of ways, we\u2019re stronger than that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had this much speed before.\u201d\n\nAfter the last caution came with four laps left, Keselowski pulled away on the final restart to become the first driver to sweep the weekend in track history. He had the fastest car most of the weekend, even leading the speed charts during both Sprint Cup practices on Saturday.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a great car if you don\u2019t have the best driver,\u201d team owner Roger Penske said. \u201cI can tell you today, there was nobody that could beat him.\u201d\n\nKeselowski and Dale Earnhardt Jr. clinched spots in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship, provided they attempt to qualify for the final seven races before the cutoff.\n\nPole sitter Kyle Busch was second. Kyle Larson, Matt Kenseth and Ryan Newman completed the top five.\n\nBusch said the No. 18 Toyota never had enough to mount a serious challenge.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody did,\u201d he said.\n\nKeselowski led 138 of 305 laps (four more than the scheduled 301) and helped Ford to its fourth straight win. Ford last won four consecutive Sprint Cup races in 2001.\n\nClint Bowyer, Tony Stewart, Denny Hamlin, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., and Dale Earnhardt Jr. rounded out the top 10.\n\nJoey Logano was running inside the top five late in the race when he connected with Morgan Shepherd. The 72-year-old Shepherd, who extended his mark as the oldest driver to start a race in NASCAR\u2019s Sprint Cup series, was about 15 laps down when his No. 33 slid up into Logano.\n\n\u201cI feel like there should be a driver\u2019s test before you get out in a Cup car and make sure you know how to drive before you drive one,\u201d Logano said.\n\nShepherd was 39th and completed 278 laps. He was never warned about not meeting the minimum speed of 115.875 mph.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an accident. Those things happen,\u201d NASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton said. \u201cIt could happen to anybody. It could happen with any competitor.\u201d\n\nJohnson, the six-time NASCAR champion, was knocked out of the race early after two rear left tire issues. The first time the tire was flat; the second time, the tire exploded and slammed the No. 48 Chevrolet into the fence. He finished 42nd.\n\nGoodyear said the tires weren\u2019t the problem.\n\n\u201cThe tires failed in a manner consistent of low inflation pressure,\u201d Greg Stucker, Goodyear\u2019s director of racing, said.\n\nFour fully functioning tires might not have helped even Johnson catch Keselowski.\n\n\u201cI think we have a lot of potential still left in our team,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brad Keselowski dominates in New Hampshire victory", "title": "Brad Keselowski dominates in New Hampshire victory", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/13/brad-keselowski-dominates-in-new-hampshire-victory/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140713_024451_keselowski.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140713_024451_keselowski.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-13T14:31:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:19:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Keselowski followed up Saturday\u2019s Nationwide Series victory with his first Sprint Cup win at New Hampshire, dominating in the No.\nHe needed four stitches to close a wound he received during his Victory Lane celebration in the Sprint Cup race at Kentucky.\nThe 2012 Sprint Cup champion is now tied with Jimmie Johnson for the series lead in wins.\nHe had the fastest car most of the weekend, even leading the speed charts during both Sprint Cup practices on Saturday.\nThe New Hampshire winner traditionally receives a live lobster in Victory Lane."}
