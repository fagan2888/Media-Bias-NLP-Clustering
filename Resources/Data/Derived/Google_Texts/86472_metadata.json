The law would also apply to residential buildings with more than 50 units.\n\nCity Council President Rolando Lavarro, who has championed the measure, has said it would lead to better jobs for the workers and would qualify them for health care.\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act requires large employers provide health insurance to employees working 30 hours or more a week, or else the companies could be hit with financial penalties.\n\nSome of Lavarro's council colleagues say the proposal has led to a deluge of complaints from business groups and developers who want them to kill the measure. Councilman Rich Boggiano, who is opposed to it, agrees with them.\n\n\"The government should stay the hell out of business,\" he told The Jersey Journal yesterday.\n\nThe measure would likely fail if called for a vote at tonight's council meeting. Two councilmen will be absent \u2014 Khemraj \"Chico\" Ramchal is on a vacation until later this month and Daniel Rivera will be attending his daughter's college graduation \u2014 while five of the remaining members have expressed misgivings about the ordinance or outright opposition. The measure needs five affirmative votes for adoption.\n\nThe final vote on a companion ordinance that would require the same employers give property service workers 90 days' notice if they plan to cancel their contract will also be postponed.\n\nThe council meets today at 6 p.m. at City Hall, 280 Grove St.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "President Rolando Lavarro, Councilman Rich Boggiano, City Council, Detroit City Hall, health insurance, Daniel Rivera, Chico, Texas, news", "title": "Final vote on Jersey City's 30-hour workweek bill will be postponed", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "A controversial, union-backed measure that would require some employers provide a minimum of 30-hour workweeks won't be voted on as scheduled today.", "title": "Final vote on Jersey City's 30-hour workweek bill will be postponed", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2016/05/final_vote_on_jersey_city_30-h.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2016/04/26/20214936-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A controversial, union-backed measure that would require some employers provide a minimum of 30-hour workweeks won't be voted on as scheduled today.", "creator": "@terrencemcd", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2016/04/26/20214936-large.jpg", "title": "Final vote on Jersey City's 30-hour workweek bill will be postponed", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, May 11, 2016,  7:32 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, May 11, 2016,  7:31 AM", "article_author": "Terrence T.
