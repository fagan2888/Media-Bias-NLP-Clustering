He partly blamed the current premium pay system, where introducing such services was unaffordable if consultants could boost basic pay by a third and junior staff receive up to twice their standard rate for working weekends.\n\n\u201cWe have mounting evidence from places that are trying to implement this that premium rates of pay are an issue. I will be asking the pay review bodies to look at that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Sir Bruce Keogh says problems of weekend care can only be solved by ending premium rates paid to staff for working weekends", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Maev Kennedy", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Sir Bruce Keogh says problems of weekend care can only be solved by ending premium rates paid to staff for working weekends", "title": "NHS chief: poor weekend care leaving vulnerable patients feeling unsafe", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/01/nhs-chief-poor-weekend-care-vulnerable-patients-unsafe", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/1/1425225986966/b9d054c8-0aac-44aa-93b4-8cf8931dc1d7-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=007baa5f5f10c43e3dbe594e04da6959", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://society/2015/mar/01/nhs-chief-poor-weekend-care-vulnerable-patients-unsafe?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/01/nhs-chief-poor-weekend-care-vulnerable-patients-unsafe", "iphone": "gnmguardian://society/2015/mar/01/nhs-chief-poor-weekend-care-vulnerable-patients-unsafe?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/1/1425225986966/b9d054c8-0aac-44aa-93b4-8cf8931dc1d7-2060x1236.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://society/2015/mar/01/nhs-chief-poor-weekend-care-vulnerable-patients-unsafe?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "NHS,UK news,Health,Society,Hospitals,Health policy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-03-01T16:11:16.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maevkennedy", "section": "Society", "modified_time": "2015-03-01T23:10:31.000Z", "tag": "NHS,UK news,Health,Society,Hospitals,Health policy"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/1/1425225986966/b9d054c8-0aac-44aa-93b4-8cf8931dc1d7-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=e3c4ae92f92e0591c1ef1ef3e10f2699", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "NHS,UK news,Health,Society,Hospitals,Health policy"}, "article_summary": "Poor weekend care in NHS hospitals is leaving the most vulnerable patients feeling neglected and unsafe, and wasting money on operating theatres, laboratories and diagnostic equipment lying idle, Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England has said.\nHe said progress on improving weekend care was patchy, particularly slow in rural areas, and that only a minority of NHS trusts had managed to establish seven day services.\n\u201cWe have mounting evidence from places that are trying to implement this that premium rates of pay are an issue.\nBut he warned it can only be tackled by ending premium rates paid to staff for working weekends.\n\u201cEverybody knows that it\u2019s wrong to start winding down on a Friday afternoon and start cranking up again on a Monday morning,\u201d he said."}
