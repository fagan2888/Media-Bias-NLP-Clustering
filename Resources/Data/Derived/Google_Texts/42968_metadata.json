(There are 3,142 counties in the U.S.; data was not collected on counties that did not have county governments.)\n\nOf the counties studied, 16 percent haven\u2019t recovered on any indicators; 32 percent have recovered on one indicator; 30 percent on two indicators; and 16 percent have recovered on three indicators.\n\nThe population in the counties that have fully recovered is 28.9 million, or 9.4 percent of the U.S. total. About 278.7 million Americans live in counties that still have yet to fully recover from the recession. (The populations in the 73 counties without county governments is left out of these numbers.)\n\nOne of the study\u2019s researchers, Dr. Emilia Istrate, emphasizes that the 16 percent of county economies that haven\u2019t recovered on any economic indicators aren\u2019t concentrated in one area, but instead are spread across the nation. \u201cThis uneven recovery tells us why everyday Americans don\u2019t feel the national numbers. Americans don\u2019t feel the national numbers because they don\u2019t feel it in their pocket books,\u201d Istrate says.\n\nAdditionally, the study found that wage increases have been uneven across the country. While nearly half of the counties experienced upticks in both productivity and real wages between 2009 and 2014, just over a quarter of counties, most of which are in Western states, saw real wages decline while productivity increased. Total wages in these counties grew at a slower pace than jobs, or in some cases moved lower. This trend popped up in more than one-third of large county (more than 500,000 residents) economies.\n\nOne factor behind the uneven recovery has been the enormous drop in oil and gas prices. More than half of counties that depend on oil and gas production experienced declines in economic output in 2015. These counties are mostly found in the middle of the country. At the same time, counties on the West Coast and in the Northeast saw impressive economic growth of more than 4 percent last year.\n\nIstrate points out that while the nation\u2019s overall economic numbers might be moving in a positive direction, \u201clet\u2019s keep in mind that Americans don\u2019t live in the abstract, macro-economic level. They live in these counties where they feel these economies,\u201d Istrate says.\n\nRelated: Why We Might Be Headed for a Recession in 2016\n\nWhile the study\u2019s findings were sobering, one positive note is that the recovery has picked up pace. The number of counties that have recovered to pre-recession levels is almost three times more than the number reported in 2014. Last year, Texas boasted 72 recovered counties, the highest number of any state, followed by Nebraska, Minnesota, Kentucky, North Dakota, Montana and Kansas.\n\nThe two economic indicators that saw the most improvement were unemployment rates and home prices. Last year, 462 counties saw their unemployment rates fall to pre-recession levels; in total, a quarter of counties have reached pre-recession unemployment lows. In addition, nearly two-thirds of counties were back to pre-recession home prices last year, after adding 448 more counties to the list in 2015.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Roughly six years after the current economic expansion began in 2009, 93 percent of co", "title": "Here's Why Millions of Americans Feel Like the Recession Never Ended", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/13/Heres-Why-Millions-Americans-Feel-Recession-Never-Ended", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/07182011_Economy_Recession_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/13/Heres-Why-Millions-Americans-Feel-Recession-Never-Ended", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/07182011_Economy_Recession_slideshow.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Roughly six years after the current economic expansion began in 2009, 93 percent of co", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis uneven recovery tells us why everyday Americans don\u2019t feel the national numbers.\nLast year, Texas boasted 72 recovered counties, the highest number of any state, followed by Nebraska, Minnesota, Kentucky, North Dakota, Montana and Kansas.\nLast year, 462 counties saw their unemployment rates fall to pre-recession levels; in total, a quarter of counties have reached pre-recession unemployment lows.\nOne factor behind the uneven recovery has been the enormous drop in oil and gas prices.\nThe two economic indicators that saw the most improvement were unemployment rates and home prices."}
