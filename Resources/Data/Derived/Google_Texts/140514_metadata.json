But for now it will be offered to businesses that provide health benefits to their employees.\n\nAnthem was roundly criticized earlier this month after it unveiled the network of hospitals offered through its exchange policies for individuals. The network omits several New Hampshire hospitals around the state, including Concord and Portsmouth Regional.\n\nBut ElevateHealth\u2019s 3,000-provider network \u2013 ready to go into effect Dec. 1 \u2013 is currently more limited than Anthem\u2019s, concentrating on southern New Hampshire and the upper Valley, along with Keene, Derry and New London. There will be no provider network in half of the state\u2019s counties, including the Seacoast and everywhere north of Concord.\n\nIt\u2019s not a matter of quantity, but quality, said Dr. James Weinstein, CEO of Dartmouth-Hitchcock.\n\nSuch a \u201csustainable health system\u201d will consist of \u201ctaking care of people,\u201d \u201cvalue, not volume\u201d of patients, and a new shared-risk \u201cpayment model\u201d said Weinstein.\n\n\u201cThis has never been done between a payer and two provider systems,\u201d he added. \u201cIt will change the landscape in the way we live that needs to be changed.\u201d\n\nInsurance companies and providers are usually in a tug of war, said Erick Schultz, CEO of Harvard Pilgrim. It is unusual for an insurance company to be \u201cso intimate with providers. That\u2019s why this is so different.\u201d\n\nThe three groups would divvy up the pool of premiums paid through ElevateHealth. The plans will be offered by Harvard Pilgrim alongside its other health insurance offerings.\n\nFor the would-be customer, the benefits would be similar, and there will still be the high deductibles and co-pays that have become so prevalent in the field. A spokesperson for Harvard Pilgrim said that deductibles will range from $1,500 to $5,000 and primary care co-pays will range from $20 to $40 a visit.\n\nHarvard Pilgrim did not release the premium range, but said it cost about 10 percent lower than other similar plans.\n\nThere will also be the ubiquitous primary care gatekeeper, but nurses will be more involved. Weinstein and Schultz called them \u201cnavigators\u201d -- a term used in a slightly different context with ACA exchanges -- who will help patients deal with the variety of health care options.\n\nBesides the medical center in Lebanon and affiliated hospitals, Dartmouth-Hitchcock\u2019s network of clinics, in Manchester, Nashua, Concord and Keene, will be in the network, as well as the Norris Cotton Cancer Center and its air ambulance.\n\nAs for Elliot, the state\u2019s third-largest hospital, will also include its physician network as well as the Visiting Nurse Association of Manchester and Southern New Hampshire.\n\nHarvard Pilgrim currently covers 125,000 lives.\n\nOther hospitals participating will be namely Southern New Hampshire Medical Center in Nashua, Cheshire Medical Center in Keene, New London Hospital and Derry Medical Center.\n\nCatholic Medical Center in Manchester, the second-largest hospital in the state, is not on the list of participants. Neither are Concord Hospital, Portsmouth Regional Hospital, St. Joseph Hospital in Nashua, Wentworth-Douglass Hospital in Dover and Lakes Region Hospital in Laconia.\n\nBut Schultz said he will invite other providers to join and expects that they will.\n\n\u201cWe are just out of the box,\u201d he said, although he added that even at its current size, the network was large enough for the state Insurance Department to approve it as a statewide offering.\n\nActually, state officials said that while ElevateHealth could offer the product anywhere in the state, they could only market it in the approved service area of Hillsborough, Merrimack and Cheshire counties, as well as southern Grafton County and western Rockingham County. The department did approve the rates, but won\u2019t release them until they go into effect in December.\n\nConcord Hospital has already been invited to participate, but it declined to do so.\n\n\u201cWe were not able to come to terms,\u201d CEO Michael Green told NHBR.\n\nThe deal offered might make sense to communities with two hospitals trying to capture market share, he said, \u201cbut we are very dominant in our market and they wanted a steep discount. How can we do that without losing money?\u201d\n\nAnd it is market share that this is all about, said Green.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think it\u2019s about providing better care for the patient,\u201d he said. Concord Hospital already participates in various cost-sharing programs, including those with Harvard Pilgrim. \u201cWe already have care coordination in place today. Nothing to be offered by Elevate is different from what we already offer. This is simply an attempt to gain more insured patients.\u201d\n\nBut Elliot\u2019s CEO, Doug Dean \u2013 when asked if the state had too many hospitals \u2013 said that providers need to cooperate more than they have if they are to thrive.\n\n\u201cWe need to begin working closely with other hospitals to be effective,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we just work as individual hospitals, the costs will escalate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 357619467597909}, "description": "The focus will be on coordinated care and a \u2018sustainable health system\u2019", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Harvard Pilgrim did not release the premium range, but said it cost about 10 percent lower than other similar plans.\nDartmouth-Hitchcock, Elliot team up with Harvard Pilgrim in shared-risk planThe focus will be on coordinated care and a \u2018sustainable health system\u2019By Bob SandersShutterstockTwo of the state\u2019s largest hospitals have teamed up with insurer Harvard Pilgrim Health Care in a shared-risk arrangement that they say promises to cut premiums by 10 percent for employers and workers willing to narrow their choice of providers.\nAnthem was roundly criticized earlier this month after it unveiled the network of hospitals offered through its exchange policies for individuals.\nHarvard Pilgrim currently covers 125,000 lives.\nThe plans will be offered by Harvard Pilgrim alongside its other health insurance offerings."}
