The \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher\u201d host described his interactions with Williams to Time magazine.\n\nMaher explains that he didn\u2019t know Williams that well, but that they had a \u201cnice friendly relationship.\u201d He then goes on to describe Williams through the context of his two appearances on \u201cReal Time.\u201d To Maher, Williams was the perfect guest, able to mold into the talk show format. Maher explains:\n\n\u201cThe thing about Robin that I loved the most \u2014 and again, with limited experience \u2014 is that when he did my show, he was so great at it, because he was able to achieve something that eludes a lot of comedians who have tried to do Real Time. It\u2019s not an easy show to do, because you have to be very smart about politics. We don\u2019t use a lot of show business people on the panel. I can name the show business people who can do it on a couple of hands \u2014 Ben Affleck, George Clooney, Alec Baldwin, Kerry Washington \u2014 people who are very politically aware and involved, and that is their passion. But mostly, show people don\u2019t do it \u2014 we have them on, but in one-on-one settings in the mid-show. But Robin did the panel, and he was able to both modulate his normal manic persona down to what was appropriate for the show he was doing, and also, completely still be Robin Williams. That is not an easy trajectory to find, and he did, and I always loved him for it. First of all, it means you\u2019re humble \u2014 that you understand that you have to shape-shift a little to the show you\u2019re doing. Some people don\u2019t do that. Some people just refuse to do that. They wanna be exactly who they are, on whatever show they\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t agree with that. I think when you\u2019re the guest, you have to bend a little. He did that. He was still Robin Williams, but he was exactly right for the show he was doing.\n\nHis style, when it came on the scene, looked completely new to people, and in many ways it was. He was fast and furious, and I think there\u2019s something else that\u2019s behind there that you can\u2019t really quantify or define, but you could just tell there was a humanity in Robin Williams. He seems like a genuinely nice guy, like a good person who cares and tries to give back to the community. Some people, you get the impression that they\u2019re putting on an act all the time. I didn\u2019t get that impression with Robin Williams. I didn\u2019t know him well, but I always thought, there\u2019s a very decent person there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" host remembers Williams as the perfect guest VIDEO", "title": "Bill Maher: \u201cYou could just tell there was a humanity in Robin Williams\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" host remembers Williams as the perfect guest VIDEO", "title": "Bill Maher: \u201cYou could just tell there was a humanity in Robin Williams\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/14/bill_maher_remembers_fast_and_furious_robin_williams_you_could_just_tell_there_was_a_humanity_in_robin_williams/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/bill_maher.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" host remembers Williams as the perfect guest VIDEO", "title": "Bill Maher: \u201cYou could just tell there was a humanity in Robin Williams\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/bill_maher.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bill Maher, Comedy, Real Time with Bill Maher, robin williams, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfecc\"", "article_summary": "Bill Maher joined the slew of stars and non-celebrities alike who\u2019ve paid tribute to the talent and kindness of Robin Williams.\nHe was still Robin Williams, but he was exactly right for the show he was doing.\nHe was fast and furious, and I think there\u2019s something else that\u2019s behind there that you can\u2019t really quantify or define, but you could just tell there was a humanity in Robin Williams.\nI didn\u2019t get that impression with Robin Williams.\nFirst of all, it means you\u2019re humble \u2014 that you understand that you have to shape-shift a little to the show you\u2019re doing."}
