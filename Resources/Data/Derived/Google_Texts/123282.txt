A group of academics have channeled their inner Bernie Sanders and written a wonderfully na√Øve op-ed about how to lower drug prices: Destroy the industry that made America the world leader in biotechnology.



It's simple. Let government control drug prices and then corporations will just do what they always do, but it will be a lot cheaper. It is so simplistic it could have been written by Paul Krugman in the New York Times. It is also in defiance of how science, creativity and medical advancement works, and would lead to a mass exodus of science jobs from America.



Writing about the piece in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, lead author Ayalew Tefferi, M.D., a hematologist at Mayo Clinic, says, "The average gross household income in the U.S. is about $52,000 per year. For an insured patient with cancer who needs a drug that costs $120,000 per year, the out-of-pocket expenses could be as much as $25,000 to $30,000 - more than half their average household income."

He and colleagues cite a 2015 study by D.H. Howard and colleagues in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, which found that cancer drug prices have risen by an average of $8,500 per year over the past 15 years. What has risen markedly in that time? Cancer survival rates.



They claim that by controlling the market, the free market will work better. If you are a California resident enjoying paying 50 percent higher utility rates compared to the rest of the country, you see how in the real world more government control does not make the free market more efficient. If you can do math, it is better to be skeptical.



Here are their recommendations, and then evidence-based insight:

Academics: Create a post-U.S. Food and Drug Administration drug approval review mechanism to propose a fair price for new treatments that is based on the value to patients and heath care



Reality: Drug prices have gone up because government has created a Byzantine approval process, it now takes a dozen years and $2 billion to get a successful drug approved. This notion says companies should do all that work, spend the money, and then get told what to charge.



Academics: Allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices



Reality: The government will dictate prices, and industry will scale back to match it. If you are trying to get a doctor's appointment from the Veteran's Administration or under the Affordable Care Act, you already know what happens when government controls cost. It instead controls supply. Innovation costs money. If government controlled the cost of cell phones, we would still be using those giant brick things from the 1980s.



Academics: Allow importation of cancer drugs across borders for personal use (For example, prices in Canada are about half of prices in the U.S.)



Reality: Let Canadians subsidize drug costs for American consumers - or do what Canadians do and create a price floor for generic drugs, which the U.S. does not have. In reality, many poor person have a high-definition television and a cell phone because rich people pay more for faster access to technology. That is the long tail of economics. Even Paul Krugman understands that. Some African companies pay a dollar for a drug, and that is because companies can afford to do so after uptake in rich countries. In proposing this, these academics must be secretly neo-conservatives who believe poor people should be doomed to never affording drugs because they are not wealthy elites born in America.





Want to have no drug development at all, but make sure people die cheap? Ask academics how to fix science.



Academics: Pass legislation to prevent drug companies preventing a drug becoming generic



Reality: There are two issues here. One is that generic drugs have not actually helped much. As soon as a generic drug is truly cheap, the generic manufacturer abandons it. This also does nothing to solve the problem of the cost of discovery, it is just vague populism.



Academics: Reform the patent system to make it more difficult to prolong product exclusivity unnecessarily



Reality: "Unnecessarily"? Most academics have never actually created a product so this fuzzy, pointless language would be exploited by the large companies they seek to penalize, while killing small companies, which are already being damaged by the onerous approval process these academics want to make even longer, more expensive and less rewarding.



Academics: Encourage organizations that represent cancer specialists and patients (e.g., American Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society of Hematology, American Association for Cancer Research, American Cancer Society, National Comprehensive Cancer Network to consider the overall value of drugs and treatments in formulating treatment guidelines



Reality: This is another example of the concern people have about "death panels" - treatment guidelines for the rich and the poor will be different. Right now, American health care is expensive because every life is important and doctors are steeped in that mentality. Increasing such a "teach to the protocol" environment, and creating more centralized control over medical decision-making, will mean the most disenfranchised people will be impacted.



20 years ago, people said they wanted doctors to make decisions, and not the government. Now the American Cancer Society is going to pick winners and losers in the marketplace and among the public? Not a good idea for anyone.



*****



It's laudable that a team of academics have gotten together to draft a plan that other academics will cheer about (corporations evil, academics goooood) - but it is instead a reminder that it is always easy to spend someone else's money. To people who understand economics and drug development, these recommendations are equivalent to a homeopath telling doctors 'you don't know until you try it' about curing cancer.
