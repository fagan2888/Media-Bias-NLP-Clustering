A summary of the study was released last month and sparked controversy for suggesting all-male units outperformed those with women. The sexual assault information was not included in the summary.\n\nThe report does not specify the circumstances of the sexual assaults or whether men or women reported them. One was reported formally, while the remaining six were reported anonymously, according to the report.\n\nThe news of the sexual assaults comes as Defense Secretary Ashton Carter is deciding whether to grant any exceptions to the order to open all military jobs to women. The Marines are reportedly the only service branch that requested any exemptions.\n\nAs part of its effort to determine whether to ask for exemptions, the Marines formed the ITF unit with 300 men and 100 women. The nine-month study included training and a simulation of being deployed.\n\nIn a statement to The Post, Marine Corps spokesman Maj. Chris Devine said the sexual assaults could have happened outside the ITF.\n\n\u201cThis behavior \u2014 whether on duty, on liberty or online \u2014 is not in keeping with our core values and is detrimental to victims and to unit cohesion and readiness,\u201d Devine said. \u201cWithout violating the confidentiality of our Marines, it\u2019s impossible to tell if the sexual assaults they experienced occurred at the ITF, while on liberty or leave, or at a prior unit. Because of the anonymous reporting, these cases of sexual assaults could have occurred [as a member of the integrated task force] and could have occurred prior to joining.\u201d\n\nIn the whole of the Marines, 7.9 percent of women were sexually assaulted in the past year, according to the report.\n\nOne of the female Marines who participated in the study told The Post she was surprised by the reports of sexual assault. She said the task force had training on sexual assault awareness and prevention, as well as sexual assault prevention and response officers, just like other units she has been a part of.\n\n\u201cI never experienced, saw or heard of any sexual assault cases while I was with the unit,\u201d Sgt. Danielle Beck said. \u201cIf there were any, it should have been addressed to the entire unit.\u201d\n\nThe report also delves into the details of the publically released summary of the unit\u2019s performance. The report found both positives and negatives in integrating women into all ground combat jobs.\n\nPositives include increased diversity, superior decision-making skills of integrated groups and lower instances of disciplinary actions. Negatives include twice as many injuries, less accuracy with certain weapons and slower tactical movements.\n\nStill, the report does not make a recommendation as to whether to integrate women into all units.\n\n\u201cIn the end, the recommendation of the commandant will have to be based on best military judgment,\u201d according to the report, \u201cas there cannot be a definitive correct answer, but simply one that is best supported by empirical evidence and formulated with the needs of the Marine Corps in mind.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Marines seek some exemptions to full integration.", "description": "Marines seek some exemptions to full integration.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Rebecca Kheel", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Marines seek some exemptions to full integration.", "title": "Report: Marines studying gender integration find seven sexual assaults", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/257027-report-seven-sexual-assaults-reported-by-marine-unit-studying-integration-of", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/femalemarines09112015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/257027-report-seven-sexual-assaults-reported-by-marine-unit-studying-integration-of", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-15T12:30-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Kheel", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "military sexual assault, Military women,,Marines", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-15T12:30:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/257027-report-seven-sexual-assaults-reported-by-marine-unit-studying-integration-of", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Marines seek some exemptions to full integration.", "card": "summary", "title": "Report: Marines studying gender integration find seven sexual assaults"}, "dcterms.title": "Report: Marines studying gender integration find seven sexual assaults"}, "article_summary": "She said the task force had training on sexual assault awareness and prevention, as well as sexual assault prevention and response officers, just like other units she has been a part of.\nStill, the report concluded that there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that sexual assaults in the Marines would rise after gender integration in ground combat units.\nThe report does not specify the circumstances of the sexual assaults or whether men or women reported them.\nIn a statement to The Post, Marine Corps spokesman Maj.
