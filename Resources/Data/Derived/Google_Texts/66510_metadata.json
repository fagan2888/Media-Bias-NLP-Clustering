Health care is a $3 trillion business in the U.S.; close to 1 in 5 dollars of today\u2019s Gross Domestic Product is health care spending, up from 1 in 20 in the 1960s.\n\nMedicaid in particular is the element of health care that stands out the most, said panelist Ed Flentje, who formerly served as Wichita\u2019s interim city manager.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about health care policy\u2026it\u2019s a new development,\u201d he said.\n\nThough the non-partisan event did not set out to advocate any particular political stance, all four panelists spoke extensively about the importance of health care coverage, whether it\u2019s under a private plan, Medicaid or in the federal insurance marketplace. David Gear, director of Wichita\u2019s Guadalupe Clinic, which serves under-insured and uninsured individuals, said there are an estimated 70 to 75,000 uninsured individuals in Sedgwick County\u2014though the number is likely higher including undocumented immigrants.\n\nStill, said Sheldon Weisgrau, director of the Health Reform Resource Project,\n\nthe ACA has been \u201ca stunning success,\u201d but not one without room for improvement.\n\nGear and Teresa Lovelady, president and CEO of the HealthCore Clinic in Wichita, described the so-called \u201cdonut hole\u201d that leaves many in limbo between the Affordable Care Act marketplace and Medicaid Lovelady says many will come to her clinic ready to sign up for insurance in the marketplace, only to find out they don\u2019t qualify for insurance in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain to someone, \u2018You\u2019re not poor enough, but then you don\u2019t have enough money. You\u2019re not rich enough. So we can\u2019t help you\u2019?\u201d she said.\n\nGear says Sedgwick County is \u201cblessed\u2026to have a network of safety-net clinics that operate on a sliding scale\u201d to serve those without adequate insurance, but Lovelady noted that organizations like hers are always struggling to have enough money to continue to provide the safety net. And someone always ends up paying for health care.\n\n\u201cWhy should you guys be engaged and encouraged to vote?\u201d she said. \u201cBecause these things directly impact you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Community", "description": "EngageICT: Health Care January 12, 2016 at Reverie Coffee Roasters Engage ICT, KMUW\u2019s civic initiative, kicked off its Democracy on Tap series with a", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kmuw.org/post/engageict-health-care", "type": "article", "description": "EngageICT: Health Care January 12, 2016 at Reverie Coffee Roasters Engage ICT, KMUW\u2019s civic initiative, kicked off its Democracy on Tap series with a", "title": "EngageICT: Health Care"}, "story_id": 478714164, "twitter": {"site": "@kmuw", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kmuw"}, "author": "Nadya Faulx", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "EngageICT: Health Care"}, "nid": 67820, "datePublished": "2016-05-19", "keywords": "Engage ICT", "wordCount": 640, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Health care is a $3 trillion business in the U.S.; close to 1 in 5 dollars of today\u2019s Gross Domestic Product is health care spending, up from 1 in 20 in the 1960s.\nEngageICT: Health CareJanuary 12, 2016 at Reverie Coffee RoastersEngage ICT, KMUW\u2019s civic initiative, kicked off its Democracy on Tap series with a panel on health care.\nAnd someone always ends up paying for health care.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about health care policy\u2026it\u2019s a new development,\u201d he said.\nAttendees gathered at Reverie Coffee Roasters to hear how issues from Medicaid to the health insurance marketplace will shape the 2016 election year."}
