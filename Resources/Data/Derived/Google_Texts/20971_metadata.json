It isn\u2019t against poverty or drugs. Those who are casualties of this war often greet death brought to them by their own hands on American soil.\n\nThis new war is against veteran suicide.\n\nIn January 2013, my husband Charles Popoloski, an Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran, received word that one of his former battalion commanders, Col. Richard E. White, passed away due to suicide. It is unknown why the colonel decided to take his own life. What is known is that the statistic of 22 veterans a day does not discriminate against age, rank, gender or branch of service. What is also known is that the colonel was admired by many, including soldiers such as my husband. We visited the colonel\u2019s gravesite this past year at Arlington National Cemetery and I know Charlie would have much rather visited with him and not a white tombstone.\n\nNot only are veterans casualties of suicide, but many of their caregivers also battle similar demons. It is unknown how many military caregivers die by suicide. According to the RAND Hidden Heroes: America\u2019s Military Caregivers study, 38 percent of post-9/11 military caregivers meet the criteria for depression and only 34 percent of the caregivers who meet this criteria are receiving mental health treatment. For pre-9/11 caregivers, 19 percent meet the criteria for depression, and 37 percent of the pre-9/11 caregivers who meet this criteria are receiving mental health treatment.\n\nThe month of September is Suicide Prevention Month and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is working to raise awareness of not only veteran suicide, but also veteran caregiver and family suicide. The Veterans Crisis Line is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Veterans, as well as their caregivers, friend and family can go to the VA\u2019s website, call 1-800-273-8255 and Press 1 or text 838255 to receive free, confidential support.\n\nA woman I\u2019ll call Jane Smith to protect her identity is a caregiver of a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress, and she struggled with depression while caring for her him. A mother of two, Mrs. Smith said she \u201cnever felt the sheer desperation and lack of will to fight anymore until our last two years.\u201d She had grown exhausted, and was struggling while dealing with her husband. In addition, finances were a major strain and the family almost ended up homeless.\n\n\u201cI had aged 20 years in two years \u2026 I had unidentified medical issues reeking [sic] havoc on my body. Dying consumed my thoughts. All I wanted to do was kill myself. I stopped eating. I barely drank anything. I lost 50 lbs in a month. I just wanted to die,\u201d said Mrs. Smith.\n\nShe credits being a mother and her family for not following through with her thoughts. With the help of outside professional support, as well as the blessing of being awarded a mortgage free home this past year, Mrs. Smith\u2019s mental health has greatly improved. \u201cThey have saved the remaining sanity I possess,\u201d said Mrs. Smith of her support.\n\nAnother caregiver, 2014 Arizona Elizabeth Dole Foundation Fellow Melissa Comeau, turned to writing poetry as a way to cope with the stress and depression often associated with military caregiving. She recently published a book of poetry, \u201cSleeping With the War,\u201d and now works to support other military caregivers through the Military Veteran Caregiver Network http://www.milvetcaregivernetwork.org (MVCN). The MVCN hosts a private, secure online forum for military caregivers of all war eras, as well as a public and comprehensive resource list and online military caregiving magazine.\n\nYet another caregiver I\u2019ll call Mary Hall has supported her husband, an Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran through not only deployments, but post-military life. Mrs. Hall \u2018s husband was on the phone when one of his former soldiers committed suicide. \u201dFor the longest time I had to keep reassuring my husband that there was nothing he could have done \u2026 My husband kept saying that had he stayed in contact more often this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d\n\nMrs. Hall\u2019s husband told her that it isn\u2019t \u201cjust the person who commits suicide who is affected by that choice. Everyone who is left behind had to deal with that decision on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nHer husband also said, \u201cWe can\u2019t minimize how one\u2019s own experiences make them feel. Just because we might feel that their experiences are insignificant we never know how it has impacted that person.\u201d\n\nMrs. Hall has also helped her husband cope with survivor\u2019s guilt. Their young son tragically passed away and Mr. Hall blamed himself, saying that it was God punishing him for an incident that happened while deployed. Mr. Hall also blames himself for the death of another soldier on a deployment that he was unable to fulfill due to medical reasons. Mrs. Hall credits her faith and faith-based support system, as well as connecting with other military caregivers for giving her the strength to take care of not only herself but her husband as well.\n\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed, depressed or suicidal, please call the Veterans Crisis Line at 800-273-8255.\n\nThe journey of being a veteran or military caregiver can be overwhelming. But please remember that even during dark times, you are loved, wanted and needed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There is a new war being waged in America today.
