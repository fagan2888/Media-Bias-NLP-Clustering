Ben Carson is undeniably an intellectual giant. The Carson canonization narrative is fairly well-known. He was beset by all the societal ills that conservatives attribute to poor family structure in black communities. His parents had little formal education. By the time he was a teenager, a single mother was raising him. In today\u2019s parlance, Carson was \u201ctroubled\u201d; he acted out, got bad grades and showed little interest in education. What saved the boy who would grow up to be a neurosurgeon of remarkable fame, respect, and glory? Books. He read his way into a life of self-discipline, Yale University, and one of the medical field\u2019s most competitive specialties. Related Story Ben Carson Gets His Bounce I\u2019m not kidding; that\u2019s the canon on Ben Carson. I know it because when I was growing up, we heard that story in various iterations from well-meaning adults who worried about our lack of good black role models. If you\u2019re a black child in America, everyone is always very worried that you don\u2019t have enough role models, which shouldn\u2019t be confused for things like clean air, affordable housing, adequate schools, or civil liberties. Carson was one of my generation\u2019s official black role models. Unlike athletes or musicians, Carson had not excelled by becoming popular, but by relying on his smarts. As far as black role models went, Carson was a double-whammy. He was apolitical, and his success refuted the well-worn, deeply held American conviction that African Americans are genetically hobbled intellectually. Carson\u2019s intellectual prowess became part of his political narrative. When he spoke at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast he was introduced as \u201ca man who loves Jesus\u201d who has \u201ca compelling life story,\u201d and as a \u201cdistinguished man of science and healing.\u201d With Barack Obama and Joe Biden sitting stage-right as he spoke, Carson went on to deliver a classic conservative speech about moral decay, the dangers of a public health-care system, and the great scourge of political correctness. Almost immediately, the political right called on Carson to make a run for the White House.\n\nAnd running for the White House is what Carson is doing. Along the way, he is employing the kind of rhetoric that astounds those who place their political faith in reason, science, and intellectualism. This piece was almost impossible to write because Carson seems to issue a new head-scratcher every day\u2014and twice a day on Sundays. After a particularly deadly week of school shootings, including one at a community college in Oregon, Carson suggested he would have attacked a shooter. His \u201c[the shooter] can\u2019t get us all\u201d comment comes off blas\u00e9, especially given the social dictate to respect the mourning periods for victims\u2019 families. Talking about faith, family, and values Carson recently argued that \u201cmost of the time [single mothers\u2019] education ends with that first baby\u201d and those children go on to welfare and prison. That isn\u2019t a new position by any stretch of the imagination, but it strikes some people as odd coming from someone whose personal story is integral to his own single-mother upbringing. And, then, there is the \u201cwoopsie\u201d about the debt ceiling, a fairly run-of-the-mill political function. In a recent interview, Carson seemed either confused about what the debt ceiling is or so committed to his standard political rhetoric that he couldn\u2019t pivot to address the actual question. Carson\u2019s grasp of history, politics, emotional intelligence, social norms, government procedure, and even his own backstory seems variable and thin. That\u2019s not new, either. This is the political process that previously produced Sarah Palin, to be fair. But Carson\u2019s personal story is fundamentally the anti-Palin story. He is not just smart but brilliant; not only accomplished, but exceptionally so. How, as Paul Waldman recently wrote, could Ben Carson be both \u201cso incredibly smart and so spectacularly stupid?\u201d Waldman is not the only one to juxtapose Carson\u2019s intellectual-greatness narrative with his arguably intellectually regressive political rhetoric. Rather than debate whether I believe Carson is stupid (I don\u2019t) or if he is the savior of conservatives (he isn\u2019t) or even if he is a good politician (nay, from the lady in the back), I prefer to marvel at the incredulity that a man of science could also be a bad politician.\n\nMany Americans revere science and rationality even when they may personally reject its sway over their own decision-making. American culture, its system of values, and all its attendant rewards for reflecting those values\u2014money, honor, social ties\u2014skew heavily in favor rationality. Americans may like to think that when presented with \u201cobjective\u201d facts and \u201chard data\u201d they will make objectively correct choices. And, they may assume that rational decision-making is static and consistent across all of the choices they make, from which detergents they buy to whom they marry. What they often don\u2019t like are emotions. Emotions are variable. They are inconsistent. They are, in the language of markets, inefficient to scale and monetize. But, science (apologizing for the appeal to rationality to make a case about emotions) is fairly clear that people make decisions based on emotions all the time. And, often, how they feel about a choice can override any objective data at hand about the choice they\u2019re making. Having mad feels is the human condition. There is little evidence to support the assumption that adopting a \u201crational\u201d occupation equates to a faith in rationality in all areas of life. But that does not stop Americans from venerating scientific rationality as the great god among all ways of knowing. That is why they venerate someone like Ben Carson, who has literally touched the genesis of all human rationality, the human brain, with his bare hands. So strong is the rhetoric of rationality in American culture that even when those who are predisposed to thinking African American children of single mothers are abhorrent make exceptions for someone like Carson. He is an outlier who doesn\u2019t disprove the rule of black inferiority; he is even more exceptional for existing despite the rule. Smart people like to think that they are rational. They make rational decisions about what to think and believe and do so based on objective facts. Carson is trained in one of the most celebrated rational professions, but he believes some things that don\u2019t seem very rational. He believes, for example, that the earth was created in six actual days.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why Ben Carson\u2019s success as a neurosurgeon doesn\u2019t translate to politics", "author": "Tressie McMillan Cottom", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Why Ben Carson\u2019s success as a neurosurgeon doesn\u2019t translate to politics", "title": "Running for President Isn't Brain Surgery", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/10/AP_875629784945/facebook.jpg?1444746807", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/ben-carsons-halo-effect/410260/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Related Story Ben Carson Gets His Bounce I\u2019m not kidding; that\u2019s the canon on Ben Carson.\nHow do we make sense of Ben Carson?\nBen Carson is undeniably an intellectual giant.\nI know it because when I was growing up, we heard that story in various iterations from well-meaning adults who worried about our lack of good black role models.\nAs far as black role models went, Carson was a double-whammy."}
