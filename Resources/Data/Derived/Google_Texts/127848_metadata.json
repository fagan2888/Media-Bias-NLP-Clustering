The issue only affects states using the federal marketplace, not state-based exchanges.\n\nAs a result, the agency has mailed letters to those Medicaid consumers, directing them to cancel their marketplace plan and repay the credit they received to help pay for the plan.\n\nA notice from CMS does not indicate how many consumers are affected, but a CMS spokeswoman described it to Modern Healthcare as \u201ca small number.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe situation reveals an issue with the way consumers can inadvertently end up enrolled in both forms of coverage, and places the burden to resolve it on individuals who may not understand it.\n\n\u201cThe CMS letter may lead to considerable confusion,\u201d Kip Piper, a consultant and former CMS official, told Modern Healthcare. \u201cMany people will not understand what they need to do. Low income families tend to move often, so many addresses may be inaccurate.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdding to the confusion is numerous states put their own brand on Medicaid and CHIP programs, so many of those enrolled may not understand that the CMS letter applies to them.\n\nThe issue of dual enrollment typically arises when an ACA-insured individual then qualifies for Medicaid or CHIP, and they don't know to terminate their marketplace coverage, CMS says.\n\nAdditional complicating factors are low-income families frequently have fluctuations in income that impact what options they qualify for. They may not understand their reponsibility to report these changes, experts tell Modern Healthcare.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nModern Healthcare: Some Medicaid users are inadvertently getting marketplace tax credits\n\nCMS.gov: Periodic data matching in the federally-facilitated marketplaces FAQ", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Heather Caspi", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/7e/ad/7ead1c4e141db95ced434137f1f0a761.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-health-law", "news_keywords": "Payer,Health Law", "category": "News Post", "title": "Inadvertent Medicaid, ACA dual enrollments bring headaches", "pub_date": "oct 02, 2015", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-02T16:02:05", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, October 02, 2015, 04:02 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2025-09-19T16:02:05", "teaser": "<p>Medicaid consumers are being told they must repay any tax credits they received for ACA plans.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2015-10-02", "sailthru.description": "Medicaid consumers are being told they must repay any tax credits they received for ACA plans.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Medicaid consumers are being told they must repay any tax credits they received for ACA plans.", "title": "Inadvertent Medicaid, ACA dual enrollments bring headaches", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/inadvertent-medicaid-aca-dual-enrollments-bring-headaches/406615/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/20140707_095043_HDR.png", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/83/a6/83a63c075add11e43fb33612647697fd.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2fae\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe CMS letter may lead to considerable confusion,\u201d Kip Piper, a consultant and former CMS official, told Modern Healthcare.\nThe issue of dual enrollment typically arises when an ACA-insured individual then qualifies for Medicaid or CHIP, and they don't know to terminate their marketplace coverage, CMS says.\nRecommended ReadingModern Healthcare: Some Medicaid users are inadvertently getting marketplace tax creditsCMS.gov: Periodic data matching in the federally-facilitated marketplaces FAQ\nThey may not understand their reponsibility to report these changes, experts tell Modern Healthcare.\nAs a result, the agency has mailed letters to those Medicaid consumers, directing them to cancel their marketplace plan and repay the credit they received to help pay for the plan."}
