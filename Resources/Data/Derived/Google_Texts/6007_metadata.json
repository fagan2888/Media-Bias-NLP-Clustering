There\u2019s something oddly beautiful about GOP lawmakers, after already having voted several dozen times to destroy the law, taking this up again \u2026 on Groundhog Day.\n\nBut as this rather pathetic waste of time moves forward in the lower chamber, the question that continues to dog Republican officials hasn\u2019t changed: after they repeal the ACA, what exactly do they intend to replace it with? Politico reported late last week that a new initiative is underway.\n\nThree powerful committee chairmen \u2013 including Rep. Paul Ryan \u2013 will lead a working group to develop an alternative to Obamacare, the House Republicans\u2019 most serious attempt thus far to develop their health care reform package, according to GOP sources. Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, will work with Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton of Michigan and Education and Workforce Chairman John Kline of Minnesota to develop the health care plan. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will unveil the task force this afternoon, GOP sources said.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that this conservative trio will come up with something \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as likely, but it\u2019s possible \u2013 though I don\u2019t think the political world fully appreciates just how overdue this GOP health care plan really is.\n\nOn June 17, 2009, then-Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) made a bold promise. The Missouri Republican, a member of the House Republican leadership at the time, had taken the lead in crafting a GOP alternative to the Affordable Care Act, and he was proud to publicly declare , \u201cI guarantee you we will provide you with a bill.\u201d\n\nThe same week, then-Minority Whip Eric Cantor (R-Va.) told reporters that the official Republican version of \u201cObamacare\u201d was just \u201c weeks away .\u201d It wouldn\u2019t just be awesome; it\u2019d be proof that far-right lawmakers could deliver real solutions better than those rascally Democrats.\n\nThat was nearly six years ago. Blunt was promoted to the Senate; Cantor lost in a primary; Republicans took over one chamber and then the other; and now we\u2019re supposed to believe GOP House members are prepared to work on a \u201c serious attempt \u201d at health care reform?\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) added on Fox News last week, \u201cThere will be an alternative, and you\u2019re going to get to see it.\u201d The second half of that sentence seemed especially amusing \u2013 as if Republicans might create an ACA alternative that we weren\u2019t allowed to see.\n\nTime will tell, of course, whether Republicans follow through on the same promises they\u2019ve already failed to keep . But as the process unfolds, keep a few things in mind.\n\nFirst, this new message from GOP leaders probably isn\u2019t intended for us, so much as it\u2019s directed to the Supreme Court. If Republican justices are concerned in the slightest about systemic chaos in the American health care market, GOP lawmakers are signaling to the court, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re working on a new plan. It\u2019ll be awesome.\u201d The promise is probably a lie, but it\u2019s a lie that might make some justices feel better.\n\nSecond, the Republican alternative, if it exists, is going to be genuinely, cover-your-eyes horrible. How can I know that? Because in order to actually reform the pre-2010 health care system, policymakers have to commit to extensive public investments, expansive government regulation of the insurance industry, and a commitment to help struggling families receive guaranteed benefits. In other words, to do reform right, Republicans would have to do some of the things they refuse to even consider doing. Instead, they\u2019ll do reform wrong, and when the GOP alternative stands alongside \u201cObamacare\u201d and consumers are allowed to compare, it won\u2019t be much of a contest.\n\nAnd finally, though this point is routinely lost on much of the chattering class, Republicans don\u2019t actually like health care reform, which is why we\u2019ve waited for nearly six years to see a plan that still doesn\u2019t exist. GOP lawmakers didn\u2019t see the old system \u2013 the bankruptcies, the uninsured rates, the deaths, Americans paying more for less \u2013 as a problem requiring a solution, which is precisely why they haven\u2019t invested energy in writing a detailed reform blueprint.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Americans have been waiting nearly six years for the GOP's alternative to Obamacare.
