Cancer patients who are losing their state health insurance at the month will have continued coverage at Memorial Sloan Kettering, the city and hospital announced on Wednesday.

The state's largest co-op, Health Republic is folding at the end of the month, and the 114 cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering will receive continued treatment under the city's MetroPlus plan.

“The collapse of Health Republic left many New Yorkers scrambling to find new coverage and providers — today’s deal ensures that the most vulnerable of this group continue to receive high-quality treatment,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. “I thank NYC Health and Hospitals for its leadership and Memorial Sloan Kettering for agreeing to work with MetroPlus.”

Health Republic, set up by the Affordable Care Act, has 200,000 customers. The state is investigating the collapse.
