Those numbers show that 59 percent of the 54,266 Montana residents who signed up for health insurance plans re-enrolled, meaning they signed up again after enrolling last year.\n\n\u201cI was struck by how there was good representation of folks buying in Healthcare.gov (the marketplace website) all over the state,\u201d said Jennifer McKee, communications director for Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance Monica Lindeen, whose office watches over the insurance industry in the state.\n\nIn 2014, 36,600 Montanans signed up for insurance through the marketplace, which acts as an online kiosk for shopping for individual health policies and offers federal subsidies for those eligible under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nNew Hampshire had the highest percentage, with 60 percent of its 53,005 residents having signed up again after enrolling in 2014. Louisiana and South Carolina were lowest with 42 percent each.\n\nFederal officials said that 85 percent of Montanans who signed up on the marketplace in 2015 get financial help to cover the costs, with an average monthly premium reduction of 66 percent after receiving a federal tax credit. Enrolled Montanans pay an average monthly premium of $116, down from $346 before the credit.\n\nThat credit has helped to ensure Montana\u2019s signup numbers stay strong, McKee told The Billings Gazette (http://bit.ly/1LZGzO6).\n\n\u201cIf people weren\u2019t getting a tax credit, they might not be able to afford insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the point of the (ACA) legislation in large measure. Health insurance was unaffordable for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nHaving four companies \u2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana, PacificSource, the Montana Health Co-op and Assurant \u2014 selling policies on Montana\u2019s marketplace could also help.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got good competition in our market,\u201d McKee said. \u201cOur rates in 2015 didn\u2019t really go up that much.\u201d\n\nHowever, Assurant has started to notify its more than 7,000 Montana customers that it plans to pull out of the national marketplace and that their policies will not be renewed after Dec. 31, according to Lindeen\u2019s office.\n\nAnd the insurance companies in Montana have also reported large losses on individual marketplace policies and recently asked for double-digit rate hikes.\n\nLindeen must first approve those increase requests, which remain under review.\n\nThe number and percentage of signups by county varied wildly across Montana.\n\nYellowstone County, the most populous in the state, saw 5,510 residents sign up through the marketplace, representing about 3.5 percent of the county\u2019s total population.\n\nThree other counties in Montana saw more total signups than Yellowstone. In Gallatin County, which saw the most total, 7,826 people (about 8.2 percent of the population there) signed up. Missoula County saw 7,716 signups (6.9 percent) while Flathead County reported 6,371 (6.8 percent).\n\nButte-Silver Bow and Lewis and Clark counties each saw 4.2 to 4.3 percent of their populations sign up while 8.76 percent of Park County residents enrolled this year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Flathead Beacon", "description": "BILLINGS \u2014 Montana has the nation\u2019s second highest rate of people re-enrolling in the health exchanges established under the federal health care law.
