Unfortunately, much of what he is running on today undermines any good he did. A Republican\u2019s Republican two decades ago, Kasich the Congressman and Presidential candidate was the fiscal watchdog outsider that never caught the national spirit in 2000. John McCain would soar on his real maverick roots, squeaking past George W. Bush, but felt the Rove crush in South Carolina. Like McCain, Kasich would have maintained a better following \u2013 and been a better President \u2013 if elected in 2000. That was not to be, and he is not to be this time around, either.\n\nHis second shot at the national limelight began in 2010, elected Ohio\u2019s Governor during the Tea Party\u2019s Great Awakening. He set to work balancing the state\u2019s budget, cutting the spending and trimming the unwelcome leaven. He tried to out-Walker Scott Walker, and pushed for collective bargaining reforms including police officers and fire-fighters.\n\nSadly, he lost that fight. Timing is everything in politics, including necessary political reforms. Kasich\u2019s decision to follow Walker\u2019s Act 10 with his heavier spin ended a major effort which could have succeeded with better coordination, much like his first Presidential run in 1999. What would anyone expect trying to pick the same fight, with the international union hordes just a few states away? Walker caught the unions off guard, but they geared up quickly to squelch Kasich\u2019s agenda.\n\nDespite Kasich\u2019s reelection by massive double-digits in 2014, conservatives confront Kasich on his heretical, illiberal policy decisions, specifically his Obamacare embrace, and take the \u201cfool\u2019s bet\u201d Medicaid expansion. For the Ohio Governor, who has played the moderate card all too often, he still preaches the need for fiscal discipline, but his lumpy liberalism is showing forth, and should have knocked him out of consideration for the Election 2016 GOP nomination from the outset.\n\nTaking on the Affordable Care Act, Kasich contends that the loaves and the fishes for a good life can come from the government. Then he argues that Common Core will improve education. Earlier this year, Texas Governor Greg Abbott excoriated Common Core, and proved that he was more educated about the topic, and would have schooled Kasich in the process.\n\nBeyond that, Kasich celebrates amnesty and celebrates a guest worker program, citing the argument that \u201cwe\u201d should do the most for the least among us. Did Kasich not get that joke from the Gipper? \u201cThe nine most dangerous words in the English language: \u2018I\u2019m from the government, and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d Help and charity are all well and good, but the Lord loves a cheerful (not a tearful) giver. The government has nothing to give, but merely takes from one and gives to another.\n\nNevertheless, the Buckeye Governor bucks conservative trends, and justifies his wholesale sellout to the Deity of Big Government with frequent references to God. \u201cGod has a plan for you! God bless you!\u201d Kasich frequently intones during TV interviews. Right, a lot like \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201d Tell that to the millions who have lost their insurance plans in this country. Kasich\u2019s idolatry will lead to \u201cIf you like your liberty and security, you can keep them, too!\u201d Ask the tens of millions who have been slaughtered by totalitarian governments throughout the world. The state with a sprinkled veneer of \u201cHoly this and that\u201d does not make it holy, no more than sitting in the White House makes one President (consider Barack Obama).\n\nEven worse, Kasich played the \u201cHail Mary!\u201d card to justify the Big Government \u201cHale-Bob\u201d Kool-aid during the August 6th Fox News debate, too:\n\n\"Now, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he\u2019s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small,\" Kasich said. \"But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.\u2019\"\n\nNever mind the theological fraud of this argument. Jesus provided a better answer during His earthly ministry:\n\n\u201cRender unto Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s. And Render unto God what is God\u2019s.\u201d\n\nIn case you missed the subtext, it all belongs to Him, so stop trying to take it from others!\n\nIn the meantime, wouldn\u2019t it be nice for politicians to stop robbing Peter to pay Paul? Government justifies taking from makers and making more takers. Would Kasich like to say \u201cThank you\u201d to all the federal taxpayers who are subsidizing his now over-budget Medicaid expansion?\n\nThe fact that Kasich misuses the Bible to sanctify more government in our lives is particularly reprehensible. I don\u2019t fear the devil whose horns I see, but the devil wearing Prada preaching Pravda, and Kasich fits that description all too well. Like a third-tier cable televangelist, a false prophet looking for easy profits with \u201cJust send me $10, and we will pray your way to prosperity,\u201d Kasich wants to sell \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d without the conservatism. The Bible does teach that God\u2019s heartbeat is for us to \u201cproper and be in health, even as your soul prospers\u201d (3 John 2). Soul prosperity matters more, and depends on walking in truth. Kasich\u2019 Big Government social gospel has no truth.\n\nTo add insult to un-Biblical misery, Kasich even defended attending a \u201cgay wedding\u201d:\n\nI\u2019m an old-fashioned person here and I happen to believe in traditional marriage. But I\u2019ve also said the court has ruled. \u2026 and I said we will accept it. And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay.\n\nKasich neglected another part of the Gospels: Male and female he created them.\n\nOrdained minister Mike Huckabee gave the godly answer to this issue: \u201cThe Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being\u201d. Neither is the government, whether pretending to provide healthcare, legal status, or education contrary to truth. Only a religious con would suggest otherwise, and John Kasich, like a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, fits that unholy bill to a T.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Governor John Kasich achieved some remarkable accomplishments as a Republican in a swing state..05/26/2016 0:36:18AM EST.", "author": "Arthur  Schaper", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Ohio Governor John Kasich achieved some remarkable accomplishments as a Republican in a swing state.", "title": "- John Kasich: Religious Con-Servative", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/arthurschaper/2015/08/29/john-kasich-religious-conservative-n2045514", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/231/a1c9a41a-0af3-4447-a4a1-4e3998564a1f.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Ohio Governor John Kasich achieved some remarkable accomplishments as a Republican in a swing state.", "title": "- John Kasich: Religious Con-Servative", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/arthurschaper/2015/08/29/john-kasich-religious-conservative-n2045514", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/231/a1c9a41a-0af3-4447-a4a1-4e3998564a1f.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "John Kasich: Religious Con-Servative, Arthur  Schaper , Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a23\"", "article_summary": "Only a religious con would suggest otherwise, and John Kasich, like a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, fits that unholy bill to a T.\nOhio Governor John Kasich achieved some remarkable accomplishments as a Republican in a swing state.\nKasich\u2019 Big Government social gospel has no truth.\nLike McCain, Kasich would have maintained a better following \u2013 and been a better President \u2013 if elected in 2000.\nJohn McCain would soar on his real maverick roots, squeaking past George W.
