FARMINGTON, N.M. — New Mexico officials on Saturday night dropped San Juan County’s restrictions on using the Animas and San Juan rivers for drinking water following a ban after a major mine wastewater spill in Colorado this month.

The New Mexico Environment Department and the state’s Game and Fish Department are also reopening the rivers for recreational use after the Aug. 5 spill at the Gold King Mine near Silverton.

Ryan Flynn, New Mexico’s environment secretary, said the bans were lifted “because the waters of the Animas and San Juan Rivers are now meeting all applicable water quality standards.”

“Recreational users of the Animas and San Juan rivers may notice some discoloration in the sediment along the river banks due to the spill,” according to a state news release. “While there is continuing concern by New Mexico officials for long-term river health and for that of aquatic life, the environment and health departments do not anticipate adverse human health effects.”

Health officials in New Mexico are still warning the public to avoid sediment from the 3 million-gallon spill, caused by the Environmental Protection Agency, and to avoid river areas where there is visible discoloration.

Officials are also recommending New Mexican anglers on the San Juan and Animas only catch and release fish until it can be determined what the impacts of the disaster were on aquatic life.

On Friday, officials in Utah lifted advisories for crop irrigation and livestock watering from the San Juan River.

“Recreational users should continue to carry their own drinking water and not rely on filtering or purifying river waters,” Utah health officials said in a news release.

The Navajo Nation, through which the San Juan runs 215 miles between New Mexico and Utah, has not lifted its recreational and agricultural water use restrictions.

Tribal officials have not said when they plan to drop those bans.
