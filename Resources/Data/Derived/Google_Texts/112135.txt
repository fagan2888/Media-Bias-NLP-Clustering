Insulting Donald Trump is no way to win the GOP presidential nomination, rival candidate John Kasich said Tuesday, and he's not going to take that road."You have to have a bigger vision," the Ohio governor told Fox News' "America's Newsroom" host Bill Hemmer. "You have to show people you have achieved things in your lifetime and you have a plan to get the country back to where you want it to be."And while Marco Rubio has started to launch personal attacks on Trump, Kasich said he does not believe that "insults and personal attacks are the way to do politics.""Everybody has to do what they want to do," said Kasich. "I'm not going to do it. I would rather lose and put myself in a position where I'm insulting people personally. When you go beyond that, that's not the way I think you should conduct yourself. Furthermore I don't think it works."Meanwhile, Kasich has faith in winning in Ohio, a winner-take-all state where all delegates go to the winning campaign, and believes his state will "change this whole race.""I'm going to Ohio, then you have Illinois and Pennsylvania," said Kasich. "At the end of the night, 35 percent of the delegates are to be selected, which leaves 65 percent to be selected. As we like to say in golf, the guy makes a double and you make a par, it's a whole new ballgame."And if he doesn't win Ohio? "I will get out," Kasich said, and he has the same advice for Ted Cruz in Tuesday's primaries."You have to seriously think about it," he said. "If you can't win your own state, how are you supposed to stay in? We'll get this all resolved here within the next two weeks."
