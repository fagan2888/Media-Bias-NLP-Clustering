The Green Bay City Council member and county supervisor displayed unprofessional behavior at a council meeting last month. It\u2019s the latest in a series of bad behavior moments over the years for the elected official. (Photo: File/Press-Gazette Media)Buy Photo\n\nWe expect more out of our elected officials, and so should you.\n\nWe expect elected officials to act in a professional manner, especially if they have to deal with a frustrated, upset or angry public. It\u2019s a tough job, but officials know that when they run for election.\n\nWe don\u2019t expect them to swear at a resident and flip the middle finger. We don\u2019t expect the childish behavior we\u2019ve seen of late in the Green Bay City Council, where the mayor and his detractors are accusing the other of bad behavior.\n\nThe most egregious example is Alderman Guy Zima.\n\nAfter the April 8 City Council meeting, Zima apparently swore at a person and gave the guy the middle finger. Mayor Jim Schmitt has called for a hearing to review Zima\u2019s behavior.\n\nThe incident took place after the meeting adjourned. The camera was still running and it picked up the audio but those involved are off-camera. The man subjected to Zima\u2019s coarse behavior confirmed what happened.\n\nIt\u2019s too bad an elected official acted this way, but what\u2019s even worse is that\u2019s it\u2019s not unexpected, at least from Zima.\n\nIt\u2019s only the latest in a string of incidents involving Zima, incidents that stretch back to at least 1997 and concern his behavior as a City Council member and Brown County Board supervisor, both during meetings and outside of the board room.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be a contrarian and at odds with other elected leaders. We support spirited debate. We don\u2019t expect everyone to agree all the time or on all the issues, but we don\u2019t support elected officials who consistently insult residents, municipal staff and fellow council members.\n\nZima\u2019s behavior shouldn\u2019t be tolerated.\n\nSchmitt\u2019s request to look at the alderman\u2019s actions comes days after other City Council members accused the mayor of intimidating officials who voted on an assistance package for the proposed Strategic Behavioral Health psych hospital.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen behavior by the mayor before that borders on intimidation. Remember when he appointed himself to the Larsen Green governing board in an effort to kill the Walmart on Broadway proposal?\n\nSchmitt is passionate about his vision for the Larsen Green property, however, his public displays of frustration do not come close to Zima\u2019s and the alderman\u2019s inability to control his temper.\n\nZima keeps getting elected despite not having the temperament to handle the position. His constituents like him, but they don\u2019t have to serve on the City Council or County Board with him, nor are they targets of his tirades.\n\nThey might want to seriously question the effectiveness of his antics for accomplishing his goals.\n\nAs it stands now, Green Bay voters will be treated to the cheap, childish theatrics of accusations of intimidation and bad behavior. Time and effort will be wasted on evaluating churlish behavior, and, sadly, nothing will change.\n\nIn the meantime, this conduct casts Green Bay in a bad light. We look like a bunch of rubes to the outside world with the bickering that takes place when our city government meets.\n\nWe expect more out of our elected officials, and we should get it.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1bG5FVz", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Alderman\u2019s latest actions shouldn\u2019t be tolerated by fellow aldermen, voters", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "Alderman\u2019s latest actions shouldn\u2019t be tolerated by fellow aldermen, voters", "title": "Bad behavior by elected officials is unacceptable", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/05/09/bad-behavior-elected-officials-unacceptable/27023023/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Alderman\u2019s latest actions shouldn\u2019t be tolerated by fellow aldermen, voters", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/09c8b8b74f150758299aa09e6f3d87a0bfb57e83/c=282-0-1518-1236&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/08/GreenBay/B9317280065Z.1_20150508221548_000_GHUANUE70.1-0.jpg", "title": "Bad behavior by elected officials is unacceptable", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "We expect elected officials to act in a professional manner, especially if they have to deal with a frustrated, upset or angry public.\nIt\u2019s the latest in a series of bad behavior moments over the years for the elected official.\nWe don\u2019t expect the childish behavior we\u2019ve seen of late in the Green Bay City Council, where the mayor and his detractors are accusing the other of bad behavior.\n(Photo: File/Press-Gazette Media)Buy PhotoWe expect more out of our elected officials, and so should you.\nAs it stands now, Green Bay voters will be treated to the cheap, childish theatrics of accusations of intimidation and bad behavior."}
