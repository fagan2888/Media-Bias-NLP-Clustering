In several towns shots have been fired at mosques and racist slogans daubed on their walls. In Corsica, a pig\u2019s head was hung on the door of a prayer hall.\n\nLast week, 47-year-old French Muslim Mohammed al-Makouli was killed in southern France by one of his neighbors, who shouted \u201cI am your god, I am your Islam\u201d before stabbing Makouli 17 times.\n\nMakouli\u2019s 31-year-old partner tried to save him, and suffered wounds to her hands, before fleeing with their young child to call the police, officials said. French authorities were investigating the case to determine whether it constituted an Islamophobic act.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande and his government have repeatedly warned against tarring all Muslims with the extremist brush.\n\nIn a speech, Hollande reiterated that \u201cMuslims are the main victims of terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe Committee against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) said that anti-Muslim attacks and insults have risen steadily in France in recent years \u201cas some politicians and media increasingly present Islam as a problem for French society.\u201d\n\nSome prominent political figures have defied calls for unity, with remarks seen as fanning anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\nA senior member of the far-right National Front (FN) representing the party in the European Parliament, Aymeric Chauprade, declared in a video last week that France was \u201cat war with some Muslims.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re told a majority of Muslims are peaceful. But a majority of Germans were also (peaceful) before 1933 and national socialism,\u201d he said.\n\nFN leader Marine Le Pen, who has joined mainstream political parties in warning against confusing Islam and fundamentalism, distanced herself from Chauprade\u2019s remarks.\n\nWhile some say radical Islamists are the fruit of France\u2019s foreign policies, many argue that extremism has fed upon the French government\u2019s inability to enact structural, social and economic reforms that ensure the participation of citizens from different ethnic and religious backgrounds in society.\n\nAl-Akhbar English by Al-Akhbar English is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last week, 47-year-old French Muslim Mohammed al-Makouli was killed in southern France by one of his neighbors, who shouted \"I am your god, I am your Islam\" before stabbing Makouli 17 times.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Al Akhbar", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Last week, 47-year-old French Muslim Mohammed al-Makouli was killed in southern France by one of his neighbors, who shouted \"I am your god, I am your Islam\" before stabbing Makouli 17 times.", "title": "More Than 128 Anti-Muslim Incidents Registered Over 2 Weeks In France", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/128-anti-muslim-incidents-registered-2-weeks-france/201495/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/APTOPIX-France-Attack_Muha.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-23T08:17:56-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Last week, 47-year-old French Muslim Mohammed al-Makouli was killed in southern France by one of his neighbors, who shouted \"I am your god, I am your Islam\" before stabbing Makouli 17 times.", "title": "More Than 128 Anti-Muslim Incidents Registered Over 2 Weeks In France", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/APTOPIX-France-Attack_Muha.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Paris", "published_time": "2015-01-24T05:00:14-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-23T08:17:56-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1459\"", "article_summary": "The number of anti-Muslim incidents in 2014 had dropped by 41 percent from the previous year, according to the watchdog.\nPhoto: Remy de la Mauviniere/APThe number of anti-Muslim incidents in France has soared since attacks in Paris earlier this month, with 128 such acts registered over two weeks, almost the same amount as all 2014, a watchdog said Friday.\nMore Than 128 Anti-Muslim Incidents Registered Over 2 Weeks In FranceLast week, 47-year-old French Muslim Mohammed al-Makouli was killed in southern France by one of his neighbors, who shouted \"I am your god, I am your Islam\" before stabbing Makouli 17 times.\nThe tally for the two weeks since January 7 do not include incidents in Paris and its surrounding region, where police have yet to release their figures.\nFN leader Marine Le Pen, who has joined mainstream political parties in warning against confusing Islam and fundamentalism, distanced herself from Chauprade\u2019s remarks."}
