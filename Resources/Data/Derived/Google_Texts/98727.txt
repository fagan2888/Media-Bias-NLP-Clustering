Two days after taking a thinly-veiled shot at CNN’s aggressive use of “breaking news” headlines for not-so-breaking bits of information about the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370, MSNBC anchor Chuck Todd is back again with some scolding words for his rival network.



He tweeted Friday morning:

Another day of "breaking news" based on finding nothing or in other words, "not breaking news" — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) March 21, 2014

He answered critics who suggest that he, too, is part of the problem by working for another cable news network:

I know it may look like I am casting stones while potentially living in a glass house. But the mistakes of one news org hurts ALL of us — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) March 21, 2014

Todd’s issue seems to be with how CNN’s “breaking news” abuse lends itself to a narrative that indicts the media at large:

Then it becomes "the media" is abusing "breaking news" — no it's not "the media" in general. — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) March 21, 2014

The MSNBC host did not cite any specific CNN headlines, but he could be referring to ones like this: “BREAKING NEWS: Solving Plane Mystery Could Take Years”.
