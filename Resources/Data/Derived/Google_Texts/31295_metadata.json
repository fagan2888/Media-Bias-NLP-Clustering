Kay Hagan picked up an endorsement from the Charlotte Observer, but she might want to keep it hidden from public view; it wasn\u2019t a shining profile. The editorial board labeled her a \u201cdisappointment,\u201d but that\u2019s not all (via WaPo):\n\nThe Charlotte Observer endorsed incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) for the second time on Sunday. They didn't seem too pleased about it, though. Here is a sample of the glowing things they had to say about her: \u00b7 \"Kay Hagan has been a disappointment\" \u00b7 \"She has done about the minimum you'd expect from a U.S. senator, with few if any notable legislative achievements.\" \u00b7 \"She has a chronic reluctance to take firm positions on controversial issues\" \u00b7 \"...She needs to accept that while North Carolina is a difficult, divided state to represent, it deserves a senator who is not perpetually fearful of upsetting half the state\u2019s voting population.\"\n\nYet, Tillis was excoriated for opposing things like Medicaid expansion, and pushing policies that hurt North Carolinians. Nevertheless, it gives credence to the GOP talking point that Hagan has not deserved re-election.\n\nOn top of this lackluster endorsement, Hagan has been somewhat painfully awkward in her recent string of television interviews. Yesterday, for WSOC, a Charlotte-based television station, Hagan could not say how many Armed Services hearing she\u2019s missed\u2013and she prevaricated when questioned if she regretted repeating the \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it,\u201d which was left-leaning PolitiFact\u2019s Lie Of The Year.\n\nAnd speaking of Obamacre, Guy wrote last week about North Carolina residents bracing themselves for a double-digit premium shock from the state\u2019s largest health insurer.\n\nIn the Tillis camp, Texas Gov. Rick Perry stumped for the GOP hopeful last week, and Mitt Romney was featured in this ad for the Chamber of Commerce touting Tillis\u2019 humble upbringing, and as someone who will fight for North Carolina in Washington.\n\nAs for the nasty, racially charged ads that have surfaced against Tillis in the final weeks, they have not gone unanswered. Our America PAC has this ad featuring Louisiana State Sen. Elbert Guillory, calling Hagan a \u201climousine liberal,\u201d who has done nothing to help the black community in North Carolina. He urged his fellow African-Americans to reject Hagan on Election Day.\n\nAdditionally, American Commitment has this radio spot slamming the Senate Majority PAC\u2019s absurd race-baiting radio ad linking Tillis to the 2012 Trayvon Martin shooting.\n\nIn the meantime, Hagan is still staying consistent with her narrative by sticking to state issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"She has a chronic reluctance to take firm positions on controversial issues\".05/26/2016 4:24:57AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"She has a chronic reluctance to take firm positions on controversial issues\"", "title": "Matt Vespa - An Endorsement That Kay Hagan Should Probably Hide", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/10/29/an-endorsement-that-kay-hagan-should-probably-hide-n1911325", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/298/f7109925-f3bd-405e-a2b7-a951b79da2b4.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"She has a chronic reluctance to take firm positions on controversial issues\"", "title": "Matt Vespa - An Endorsement That Kay Hagan Should Probably Hide", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/10/29/an-endorsement-that-kay-hagan-should-probably-hide-n1911325", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/298/f7109925-f3bd-405e-a2b7-a951b79da2b4.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "An Endorsement That Kay Hagan Should Probably Hide, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb9bd\"", "article_summary": "The editorial board labeled her a \u201cdisappointment,\u201d but that\u2019s not all (via WaPo):The Charlotte Observer endorsed incumbent Sen.
