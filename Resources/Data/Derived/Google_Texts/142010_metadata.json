He basically took the temporary gig as a bet. (Amanda Voisard/For the Washington Post)\n\nZeke Emanuel may be the only person in Washington who turns breakfast into a competitive sport.\n\nThe firstborn of the three Emanuel brothers \u2014 Rahm is mayor of Chicago, Ari the Hollywood agent who inspired the HBO show \u201cEntourage\u201d \u2014 is unhappy about the dearth of healthful and delicious breakfasts in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cI have been railing about the terrible breakfasts in Washington, D.C., to everybody I know,\u201d he says. \u201cSome things just really irritate me, and this one in particular.\u201d A long line waiting to get into a lousy brunch joint? Drives him crazy.\n\nThe physician and health-policy expert, 57, has been threatening for years to open a brunch spot when he retires. His friends have finally forced him to put his menu where his mouth is, which is how he has ended up at the newly opened Masseria restaurant on Fourth Street NE on Saturday morning, acting as guest breakfast chef. He\u2019s serving Gruy\u00e8re omelets, challah French toast, waffles, quail eggs and fresh berries. But no potatoes. He doesn\u2019t like them.\n\n\u201cYou can find better things to put on the menu that taste better and have more nutritional value,\u201d he says. He has put zucchini fritters and malanga (a yamlike root vegetable) hash browns on his menu instead, which upset his mother, who thought that he was insulting her Hanukkah latkes.\n\nAlthough he\u2019s a serious home cook, this is Emanuel\u2019s first time in a professional kitchen \u2014 but it\u2019s for just two weekends, including this coming Saturday and Sunday. As a doctor with a PhD in bioethics, he\u2019s totally unfazed by public speaking and arguing for Obamacare. (Okay, arguing anything.) But he\u2019s pretty nervous about preparing dozens of meals to order.\n\n\u201cSomething\u2019s going to go wrong,\u201d he predicted earlier in the week. \u201cHow will I handle it when it goes wrong? I have no idea.\u201d Yelling, the default Emanuel family setting, is not an option. Amazingly, calm prevails, and the meals make it to the table without major incident.\n\nCorby Kummer, a food critic and senior editor for the Atlantic, has flown up from Atlanta with his husband to attend his friend\u2019s professional debut. The two go way back, and Kummer says that he pretty much had to show up.\n\n\u201cThis is a very expensive present for Zeke, even though it\u2019s my birthday,\u201d he says. \u201cHe made it clear how irritated he would be if we failed to appear. But he used more colorful language.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmanuel as guest chef at Masseria restaurant in Northeast Washington. (Amanda Voisard/For the Washington Post)\n\nEmanuel can pinpoint the exact moment when he became a foodie: It was his father\u2019s 70th birthday in 1997, when the entire family went to dinner at Charlie Trotter\u2019s in Chicago.\n\n\u201cIt was just a phenomenal experience,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe food was totally amazing. One of the five best meals of my life.\u201d Even better: Ari paid.\n\nBefore that, he hadn\u2019t paid much attention to food. His father was a doctor, and as the eldest son in a high-achieving Jewish family, there really wasn\u2019t any question about what Ezekiel would be when he grew up.\n\n\u201cFirst generation immigrant family, father a doctor, I\u2019m very good at science and was good in school \u2014 and the eldest,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cTotally overdetermined that I would have to be a doctor.\u201d\n\nNot just a doctor, but a Harvard- and Oxford-educated expert on health care, past head of the bioethics center at the National Institutes of Health, former White House adviser to President Obama and an architect of the Affordable Care Act. (His 2013 book, \u201cBrothers Emanuel: A Memoir of an American Family,\u201d explores the role that his parents, history and culture played in producing the famous trifecta of boys.)\n\nHis time in the kitchen was limited mostly to cooking breakfast for his three daughters when they were growing up and his then-wife, also a doctor, was working as an intern. Those breakfasts became a daily routine. \u201cMy motivation has always been primarily my children,\u201d he says. \u201cLike dinner with the family, it\u2019s a centering moment.\u201d He still makes breakfast from scratch for the now-grown daughters when they\u2019re at his Washington home.\n\nOnce he got serious about food, he brought to the kitchen his natural competitiveness and tinkering-in-the-lab tendencies. \u201cI view it a little bit like sports,\u201d he says. \u201cYou do it well, and you want to do it a little better. You begin tweaking things; you begin learning more.\u201d\n\nAnd he got more sophisticated, learning at the best restaurants. In 2010, he won a bet with Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia \u2014 dinner at the restaurant of his choice. The two men met at a fundraiser and bet on the outcome of health-care reform: Scalia said it would be overturned and offered a $5 bet. \u201cI don\u2019t bet $5,\u201d Emanuel told him. \u201cI bet dinners.\u201d\n\nHe won, and the justice picked up the tab for a very expensive meal at Minibar. The two hit it off: Emanuel took Scalia to Birch and Barley because the justice\u2019s son-in- law is a brewer; Scalia invited his new pal to lunch in his chambers, and Emanuel had the justice and his wife over for quail on his patio and then a Shabbat dinner.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s great company,\u201d Emanuel, a lifelong liberal, says. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to argue about anything.\u201d And do they disagree about everything? \u201cI won\u2019t say everything, but almost everything.\u201d\n\nThis spring, Emanuel hosted a dinner party for Sarah Weiner, head of the Good Food Awards, and friends from Union Market in Northeast. He went off on yet another rant about lousy brunches in the District, and his friends basically dared him to be a guest chef for a pop-up breakfast at chef Nick Stefanelli\u2019s new restaurant Masseria. \u201cFive minutes later, we had two weekends\u201d planned, Emanuel says.\n\nThe menu he designed is simple but full of the healthful ingredients he loves: maple syrup from New Hampshire, jam from Vermont, handcrafted granola, and challah made by one of his professors at Harvard. Emanuel is headed to Boston to learn how to make the braided Jewish bread, a skill that has so far eluded him because, he says, it requires patience.\n\n\u201cAs my kids will say, I\u2019m relentlessly competitive,\u201d he says. \u201cI always like to know, \u2018What\u2019s the best? What\u2019s number one, two and three?\u2019 \u201d For example, he put together gift bags for breakfast guests with samples of his favorite ingredients, including dark chocolate made by a former criminal defense lawyer in Missouri. Missouri? Emanuel just got back from six weeks teaching in Switzerland, which is renowned for its chocolate, yet he says that the Askinosie Chocolate from Missouri is even better than anything you can find in Geneva or Zurich. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten a lot of chocolate,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the best chocolate in the world, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nAnother Emanuel family trait: having a lot of opinions and no fear of expressing them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very certain of my opinions, but I change my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve changed a lot of my views.\u201d\n\nOne that hasn\u2019t changed: His belief that 75 years is a good age to die. His essay in the Atlantic this past fall caused a firestorm when he wrote that he would not take any medical steps to prolong his life after that age. Not suicide, not euthanasia, just a personal decision not to extend his life by any means necessary. People, to put it mildly, freaked out and accused him of attacking all seniors and revived the mythical Obamacare \u201cdeath panel\u201d specter.\n\n\u201cThis is a 40-year-old philosophy,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this for a very long time.\u201d As an expert in end-of-life care, he was urged to put his beliefs in writing. \u201cI think the most important thing that article did \u2014 and I\u2019ve heard from many thousands of people \u2014 is that it prompted a lot of very important discussion in families and a lot of soul-searching and thinking.\u201d\n\nEmanuel\u2019s daughters, of course, disagree with their very healthy father\u2019s position. His brothers also think he\u2019s wrong. Both of his parents are still alive, and his 88-year-old father offered the most persuasive argument for why he may yet change his mind: grandchildren.\n\n\n\nEmanuel, center in apron, got serious about food 20 years ago, at his father\u2019s 70th birthday celebration in Chicago. (Amanda Voisard/For the Washington Post)\n\nFor now, Emanuel is busy cooking for friends. Like most home cooks, he wildly underestimated how long it would take to prepare ingredients for 100 people. But he has taken charge of the kitchen and basically gotten most of the dishes ready to send out at the same time \u2014 except for the timing of a soft-boiled egg.\n\n\u201cIt takes six minutes exactly,\u201d Steffanelli explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t change the laws of physics.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive at home,\u201d Emanuel counters as he awkwardly rips the shell off the egg. It isn\u2019t pretty, but it tastes right.\n\nThere are a few tiny glitches, but the guest chef gets two thumbs up. The French toast, his buddy Kummer says, is perfect: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get French toast in a restaurant that\u2019s tender in the middle and crisp on the outside.\u201d\n\nAfter five hours, Emanuel has survived his first day. \u201cBarely,\u201d he says. Serving 110 meals was much harder than he expected and a humbling experience. But a \u201ctotal, total blast.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Zeke Emanuel, Rahm Emanuel, Aro E,amie, Nick Stefarelli, Union Market, Obamacare, the Atlantic, stylefront", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A bad brunch joint annoys the health-care wonk, so he\u2019s aiming to be the champion of breakfasts, temporarily.", "title": "Breakfast isn\u2019t a sport.
