A Russian official who is upset with a FIFA corruption investigation spearheaded by the U.S. now wants global powers to look into the 1969 and 1972 moon landings.

Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Russian government’s Investigative Committee, wants the international community to investigate lost footage from the 1969 moon landing and the current location of all lunar soil obtained on subsequent missions, The Daily Mail reported Thursday. Mr. Markin’s original comments were published in Russia’s Izvestia newspaper.

“We are not contending that they did not fly [to the moon], and simply made a film about it. But all of these scientific — or perhaps cultural — artifacts are part of the legacy of humanity, and their disappearance without a trace is our common loss. An investigation will reveal what happened,” the Russian wrote, The Daily Mail reported.

NASA said in 2009 that its original high-resolution footage of the July 20, 1969, moon landing was erased.

“I don’t think anyone in the NASA organization did anything wrong. It slipped through the cracks, and nobody’s happy about it,” said NASA video engineer Dick Nafzger in 2009, The Daily Mail reported.
