There were two vigilante men waiting to insult us,\u201d said UK delegate Frances Raday. She claimed the men repeatedly shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re murdering children!\u201d at the three women as they approached the clinic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of terrorism,\u201d said the Polish delegate and abortion activist, Eleonora Zielinska. \u201cTo us, it was shocking.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations has no official position regarding abortion, but for years abortion advocates have attempted to use the UN platform to pressure countries to relax abortion laws. Moreover, representatives of women\u2019s rights organizations within the UN normally comprise radical feminists pushing for access to abortion-on-demand across the globe.\n\nLast September, the Vatican formally expressed its \u201creservations\u201d regarding the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2016 because of its inclusion of language often used to mask abortion rights. The Vatican\u2019s Permanent Observer to the UN, Archbishop Bernardito Auza, expressed the Vatican\u2019s \u201creservations\u201d on the goals that mention \u201creproductive health,\u201d \u201cfamily planning,\u201d and \u201cgender.\u201d\n\nDuring their U.S. visit, the three UN women travelled to Alabama, Texas and Oregon to assess American policies and attitudes, as well as school, health, and prison systems.\n\nThe women claim that the U.S. is far behind \u201cinternational human rights standards\u201d in areas such as its \u201c23 percent gender pay gap, maternity leave, affordable child care and the treatment of female migrants in detention centers.\u201d\n\nThe women\u2019s agenda included a push for new federal gun restrictions more in line with the practices in other countries.\n\n\u201cSome states have introduced gun control laws regarding domestic violence, refusing to give perpetrators of domestic violence the right to possess firearms,\u201d Raday said. \u201cThis should be a national policy, not an isolated state policy.\u201d\n\nThe women also attacked religious freedom and conscience exceptions in the U.S., especially those that touch on \u201creproductive health.\u201d\n\n\u201cReligious freedom does not justify discrimination against women, nor does it justify depriving women of their rights to the highest standard of health care,\u201d Raday said, referring once again to abortion.\n\nThe U.N. representatives had meetings at the White House and with numerous government agencies, including the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Justice. They will file their full report to the U.N. Human Rights Council in June 2016.\n\nFollow Thomas D.
