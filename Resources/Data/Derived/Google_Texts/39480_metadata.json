Housed in an unassuming bookstore on K Street and operated by the controversial Opus Dei order, the CIC claims to cater to the spiritual needs of Washington\u2019s political elites with daily mass as well as lectures and panels featuring prominent conservative pundits and activists. The \u201cWomen for Freedom\u201d panel aimed to teach lay Catholics to \u201cconvince rather than antagonize\u201d the public about the church\u2019s stances on divisive issues, and, in the words of one panelist, \u201cshare and show love.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal,\u201d said Kim Daniels, then the head of the organization Catholic Voices and now the spokesperson for the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), \u201cis to make the church\u2019s case in the public square as lay people who know and love our faith. Our job is to be authoritative but not official.\u201d\n\nThe ACA\u2019s contraception-coverage requirement was not their only target, and the goal was not simply to defend the church\u2019s argument about religious freedom. The women emphasized the role of the Church as an essential, life-sustaining part of the fabric of American life. The Church and its social-service auxiliaries, they argued, provide indispensible services to the poor and vulnerable. As a consequence, they contended, the Church and Catholic social-services agencies should not be forced to participate in what they consider to be immoral activity, because that would force them to abandon their services to the poor.\n\nThe USCCB has deployed this argument in the context of its work with victims of human trafficking, immigrants, and refugees, insisting that when it receives federal funding to provide these services, it should be exempt from having to refer clients for contraception and abortion care. This stance has put the USCCB in conflict with civil liberties, church-state separation, and reproductive-rights advocates, who say the church should not be using taxpayer dollars to impose its religious beliefs on its clients\u2019 health-care choices.\n\nThis debate\u2014balancing the free-exercise rights of a religious institution and its employees with those of its clients, and with the establishment clause\u2019s prohibition on government imposition of religion\u2014has occupied policymakers, legislators, lawyers, and activists since the USCCB launched its religious-freedom campaign in 2011. Republican lawmakers have held hearings accusing the Obama administration of \u201canti-Catholic\u201d bias. They have introduced legislation to broaden the scope of exemptions for religious objectors, and have attempted to attach it as an amendment to a continuing resolution in the government-shutdown standoff. Conservative activists have registered their support of the Church\u2019s cause with \u201cStand Up for Religious Freedom\u201d rallies. Think tanks and universities have hosted conferences at which experts dissect the minutiae of law and theology.\n\nFor immigrant advocates and health-care providers at the Texas-Mexico border, though, the ferocity of the bishops\u2019 insistence on religious exemptions as a condition for serving this vulnerable population is a misguided sideshow. Seventeen hundred miles away from Washington, in McAllen and Brownsville, the two poorest metropolitan areas in the country, many residents and undocumented immigrants struggle just to access life\u2019s basic necessities. \u201cIt makes the whole thing about the exemption, just kind of like, wow,\u201d says Michael Seifert, a former priest in the Brownsville diocese who is now the network coordinator for the Rio Grande Equal Voice Network, a community organizing coalition. \u201cThat\u2019s like chapter 15 in this book.\u201d\n\nReligious Conflicts over Reproductive Health Services\n\nTwo years ago, conservative activists started a firestorm over the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 decision not to renew a contract with the USCCB to provide services to victims of trafficking. The contract, which was funded under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), was not renewed because the bishops would not permit referrals for victims of trafficking to a full range of gynecological and obstetric care, specifically abortion, contraception, and sterilization. Many trafficking victims have been raped, and many of them are minors. While under the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of Medicaid funds for abortion, federal funds cannot be used to pay for abortion, the controversy was over referrals, rather than payment.\n\nAt a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on the $2 million contract in 2011, Representative Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, railed against \u201cthe Obama administration's bias against Catholics,\u201d declaring it \u201can affront to religious freedom and a threat to all people of faith.\" Smith painted the USCCB as the victim of discrimination \"solely because it fundamentally respects the innate value and preciousness of an unborn child and refuses to be complicit in procuring his or her violent death by abortion.\u201d\n\nDespite the charges that the administration discriminated against Catholics, during Obama\u2019s tenure, federal grants to the USCCB have increased, according to a federal government database. In 2012, the USCCB received $62.8 million in federal grants, and other Catholic organizations, including Catholic Charities and Catholic Relief Services, also received millions in federal funding. And although the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) ended its contract to aid trafficking victims with the USCCB, the department\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) still contracts with it and other Catholic organizations to provide services to immigrants, including undocumented unaccompanied children (known as UACs, or unaccompanied alien children) and adult and minor refugees (known as URMs, or unaccompanied refugee minors). All of these populations could potentially qualify for trafficking services, according to an HHS spokesperson.\n\nUACs are undocumented minors who enter the United States illegally, are detained (usually at the U.S.-Mexico border), and placed in the custody of federal authorities. The USCCB, as well as other religious and secular organizations, provide them with transitional housing, foster care, and other services, often to help UACs reunite with family members located in the U.S. Many of these undocumented minors, though, can face deportation when they turn 18.\n\nShrinking economic opportunities, political persecution, and drug- and gang-related violence have all contributed to a surge in UACs coming across the Mexico border from Central America. In 2012, 14,000 children were in ORR custody, double the number in previous years, says Michelle Bran\u00e9, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice Program at the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission, a nonprofit advocacy group for women and children refugees. Authorities anticipate that number to reach 20,000 for 2013, she said.\n\nUnaccompanied minors, Bran\u00e9 says, \u201care a pretty vulnerable group, if you can imagine,\u201d particularly girls, who \u201care very often exposed to sexual assault and gender-based violence en route and even before they come [to the U.S.].\u201d A 2012 USCCB report on UACs in need of foster care noted that \u201cchildren migrating to the United States are at risk of experiencing physical and sexual assault, robbery, kidnapping, and death while on the migration journey.\u201d Several health and immigrant advocates in the Rio Grande Valley said many girls start birth-control pills a few months before they leave their home country, anticipating they will be raped during their journey. Others arrive in the U.S. pregnant.\n\nFive years ago, four Catholic Charities workers in Virginia were fired for helping an undocumented, unaccompanied teenager in their care to obtain an abortion. Since the Virginia case, Bran\u00e9 says, \u201cwe haven\u2019t had cases come forward, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not out there.\u201d Whether girls are being deprived of any services \u201cis really difficult to find out.\u201d\n\nIn a January 2013 report on civil liberties, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) charged that HHS \u201chas failed to meet the reproductive health care needs\u201d of immigrants and refugees it serves, \u201cin part because ORR contracts with religious entities that refuse to provide referrals to this type of health care.\u201d In particular, the ACLU argued, the USCCB\u2019s refusal to refer UACs for reproductive health services violates a court-ordered settlement agreement that requires HHS to provide or arrange for family-planning services for UACs.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson, when asked to comment on the ACLU\u2019s non-compliance charge, said, \u201cIn providing care to unaccompanied alien children, ORR fully adheres to the principles and provisions established by the Flores Agreement in 1997, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and its reauthorizations, and the Homeland Security Act of 2002.\u201d\n\n\u201cUSCCB is incredibly powerful in Congress and nobody wants to go against it,\u201d says one immigrant advocate who didn\u2019t want to be identified but whose organization contracts with HHS. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge, huge, very powerful institution. So even the NGOs [that also receive HHS funding], I think, are afraid of offending the USCCB.\u201d\n\nExemptions Routinely Granted\n\nIn a lawsuit brought by the ACLU challenging HHS\u2019s prior policy of allowing religious exemptions in the trafficking contract, the USCCB argued that it is routinely granted exemptions in contracts with HHS and the Department of State to serve migrants and refugees. (A federal court ruled the exemption in the trafficking contract to be unconstitutional, but an appellate court vacated the decision as moot, since HHS changed the policy and didn\u2019t renew the USCCB\u2019s contract.)\n\nIn a sworn affidavit in the ACLU case, Beth Englander, director of the Division of Special Programs for the USCCB\u2019s Office of Migration and Refugee Services (MRS), said that in negotiating a contract to provide services to UACs under HHS\u2019s Safe Passages Program, \u201cat USCCB/MRS\u2019s insistence the government agreed to remove language that would have required USCCB/MRS to provide referrals for abortion and contraception services.\u201d HHS did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRequiring the USCCB \u201cto provide services to refugee minors that are inconsistent with Catholic moral and religious teachings,\u201d Englander added, would likely result in USCCB being \u201cunable to continue our collaboration\u201d with HHS, producing \u201ca severe impact on a large population of vulnerable children and teens,\u201d because USCCB provides about 50 percent of transitional foster-care services nationwide.\n\nAnastasia Brown, director of MRS, similarly said in an affidavit that in a contract to serve refugees with the Department of State, the USCCB included specific language in its proposal: \u201cThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops must ensure that services provided to those served under this proposal are not contrary to the authentic teaching of the Catholic Church, its moral convictions, and religious beliefs.\u201d A State Department spokesperson said the contract did not contain any provisions regarding reproductive health and would not confirm or deny whether the language about Catholic teaching was part of the contract. The State Department contract with the USCCB was $39,609,977 for fiscal year 2013.\n\nBrown added in her affidavit that in its proposals for contracts with ORR, including contracts to serve UACs, the USCCB included language, which it believed to be incorporated into the contracts, that the services would be provided in accordance with Catholic teaching. An HHS spokesperson said the contracts contained no such provisions.\n\nA spokesperson for the USCCB did not respond to several requests for comment. Maggie Garrett, legislative director at Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said such a provision would \u201ccertainly be a constitutional problem\u201d for contractors to \u201chave their own religious litmus test for what services they will or will not perform.\u201d\n\nBrigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney at the ACLU\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project, says that \u201cit\u2019s fair to say it raises constitutional concerns\u201d but added it is hard to know \u201cin the abstract\u201d whether there is a withholding of services due to a provision requiring compliance with a religious belief. She noted a concrete example of a constitutional concern was the trafficking contract, under which the USCCB was refusing to refer clients for certain services.\n\nOn its website, HHS says the administration \u201cis committed to providing the full range of legally permissible services to people who need them\u201d and is also \u201ccommitted to finding ways for organizations to partner with us even if they object to providing specific services on religious grounds.\u201d\n\nOf the HHS policy, American United\u2019s Garrett said, \u201cThe big question is how that\u2019s being implemented,\u201d adding that monitoring how such faith-based policies play out in practice has been an ongoing difficulty.\n\nUncomfortable Truths\n\nSeifert, the former priest, described the dire conditions that the undocumented and the poor face in the Rio Grande Valley and criticized the church for failing to address the panoply of social-services deficits in the area or the draconian effects of stepped-up border federal enforcement. \u201cThey certainly are not a prophetic voice in every sense of the word prophetic, in the sense of just speaking an uncomfortable truth,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Texas Catholic Conference, the church\u2019s policy arm in the state, lists \u201cprotecting human life\u201d first on its legislative agenda in Austin but also identifies justice for immigrants and the poor and vulnerable as issues it advocates.\n\nThere\u2019s no public hospital in the valley, Seifert says, and not enough public clinics or doctors to serve the population. He says that because of the absence of clinical psychologists in the area, such providers must travel in from Corpus Christi or Galveston, and securing an appointment with one can take up to three months. Should a patient require medical care not available in the valley, she must drive north to San Antonio\u2014and pass through a second checkpoint along the way, making the trip an impossibility for the undocumented.\n\nORR\u2019s principal goal\u2014reuniting unaccompanied undocumented minors with family in the United States\u2014does not happen as much as it should, Seifert says. \u201cThere are simply no services. You\u2019re talking about children who have come through a war zone. In that instance, in which the Catholic Church or any other church group could do something actually interesting and innovative like bring in those social services,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s not even a discussable point.\u201d\n\nAccess to reproductive health care, in particular, has been gutted by the Texas Legislature, which has \u201cimpacted us tremendously,\u201d says Patricio Gonzales, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Hidalgo County. \u201cMany of the women we serve are poor and uninsured, and we are their only doctor, and many of them are undocumented.\u201d Many women are forgoing physicals, pap smears, and birth control. Because of the new law in Texas requiring clinics to meet heightened requirements in order to stay open, the two remaining abortion providers in the valley are at risk. And an undocumented woman would be unable to travel to San Antonio because of an additional border checkpoint.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s promotoras, or health educators, discover that many young women living in colonias\u2014poverty-stricken and desperately underserved communities along the border\u2014are \u201cvery clueless about birth control,\u201d says Gonzales. \u201cThey\u2019ve heard of it, but they\u2019re not sure about it. They don\u2019t understand how it works or what methods are out there for them.\u201d\n\nThe bishops, Gonzales says, \u201cmanage with their lobbying groups and with this Texas Legislature, to knock out all the available resources for women.\u201d\n\nThe church does provide some services to immigrants in the valley, but they are limited by lack of funding and staffing. Sister Norma Pimentel, executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, provides legal help to immigrants and emergency food, school supplies, and accommodation to undocumented people in need.\n\nPimentel says that she handles three or four cases a year of UACs, and her services involve helping them make the transition to reunification with family members. She says that the cases are referred by the USCCB and that questions about referrals for contraceptive or abortion care have never come up. If they did, she says, \u201cI think we would have a problem, because I\u2019m sure the bishop would not want us participating in something like this.\u201d\n\nFather Jerry Frank, pastor of St. John the Baptist Church in San Juan, Texas, praises the diocese\u2019s role in pushing for immigration reform. But, he adds, the U.S. bishops are \u201cfocused on one issue [reproductive health], and it makes them come across as very partisan. I\u2019d like to see a broader vision re-established,\u201d one focused on \u201cCatholic social justice principles.\u201d In a recent interview published in the Jesuit magazine America, Pope Francis called for a more expansive treatment of the church's teachings, saying, \"we cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods.\" Francis later amplified that message, telling the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that \"youth unemployment\" and \"loneliness of the old\" are \"most serious of the evils that afflict the world these days,\" and emphasizing that the church must deal with both \"bodies and souls.\"\n\nAnn Williams Cass, a self-described \u201crecovered Catholic\u201d who worked for the church for 25 years, including as a pastoral administrator, is now the executive director of Proyecto Azteca, a community-development corporation in San Juan, Texas, that helps migrants and colonia residents finance and build affordable homes. She says the church has \u201cdefinitely lost sight of the mission.\u201d But \u201cwhen you get people in a small group, and you start asking them questions, you find out that most people don\u2019t have a problem with gay and lesbian people. Most people don\u2019t have a problem with birth control. They\u2019re on birth control.\u201d The problem with the bishops, says Cass, is that they are \u201cfar right wing.\u201d\n\nCass has criticized the Church for its unwillingness to \u201crattle the people in the pews.\u201d Many people, she says, want to leave church \u201cfeeling good. And I would say, \u2018well, no, we come to church on Sunday because we want to have our hearts broken to be more generous and hospitable and justice-oriented, to become more like the body of Christ.\u201d\n\nIn Brownsville, Seifert of the Rio Grande Equal Voice Network took me for a tour of the border fence, built two years ago over the objections of local activists. It is common knowledge in the valley that the fence doesn\u2019t stop the undocumented from crossing the border, and people chafe at the cost of the border-control efforts and the armed border patrol agents cruising around Brownsville in their white SUVs. As we drove down a residential street, Seifert pointed to a yard where there once was a tree that people used to visit because they believed it contained a vision of the Virgin Mary. \u201cThen the tree fell down,\u201d Seifert said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that does to your faith, when your miracle tree falls down.\u201d\n\nThis report was supported by a 2012 Knight Grant for Reporting on Religion and American Public Life.
