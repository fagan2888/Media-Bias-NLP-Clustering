Five months later, the right-hander will pitch his first start of the season for the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nThe D-backs called up Chacin and added him to their big-league roster for a start against the St. Louis Cardinals in Phoenix on Monday.\n\nChacin, 27, pitched this season with Cleveland\u2019s Triple-A team in Columbus, then with Arizona\u2019s affiliate in Reno.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised,\u201d Chacin told The Denver Post as he left Salt River Fields on March 22, after the Rockies cut him. \u201cI haven\u2019t been pitching well. I haven\u2019t been doing what I wanted to do. But I didn\u2019t expect it. Now I have a chance to find something else.\u201d\n\nThat something else started with Cleveland. Chacin continued to work out in Scottsdale, Ariz., then signed a minor-league deal with the Indians. In June, without a big-league opportunity in front of him in Cleveland, Chacin opted out of his deal.\n\nA few days later, he signed with the Diamondbacks with the option of opting out again in July. But he stayed with Arizona and will finally get an opportunity.\n\nChacin pitched to an impressive 3.47 ERA with the Rockies in 2013, with a 14-10 record, after he lowered his WHIP to 1.26 that season, down from 1.62 in 2012. But shoulder injuries slowed his 2014 run. After the Rockies signed him to a a $4.85 million contract in January, they were not pleased with his showing in spring and released him.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Arizona Diamondbacks,Cleveland Indians,Jhoulys Chacin", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "The Rockies in a surprise move cut Jhoulys Chacin from their spring training roster in March.
