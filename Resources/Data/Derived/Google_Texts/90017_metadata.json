To prevent opening delays, the tribe moved forward with Class ll gaming-- meaning bingo and games that have gamblers play against each other instead of the house.\n\nBut officials say regardless of all the controversy, this casino will make a positive economic impact on the west Valley, helping make this area a travel destination.\n\nMore than 200 million dollars has been invested in the project this year.\n\n[READ: Under-construction Glendale casino receives gaming machines]\n\n\u201cThis is very exciting because not only are we helping sustain a nation, we're helping sustain our economy here locally,\u201d says Glendale city councilman Samuel Chavira.\n\nThe tribe said the casino has created nearly 500 permanent jobs, with thousands more expected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for the nation because I believe that any one of the tribes in Arizona that advances with the economic development only helps the rest of us,\u201d says Terry Rambler, chairman of the San Carlos Apache tribe.\n\nThe 40,000-square-foot casino floor is sure to draw crowds.\n\n\"The floor will include two-venue food outlet, a bar,\" said Treena Parvello, director of public relations for Tohono O'odham Gaming Enterprise. \"It will include a rewards center with a cage, along with the 1,089 machines.\"\n\nCopyright 2015 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
