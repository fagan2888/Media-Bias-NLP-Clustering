A new study says you have good reason to: Arizonans are the sixth worst drivers in the country.\n\nThe study by carinsurancecomparison.com looked at deadly crash data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and found Arizona drivers ranked high in both careless driving incidents and crashes involving a failure to obey traffic laws.\n\nThe site concluded the country\u2019s worst drivers overall reside in Montana.\n\nThe study ranked each state in five categories: fatalities rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, fatal crashes involving a failure to obey seat belt or traffic laws, fatal crashes involving drunk driving, fatal crashes involving speeding, and the rate of deadly crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists, which the site calls careless driving.\n\nArizona ranked third worst for careless driving crashes and seventh worst for failure to obey traffic laws.\n\nThe Grand Canyon State fared well, however, in drunk driving crashes. Arizona ranked 47th \u2013 or fourth best \u2013 in the percentage of deadly crashes involving alcohol.\n\nThe Director of the Governor\u2019s Office of Highway Safety said the positive drunk driving stats are the result of tough enforcement, and those efforts will be scaled up.\n\n\u201cWe are putting together programs around the state with more dollars for more enforcement. Enforcement works,\u201d said Alberto Gutier, saying enforcement has been shown to decrease fatalities, injuries, and the number of crashes in the state.\n\nWhen it comes to careless driving, the study points out that 46 states have a total ban on texting while driving. Arizona and Montana are the only states in the country without some kind of statewide restrictions, according to NHTSA.\n\nTop 10 Worst Drivers", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Ever feel frustrated with drivers on Valley roadways?
