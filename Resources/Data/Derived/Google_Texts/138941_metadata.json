Founded by Bernard Lown, a cardiologist, mentor, activist, and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Lown Institute is an organization committed to making things right in the US healthcare system.\n\nIn case you wondered, yes, there is right and wrong in healthcare. At this point in my career, more than anything, I need to be on the right side of history.\n\nThe Lown Institute seeks the basics in a healthcare system. We think healthcare should be affordable, effective, rational and available to all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is hardly the case now in America.\n\nToday, October 18th, begins Right Care Action Week. It\u2019s a week when caregivers will take action to show patients that we have not forgotten what good medical care is. Lown suggests actions such as\u2026\n\nHighlight the conflict between the healing culture and business culture\n\n\u201cSuspend business as usual\u201d\n\nConnect patients to clinicians and clinicians to their colleagues to provide better care\n\nEncourage clinicians to take as much time as needed with patients\n\nMy action for this week will be to write about Right Care (and Wrong Care.) Words are the best way I know to affect change.\n\n****\n\nI had planned to start this week by highlighting something positive in the healthcare system. But then the NY Times published a terrible story of a trusted cardiologist who grossly overused his power. The headline said his actions scarred a small Indiana town.\n\nThis man broke the trust he had as a doctor. By doing so he not only hurt his patients, many of whom are now suing, he brought shame on his profession.\n\nYet the real story here runs deeper than one fraudulent man.\n\nOne of the worst aspects of this story is how powerless others were to stop it. Why that was (is) underscores a root problem with our system\u2013the conflict between a healing culture and business culture.\n\nThis man\u2019s colleagues knew something was amiss. They asked the hospital to stop the nonsense. The hospital did not, mainly because the overusing cardiologist brought them money and prestige.\n\nThis is a big problem playing out across hundreds of hospitals in the US. From the inside, it\u2019s easy to see when doctors game the system. But short of obvious malfeasance, it\u2019s risky to speak out. When overuse pays it\u2019s easy for administration to dismiss criticism as sour grapes from competing specialists. What\u2019s more, peers have difficulty criticizing wrong care because privacy limits review of charts.\n\nThe employed business model for physicians\u2013where doctors are paid by productivity\u2013exacerbates the conflict between good care and lucrative care. I made this slide and posted it on Twitter yesterday:\n\nI stand against overuse. I stand against doctors who abuse their power; misusing fear in the medical decision is one of the most egregious offenses.\n\nAnd, I stand against a system that favors more care over right care.\n\nSee you tomorrow. In the meantime, go join the Right Care Alliance. And speak up.\n\nPhoto: Flickr user Seth Capitulo", "article_metadata": {"description": "A story of broken trust reminds us how valuable our role is to healthcare's consumers.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "A story of broken trust reminds us how valuable our role is to healthcare's consumers.", "title": "Why this week (more than others) you should show patients we\u2019re truly working for them", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/patient_flickr_SethCapitulo.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-18T16:28:54-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/10/right-care-action-week-2015/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/patient_flickr_SethCapitulo.jpg", "creator": "@drjohnm", "description": "A story of broken trust reminds us how valuable our role is to healthcare's consumers.", "card": "summary", "title": "Right Care Action Week: Why it matters more than ever"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Right Care Action Week, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Right Care Action Week", "published_time": "2015-10-18T16:20:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-18T16:28:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "What\u2019s more, peers have difficulty criticizing wrong care because privacy limits review of charts.\nIn the meantime, go join the Right Care Alliance.\nAnd, I stand against a system that favors more care over right care.\nToday, October 18th, begins Right Care Action Week.\nThe Lown Institute seeks the basics in a healthcare system."}
