Finding levels hit a low of 77 percent in 2012 but have been rising since then. If the Fed continues to increase interest rates, pension funding could improve this year.\n\nTotal pension plan assets in 2015 fell 6 percent to $1.33 trillion. Towers Watson estimates that companies put $32 billion into pension plans, enough to cover new benefits earned by employees through the year but not enough to reduce the overall funding deficit.\n\nIn recent years employers have made other moves to lower their pension-related risks, such as lump-sum buyouts and group annuity purchases. They\u2019re also increasingly replacing pension plans altogether with defined-contribution plans such as 401(k)s in which employees bear more responsibility to save for their own retirement.\n\nIn 2013, less than a quarter of Fortune 500 companies offered defined-benefit plans to new workers, a 60 percent decline from 15 years ago, according to Towers Watson.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Higher corporate bond rates combined with a lackluster global stock market left corpor", "title": "Why Corporate Pension Funds Are Still Falling Short", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/04/Why-Corporate-Pension-Funds-Are-Still-Falling-Short", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10272011_Nest_Egg_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/04/Why-Corporate-Pension-Funds-Are-Still-Falling-Short", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10272011_Nest_Egg_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Higher corporate bond rates combined with a lackluster global stock market left corpor", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Higher corporate bond rates combined with a lackluster global stock market left corporate pension plans in 2015 funded at about the same level as in 2014.\nThey\u2019re also increasingly replacing pension plans altogether with defined-contribution plans such as 401(k)s in which employees bear more responsibility to save for their own retirement.\nRelated: Market losses, low yields sideswipe U.S. corporate pensionsCorporate pension plans haven\u2019t been fully funded since 2007.\nIf the Fed continues to increase interest rates, pension funding could improve this year.\n\u201cWhile pension obligation declined last year, so did assets,\u201d Towers Watson senior retirement consultant Alan Glickstein said in a statement."}
