Only 26% of respondents said they felt overloaded by the amount of information available online.\n\n\u201cThese generally positive attitudes are buttressed by the view that people like having so much information at their fingertips, rather than feeling information overload,\u201d the study said.\n\nBut the Internet\u2019s impact is felt less in local news, with only 39% of respondents saying the Internet has taught them about their neighborhood or neighbors.\n\nAmericans\u2019 faith in the value of information on the World Wide Web is up from 2006, when Pew found just 55% of adults felt the Internet boosted their ability to share their ideas.\n\n\u201cIt is likely that a major contributor to the increase in this measurement is the rise of social networking sites, which were not heavily in use in 2006,\u201d the study said. \u201cSocial networking sites are used by more than two-thirds of those who go online now.\u201d\n\nThe survey, conducted Sept. 12-18, questioned 1,066 Internet users.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @ParviniParlance", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Pew: Most Americans say Internet makes them feel 'better informed'", "Description": "More than three quarters of Internet users believe the average American is \u201cbetter informed\u201d on issues ranging from global news to pop culture because of the Internet, a new Pew Research Center study finds.
