Mike Chambers is on the road covering the Avalanche and in transit, so I’ll post this to pass the news along and Mike will report more details from Toronto in his material for online and the Monday paper.

The Avalanche Sunday morning claimed center Chris Wagner, a 24-year-old native of the Boston area, on waivers from the Anaheim Ducks.

Wagner played two collegiate seasons for Colgate after the Ducks took him in the fifth round of the 2010 draft, and logged 196 games over the last three seasons with the AHL’s Norfolk Admirals. With the Ducks, he didn’t have a point in nine games in 2014-15 and in 11 games this season. He also played three games this season with the Ducks’ new AHL affiliate, the San Diego Gulls, and had a goal and an assist.

To open up an active roster spot, the Avalanche placed goalie Semyon Varlamov on injured reserve. Gabe Landeskog has one more game to serve on his two-game NHL suspension.
