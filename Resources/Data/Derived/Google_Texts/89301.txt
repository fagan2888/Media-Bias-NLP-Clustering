EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — While X-rays taken here Sunday were negative, the Broncos must wait until a more revealing magnetic resonance imaging exam is done Monday before determining the extent of Danny Trevathan’s left knee injury.

There is concern Trevathan might have suffered ligament damage, although there wasn’t much looseness in the knee. An MRI would determine the extent of ligament damage, if any.

Trevathan, the Broncos’ starting weakside linebacker, was walking without a limp in the postgame locker room so there is hope his injury is not as serious as it appeared when he was carted off the MetLife Stadium field early in Denver’s 31-17 victory Sunday against the New York Jets.

The Broncos’ leading tackler by a wide margin a year ago, Trevathan missed this season’s first three games after suffering a fractured left leg just below the kneecap during a training camp practice in August.

Two plays into his second game back Sunday, Trevathan was pancaked on a double-team block as the Jets’ Eric Decker gained 15 yards on a screen. Trevathan had to be helped off the field, then was driven by cart to the locker room.

He didn’t return.

“I think it will be good, but we won’t know until (Monday) when I get the MRI,” Trevathan said.

Brandon Marshall, who started the first three games in Trevathan’s absence, again filled in at weakside linebacker. Rookie Corey Nelson played briefly in the first half.

The Broncos were thin at linebacker with Lerentee McCray a healthy scratch, then rookie Lamin Barrow was ejected late in the third quarter for throwing a punch.

Strongside linebacker Von Miller also left late in the first half after he came up staggering from a tackle he made on Jets’ running back Chris Ivory. He was evaluated for a concussion on the sideline, but was cleared to return in the second half.
