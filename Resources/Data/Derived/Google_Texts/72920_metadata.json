The regulators can ask the insurer to rescind the increase, but the company is not legally obligated to comply. The two departments' only recourse is to post the information on their websites.\n\n\"Frankly most consumers aren\u2019t looking over a Department of Managed Health Care or Department of Insurance website,\" says Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, which sponsored the bill. \"And even if they did, it would be hard for them to figure out whether the plan they're in has the unreasonable rate.\"\n\nSB 908, introduced by Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), would require an insurer to send a written notice to its customers anytime regulators found the price hike for a particular plan to be unjustified. The insurer would have to send the notice at least 60 days before the policy's renewal date, to give consumers time to shop for a new plan.\n\nThe California Association of Health Plans is studying the bill, says spokeswoman Nicole Kasabian Evans, while suggesting that it may be unnecessary.\n\nOpen enrollment periods under the Affordable Care Act already allow individuals 90 days to compare plans and to switch into new ones if they choose, she says.\n\nAnd noting that regulators post information about rates that are deemed \"unreasonable\" online, Evans argues that \"we already have a pretty good system out there.\"\n\nThe legislation is likely to go before its first committee hearing in March, says Hernandez spokesman Tim Valderrama.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "When regulators conclude a rate hike is too high, they can post it online.
