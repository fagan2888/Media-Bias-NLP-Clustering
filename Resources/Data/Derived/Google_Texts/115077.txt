Echoes to Bugles: Stories of Colorado Mammals" will be the theme for naturalist Kevin Cook's Noontime and Nighttime Nature Talks in 2014.

The monthly series starts Tuesday, Jan. 7, at noon to 1 p.m. at the Loveland Public Library, Gertrude Scott Room, 300 N. Adams Ave., repeated at 6-7 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 8.

The programs are free and open to the public.

The first program, "Runner of the Steppe," will examine pronghorns and what predator so threatened the pronghorn to make it so grandly swift yet so completely earthbound.

No registration is required, but come early as seats fill quickly.
