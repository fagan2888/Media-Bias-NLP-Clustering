However, Democrats around the country should jettison conventional wisdom and look beyond Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonJudge seals all video interviews in Clinton email case State aide thought Clinton email was for \u2018family and friends\u2019 Clinton: I'm ready for Trump's 'fantasy' campaign MORE. Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenTrump sticks by 'Pocahontas' nickname after being challenged Trump: Warren \u2018as Native American as I am\u2019 The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (Mass.) is by far the most compelling Democratic candidate and The Boston Globe is absolutely right; she should \u201crun for the White House.\u201d Warren represents the best that Democrats have to offer in 2016, in addition to the fact that she can type an email without it causing a nationwide scandal.\n\nFirst, some polls have the Massachusetts senator ahead of the former secretary of State. Warren ranked ahead of Clinton and GOP competition in a 2014 Quinnipiac poll centered on a \u201cheat index\u201d that measures favorability:\n\nElizabeth Warren Generates Most Heat\u2026\n\nNumber one today is U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, at 48.6 degrees\u2026\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is second with 47.8 degrees and only 1 percent don't know enough about her\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that this data was taken last year, before Clinton\u2019s email scandal cost her support in recent surveys and before Warren\u2019s ascent within the Democratic Party. It\u2019s also important to note that the 2014 Quinnipiac \u201cfavorability\u201d poll is different from the recent 2015 poll that states Hillary \u201cwipes everyone out.\u201d This latest poll doesn\u2019t mention the \u201cheat index\u201d and focuses primarily on New York voters. While Clinton has the name recognition today, Warren has two years to build on her reputation as a champion of the middle class.\n\nSecond, The Boston Globe has recently urged Warren to run and stated that Democrats would be making a \u201cbig mistake\u201d to simply ignore potential challengers to Hillary Clinton:\n\nDEMOCRATS WOULD be making a big mistake if they let Hillary Clinton coast to the presidential nomination without real opposition, and, as a national leader, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren can make sure that doesn\u2019t happen...\n\nIndeed, the big-picture debate on financial regulation and income inequality is what\u2019s most at peril if the Democratic primaries come and go without top-notch opponents for Clinton\u2026\n\nShe should not shrink from the chance to set the course for the Democratic Party or cede that task to Hillary Clinton without a fight.\n\nWhen a major newspaper urges a potential candidate to run, out of fear that Hillary Clinton will remain unopposed, this speaks volumes about the need for a paradigm shift within the Democratic Party.\n\nPart of the reason The Boston Globe and other would want Warren to serve as a counterbalance to Clinton is because the Massachusetts senator offers a real alternative to the GOP. As stated on Rep. Barbara Lee\u2019s (D-Calif.) website, Warren proved to be a formidable opponent of Paul Ryan Paul RyanOvernight Energy: Trump outlines 'America First' energy plan in North Dakota Bible verse prompts GOP walkout after LGBT vote labeled a 'sin' Ohio ObamaCare co-op shutting down due to finances MORE\u2019s conservative views on the economy:\n\nWarren continued: \u2018Paul Ryan says don\u2019t blame Wall Street: the guys who made billions of dollars cheating American families. Don\u2019t blame decades of deregulation that took the cops off the beat while the big banks looted the American economy\u2026\u2019\n\nAnd to a standing ovation, Warren declared: \u2018That may be Paul Ryan\u2019s vision of how America works, but that is not our vision of this great country.\u2019\n\nCan you imagine Wall Street Republican\u2019s dark secret making those statements? Hillary Clinton has raised $328,755,858 with Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan as her top donors.\n\nEconomic issues faced by middle class Americans are growing in importance and even Jeb Bush has stated \"the playing field is no longer fair or level.\" When a leading Republican is saying things that Warren would say, this shows the relevance of the wealth gap in our country. Clinton, unlike Warren, is slow to make any statements regarding the economy and The New York Times has stated that her economic plan is \u201ca quandary.\u201d Furthermore, while Clinton just recently mentioned her thoughts on income inequality, this was only because more and more people are beginning to notice Elizabeth Warren.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s momentum won\u2019t last for two years with \u201cEmailgate\u201d threatening to become a bigger issue. According to FOIA expert Nick Gass in POLITICO, Clinton\u2019s email system was \u201claughable\u201d because there\u2019s \u201cno doubt that the scheme she established was a blatant circumvention of the Freedom of Information Act.\u201d As with anything related to the Internet, email, or technology in 2015, it\u2019s entirely possible that further revelations surface about Clinton\u2019s misuse of her private home server, or any number of other unforeseen issues that could hurt Democrats.\n\nElizabeth Warren, not Hillary Clinton, personifies the true value system of most Democrats. Hillary might be ahead in certain polls, but Warren is rising and already has a major newspaper championing her as one of the best Democratic candidates in 2016. Elizabeth Warren should make a run for the White House since America, and the Democratic Party, will thank her for doing so.\n\nGoodman is a journalist and author.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Elizabeth Warren, not Hillary Clinton, personifies the true value system of most Democrats.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren, not Hillary Clinton, personifies the true value system of most Democrats.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Elizabeth Warren, not Hillary Clinton, personifies the true value system of most Democrats.", "title": "Democrats need Elizabeth Warren", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/236935-democrats-need-elizabeth-warren", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/236935-democrats-need-elizabeth-warren", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-26T18:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "H.A.
