The original bill Congress is looking to reauthorize is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, first passed in 1965. K-12 education policy is already a large enough beast on its own, with Congress debating federalism, teacher effectiveness, funding levels, funding portability and plenty of other education issues. The Head Start program is administered under the Department of Health and Human Services, not the Department of Education. Preschool policy simply doesn't belong in the jurisdiction of federal reform of K-12 education.\n\nThird, adding preschool to federal K-12 policy only makes it more difficult to reform education. Lately, it seems that most legislative changes occur in large, comprehensive bills. Congress didn't just change one part of healthcare, it passed comprehensive changes under Obamacare. Likewise, the House Republican education bill wouldn't just alter one section of K-12 education policy, it would be largely comprehensive. Regardless of whether large, comprehensive reforms are better than a series of small ones, larger pieces of legislation are harder to pass. The larger a bill is, the more likely a member of Congress will find a poison pill giving them reason to vote against.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With congressional education leaders looking to rewrite K-12 education policies, liberals continue to push Congress to expand funding for ineffective federal preschool programs.\nAfter one House Republican bill passed the Committee on Education and the Workforce, President Obama threatened to veto the bill.
