The mentality in a lot of MMA gyms when it comes to sparring is that the more often you do it, the better. I've trained in at least 10 gyms and have been to many others as a spectator or a media member. At most places the fighters sparred at least twice a week, sometimes three times a week.

So this piece by Bleacher Report about the lack of sparring in the camps of Robbie Lawler and Johny Hendricks, the headliners from the UFC 171 event this past Saturday (Hendricks beat Lawler to claim the welterweight title), surprised me a bit.

Hendricks told the media during fight week that he doesn't take head shots in training because "you don’t get paid in the gym - you get training in the gym. I want to save them for in the Octagon, and I think that’s what helps me a lot, is don't take them in there."

Lawler quit sparring in 2004 according to Fight Magazine. "He would ride his bike, come to the gym to shadowbox and hit mitts, and then hit the bag and watch the Monday and infamous Wednesday Night sparring sessions at MFS where guys were getting knocked out regularly," said the article.

“I didn’t spar for four or five years,” says Lawler in the magazine. “I was still knocking a lot of people out. I felt like I already knew how to fight, and now I had to get in shape. I didn’t want to do too much hard sparring.”
