The substance of her speech was unremarkable, but the style was unfortunate. Clinton tried to soar with inspirational rhetoric\u2014\u201cYes, that long march to freedom that began here has carried us a mighty long way\u201d\u2014but it fell flat. And worse, the Chicago-raised Clinton adopted a strange Southern drawl that at times mimicked, poorly, the cadences and rhythms of a black preacher. Instead of connecting with her audience, Clinton\u2014who has real allies in black political leadership and a genuine commitment to voting rights\u2014looked fake.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nWhen we talk about Clinton, we often talk about this inauthenticity. \u201cDespite sharing her husband\u2019s poll-driven risk aversion,\u201d wrote columnist Damon Linker in a piece last year for the Week, \u201cHillary Clinton has never played the game on his level, and her vulnerability to backlash against gratuitous displays of patent insincerity is already becoming glaringly apparent.\u201d Linker\u2019s view is a version of former Clinton adviser Mark Penn\u2019s: \u201cHillary is cold, removed, needs to be authentic,\u201d he said, suggesting she be \u201cas likable as possible\u201d but not \u201creach too far.\u201d And in turn, this reflects a more hostile assessment from conservative speechwriter Peggy Noonan in her 2000 book The Case Against Hillary Clinton, \u201cShe lacks historical heft, is not a person of real size and authenticity.\u201d Carl Bernstein, discussing his biography of Clinton, said it this way: \u201cThis is a woman who led a camouflaged life and continues to.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Wellesley College Archives/Photo by Stimmell\n\nBut there\u2019s an obvious double standard here: What politician is utterly authentic? Who are the lawmakers who show their realest selves to the public? And what does it even mean to be \u201cauthentic\u201d in a singular sense when all of us are authentic in different ways at different times?\n\nClinton should embrace the earnest wonkery and nerd enthusiasm that have defined her entire life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFor Clinton in particular, this entire line of questioning and criticism is deeply unfair. After all, there was a time when Hillary Clinton was incredibly authentic, or, at least, gave us a glance at one of her authentic selves. \u201cOne needn\u2019t approve of what she says or does (though often it is highly approvable) to recognize her as real,\u201d wrote journalist Paul Greenberg in 1992, during the Democratic primaries. At the New Republic, Elspeth Reeve uncovers a 1992 profile of Clinton in which observers and reporters praise her as \u201ccharming,\u201d \u201cdelightful,\u201d \u201cextraordinary,\u201d and \u201cunbelievably articulate.\u201d This Hillary Clinton\u2014still new on the national stage\u2014was ambitious, driven, and feisty. She was as political, knowledgeable, and as fluent in the language of policy as her husband. And people liked her for it.\n\nPhoto by David Hume Kennerly/Getty Images\n\nOr they did, until she revealed too much. \u201cI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life,\u201d she said to reporters about her career, unleashing waves of criticism from angry and affronted Americans. Clinton was too real, and she paid a political price. Hillary and her allies would spend the next two decades, right up to the present, burying the tough, passionate Clinton and playing up the one who wouldn\u2019t raise hackles, who was her \u201csofter side\u201d more than she was a political partner.\n\nPhoto by Ron Galella\n\nBut even as Clinton has accommodated the backlash, she chafes against it. According to Gail Sheehy, who has profiled Clinton and been her biographer, the former first lady once confessed deep frustration with her public image. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do anymore, nothing I do works. \u2026 I understand that I\u2019m really threatening to men, that the velocity of change between men and women and the way the country is going and for one generation to the boomers is overwhelming, especially to men,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m threatening to them and I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d Clinton came back to this territory during her 2000 Senate campaign, during an unusually introspective press conference. \u201c \u2018Who are you?\u2019 and all of that. I don\u2019t know if that is the right question,\u201d she said. \u201cEven people you think you know extremely well, do you know their entire personality? Do they, at every point you\u2019re with them, reveal totally who they are? Of course not. We now expect people in the public arena to somehow do that. I don\u2019t understand the need behind that.\u201d\n\nPhoto by Cynthia Johnson/Liaison\n\nHillary Clinton is running for president again, and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s still accommodating the backlash against her more authentic self. Unlike her Republican opponents who announced their campaigns with big rallies and elaborate staging, Clinton had a quieter initial rollout. She released a short video\u2014focused entirely on her supporters\u2014and embarked on a \u201clistening tour\u201d across early-primary and swing states. All of this was meant to diffuse the sense that Clinton is entitled\u2014a \u201ccoronated\u201d candidate foisted on an apathetic party. I don\u2019t know if that has worked, although I think the description is false. What I can say, however, is that these scripted events have made her seem more relatable and more real. Just not in the way you might expect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDuring her \u201clistening tour,\u201d Clinton spoke to Iowans about substance abuse, mental illness, and building treatment capacity for both; to Nevada high schoolers about immigration reform, vowing to \u201cdo everything I possibly can\u201d to help immigrants; and to community college students about job training and education. And in speeches across the country, she\u2019s staked new and more liberal ground on criminal justice reform and voting rights, pushing an expansive plan for universal voter registration.\n\nWhat comes across in every instance is her enthusiasm for policy. When the discussion is concrete, when it involves problems and solutions, Clinton is clear and compelling. No, she doesn\u2019t have the effortless charm of her husband or the equally effortless cool of Barack Obama, but she\u2019s intense, devoted, and honestly interested in helping. Here\u2019s the New York Times on her stop in New Hampshire:\n\nThere is not a lot of I-feel-your-pain hugging at these events, and few uproarious moments. But Mrs. Clinton brings a wonkish intensity, arriving at each round table armed with specific data points. She said, \u201cThe average four-year graduate in Iowa graduates with nearly $30,000 in debt,\u201d and, \u201cIn New Hampshire, 96 percent of all businesses are considered small businesses.\u201d She nods, jots down notes and interjects conversations with words of encouragement: \u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d and, \u201cThat\u2019s a very good point.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another way to put this: Hillary Clinton is a nerd. You see it at every stage of her life. As a kid she went door to door collecting census data, asking homeowners if they had \u201cany children in the home who are not in school\u201d so that the Census Bureau could understand the discrepancy between the total number of children and those who are enrolled in school. As a student at Wellesley, writes Carl Bernstein, she developed \u201ca better system for the return of library books\u201d and \u201cstudied every aspect of the Wellesley curriculum in developing a successful plan to reduce the number of required courses.\u201d Writing in the Atlantic, Peter Beinart collects other examples of Clinton\u2019s earnest, and authentic, nerdiness:\n\nIn 1993, she took time off from a vacation in Hawaii to grill local officials about the state\u2019s healthcare system. In his excellent book on Hillary\u2019s 2000 Senate race, Michael Tomasky observes that, \u201cIn the entire campaign, she had exactly one truly inspiring moment\u201d but that, \u201cover time it became evident to all but the most cynical that she actually cared about utility rates.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nLooking ahead to 2016, Clinton will face one of two attacks from her eventual Republican opponent, if not both: that she can\u2019t relate to ordinary Americans, and that she\u2019s long in the tooth\u2014a candidate for yesterday, not tomorrow.\n\nAn elite among elites, there\u2019s no way that Clinton can refute the latter. But she can sidestep it, and take on the former, by embracing the ambition, the earnest wonkery, and the nerdy enthusiasm that have defined her entire life. Instead of moderating the parts of her that caused her trouble in 1992 (and beyond), she should step on the throttle and ride with them. Not only does it fit her, but it fits the moment, too.\n\nPhoto by Curtis Means/NBC NewsWire\n\nEarlier this year Parks and Recreation ended its seven-season run on NBC. Initially modeled on the American version of The Office, the show shifted gears in its second season. It became gentler\u2014a comedy of errors, not a comedy of awkwardness\u2014and in its own way, radical. As critic Alyssa Rosenberg wrote for the Washington Post, rather than capitulate to the hopelessness of present politics\u2014in which gridlock and obstruction are the rule\u2014Parks and Recreation stood out as a \u201ccelebration\u201d of government that \u201cdistinguished itself from other television that\u2019s broadly considered liberal (and from so much of real-world politics), by arguing for a theory of change and a specific role for government.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s world is much more ready for the kind of woman who would snark about baking cookies on national television.\n\nIt did this through its heroine, Leslie Knope, played with aplomb by comedian Amy Poehler. For seven seasons, viewers could watch Knope\u2014a talented and dedicated public servant\u2014make the case that government, when used with passion and integrity, can be a force for good. Yes, the projects were often minor: a festival here, a park there. And her obstacles weren\u2019t hostile politicians as much as they were bumbling citizens and indifferent colleagues. But her basic philosophy was one of civic engagement. \u201cI am very angry. I\u2019m angry that Bobby Newport would hold this town hostage and threaten to leave if you don\u2019t give him what he wants. \u2026 Corporations are not allowed to dictate what a city needs. That power belongs to the people,\u201d said Knope in fourth-season debate with a political opponent. And in the season finale, Leslie gave her final take on what it means to be a public servant. \u201cWhen we worked here together, we fought, scratched, and clawed to make people\u2019s lives a tiny bit better,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what public service is about: small, incremental change every day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTwenty years ago a character like this might have had a sharper, more negative edge, like Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Tracy Flick in Election. Now, however, she\u2019s admired. And while Knope isn\u2019t a Hillary Clinton surrogate\u2014although she keeps a photo of Clinton in her office\u2014you can read her as a sunny take on the Clinton type: tenacious, ambitious, and incredibly smart.\n\nPhoto by Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nParks and Recreation wasn\u2019t a blockbuster series, but it was popular. And in its popularity, it showed a greater appetite for the kind of woman reflected in Knope. Indeed, it\u2019s no accident that, in 2015, Poehler\u2014and her former Saturday Night Live colleague Tina Fey\u2014have become feminist celebrity icons on the strength of these kinds of characters and performances.\n\nThe Hillary Clinton of 1992\u2014long buried by controversy, circumstance, and political necessity\u2014would have thrived in this moment. Indeed, today\u2019s world is much more ready for the kind of woman who would snark about baking cookies on national television.\n\nPhoto by Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images\n\nIn an environment where voters want someone new, but also want constructive progress, \u201cHillary as civics nerd\u201d is appealing. And it seems Clinton is making that bet, leaning on her past as a wonk and an advocate to connect to Democratic voters, while channeling the punchy confidence of her national debut. \u201cI may not be the youngest candidate in this race,\u201d she said in her inaugural campaign speech on Saturday, \u201cbut I will be the youngest woman president in the history of the United States.\u201d\n\nRather than wow the audience with rhetoric, Clinton structured her speech with policy, giving the audience a clear view of what she would do for the country\u2014the battles she would \u201cfight\u201d\u2014if elected president. She would protect and improve the Affordable Care Act; push a higher minimum wage; change the tax code to rein in Wall Street; cut small-business taxes; build green infrastructure; provide job training and aid for \u201cdistressed\u201d communities; pass universal paid leave and child care; make college debt-free; ban discrimination against LGBT Americans; and make retirement more secure.\n\nIf Clinton had tried to mimic Obama\u2014tried to inspire Americans like the president she wants to succeed\u2014it would have rung false. Instead, she talked policy and told thousands of people exactly what she would do.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The Democratic front-runner should offer voters her authentic, geeky self.", "fb-share": "Nerds are cool, and that is Hillary\u2019s true self.
