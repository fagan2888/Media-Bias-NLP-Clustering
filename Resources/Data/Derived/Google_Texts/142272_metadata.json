Specifically, they want to ask Mayweather about two lengthy fights in his gym where neither fighter got a rest break, and another scene showing marijuana being used at his Las Vegas mansion.\n\n\u201cWe all know TV is drama but our main responsibility is the health and safety of fighters,\u201d said Francisco Aguilar, head of the Nevada State Athletic Commission. \u201cBefore we draw a conclusion about what we saw on TV we want to make sure we have all the information.\u201d\n\nMayweather is shown on the \u201cAll Access\u201d show promoting his fight cheering on two fighters at his gym who fought 31 minutes straight without taking a break. Mayweather explained on camera that the fighters would go until one of them quit, much like fights used to be in the early days of boxing a century ago.\n\n\u201cThe dog house \u2014 the rules are you fight till whoever quits,\u201d Mayweather said.\n\nAguilar said he is concerned that fighters could be hurt by not having rest breaks and proper attention in the ring. He said it is the commission\u2019s duty to protect fighters, whether it is in sparring or in the ring during a real fight.\n\n\u201cI want to ensure that what they\u2019re doing is in the best interest of fighters,\u201d Aguilar said.\n\nMayweather will appear Tuesday before the commission both in his role as a fighter and a promoter. His Mayweather Promotions was licensed earlier this year to promote fights, and he has a stable of fighters who train at his Las Vegas gym.\n\nMayweather will also be questioned about a scene in the show where he watched as several women rolled marijuana joints in his home, though Aguilar said it was not his major concern. Mayweather did not smoke, but at one point told an assistant to go buy more rolling papers for the women.\n\nMayweather is listed as the executive producer of \u201cAll Access,\u201d a promotional series which aired in the weeks before the fight. He has talked often about Showtime allowing him to be in charge of content for the show, which shows him and his opponent preparing for their fight.\n\nMayweather was also the center of controversy a few days before the fight when he suggested that Ray Rice\u2019s original 2-game suspension should have been his only punishment, and that worse things than Rice punching his then-fiancee in an elevator happen behind closed doors in other people\u2019s homes. Mayweather later apologized for the comments, saying he shouldn\u2019t have been asked about Rice in the first place.\n\nMayweather won a unanimous 12-round decision over Maidana in their rematch to improve his record to 47-0.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Floyd Mayweather called before Nevada boxing commission", "title": "Floyd Mayweather called before Nevada boxing commission", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/20/floyd-mayweather-called-before-nevada-boxing-commission/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140920_050554_floyd-mayweather.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140920_050554_floyd-mayweather.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-20T17:03:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:30:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Once again, Floyd Mayweather Jr. has some explaining to do.\n\u201cI want to ensure that what they\u2019re doing is in the best interest of fighters,\u201d Aguilar said.\nMayweather explained on camera that the fighters would go until one of them quit, much like fights used to be in the early days of boxing a century ago.\nHis Mayweather Promotions was licensed earlier this year to promote fights, and he has a stable of fighters who train at his Las Vegas gym.\nNevada boxing regulators have ordered Mayweather to appear before them next week to answer questions about scenes aired on the Showtime network prior to his fight Saturday night against Marcos Maidana."}
