Appearing on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” on Tuesday morning, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul offered some advice to President Obama in regards to his upcoming meeting with Pope Francis.

“He ought to explain to the pope why he is telling businesses in America they can’t remain true to their faith and stay in business,” Paul said.

“The ‘Hobby Lobby’ case is being discussed [at the Supreme Court] today,” Paul continued, “and I think it’s important that he tell the leader of the Catholic Church why he thinks that businesses owned by Catholics can’t make their own decisions with regard to health care.”

After misrepresenting the Hobby Lobby case, Paul went on to agree with a prior comment from the Vatican’s chief justice, Cardinal Raymond Burke, to the effect that the Obama administration was “hostile toward Christian civilization.”
