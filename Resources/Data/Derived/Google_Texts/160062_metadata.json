Victims shouldn't have to pay a premium to make a claim, especially when many will be calling from a mobile.\n\n'The government must also make sure other public bodies play fair and drop high rate numbers as soon as possible so that people are not left out of pocket when calling essential services.'\n\nMore on this...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Which? is calling for the ban on costly customer service numbers to be extended to all financial companies, including insurers.", "sectionName": "News", "og": {"url": "http://www.which.co.uk/news/2014/02/costly-calls-ban-should-extend-to-insurers-353910/", "image": "http://www.staticwhich.co.uk/media/images/in-content/concerned-man-speaking-on-his-mobile-phone-353925.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Which? is calling for the ban on costly customer service numbers to be extended to all financial companies, including insurers."}, "contentId": 353910, "robots": "NOODP", "categoryId": 213176, "omniturePageName": "home: news: 2014: February: costly calls ban should extend to insurers, 09 February 2014", "fb": {"pages": 141323599261898}, "timestamp": 160525195006, "keywords": "premium rate phone numbers, 0845, 0870, insurance, home insurance, floods, environment agency, financial conduct authority,", "omniturePageType": "news", "categoryIds": "191887,192093,", "categories": "news,which?-home", "omnitureAccount": "whichdev"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6112\"", "article_summary": "is calling for the ban on costly customer service numbers to be extended to all financial companies, including insurers.\nCostly Calls ban should extend to insurers Which?\nThat's why we're pressuring the Financial Conduct Authority to prohibit all financial companies from using these high-rate customer service numbers.\nWe are now focusing on ensuring that all financial companies including insurers are added to the directive and that has helped attract another 12,000 signatures in the last week alone.\nIt also helped ensure that transport companies were added to the Consumer Rights Directive, meaning they will be banned from using costly phone numbers for their helplines from June 2014."}
