Really?\n\nThere are more than 300 million people in America, yet the same two families keep popping up when it comes to picking a president.\n\nThe possibility of a Bush-Clinton matchup in 2016 is increasingly plausible.\n\nAfter months of hints and speculation, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush says he\u2019s actively exploring a bid for the Republican nomination.\n\nAnd while Hillary Rodham Clinton hasn\u2019t revealed her intentions, she\u2019s seen as the odds-on favorite for the Democratic nomination.\n\nBetween them, the two potential rivals have three presidents and a U.S. senator in the branches of their family trees. And three governors, as well.\n\nWhy are these two families so dominant in modern politics?\n\nIt turns out that even though Americans profess to reject dynasties, in politics they\u2019re quite comfortable with familiar names.\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nAnd a famous name can bring a candidate instant brand recognition, important fund-raising connections and a ready network of political contacts. It may also suggest competence at a time of dysfunction \u2014 like now.\n\n\u201cPower begets power,\u201d says Dartmouth College political scientist Brendan Nyhan. \u201cDynasties can self-perpetuate.\u201d\n\nA political pedigree can have its negatives, though. A prominent surname sometimes carries unsavory associations and the risk of a fatigue factor.\n\nBoth sides of that equation were evident after Bush, 61, the son and brother of a president and the grandson of a senator, made his announcement.\n\nParty activists said the Bush name would help Jeb attract early money, talent and supporters around the country.\n\nBut Bush\u2019s brother, George W. Bush, was hugely unpopular at the end of his presidency six years ago. And while people seem to think more of him now, the recent release of a Senate report on Bush-era torture practices was a ready reminder of past controversies.\n\nClinton, 67, a former secretary of state, senator and first lady, will face the same competing dynamics of familiarity vs. fatigue if she enters the race.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton is enormously popular now, and would be sure to campaign for his wife as he did in the 2008 race, but there is still plenty of lingering unwanted baggage from his White House years.\n\nAfter Bush edged closer to a run last week, the liberal RootsAction group quickly set up a NoBushesorClintons website and began collecting signatures on a \u201cdeclaration of independence\u201d that pledges to \u201creject future domination of government by the Bushes and Clintons and by Bush/Clinton-like policies.\u201d\n\nBut Princeton historian Julian Zelizer thinks the comfort element might be more important to 2016 voters than any same-old, same-old worries.\n\n\u201cWashington\u2019s broken, and voters and campaign donors are looking for people who seem to know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe familiarity of these names becomes a big benefit and counteracts any sense that, \u2018Oh my God, I can\u2019t believe these are going to be the candidates again.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDespite some groaning about a possible Bush-Clinton sequel, there\u2019s plenty of reason to think voters will simply take a breath and size up the primary election candidates on their merits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about alternatives,\u201d Zelizer says. \u201cIf that\u2019s the best choice available, people will get over it.\u201d\n\nDynastic politics, in which multiple family members hold elected office, are more common than people might think in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. has had 44 presidents, and eight of them came from four families (two each of Adams, Harrison, Roosevelt and Bush).\n\nNyhan points to a 2010 study published in Legislative Studies Quarterly that found that over the previous two centuries, nearly 9 percent of members of Congress were closely related to someone who had served in a previous Congress. It concluded that such politicians \u201cenjoy \u2018brand name advantages,\u2019 giving them a significant edge over comparable nondynastic opponents.\u201d\n\nThat kind of talk makes Jeff Cohen\u2019s skin crawl.\n\nCohen, a co-founder of the RootsAction group, said even his non-political friends frequently complain about the dominance of the Bushes and Clintons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a source of frustration and it\u2019s broad,\u201d he says, calling the Bushes and Clintons \u201csymbols of a corrupt system and a permanent governing class.\u201d\n\nEven Bush\u2019s mother has suggested a third President Bush could be one too many.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t find more than two or three families to run for high office, that\u2019s silly,\u201d she said earlier this year.\n\n(Mom supposedly has since come around to the idea of another Bush candidacy.)\n\nClinton, for her part, may have to worry as much about Obama fatigue as she does about Clinton fatigue.\n\n\u201cShe served in Obama\u2019s Cabinet, she\u2019s been around a long time, and she\u2019s quite old for a presidential candidate,\u201d says Nyhan. \u201cSo the Republicans have an opportunity to run a turning-the-page campaign against her.\u201d\n\nOf course, if she\u2019s running against a Bush, that\u2019s a harder case for Republicans to make.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Bush and Clinton families keep popping up when it comes to picking a president.
