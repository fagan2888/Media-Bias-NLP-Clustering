"There is no question that Ryan is operating in a very ambitious way," said Peter Wehner, a former director of the White House Office of Strategic Initiatives under President George W. Bush who has known Ryan for two decades. "He is trying to set forth a path for the party with ideas and policy proposals and principles," he said. "That is unusual for a speaker in an election year, but Ryan himself is a very different person, and this is the product of this very unusual presidential year."
