Since Obamacare was made law over six years ago, it has been under attack.

So far, Congress has held over 60 pointless votes to repeal all or part of the law. I watch that circus with interest because I'm on the road to recovery today because of insurance I purchased through the Affordable Care Act. Since this battle is political, I want to elect representatives to Congress who will do what needs to be done next: drive down medical costs.

Shaughnessy Naughton, a Bucks County Democrat running for Congress, knows that middle-class families need access to quality health care and health insurance at prices that don't break the bank. She wants Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower prices, which will help seniors and those who care for them. And she wants to require greater transparency from pharmacy benefits managers so that small pharmacies can compete and consumer prescription drug prices can go down.

Shaughnessy supports the Affordable Care Act because it's helping people like me, and she has concrete, achievable ideas to make it even better so more families and individuals can live healthier lives. I'll be voting for Shaughnessy on April 26.
