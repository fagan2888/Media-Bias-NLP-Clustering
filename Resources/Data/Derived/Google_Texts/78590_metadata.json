The entire interview and transcript will be posted at marketplace.org.\n\nHighlights from the interview:\n\nTo deal with debt and balance the budget, as president, Carson would shrink government through attrition, making cuts across the board, having every department head make 3-4 percent reductions, and implementing a 15 percent flat tax.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that difficult. If we simply refuse to extend the budget by one penny for three to four years, you\u2019ve got a balanced budget \u2013 just like that.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Ben Carson\n\nIn answer Kai\u2019s question \u201cas president, would you roll back the Affordable Care Act and take away healthcare coverage away from the 16 million people who\u2019ve gotten it?\u201d Dr. Carson answered, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to take healthcare out of the political realm and actually come up with something that actually works and I have proposed a system that actually works \u2026 It will provide much better coverage than they have right now and they will not be second-class citizens.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Ben Carson\n\nOn what he sees as the biggest economic issues facing our country \u2013 debt and income gap:\n\n\u201cPoor people and middle class people don\u2019t have a mechanism to grow their money. The only people who can grow their money are people who have a certain risk tolerance. Those tend to be upper income people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see the buying power of the middle class and poor people going down. These things are increasing the gap. When people come along and say, \u2018it\u2019s the rich people. It\u2019s their fault, and if we can take their money and redistribute it, somehow that\u2019s going to solve the problem,\u2019 that\u2019s an emotional argument and I think it appeals to our lower elements but has nothing to do with reality \u2026 Those are the kinds of things that are killing the poor and the middle class. It\u2019s those silly asinine policies. It\u2019s not because of rich people.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Ben Carson\n\nOn international relations under Carson\u2019s leadership:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna see much more proactive stance toward someone like Putin. We\u2019re going to be much more active throughout the whole Baltic basin area, Eastern Europe, we\u2019re going to re-establish a missile defense program, we\u2019re going to have more than one or two armored brigades in that area \u2026 We\u2019re going to use our energy resources in an appropriate way \u2026 to exploit our tremendous energy resources \u2026 to make Europe dependent on us for energy rather than Putin. Put him back in his little box where he belongs.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Ben Carson\n\nMarketplace\u00ae is produced and distributed by American Public Media\u2122 (APM), one of the largest producers and distributors of public radio programming in the world with a portfolio reaching 19 million listeners via nearly 1,000 radio stations nationwide each week.
