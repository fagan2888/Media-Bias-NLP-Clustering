Including you.\n\nThey seem to have just thought of this in the past 24 hours -- see, they didn't really think Pajamaboy was cool or anything. They actually intended Pajamaboy to be a negative image, like \"This is what people who don't sign up with Obamacare look like.\"\n\nSo they're now claiming -- like, two weeks too late for this to be plausible -- that Pajamaboy was always intended as the Goofus, not as the Gallant, of health insurance status.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be this guy sitting around in his pajamas,\u201d a Democratic official told First Read said of the message, who requested anonymity to talk freely. \u201cHave a conversation, and get health care. And it\u2019s poking fun at that\u201d idea of doing nothing.\n\nThey used Pajamaboy a lot, over the course of two months, in various OFA \"get enrolled\" messages.
