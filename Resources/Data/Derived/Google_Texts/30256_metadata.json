A few examples should suffice. Let\u2019s start with one: what can only be described as the Left\u2019s irrational obsession with attempting to overturn the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United, which by now has become a virtual plank in the official Democratic Presidential Platform.\n\nAs a brief refresher, Citizens United arose against the background of a national battle against campaign spending on political speech that seems to date back at least to the Watergate scandal of the second Nixon Administration. If only we could take money out of politics, reformers reasoned, we could elect honest politicians who would put the good of the whole above their own and have something approaching the constitutional republic that the Constitution\u2019s Framers envisioned all those years ago in Philadelphia. Right.\n\nThis fundamentally misreads the nature of politics, of people, of government, and of the Constitution itself. Unless, like Bernie Sanders, you believe that \u201crich people\u201d (defined as anyone who makes more money than you) are the root of all evil, then you should recognize that it is not money that corrupts: as Lord Acton recognized, it\u2019s power.\n\nAnd the reason that government in general and the national government in particular invite so much corruption are that they have assumed so much power over American\u2019s lives, livelihoods, educations, and \u2013 indeed \u2013 their very health. No aspect of American life is too minute for the federal government to attempt to regulate, from who must pay for your birth control if you don\u2019t want children to what kind of car seat your children have to ride in if the birth control doesn\u2019t work.\n\nBut back to Citizens United. The case arose from four private citizens who formed a not-for-profit corporation they called \u201cCitizens United\u201d to produce a film arguing against voting for Hillary Clinton for President.\n\nNever mind that the CBS television network has for three seasons now run a continuing series called \u201cMadame Secretary\u201d about a brave and capable blond-haired Secretary of State whose passing resemblance to the former Secretary of State now running for the Democratic party\u2019s presidential nomination is doubtless wholly coincidental.\n\nNever mind also that the president of CBS News is David Rhodes, whose brother Benjamin is deputy national security adviser for strategic communication for U.S. President Barack Obama, who would love to see his former Secretary of State elected as his successor. The idea of independent film-makers arguing directly against the Secretary\u2019s election as President was more than the power structure could bear. Only Michael Moore gets to do that kind of stuff.\n\nSo the government sued to block the film as violating campaign spending laws. And \u2013 as is all too typical for government \u2013 the government over-reached. It actually had the audacity to argue that, under campaign finance laws, it could even ban the sale of a book within a specified number of days of a Presidential election that said \u201cdon\u2019t vote for candidate X.\u201d\n\nThis was too much for the Supreme Court to bear, which accordingly ruled that corporations, labor unions, and political action committees could spend as much as they wanted, provided they didn\u2019t coordinate with the candidates they support. The effect of such spending, the Court reasoned, was neither pernicious nor profound.\n\nBut obviously the Supreme Court must have been wrong, because look how $118 million or so was able to buy the Republican nomination for Jeb! Bush. And look at how poorly Donald Trump, whose major coverage comes from the media at no expense to him or any super-PAC, has done at the polls.\n\nOh. Wait.\n\nReasoning not being the Left\u2019s strong suit, the push to overturn Citizens United remains strong. Whether a post-Scalia Supreme Court will indeed reconsider and overturn the opinion remains to be seen.\n\nBut if it does, don\u2019t look on it as a victory for free speech.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2016/04/the-progressive-war-on-free-speech-part-one/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RobertsObama.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "The Progressive War on Free Speech \u2013 Part One"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Reasoning not being the Left\u2019s strong suit, the push to overturn Citizens United remains strong.\nBut obviously the Supreme Court must have been wrong, because look how $118 million or so was able to buy the Republican nomination for Jeb!\nWhether a post-Scalia Supreme Court will indeed reconsider and overturn the opinion remains to be seen.\nBut if it does, don\u2019t look on it as a victory for free speech.\nBut back to Citizens United."}
