In the last three months of 2014, as a few stores opened, Aurora earned a little over $100,000 total.\n\nBy the end of 2015, the city expects to have between $1.5 million to $2 million in revenue from legal pot sales.\n\nAnd those who waded through the process and claimed one of the city\u2019s 24 licenses are starting to see big dividends.\n\nWith no previous pot sales, Aurora used a point system to rank and issue 24 recreational marijuana business licenses \u2014 four in each City Council ward or district \u2014 and so far 23 licenses have been awarded. The point system led some to criticize the city, saying it was squeezing out the mom-and-pop pot shops.\n\nMaybe they were right.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always room for improvement if you look back, but overall I am very proud of the way we implemented our ordinance,\u201d said City Councilman Bob Roth, chairman of a committee that created rules for recreational marijuana. \u201cI think we did get some heat from some people saying \u2018Why are you micro-managing it?\u2019 But I don\u2019t think we wanted the mom-and-pop shops, at least initially.\u201d\n\nRecreational marijuana stores were allowed to open in Aurora on Oct. 1, but it took a few weeks before the first store, Euflora, opened near Southlands mall.\n\nSince then, 11 recreational pot shops have opened in the city, and there are two grow operations currently in business, including one that is 20,000 square feet.\n\nIt\u2019s not known whether Aurora has seen an increase in criminal activity, including public consumption, because of recreational sales.\n\nSgt. Scott Pendleton of the Aurora Police Department said that one or two retail pot stores have had attempted break-ins. Police responded to one shop that reported a disorderly person inside.\n\n\u201cThose places do a pretty good job of policing themselves,\u201d Pendleton said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d\n\nPolice are seeing more illegal home-grow operations, but that\u2019s been happening for about four years, he said. Last year, police responded to 144 home-grow calls, and the majority of them were illegal, Pendleton said.\n\nThe Aurora City Council has moved to ban all types of hash-oil production in homes. The city has seen at least six explosions or fires due to hash oil production since October 2013, injuring three people and damaging several buildings.\n\nThe most recent opening of a recreational store, Good Chemistry on East Iliff Avenue, is certainly no mom and pop; think more Apple store. It is modern, spacious and has four kiosks with iPads so customers can research pot.\n\nMeg Collins, vice president of business development for Good Chemistry, said Aurora was a natural fit for the company, which also has a store in Denver.\n\nThe Aurora shop has been open since April 9, so sales numbers are still coming in. But Collins, former executive director of the Cannabis Business Alliance, said expectations are high for the company\u2019s new location.\n\n\u201cSo far, the store is doing very well,\u201d she said.\n\nAt Starbuds on Del Mar Parkway, owner Brian Ruden said it was a slow process getting approval for a license but it is paying in a big way.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t able to open by the Oct. 1 start date, but he said the business is in a good location in Original Aurora and is setting sales records each month. In March, Ruden said, sales totaled roughly $200,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting trend now that people are finding us,\u201d Ruden said. \u201cAll the headache and strife and nightmare to get open \u2026 now looking back I\u2019m so glad we did it.\u201d\n\nCarlos Illescas: 303-954-1175, cillescas@denverpost.com or twitter.com/cillescasdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Aurora recreational pot venture going well after first six months", "title": "Aurora recreational pot venture going well after first six months", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/26/aurora-recreational-pot-venture-going-well-after-first-six-months/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150426__20150427_A4_CDXXAURORAPOTp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150426__20150427_A4_CDXXAURORAPOTp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-26T20:04:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T21:29:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Marijuana Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb59\"", "article_summary": "Six months into Aurora\u2019s venture of recreational marijuana sales, city officials say after a slow start everything is going about as well as could be expected.\nThe most recent opening of a recreational store, Good Chemistry on East Iliff Avenue, is certainly no mom and pop; think more Apple store.\nIt\u2019s not known whether Aurora has seen an increase in criminal activity, including public consumption, because of recreational sales.\nThe Aurora City Council has moved to ban all types of hash-oil production in homes.\nBy the end of 2015, the city expects to have between $1.5 million to $2 million in revenue from legal pot sales."}
