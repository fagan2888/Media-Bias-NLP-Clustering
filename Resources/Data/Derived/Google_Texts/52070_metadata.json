Yet only this week, past the halfway mark of his term, did he at last offer even a sketch of how to cut costs and raise funds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for us all to come to grips with it,\u201d de Blasio remarked. No \u2014 the time to come to grips when he stepped into City Hall in Jan. 2014.\n\nInstead, while public hospitals bled money, de Blasio went gangbusters to salvage Brooklyn\u2019s private Long Island College Hospital, a ward of the state after an operator had declared the hemorrhaging patient beyond saving.\n\nAs candidate for mayor, de Blasio got arrested protesting LICH\u2019s impending closure. Two months into his mayoralty, he trumpeted a settlement that kept alive hope LICH could stay open as a \u201ctranscendent moment for health care in New York City.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, Local 1199, a health-care union dominant in private hospitals, including LICH, contributed $250,000 to the Campaign for One New York.\n\nEmergency! (Mark Bonifacio/New York Daily News)\n\nAlthough the hospital was doomed when no bidder submitted a feasible operating concept, de Blasio used the Campaign for One New York to then round up local support for Plan B: a freestanding, privately operated emergency room amid redevelopment of the hospital\u2019s prime real estate.\n\nMAYOR DE BLASIO BLAMES POLITICS FOR FUNDRAISING SCRUTINY\n\nIn June 2014, the campaign mailed to thousands of neighbors a letter signed by a local civic leader who had been \u201casked by Mayor de Blasio to share my views.\u201d\n\nHe touted the fallback plan for a clinic as a win \u201cmuch better than we expected.\u201d\n\nIt meant a reprieve for Local 1199 jobs, too.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s campaign to prop up a single private health-care facility that served an affluent area, while leaving the public system unattended, contradicts his claims that the Campaign for One New York only pushed two issues of citywide reach, universal pre-K and affordable housing.\n\nThe LICH circus proved a distraction from the urgent project of rescuing Health + Hospitals \u2014 and poses questions for Bharara and Vance. For example:\n\nThe state ultimately chose a developer named Fortis to build housing on the site along with an emergency facility, a plan complicated by pursuit of zoning changes. How did Fortis come to hire Hilltop Solutions \u2014 whose New York office is led by Campaign for One New York chair and de Blasio campaign manager Bill Hyers \u2014 to sell its development plan to the neighborhood?", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Editorials", "twitter": {"description": "Jump to no conclusions that  Mayor de Blasio traded government quos for donors\u2019 quids via the Campaign for One New York.", "title": "Dr. Bill's housecall, while the city's public hospitals withered", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/dr-bill-housecall-city-public-hospitals-withered-article-1.2618113", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2618112.1461881515!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/lich29e-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "de blasio investigation, preet bharara de blasio, campaign for one new york, de blasio fundraising,", "parsely-author": "Editorials", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "de blasio investigation, preet bharara de blasio, campaign for one new york, de blasio fundraising,", "nydn_tags": "de blasio campaign finance, bill de blasio, cy vance, preet bharara", "news_keywords": "de blasio investigation, preet bharara de blasio, campaign for one new york, de blasio fundraising,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/dr-bill-housecall-city-public-hospitals-withered-article-1.2618113", "parsely-title": "Dr. Bill's housecall, while the city's public hospitals withered", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-29T04:10:00-0400", "sailthru.title": "Dr. Bill's housecall, while the city's public hospitals withered", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-04-29T08:10:00", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2618112.1461881515!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/lich29e-1-web.jpg", "description": "Jump to no conclusions that  Mayor de Blasio traded government quos for donors\u2019 quids via the Campaign for One New York.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Jump to no conclusions that  Mayor de Blasio traded government quos for donors\u2019 quids via the Campaign for One New York.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Jump to no conclusions that  Mayor de Blasio traded government quos for donors\u2019 quids via the Campaign for One New York.", "title": "Dr. Bill's housecall, while the city's public hospitals withered", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/dr-bill-housecall-city-public-hospitals-withered-article-1.2618113", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2618112.1461881515!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/lich29e-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "de blasio campaign finance, bill de blasio, cy vance, preet bharara", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2618112.1461881515!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/lich29e-1-web.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Editorials", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "the foundation of all public health care.\u201dA \u201clong-term problem,\u201d he called the public hospitals\u2019 money traumas, exacerbated by unintended consequences of Obamacare.\nThe LICH circus proved a distraction from the urgent project of rescuing Health + Hospitals \u2014 and poses questions for Bharara and Vance.\nMAYOR DE BLASIO'S POLITICAL ALLIES HIT WITH SUBPOENASDe Blasio included in the budget he proposed this week $180 million annually to prop up the public Health + Hospitals system, described by the mayor as \u201ccrucial to this city .\nInstead, while public hospitals bled money, de Blasio went gangbusters to salvage Brooklyn\u2019s private Long Island College Hospital, a ward of the state after an operator had declared the hemorrhaging patient beyond saving.\nAs candidate for mayor, de Blasio got arrested protesting LICH\u2019s impending closure."}
