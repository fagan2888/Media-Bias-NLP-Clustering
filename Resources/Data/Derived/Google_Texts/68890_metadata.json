The steps outlined in the consent order will instead allow consumers to continue their health coverage with no changes, he said.\n\nThe agreement reached \u201cis the best option for consumers because it will not disrupt their current policies,\u201d he said. The department said it retains the ability to respond if Moda doesn\u2019t comply with all the requirements in the order.\n\n\u201cWe worked very hard to keep them\u201d in the market, said Alaska Division of Insurance Director Lori Wing-Heier.\n\nModa is one of two companies that have been offering individual health insurance policies for Alaskans on the federally facilitated online marketplace. Wing-Heier said she has asked the federal government to put Moda back on the exchange and has also requested a two-week special enrollment period. Wing-Heier said people may have selected Moda but had not finalized their enrollment. The initial action against Moda took place near the end of the latest open enrollment period on the marketplace.\n\nAlaska officials in a release said both states came to an agreement with Moda over the weekend that outlines a plan for the company to stabilize its financial position and continue to offer coverage.\n\nThe agreement calls for Moda to raise at least $179 million, which is expected to allow the company to continue providing services through 2016. Of that, $15 million would be put aside for the protection of Alaska policyholders, Wing-Heier said.\n\nAmong other things, Moda also must obtain approval from Oregon regulators before awarding executive salary increases or bonuses.\n\nWing-Heier said insurers not only in Alaska but across the country have had a tough time. Moda has made a commitment to try to stay in the market, she said.\n\n\u201cThey could\u2019ve taken a much easier route and said, \u2018We\u2019re out of health insurance,\u2019 or \u2018We\u2019re out of Alaska, period,\u2019 and they did not take that,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Jan. 27, Moda has worked through the process of assuring the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services of its ability to continue to serve its individual customers in Oregon and Alaska, said Robert Gootee, CEO of Moda Inc., the parent company of Moda Health Plan.\n\n\u201cThey have done an excellent job of quickly analyzing a difficult and rapidly changing set of circumstances,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHe said he\u2019s pleased an agreement has been reached on a path forward.\n\nAbout 10,000 Alaskans are enrolled by Moda on the individual market and about 7,500 on the small group market, Wing-Heier has said.\n\nAbout 244,000 Oregon residents were enrolled in Moda plans in the individual, small group and large group markets as of Sept. 30, according to the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "JUNEAU (AP) \u2014 Insurance regulators in Alaska and Oregon announced Feb. 8 that a company that had been suspended from offering health insurance policies in the states over concerns with its financial condition will be allowed to resume that business.
