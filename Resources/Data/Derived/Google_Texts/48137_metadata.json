However, a new study by anthropologists has found that human settlements and disruptions do not pose a significant impact on the aggressive behavior of the chimps. Their killing instinct comes naturally as they kill one another to increase their chances to reproduce and survive.\n\nJill Pruetz, Iowa State University primatologist and anthropologist, was one of the 30 international researchers who conducted a study on chimpanzees and bonobo communities. The study was published in Nature.\n\nThe team of 30 experts assembled data from 18 chimpanzee communities gathered over five decades that included analysis of 152 killings by chimpanzees. The researches made sure that chimp-on-chimp violence occurred at a site that was relatively undisturbed by humans.\n\nIt was found that those chimps adopted killing as their survival strategy. Killing their own kind is simply a natural way for their community to survive and develop as killing other each other provides them more resources and territory.\n\nIt was also found that most of the killings were carried out by males on other males from neighboring groups. While even chimps with plenty of resources can show aggression, human encroachment was not responsible for the cause of chimp-on-chimp aggression.\n\nThe study was also conducted on four bonobo communities. Interestingly, researchers found that even though chimpanzees could be very violent, bonobos were less aggressive. Only one suspected bonobo killing was documented.\n\nMichael Wilson, a University of Minnesota evolutionary anthropologist, said, \"They'll tear off pieces of the body, often the genitalia, and sometimes they'll rip the throat out. It's really horrific, the sorts of damage they do\".", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4d32\"", "article_summary": "It was found that those chimps adopted killing as their survival strategy.\nOnly one suspected bonobo killing was documented.\nJill Pruetz, Iowa State University primatologist and anthropologist, was one of the 30 international researchers who conducted a study on chimpanzees and bonobo communities.\nThe study was also conducted on four bonobo communities.\nHowever, a new study by anthropologists has found that human settlements and disruptions do not pose a significant impact on the aggressive behavior of the chimps."}
