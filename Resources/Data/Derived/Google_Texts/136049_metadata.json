John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told Politico.\n\nThe threat arrives less than two weeks before U.S. diplomats are set to join representatives from nearly 200 nations in Paris to finalize a climate deal intended to cut carbon emissions.\n\nNegotiators are expected to sign the final agreement Dec. 11 during the United Nations summit, running parallel with a deadline for Congress to submit its 2016 spending bill to Obama.\n\nBarrasso and Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., sent a letter last week to the White House pledging to use the budget legislation to prevent U.S. tax dollars from flowing into the climate plan unless the president submits the deal to Congress for review.\n\nObama is said to be devising a strategy to avoid sending the agreement to Congress because of near inevitable rejection from the GOP-led legislature.\n\n\u201cWhile the executive branch and Congress both play an important role in the foreign policy of our nation, Congress ultimately holds the power of the purse,\u201d Barrasso and Inhofe wrote.\n\nThe senators demanded that Todd Stern, U.S. special envoy for climate change, relay to foreign counterparts that \u201cCongress will not be forthcoming with these funds in the future without a vote in the Senate on any final agreement, as required in the U.S. Constitution.\u201d\n\nRachel Bovard, director of policy services at The Heritage Foundation, said the Obama administration plans to cast the pact as an \u201cinternational agreement\u201d rather than a treaty, which requires two-thirds approval in the Senate, because it would not attract the votes required for ratification.\n\n\u201cIn an incredibly bold move, he has decided to subvert the intent of the Constitution\u2014which requires Senate advice and consent for treaties,\u201d Bovard said of Obama:\n\nEssentially he is using legal loopholes to get around the constitutional role of the Senate, and impose this agreement\u2014and its billions of dollars in costs\u2014onto the American people without the say of their elected representatives.\n\nDuring a hearing last week by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Barrasso said Congress never approved the president\u2019s promise to pour billions of U.S. funds into the Green Climate Fund. That United Nations fund allocates money from developed countries and private contributors to assist developing nations with protections against climate change.\n\n\u201cThese actions in the House and Senate send a strong signal that the U.S. will no longer underwrite the global climate change project,\u201d said Steven Groves, a senior research fellow in foreign policy at The Heritage Foundation. \u201cIf the poor countries attending the Paris negotiations don\u2019t think the U.S. will make good on its financial pledges, they won\u2019t sign any climate change agreement.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama is trying to go around Congress on the pact.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Obama is trying to go around Congress on the pact.", "title": "Senate GOP Plan to Use Budget Process to Block Obama's Climate Change Pact", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151123_ParisClimatePact_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-24T23:33:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PXe1ZD"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Obama is trying to go around Congress on the pact.", "title": "Senate GOP Plan to Use Budget Process to Block Obama's Climate Change Pact", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151123_ParisClimatePact_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "climate change", "published_time": "2015-11-24T12:24:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-24T23:33:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, John Barrasso, Paris Protocol, United Nations, Jim Inhofe"}, "article_summary": "The GOP lawmakers want to leverage their appropriations power to block $3 billion pledged by the Obama administration to help developing countries manage climate change.\n\u201cIf the poor countries attending the Paris negotiations don\u2019t think the U.S. will make good on its financial pledges, they won\u2019t sign any climate change agreement.\u201d\nThat United Nations fund allocates money from developed countries and private contributors to assist developing nations with protections against climate change.\n\u201cThese actions in the House and Senate send a strong signal that the U.S. will no longer underwrite the global climate change project,\u201d said Steven Groves, a senior research fellow in foreign policy at The Heritage Foundation.\nSenate Republicans, girding for another budget battle in early December, are vowing to use the process to undercut President Barack Obama\u2019s chances of brokering an international climate pact expected to emerge from negotiations in Paris."}
