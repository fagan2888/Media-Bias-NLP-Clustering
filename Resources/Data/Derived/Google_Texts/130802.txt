CAVE JUNCTION, Ore. (AP) - Up to 40 homes have been evacuated just south of Cave Junction due to a fast-growing wildfire in the area.

The Oregon Department of Forestry says the fire originated on the south side of the Illinois River and has recently jumped the river and grown to 40 acres in size. It is starting spot fires out ahead of itself.

Illinois Valley Fire District spokesman Jason Bayless said the fire was reported at about 1:30 p.m. behind the Illinois Valley Airport and the Rough & Ready Lumber mill. Its cause is under investigation.

Bayless said 125 structures are threatened by the fire; itâ€™s unclear how many of those are homes. So far, he said, no structures have been lost to the blaze.

The fire is advancing quickly, Bayless said, because there is a lot of dry fuel on the ground and a steady wind of 5 to 10 mph.

Multiple agencies, many fire personnel and aircraft such as helicopters and air tankers are either on scene or en route.

The American Red Cross says it has opened a shelter at the Immanuel United Methodist Church in Cave Junction.
