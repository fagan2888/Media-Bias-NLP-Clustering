Upon hearing that Congressman Cole is from the Chickasaw Nation, Scalia said: \u201cDon't forget you belong to a conquered race.\u201d\n\nJustice Scalia\u2019s use of the word \u201crace\u201d places his comment in an obvious racial frame of reference. The idea of American Indians being \u201cconquered\u201d evokes the theme of inferiority (those deemed \u201cconquered\u201d), and superiority (the racial group said to have conquered \u201cthe race\u201d treated as \u201cinferior\u201d). In other words, Justice Scalia\u2019s comment was predicated on the idea of racial domination: \u201cWe are the victorious race and you are the inferior, \u2018conquered race.\u2019\u201d In short, Justice Scalia\u2019s comment was an open expression of racism and is accurately re-expressed in this manner: \u201cDon't forget you belong to a dominated race.\u201d\n\nThe Ethnic Studies Department at the University of Oregon characterizes and studies racism as a system of domination. Racism is structured in terms of a top/down pattern of superiority and inferiority, of dominance and subordinance. One example of racism is automatically judging dark skinned people with \u201cnon-white\u201d facial features as inferior to \u201cwhite\u201d people with a lighter skin hue and European features.\n\nFor a racist, darker skin and \u201cnon-white\u201d racial features serve as \u201cproof\u201d of the inferiority of \u201cblack\u201d people. A racist judgment of inferiority can also be based on some other categorization, such as some \u201cgroup\u201d identification. Simply being \u201cother than white society,\u201d and, therefore, \u201clower than\u201d the supposedly superior \u201cnorm\u201d of \u201cwhite people\u201d is enough to be judged by racists as \u201clesser than.\u201d\n\nDonald Sterling, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team has been embroiled in a firestorm of controversy over what has been characterized as his racist comments about \u201cblack people\u201d to his \u201cmixed-race\u201d girlfriend. His comments were anonymously leaked to the media through the gossip monger program TMZ, and this has resulted in a condemnation of racism in the media. The universal attitude seems to be: \u201cHow dare Sterling talk in such a racist manner about African American National Basketball Association (NBA) basketball players.\u201d\n\nThe consequences were swift: Sterling is probably going to be compelled to sell his Clippers franchise (which he will no doubt profit from). He has been banned for life from the NBA. He has been fined some $2.5 million dollars. This is likely to hurt Sterling a great deal since it will take such a huge chunk of his estimated net worth of some $1,900,000,000. After the fine, that leaves him with a mere $1,897,500,000 net worth. That kind of punishment will surely teach him a valuable lesson.\n\nOne white male pundit on CNN said he believes the outrage over, and universal repudiation of, Sterling\u2019s comments, sends a clear signal that racism has pretty much ended in the United States. And it makes sense that in many ways African Americans in the United States have obviously come far since the days of separate bathrooms, drinking fountains, and back-row bus seats during the separate but equal days of the Jim Crow laws. However, for the most poverty stricken sectors of African American society, the daily problems they continue to face from institutional racism abound.\n\nWhile privately expressed racism toward wealthy African Americans who play pro-basketball will not be tolerated, especially if it so happens that the privately expressed racist views are widely publicized, it is an entirely different matter when it comes to the expression of racism towards the poorest sectors of African American society, and toward other so-called \u201cethnic groups.\u201d A case in point is the comment by Justice Scalia to Chickasaw Nation citizen Tom Cole. The fact that Cole is a duly elected and seated U.S. Congressman did not temper Scalia's acidic and racist tongue.\n\nWhile I refuse to think or write of our Original Nations and Peoples as a \u201crace\u201d or \u201cethnic groups,\u201d it is clearly a problem for a sitting Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court to avow that he regards us as a \u201crace\u201d that is inferior as a result of that claim that we have been \u201cconquered,\u201d or, in other words, \u201cdominated.\u201d\n\nCertainly there is a vast difference between Donald Sterling and Antonin Scalia. After all, Donald Sterling was never going to referee any NBA games. It was not as though he has been forced out of the NBA to prevent him from being able to use his racist frame of reference to judge African American NBA players on the court, or use his racist views to influence the outcome of specific basketball games.\n\nAs for Justice Scalia, he has been on the U.S. Supreme Court for almost twenty-eight years, and during that time he has been using in his racist mental frame of our Original Nations (\u201cIndians\u201d) as a conquered (dominated) race in his decision-making in cases involving Indian issues. Why has his openly racist comment to Congressman Cole resulted in no public expression of outrage from the leadership in Indian Country? Why hasn't there been any persuasive campaign to have Scalia remove himself from any case involving American Indian nations and peoples?\n\nThe white male pundit on CNN who said that racism has pretty much ended in the United States has obviously never read Robert A. Williams' book Like A Loaded Weapon: The Rehnquist Court, Indian Rights, and the Legal History of Racism in America (2005). Professor Williams makes it abundantly clear that U.S. federal Indian law is an entire sector of U.S. law that is a product of racist thinking that has been institutionalized in the United States. Where's the outrage over that in the U.S. media?\n\nWhile I prefer to frame the discussion more in terms of \u201creligious racism\u201d based on what I term the Doctrine of Christian Discovery and Domination, Williams clearly demonstrates that U.S. federal Indian law is a system of ideas structured in terms of white superiority and non-white inferiority, which continues to be used by the U.S. Supreme Court in an anti-Indian manner to this very day. Anyone who would claim that racism has pretty much ended in the United States has no clue that the U.S. Supreme Court continues to make federal Indian law decisions based on racist precedents against our Original Nations and Peoples.\n\nWith regard to Justice Scalia's statement, Congressman Cole's office told me that he will not comment \u201con a private conversation.\u201d His office did not say that the incident never happened, or that Scalia did not make that statement to representative Cole. His office simple characterized it as \u201cprivate,\u201d even though the congressman evidently later recounted Scalia's comment at a conference of lawyers in Oklahoma.\n\nSteven Newcomb (Shawnee, Lenape) is co-founder and co-director of the Indigenous Law Institute and author of Pagans in the Promised Land: Decoding the Doctrine of Christian Discovery (Fulcrum, 2008).
