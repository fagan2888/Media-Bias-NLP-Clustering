That will prove a tough exercise for lawmakers in 2016, however.\n\nThe calendar and political obstacles are daunting. Congress will have a shorter session this year, making it difficult for legislators to pass all 12 appropriations bills individually\u2014a feat that hasn\u2019t been accomplished in over two decades.\n\nIn recent years, Congress has made a habit of approving government spending with a single vote. Instead of voting to fund individual agencies and programs one at a time, legislators bundle smaller appropriations bills into a single lump package.\n\nInside Washington, that massive legislation is known as the omnibus. Ryan calls it a \u201ccrap sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be putting appropriations bills together this way,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican said late last year. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have a handful of people in a room putting together a trillion-dollar spending bill.\u201d\n\nStill new on the top job in December and with a deadline looming, Ryan finished negotiations with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on a $1.8 trillion omnibus deal\u2014legislation left over from his predecessor as speaker, John Boehner, R-Ohio.\n\nRyan promises things will be different. Starting in 2016, he says, the 12 government appropriations bills will be considered one at a time. And House conservatives say they\u2019ll watch closely to make sure the speaker follows through.\n\n\u201cWe have one job this year, and that\u2019s to fund the government in a responsible, thoughtful, and constitutional manner,\u201d Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said Wednesday. \u201cIf we are here next year having just passed an omnibus, that is an F-minus [for Ryan]. If we pass 12 appropriations bills and stand our ground and force the Senate to face these issues, that\u2019s an A.\u201d\n\nJustin Bogie, a senior fiscal policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, says passing the individual appropriations would be a \u201cmonumental step toward returning to regular order.\u201d\n\nBy debating each appropriations bill individually, Bogie said, Congress would be able \u201cto make tough policy decisions and eliminate wasteful spending and duplicative programs that fall outside of the scope of the federal government.\u201d\n\nThe omnibus has been criticized as a favorite vehicle for pet projects and questionable spending. In recent years, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., has followed previous lawmakers\u2019 tradition by releasing an annual Wastebook detailing hundreds of expensive government programs of questionable merit.\n\nGoing through appropriations bills one at a time would give the House an opportunity to find and cut out the questionable spending that Flake targets\u2013such as the millions of taxpayer dollars spent to study sheep in microgravity or monkeys on treadmills.\n\nBut picking out wasteful programs as the House evaluates 12 separate appropriations bills likely will be a lengthy process.\n\nCongress must approve all government spending before a Sept. 16 deadline. Although lawmakers regularly miss deadlines, they haven\u2019t successfully funded the government through the regular process in more than 20 years.\n\nAnd lawmakers have only 110 days to try\u2014three weeks less than they had last year.\n\nAn aide to Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told The Daily Signal it\u2019s not unusual for congressional sessions to run short during election years. The majority leader crafted the calendar in consultation with Ryan\u2019s office.\n\nBut even on a tighter schedule, the aide said, the House should have plenty of time to finish legislative business. What will happen in the Senate is another matter.\n\nBefore Christmas, Ryan told the House\u2019s GOP caucus that Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., had promised to return to regular order on appropriations bills. The room, The Hill newspaper reported, erupted in laughter.\n\nSenate Democrats regularly have filibustered House-passed appropriations bills in the past. And it\u2019s not clear whether Reid will allow any of Ryan\u2019s bills to make it to the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cCongress absolutely has to return to regular order on appropriations and start working in the daylight,\u201d said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who sits on the Appropriations Committee.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for the minority leader to block open debate and amendments on the Senate floor,\u201c Lankford told The Daily Signal in a prepared statement. \u201cThe broken appropriations process needs to be fixed this year to end [continuing resolutions] and mega-omnibus bills.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House speaker wants Congress to spend your tax dollars through the regular process of 12 appropriations bills, not a massive one-and-done bill.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The House speaker wants Congress to spend your tax dollars through the regular process of 12 appropriations bills, not a massive one-and-done bill.", "title": "Paul Ryan Has a New Year's Resolution for the House", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160108_ApropsGoals.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-08T15:31:42+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1IUW2m2"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The House speaker wants Congress to spend your tax dollars through the regular process of 12 appropriations bills, not a massive one-and-done bill.", "title": "Paul Ryan Has a New Year's Resolution for the House", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160108_ApropsGoals.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "budget", "published_time": "2016-01-08T15:29:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T15:31:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Paul Ryan, Harry Reid, James Lankford, Nancy Pelosi, Omnibus, Regular Order, Appropriations"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd1b2\"", "article_summary": "House Speaker Paul Ryan has given Congress a New Year\u2019s resolution: Skip gigantic spending bills and return to the regular, piece-by-piece appropriations process.\nRyan calls it a \u201ccrap sandwich.\u201d\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be putting appropriations bills together this way,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican said late last year.\nBut picking out wasteful programs as the House evaluates 12 separate appropriations bills likely will be a lengthy process.\nStarting in 2016, he says, the 12 government appropriations bills will be considered one at a time.\nInstead of voting to fund individual agencies and programs one at a time, legislators bundle smaller appropriations bills into a single lump package."}
