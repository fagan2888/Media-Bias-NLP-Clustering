Republicans needed significant support from Democrats to pass the CR, 319-108. However, 53 Republicans and 55 Democrats voted against it, reports CNSNews.com. The bill will fund the government through December 11th during the “lame duck” session of Congress.

Among the Republican members of the House who voted against the resolution were Reps. Louis Gohmert (TX); Michele Bachmann (MN); Trey Gowdy (SC); John Fleming (LA); Jim Jordan (OH); Scott Garrett (NJ); Jim Bridenstine (OK); and Dana Rohrabacher (CA).

According to Planned Parenthood’s latest annual report, it performed 327,166 abortions in fiscal year 2011-2012 and received $540.6 million in funding from local, state, and federal governments in the year that ended on June 30, 2013.

Additionally, the GAO has just released a new report that states more than 1,000 Obamacare exchange plans include taxpayer-funded abortion coverage, a fact that confirms the provision in Obama’s health reform law requiring individuals to pay separately for abortion coverage is being widely ignored.

The continuing resolution placed no restriction on funding any provision or regulation of Obamacare, including the so-called “preventive services” regulation that requires individuals and families to purchase health insurance plans that cover contraceptives, sterilizations and abortifacient drugs regardless of their faith beliefs.

Regarding the continuing resolution bill, House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY) said, “This bill is free of controversial riders, maintains current levels, and does not seek to change existing federal policies.”
