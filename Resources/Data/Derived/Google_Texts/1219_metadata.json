Unfortunately, the present remains a nightmare as the Rockies continue to find new and confounding ways to lose.\n\nThe Brewers walked off with a 3-2 victory on a ninth-inning single by Ryan Braun off reliever Matt Belisle that scored Mark Reynolds, who had advanced to third base on a passed ball charged to catcher Michael Mc- Kenry earlier in the inning.\n\nColorado manager Walt Weiss had the option of having Belisle intentionally walk the dangerous Braun and pitch to Jonathan Lucroy. Weiss instead chose Braun, who promptly whistled Belisle\u2019s first-pitch, 92 mph fastball into center field for the game-winner.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those pick-your-poison situations,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI wanted to give (Belisle) a couple of pitches to see where we were at. I wasn\u2019t going to let (Braun) hit in a good hitter\u2019s count.\n\n\u201cI will always take responsibility for that one. It\u2019s not a great situation to be in, facing Braun or facing Lucroy, who is second in the league in hitting (at .330).\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado Rockies 2, Milwaukee Brewers 3 \u2013 June 27, 2014\n\nThat decision came after Josh Rutledge tied the game 2-2 in the top of the inning with a solo homer to left field off Milwaukee super closer Francisco Rodriguez. That\u2019s no easy feat. K-Rod had blown just two saves in 28 attempts coming in. Rutledge went 3-for-4 and came up a triple short of the cycle.\n\nThe Rockies lost for the 10th time in 11 games, despite getting six terrific innings from Matzek.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t win, so this is going to sting a little bit more,\u201d he said.\n\nAll of Matzek\u2019s good came undone when reliever Adam Ottavino hit Braun with the bases loaded to give the Brewers a 2-1 lead in the seventh.\n\nColorado\u2019s bullpen \u2014 burdened by a 4.56 ERA that\u2019s easily the worst in the National League \u2014 simply couldn\u2019t finish the job Matzek started. Right-hander Nick Masset arrived on the scene in the seventh and promptly gave up a double to Khris Davis and a walk to Reynolds. Jean Segura moved them into scoring position with a sacrifice bunt.\n\nLefty Rex Brothers relieved Masset and struck out Martin Maldonado, but then walked Rickie Weeks to load the bases. All of that led to Ottavino plunking Braun.\n\nMatzek, getting ahead of hitters and showing exceptional command, needed just 83 pitches (52 strikes) to steer through his six innings. He allowed a single run on five hits, walked zero and struck out three.\n\n\u201cHe was really good against an all-right-handed lineup that is very good,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging. Tyler is showing up very well. He\u2019s a guy who can help us moving forward here.\u201d\n\nAfter the Brewers scored in the bottom of the sixth, the Rockies tied the game 1-1 in the seventh off Milwaukee starter Kyle Lohse with a leadoff double by Corey Dickerson, a bloop single by Ryan Wheeler and a safety squeeze bunt down the first-base line by pinch-hitter Brandon Barnes to score Dickerson from third.\n\nColorado\u2019s offense couldn\u2019t generate much support for Matzek, going 2-for-9 with runners in scoring position.\n\nOne highlight: Troy Tulowitzki\u2019s double in the third inning was the 400th extra-base hit of his career.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nRockies\u2019 Jhoulys Chacin (1-6, 4.84 ERA) at Brewers\u2019 Matt Garza (4-5, 4.01)\n\n2:10 p.m. Saturday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nWins are just one measure of a starting pitcher\u2019s worth. But in the case of Chacin, it\u2019s a telling number. After 10 starts this year, he has only one victory and the Rockies are 2-8 in his starts. Chacin, who has a very good sinker when he commands it, has been leaving the ball up and over the plate \u2014 and that has hurt him. He has given up seven home runs already, in 57 \u2154 innings. Last year, when he went 14-10 and posted a 3.47 ERA, he served up only 11 homers in 197 \u2153 innings.\n\nSunday: Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (7-6, 4.78 ERA) at Brewers\u2019 Yovani Gallardo (5-4, 3.23), 12:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nMonday: Rockies\u2019 Yohan Flande (0-0, 7.20) at Nationals\u2019 Jordan Zimmermann (5-4, 2.95), 5:05 p.m., ROOT\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Christian Friedrich (0-2, 8.10) at Nationals\u2019 Stephen Strasburg (6-6, 3.70), 5:05 p.m., ROOT", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies lose to Brewers after Ryan Braun\u2019s game-winning single", "title": "Rockies lose to Brewers after Ryan Braun\u2019s game-winning single", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/27/rockies-lose-to-brewers-after-ryan-brauns-game-winning-single/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140627__rockies-breweres2p1.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140627__rockies-breweres2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-27T21:36:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:07:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe was really good against an all-right-handed lineup that is very good,\u201d Weiss said.\nUnfortunately, the present remains a nightmare as the Rockies continue to find new and confounding ways to lose.\nColorado manager Walt Weiss had the option of having Belisle intentionally walk the dangerous Braun and pitch to Jonathan Lucroy.\nWeiss instead chose Braun, who promptly whistled Belisle\u2019s first-pitch, 92 mph fastball into center field for the game-winner.\nMILWAUKEE \u2014 A glimpse into the future looked bright indeed for the Rockies on Friday night with rookie left-hander Tyler Matzek on the Miller Park mound."}
