CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) is the division of HHS that was largely responsible for hiring contractors to develop and run the federal government's Obamacare marketplace. The investigation ordered by Sebelius will center around the agency's work with contractors, because, the secretary wrote, \"HHS is the third largest federal contracting agency, and CMS alone spent $5.3 billion in 2013 on contracting engagements.\" Three actions were ordered by Sebelius, each involving the contracting process: Inspector General, Dan Levinson, is to \"review the acquisition process, overall program management, and contractor performance and payment issues related to the development and management of the HealthCare.gov website.\"\n\nA new position will be established, Chief Risk Officer, whose \"first assignment will be to review risk management practices when it comes to IT acquisition and contracting,\" and report back within sixty days.\n\nThe agency will \"update and expand CMS employee training on best practices for contractor and procurement management, rules and procedures.\" The timing of Sebelius's announcement is interesting since the Contracting with CMS Conference is to be held on January 31, 2014, which falls within the 60 day window set by Sebelius for the new Chief Risk Officer to report back to the secretary.
