Cascade County will receive $1.5 million in funding for its Community Health Care Center in Great Falls, U.S. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana announced Tuesday.

The funds have been awarded through the Community Health Center Fund, which was established by the Affordable Care Act, Tester said.

Leslie Southworth, CEO of the Cascade County Community Health Care Center, 115 4th St. S., said the money will be used for ongoing efforts to improve access to health care and serve the underserved in the community.

Tester, D-Mont., said in a news release that he has fought to protect and strengthen the American Care Act. He has introduced multiple bills to help ease the programâ€™s financial burden on small businesses, ensuring pregnant women have access to health care coverage and making sure it covers the costs of contraception, he said.
