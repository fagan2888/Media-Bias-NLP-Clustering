From there, the coal is moved by barge, railcar or truck to a storage facility in a remote part of Germany.\n\nWhen it comes time for the Air Force and Army to turn on the heat at a large military maintenance and repair installation in the small town of Kaiserslauntern in southwestern Germany, the utility there must burn only anthracite coal shipped 4,000 miles from Pennsylvania.\n\nRelated: A $10 Billion Missile Defense System Gets Added to \u2018Government Waste\u2019\n\nWhile less expensive foreign Bituminous Coal and other heating sources are readily available, a long-standing congressional earmark tucked away in the defense appropriations law requires the local utility in Germany to burn Pennsylvania coal along with other fuels. Cost to the taxpayers? About $1.5 million of the $17 million the U.S. pays annually to heat all U.S. military facilities in Kaiserlautern.\n\nSteve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, calls the congressionally mandated arrangement \u201cthe boondoggle that won\u2019t die,\u201d and indeed there is some mystery to why a provision dating back to the early 1960s that makes little economic or budgetary sense remains embedded in the federal government\u2019s spending laws.\n\nRelated: 5 Government Reforms That Could Save Billions\n\nThe congressional mandate can be found again this year in Section 8053 of the 164-page House defense appropriations bill for fiscal 2016 awaiting action. Although the congressional champions of this mandate \u2013 including the late Democratic Reps. Daniel Flood and John Murtha of Pennsylvania \u2013 have long passed from the scene, legislative inertia more than anything else seems to be keeping it alive.\n\n\u201cEven though the original supporters are no longer around, it\u2019s like on auto-pilot \u2013 it\u2019s always in there, so they just leave it,\u201d Ellis said in an interview.\n\nAnd while $1.5 million a year is a pittance compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars that the Pentagon spends each year, Ellis and other critics say the provision is a troubling testament to the staying power of wasteful government spending.\n\nDuring the peak of this policy, between 1962 and 1988, U.S. taxpayers spent more than $1.1 billion on additional heating costs because of the requirement that Pennsylvania coal be used overseas, according to one study.\n\nOn Thursday, Taxpayers for Common Sense awarded the House and Senate Appropriations Committees its \u201cGolden Fleece Award\u201d for helping to perpetuate this seemingly ridiculous policy.\n\nThe roots of the boondoggle date back to shortly after World War II, when a handful of Pennsylvania lawmakers saw an opportunity to try to prop up the dying coal industry in northeast Pennsylvania by forcing the Pentagon to use Pennsylvania-produced coal to heat some of the overseas military facilities. Anthracite, a hard, carbon-dense and more expensive variety of coal, was mined exclusively in Pennsylvania, and in the post-World War II period, miners were suffering from layoffs and loss of income.\n\nRelated: Ashton Carter: Americans Are Disgusted with Government Waste\n\nOver the years, the Pentagon tried to scale back the use of anthracite coal in favor of less expensive coal or alternative fuels. But Flood and Murtha, among others, used their influence on the House Appropriations Committee to preserve this carve-out in the defense spending bill.\n\nFlood left Congress in 1980 after pleading guilty to corruption charges and died in 1994. One of Flood\u2019s aides, Michael Clark, founded the Anthracite Industry Association and continued lobbying Congress to preserve the coal legislative language.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of the arch-culprits,\u201d Clark said half-jokingly in an interview on Friday describing his role in defending the program over the years. Clark represented the anthracite producers years ago but now represents Stadtwerke Kaiserslautern, the city-owned utility that is required to burn American anthracite in its Air Force heating contract.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that the program today is nothing like what it was in the 1960s when it started,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely different, and the difference started 15 to 16 years ago\u201d when the Defense Department began closing many of the scores of military installations in Germany and relied more on municipal energy systems for heat.\n\nClark offered a vigorous defense of the current program, saying that it \u201callows for U.S. anthracite to be part of the energy mix that serves the greater Kaiserslautern area\u201d \u2013 and in a way that has been shown to be \u201cboth fiscally sound and environmentally friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cExpanded use of other fuels would trigger costly and unnecessary retrofit of the cogeneration facility, in turn subsequently resulting in increased energy charges reflected in the military\u2019s ongoing heating bills,\u201d Clark said.\n\nRep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA) today represents Flood\u2019s old district. He first won election in 2012 running as an environmentalist.\n\nDuring a public hearing last year in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Cartwright conceded that the coal earmark was not ideal from an environmental standpoint but added that it was not likely to be changed anytime soon. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things in Washington that if you want to dislodge it, you have to well up a force of steam to get that done,\u201d he told National Public Radio. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any great groundswell of support to get rid of it at this point.\u201d\n\nThis story was revised June 16 to correct the cost to the U.S. of the congressional mandate.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Every year, 5,000 to 9,000 tons of coal mined from the rugged hills of Tamaqua in nort", "title": "The Political Boondoggle That Just Won\u2019t Die", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/08/20-Million-Political-Boondoggle-Just-Won-t-Die", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01012014_Coal_Mine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/08/20-Million-Political-Boondoggle-Just-Won-t-Die", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01012014_Coal_Mine.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Every year, 5,000 to 9,000 tons of coal mined from the rugged hills of Tamaqua in nort", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb532\"", "article_summary": "Related: Ashton Carter: Americans Are Disgusted with Government WasteOver the years, the Pentagon tried to scale back the use of anthracite coal in favor of less expensive coal or alternative fuels.\nAbout $1.5 million of the $17 million the U.S. pays annually to heat all U.S. military facilities in Kaiserlautern.\nOne of Flood\u2019s aides, Michael Clark, founded the Anthracite Industry Association and continued lobbying Congress to preserve the coal legislative language.\nRelated: 5 Government Reforms That Could Save BillionsThe congressional mandate can be found again this year in Section 8053 of the 164-page House defense appropriations bill for fiscal 2016 awaiting action.\nFrom there, the coal is moved by barge, railcar or truck to a storage facility in a remote part of Germany."}
