(AP) - When the Detroit Lions opened last season\u2019s training camp, the identity of their next placekicker was a mystery.\n\nA year later, there\u2019s no such concern.\n\nMatt Prater is back after signing with the franchise early last season, leaving one less thing for coach Jim Caldwell and his staff to worry about as Detroit seeks a second straight playoff berth.\n\n\u201cWe have guys that have experience and have done well,\u201d Caldwell said, \u201cso I feel good about that.\u201d\n\nThe nine-year veteran came to the Lions after being released by Denver, which ended its relationship with Prater as he returned from a four-game suspension under the NFL\u2019s substance abuse policy.\n\nPrater gave the Lions a seasoned kicker once again. The franchise had been spoiled by more than two decades of the reliable Jason Hanson.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice this year getting a lot of reps with (long snapper Don Muhlbach) and (punter) Sam (Martin), and I have more confidence coming in this year,\u201d Prater said after a training camp practice.\n\n\u201cLast year I only had 20 or so kicks with them and had to go out and play a game.\u201d\n\nPrater was open when he signed with Detroit about steps he took to combat a drinking problem that led to the suspension and his abrupt exit from Denver, where he set an NFL record with a 64-yard field goal in 2013.\n\nHe voluntarily went to a Florida rehab facility and discussed the matter with Caldwell and other team officials before the Lions offered him a contract.\n\nThough only 31, he\u2019ll likely have the luxury of focusing just on field goals again this season. Martin handled kickoffs last season, and though Prater will kick off during the preseason, it\u2019s likely the punter will reclaim the duty during the regular season.\n\n\u201cIf Sam is hitting them like he did last year, I don\u2019t see why we should make a change,\u201d Prater said. \u201cHe was second in the league in touchback percentage, so he\u2019s obviously a top kickoff guy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we shouldn\u2019t mess with.\u201d\n\nThe Lions play their second exhibition game Thursday night at Washington.\n\nNate Freese beat out Giorgio Tavecchio in camp to start last season, but was released after making three of seven field-goal attempts in the Lions\u2019 first three games. Alex Henery succeeded Freese, but was 1 for 5 in two games, including a late miss that cost Detroit against Buffalo.\n\n\u201cLast year, I thought we were in good shape,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cWe had a young kicker and then obviously once we got into competition, some things changed a little bit.\u201d\n\nThe franchise signed Prater in early October and he finished the season making 21 of 25 field goals.\n\nHe\u2019s still certain a 70-yarder - even outside of Denver\u2019s high altitude - isn\u2019t out of the question.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the right opportunity at the end of a game or before a half, why not attempt it? It\u2019s definitely doable,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the Detroit Lions opened last season's training camp, the identity of their next placekicker was a mystery.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "When the Detroit Lions opened last season\u2019s training camp, the identity of their next placekicker was a mystery.", "title": "Prater gives Lions stability in kicking game", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/19/prater-gives-lions-stability-in-kicking-game/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/19/1e654c0730508f257f0f6a706700dc18.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/19/1e654c0730508f257f0f6a706700dc18.jpg", "description": "When the Detroit Lions opened last season's training camp, the identity of their next placekicker was a mystery.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Prater gives Lions stability in kicking game"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce019\"", "article_summary": "ALLEN PARK, Mich.
