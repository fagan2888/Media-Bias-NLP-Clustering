Rick Scott and the Florida Cabinet on Tuesday decided to keep taking applications for state Insurance Commissioner.\n\nScott, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam agreed to extend the deadline to April 15. The next Cabinet meeting is April 26.\n\nScott and Atwater, however, first must agree on one candidate under state law. The Office of Insurance Regulation is in the Department of Financial Services, which Atwater heads as CFO.\n\nThe four did agree on another hire, unanimously picking current Department of Business and Professional Regulation deputy secretary Leon Biegalski to become the new executive director of the Department of Revenue.\n\nBiegalski, a lawyer, now will replace current DOR head Marshall Stranburg, who accepted a position as deputy executive director of the Multistate Tax Commission, an intergovernmental agency that works on uniformity in taxes among states. Stranburg\u2019s last day is Friday.\n\nFor the state\u2019s top insurance regulation job, however, it was evident neither candidate had a winning number of votes on the panel.\n\nBragg, the governor\u2019s favorite, had one significant stumble when Bondi asked him an Affordable Care Act question about navigators, or application counselors, who are supposed to help people get health insurance. Bragg had to admit he didn\u2019t know what Bondi was talking about.\n\nThe now-retired Bragg has had senior positions with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and mega-insurer Zurich. He also was director of the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.\n\nBragg was asked to explain news reports about old allegations that he misled investors in a flood insurance business venture in which he was involved.\n\nThe Palm Beach Post reported Monday that Bragg allegedly signed misleading documents that cost tens of millions of dollars to investors. The case was settled in 2003.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good but it\u2019s part of what we face as businessmen and leaders,\u201d Bragg told the panel. He explained that a subsidiary in the business, which issued stock in an initial public offering (IPO), didn\u2019t make the revenue it was expected to, and the stock price later fell.\n\n\u201cAny IPO, if their shares drop, get sued,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost money. I wasn\u2019t happy about it. But that\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nHager, a current Florida state representative who was Iowa\u2019s insurance commissioner, also runs a small business as an expert witness and insurance arbitrator. The Delray Beach Republican is vice chairman of the House Insurance and Banking Subcommittee.\n\n\u201cI believe I would be ready from Day 1,\u201d he said. \u201cI have experience leading \u2026 I\u2019m unafraid to lead and to take the heat.\u201d\n\nHager sold himself as a \u201cteam player,\u201d someone who\u2019s \u201creasonable and responsible\u201d and bringing \u201cvigor and decisiveness\u201d to the job. He stressed the importance of bringing in fresh blood to Florida\u2019s insurance market, but not at the cost of giving away the store in lax regulation.\n\n\u201cWe need to be ever vigilant, but also put the sign out that says \u2018Florida is open for business,'\u201d Hager said. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can do to make sure the market knows we want them here.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he added, \u201cthis is not a position to stand by and watch the world go by.\u201d\n\nChip Merlin, the namesake of Tampa\u2019s Merlin Law Group, didn\u2019t like either choice. The firm, which also includes former state Insurance Consumer Advocate Sean Shaw, has built a business out of representing people \u201cwhen insurance companies deny, delay or underpay property insurance claims.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolicyholders should breathe a short sigh of relief today, and then demand the new search include candidates willing to put consumers \u2013 not the insurance industry \u2013 first,\u201d Merlin said in a statement.\n\nBiegalski beat out three other contenders: DOR chief economist Robert McKee, retired DOR official James Evers and former Duval County Property Appraiser James Overton. He ran unsuccessfully for Jacksonville mayor last year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "With no clear winner between finalists\u00a0Jeffrey Bragg and Bill Hager, Gov.
