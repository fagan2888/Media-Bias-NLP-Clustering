Among these were \"continued presence of unsafe items accessible to psychiatric patients for potential harm which included plastic liners in trash cans, electrical cords and phone cords.\"\n\nPatients like the 37-year-old who hanged herself should been visited more frequently by staff based on their risks, which for her included previous suicide attempts.\n\nCMS gave Timberlawn until June 8 to submit a corrective action plan and a final inspection was set for early July -- but the hospital apparently flunked. On July 23, CMS notified Timberlawn that it was taking the rare step of shutting off funding, after finding that the hospital was still out of compliance with proper staffing and monitoring of patients.\n\nNurses left key patients in detox or with a suicide risk unattended, and the \"medical director failed to adequately monitor and evaluate the care provided to patients at the facility,\" CMS wrote in a report accessed by the Dallas Morning News.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nThe final survey also discovered that staff at Timberlawn falsified records at least once. As the Dallas Morning News reported, a patient swallowed a metal object and a supervisor asked a nurse to change medical notes to conceal certain details.\n\nFounded in 1999, Timberlawn is the oldest psychiatric hospital west of the Mississippi River and one of the largest in North Texas. King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based Universal Health Services acquired Timberlawn in 1996, but it didn't really start facing scrutiny for safety problems until 2009, according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\nCMS told the newspaper that other psychiatric hospitals in greater Dallas will be able to handle patients from Timberlawn.\n\nLast week, the Cochise Regional Hospital in Arizona also announced plans to close after CMS cut off Medicare funding over safety issues.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/timberlawn-mental-health-system-faces-closure-after-cms-finds-major-safety-problems", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/mental-health-feature_0.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Last December, a 37-year-old patient with dissociative disorder died after hanging herself with a bedsheet and closet doorknob, a suicide that could have been prevented if Timberlawn used best practices.", "title": "Timberlawn Mental Health System faces closure after CMS finds major safety problems"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/mental-health-feature_0.jpg"}, "description": "Last December, a 37-year-old patient with dissociative disorder died after hanging herself with a bedsheet and closet doorknob, a suicide that could have been prevented if Timberlawn used best practices.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Timberlawn Mental Health System faces closure after CMS finds major safety problems"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Timberlawn Mental Health System, for-profit psychiatric hospital in Dallas, is on the brink of closing, over the federal government's plan to cut funding over safety concerns.&#13; The a 144-bed hospital with another 72-bed unit at a nearby campus could shut down on Friday unless a last-minute lawsuit convinces a judge to delay the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' from pulling the plug on reimbursements.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb82a\"", "article_summary": "The Timberlawn Mental Health System, for-profit psychiatric hospital in Dallas, is on the brink of closing, over the federal government's plan to cut funding over safety concerns.\nFounded in 1999, Timberlawn is the oldest psychiatric hospital west of the Mississippi River and one of the largest in North Texas.\nIt wasn't until February that the doorknobs were replaced, but by then CMS had already found other problems, as a Dallas Morning News investigation found.\nCMS told the newspaper that other psychiatric hospitals in greater Dallas will be able to handle patients from Timberlawn.\nMedicare and Medicaid account for almost a third of Timberlawn's revenue, as the Dallas Morning News reported."}
