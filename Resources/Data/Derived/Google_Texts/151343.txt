Reid and Obama could have allowed Sen. Begich or his colleagues to take up any small handful of myriad bills passed by the House and to move them to conference. Senate Democrats could have then negotiated constructive settlements, and the president might have signed the final bills into law. Rather, Sen. Reid and the president showed no interest in working with the House. Had they done otherwise, Begich could have improved his standing with Alaska voters. He might have held up reform legislation that fixed admitted problems with the Affordable Care Act or Dodd-Frank, but instead he was left to defend his votes, and his opposition was able hang the problematic legislation around his neck. Finally, in his ill-advised public speech late in the campaign, Obama reminded midterm voters that every one of his policies were on the ballot in November. Though this sunk Begich, he arguably outperformed most other Democratic Senate candidates, who lost by larger margins or lost in states where Obama's approval rating was higher than in Alaska.
