The man charged with causing a crash that killed popular Oklahoma sports broadcaster Bob Barry Jr. took a plea deal Thursday afternoon.

Gustavo Gutierrez plead guilty to one count of causing an accident without a valid license resulting in death and one count of possession of cocaine. He was sentenced to five years for the first count and ten years for the cocaine charge. He will be serving the time concurrently and will receive time served.

The accident occurred back in June 2015, when Gustavo Gutierrez caused the crash when he made an illegal U-turn in front of Barry, who was thrown from his motorcycle crashing into Gutierrezâ€™s vehicle.
