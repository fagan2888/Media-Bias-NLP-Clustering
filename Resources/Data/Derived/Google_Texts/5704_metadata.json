I thought you had to be 70 to have a legacy.\"\n\nThat\u2019s news to President Obama.\n\nThis president has been obsessed with creating his legacy from an embarrassingly early age; who in the world writes two memoirs before the age of 45?\n\n[pullquote]\n\nMaybe someone who views himself as a historic figure, the kind of person who can slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet, for instance.\n\nThe kind of fellow who invites presidential historians to dine at the White House to make sure he\u2019s on script.\n\nObama\u2019s ambition and quest for legacy have cost the country dearly, as even liberal economist Alan Blinder admits in a new book, \"After the Music Stopped.\"\n\nIn his analysis of the financial crisis and its aftermath, Blinder asks: \u201cDid President Obama overextend himself\u2026and us?\u201d His answer: \u201can emphatic yes.\u201d\n\nBlinder thinks that because Obama set out to \u201ccauterize the bleeding financial system, to stimulate aggregate demand, to reform financial regulation, to transform healthcare delivery\u2026to devise a new climate/energy policy\u2026to reform America\u2019s K-12 education system, and much else...,\u201d the public tuned out. In Blinder\u2019s words, Americans \u201ccould not discern any forest, only lots of trees\u2026\u201d They never figured out what the president really stood for, or what his strategy was.\n\nTo be fair, Obama faced a massive economic meltdown when he took office; the stanching of the financial bloodletting was not a matter of choice.\n\nAlso, an overhaul of banking regulation was a given; the public wanted to see the financial companies hobbled and demanded new restrictions that would preclude another crisis.\n\nDodd-Frank will not prevent future bubbles, and the safeguards installed are in some cases absurd.\n\nStill, addressing the financial industry\u2019s role in the meltdown was mandatory.\n\nObamaCare, on the other hand, was a matter of choice. This was Obama\u2019s big policy breakthrough \u2013 something Hillary Clinton, after all, had failed to secure.\n\nSomething he had pledged to Ted Kennedy, one of Obama\u2019s earliest and most important backers.\n\nIf he could push through universal health care, a cause in which he had shown little interest earlier in his career, he would secure his place in the history books.\n\nBlinder thinks that the administration\u2019s failure to explain the complicated and expensive bank bailouts, and the programs designed to aid overextended homeowners, and the rescue of Detroit automakers \u2013 that anger at all these worthy but expensive programs caused the backlash in 2010 that delivered the House to the GOP.\n\nThose policies raised alarms, for sure, but what drove people to the voting booths that November was ObamaCare.\n\nEven at the beginning, Americans knew they were being scammed. They knew you couldn\u2019t provide free health care to 30 million people without someone picking up the rather large tab.\n\nAs prescient as voters were, though, they could not foresee the end result of turning one-sixth of the economy upside-down.\n\nNo one anticipated that ObamaCare would stop our recovery in its tracks.\n\nThat millions would remain out of work five years after the recession ended because small businesses were paralyzed by uncertainty, by not knowing what the cost of hiring would be, because the sand continually shifted under their feet.\n\nThat consumer confidence would swoon, and swoon again.\n\nThat green shoots would wither and die \u2013 not once, but year after year as the rules changed and business owners put off hiring.\n\nThis is the real legacy of Barack Obama. It is the increased incursion by the federal government into the private sector, and the worst recovery in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nFor sure, rampant automation has played a role in our disappointing employment; struggling companies laid off millions during the downturn and then discovered they could, with new gizmos aplenty, carry on without those employees as business began to revive. But a bigger part of the story is the molasses of ObamaCare poured on the sputtering recovery \u2013 the program that gummed up the works in historic fashion.\n\nBlinder reminds us that President Bill Clinton promised to \u201cfocus like a laser beam on the economy,\u201d and he argues that \u201cBarack Obama made no such defining declaration. And it hurt him.\u201d\n\nIt also hurt the country.\n\nHe notes that Obama, early on, decided to be a \u201ctransformational president\u2019 and try to do everything at once, leaving the public confused and the administration (and Congress) overburdened.\n\nBlinder excuses some of these errors as the work of a \u201crookie\u201d president who was naive and in over his head. I think that\u2019s generous.\n\nEven the devoted New York Times (before they became quite so devoted) entitled a 2007 profile of the aspiring politician, \u201cAmbition marked Obama\u2019s early career.\u201d\n\nLittle did they know that ambition would become his legacy, as well.\n\nLiz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.
