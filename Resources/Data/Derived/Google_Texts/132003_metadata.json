Contact cards are completed by police to collect information on the reason for the stop and demographic information such as the race and sex of the individual in question.\n\n\u201cThe problem right now is that nothing is searchable in terms of the contact cards that they keep track of, so we don\u2019t know how many times this is happening to people,\u201d Patel said.\n\nShe said New York City has successfully developed a system where contact card data is available to the public, and that Chicago needs a similar system.\n\n\u201cFrom the time that I was arrested and waiting for my trial, how many more people were arrested,\u201d Hernandez asked as he emphasized the importance of making stop and frisk data public information.\n\nTanue David, a youth organizer for Action Now who is African-American, said he too, experienced stop and frisk while waiting for a friend to answer the door at their Lincoln Park apartment.\n\n\u201cIn order to circumvent the problem, what I decided to do was change the way I dress. I got tired of being profiled, so I put the suit and tie on,\u201d David said.\n\nHe closed his remarks by calling on the Latino and African-American communities of Chicago to unite in order to hold law enforcement and other officials accountable for racially biased practices.\n\nLindsay Miller, staff attorney for ACLU Illinois said existing stop and frisk policies in Chicago lead to the \u201carrests and detention of thousands of young men of color on questionable grounds,\u201d adding that access to stop and frisk data is necessary so that the public has the information they need to assess the nature of these types of stops on our streets.\n\n\u201cPolice should be forced to answer two very simple questions: why is someone being stopped on the streets of Chicago, and why are they being searched by the police,\u201d Miller said.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department issued a statement shortly after the arrest in late March that said the two young men matched the exact descriptions of two individuals who were allegedly scamming elderly people the week before.\n\nOn April 28, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department will begin collecting data on stops, searches and arrests as part of a nationwide effort to reduce racial bias in the criminal justice system.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "uXx1maln2j-OmFEy-sOc0PAgVSDdhRocGQJsJ2FPnbA", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "Charges against outreach workers droppedCharges against two young Latino men who were arrested in late March while canvassing the Garfield Ridge neighborhood were dropped this afternoon in Cook County Criminal Court.\nThe two young men alongside a group of supporters, including Action Now, the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Illinois, rallied outside the courthouse before their trial.\n\u201cFrom the time that I was arrested and waiting for my trial, how many more people were arrested,\u201d Hernandez asked as he emphasized the importance of making stop and frisk data public information.\nShe said CPD does not make contact card data accessible to the public.\nShe said New York City has successfully developed a system where contact card data is available to the public, and that Chicago needs a similar system."}
