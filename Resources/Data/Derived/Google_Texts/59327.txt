WATCH: ISIS Uses Only Half Of A Quran Verse To Justify Beheadings — See What’s In The Other Half

"It just shows that they don’t know anything about Islam and they probably don’t know how to read this properly."



Rashid Khalidi, a professor of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, disputes that the Quran offers any justification for beheading. He cites the lines coming immediately after one of the two verses used to justify the act: “Therefore, when you meet the unbelievers, smite at their necks.” But the very next line, contained in Chapter 47, Verse 4: “At length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind the captives firmly. Therefore is the time for either generosity or ransom.” Share this article!
