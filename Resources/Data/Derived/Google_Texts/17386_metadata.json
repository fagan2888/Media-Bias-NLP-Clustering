Since that announcement, he said he's been flattered by those who have approached him with another idea.\n\n\"For some months now, a lot of colleagues and other citizens have been pressing me and I was saying no,\" Klassen said last week. \"I finally succumbed.\"\n\nThe dean of the current City Council and its Mayor Pro Tem, Klassen's history in local politics spans decades. He served eight years on the Larimer County Board of Commissioners, starting in 1985. It's that experience and background that Klassen believe give him the leadership skills necessary for the mayor's job.\n\nAnd Klassen said he is concerned about trends he has noticed in the city. As a councilor, and if he were elected mayor, it's all about three words: First things first.\n\n\"I'm seeing a trend in Loveland city government to be all things for everybody and in today's economic world, this is not possible,\" Klassen said.\n\nFor Klassen, the first things that he believes should be put first are jobs and economic vitality, which directly relate to police, fire, transportation, water, electricity and other essentials. Only after those are provided for should government start looking toward quality of life issues like parks and museums, he said.\n\nHe would aim to maintain a fiscally conservative approach in the city, and thinks holding the mayor's position could also be a \"grand exit\" to his political career. Klassen said he would only seek one term.\n\nKlassen is one of three contenders for the mayor's seat; he will face off against incumbent Mayor Cecil Gutierrez and Loveland resident Alexi Grewal.\n\nJessica Maher can be reached at 669-5050, ext. 516, or maherj@reporter-herald.com.
