Police say three people were arrested and accused of trying to kidnap a woman from a Fort Mill store parking lot on Thanksgiving Day.

According to the Fort Mill Police Department, a woman from the Washington DC area was walking in the parking lot of a Lowes Home Improvement store just before 4:30 p.m. when a man grabbed her. The woman was staying at the nearby Hampton Inn in the 1500 block of Carolina Place Drive.

That's when one of the men reportedly ran towards her, grabbed her by the arm, and pulled her towards the vehicle and the woods. Police say she was able to break free after being dragged for a short distance. In the struggle, her cellphone was taken from her.
