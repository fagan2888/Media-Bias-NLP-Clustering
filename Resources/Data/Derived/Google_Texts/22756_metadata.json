Lack of physical activity is, is says, acknowledged as one of the top four factors responsible for premature deaths and long term diseases.\n\nChairman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges Professor Dame Sue Bailey sailed:\n\n\u201cThis is about people and their doctors believing that the small effort involved is worth it because they are worth it.\n\n\u201cThere really is a miracle cure staring us in the face, one which too many patients and doctors have quite simply forgotten about.\n\n\u201cThis is about people and their doctors believing that the small effort involved is worth it because they are worth it. This needs to work across the life-course, from children to the very elderly.\u201d\n\nBut the advice was not welcomed everywhere, with Joyce Robins of Patient Concern saying, \u201cIt\u2019s none of GPs\u2019 business to be talking about patients\u2019 sex lives. I would take amiss at that and I\u2019m sure many others would too.\n\n\u201cThis is particularly true as nowadays most patients don\u2019t even know their family doctor.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "British Doctors Told to Prescribe Sex as Exercise", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "British Doctors Told to Prescribe Sex as Exercise", "title": "British Doctors Told to Prescribe Sex as Exercise - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Couple-in-Bed_AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/02/13/british-doctors-told-to-prescribe-sex-as-exercise/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "British Doctors Told to Prescribe Sex as Exercise", "creator": "@trixysanderson", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Couple-in-Bed_AP.jpg", "title": "British Doctors Told to Prescribe Sex as Exercise - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "NHS, sex,Breitbart London,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart London", "tag": "sex", "published_time": "2015-02-13T09:09:56-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart London"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcace8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere really is a miracle cure staring us in the face, one which too many patients and doctors have quite simply forgotten about.\n\u201cThis is about people and their doctors believing that the small effort involved is worth it because they are worth it.\nThe report says that fun activities are more likely to be sustained, suggesting many activities can be promoted including dog walking, dancing and even having sex.\nAnd worryingly, over 40 per cent of adults do not reach the minimum recommended level of 30 minutes of moderately intense exercise five times per week.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThere is, it says, a direct correlation between the increasingly sedentary lifestyle and conditions such as diabetes and obesity."}
