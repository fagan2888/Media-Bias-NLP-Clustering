The government also says they can avoid being fined if they simply hire a third party to provide the health insurance. If the Little Sisters don\u2019t comply with the mandate, they could be fined $4.5 million annually \u2014 \u201cabout a third of its budget,\u201d Fox News reports.\n\n\u201cThe president is right, freedom of religion is under threat, not only in the United States but increasingly around the world,\u201d Adam Cassandra, communications manager at Catholic organization Human Life International told The Daily Caller. \u201cUnfortunately, the actions of the Obama administration, especially in terms of the HHS mandate dealing with contraception and abortifacient drugs, its policy on abortion, and the administration\u2019s support for redefining marriage, have greatly contributed to the persecution of Christians, especially Catholics. The rights of religious minorities deserve protection, but the mainstream moral values of Christianity also need protection, especially from this administration, and should not be labeled as \u2018intolerant,\u2019 which only incites hatred and violence towards Christians.\u201d\n\nSupreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor put a stay on the administration enforcing the mandate while the matter is contested in the courts. A decision is expected by June.\n\nFollow Bedford on Twitter and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Christopher Bedford", "description": "Little Sisters of the Poor agree", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "In a speech during Thursday morning's National Prayer Breakfast, President Barack Obama acknowledged, \"It\u2019s also clear that around the world, freedom of religion is under threat.\"    \"No society can", "title": "Obama says \u2018freedom of religion is under threat\u2019 as Catholics sue administration", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/06/obama-says-freedom-of-religion-is-under-threat-as-catholics-sue-administration/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Obama-and-Sebelius-Reuters-e1391703249341.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Little Sisters of the Poor agree", "title": "Obama says \u2018freedom of religion is under threat\u2019 as Catholics sue administration Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/06/obama-says-freedom-of-religion-is-under-threat-as-catholics-sue-administration/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Obama-and-Sebelius-Reuters-e1391703249341.jpg"}, "creator": "@CBedfordDC", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-06 11:19:28", "sailthru.title": "Obama says 'freedom of religion is under threat' as Catholics sue administration", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,christopher-bedford", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "little sisters of the poor,obamacare,sonia sotomayor", "sailthru.description": "In a speech during Thursday morning's National Prayer Breakfast, President Barack Obama acknowledged, \"It\u2019s also clear that around the world, freedom of religion is under threat.\"    \"No society can", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Obama-and-Sebelius-Reuters-e1391703249341.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf712\"", "article_summary": "\u201cUnfortunately, the actions of the Obama administration, especially in terms of the HHS mandate dealing with contraception and abortifacient drugs, its policy on abortion, and the administration\u2019s support for redefining marriage, have greatly contributed to the persecution of Christians, especially Catholics.\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor, an organization run by Catholic nuns that provides assistance to the elderly poor, doesn\u2019t qualify for the Obama administration\u2019s exemption of \u201creligious organizations\u201d because they hire people of all religions.\nThe government also says they can avoid being fined if they simply hire a third party to provide the health insurance.\n\u201cThe president is right, freedom of religion is under threat, not only in the United States but increasingly around the world,\u201d Adam Cassandra, communications manager at Catholic organization Human Life International told The Daily Caller.\nIf the Little Sisters don\u2019t comply with the mandate, they could be fined $4.5 million annually \u2014 \u201cabout a third of its budget,\u201d Fox News reports."}
