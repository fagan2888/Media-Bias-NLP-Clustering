It\u2019s Hemingway\u2019s iceberg theory of writing, except enforced upon writers by anxious suits with money at stake. A watchful playthrough of Tomb Raider while interpreting Lara as having romantic feelings for the story\u2019s damsel in distress, Sam, works perfectly, with nothing in the game universe that contradicts it. (Though whether or not Lara\u2019s feelings are reciprocated is more open to interpretation.) The character of Aveline de Grandpre, protagonist of Assassin\u2019s Creed: Liberation, and with cameos in Assassin\u2019s Creed IV: Black Flag, is another example of an LGBT character whose orientation is there for the keen-eyed and open-minded to interpret. Aveline is the only playable assassin to eschew the gender-neutral robe and hood of the Assassins, instead donning a man\u2019s tricorne hat, shirt and trousers. Indeed, in the PlayStation-exclusive Aveline mission in Black Flag the soldiers chasing her repeatedly say such things as, \u201cHe\u2019s getting away!\u201d \u201cAfter that man!\u201d etc. Because the focus of the story is forced to be about something else, these LGBT characters are not defined only by their orientation. The developers must have been aware of this incorrect use of pronoun\u2014likely an artifact of the game\u2019s main campaign being centered on a man\u2014but they did not bother to correct it. It actually makes more sense like this. The soldiers would indeed think the figure they were seeing was a young man or boy, because Aveline is appareled as a man, literally from head to foot. If one finds the hidden audio log \u201cSubject 1 Interview\u201d in Black Flag, it is made clear that the person who is reliving this female ancestor\u2019s memories is, in fact, a man. The entire tenor of the interview Subject 1 has with the researcher in the audio log is thus about being transgender. Subject 1 describes at length his experiences reliving the memories of a woman, Aveline. When the researcher asks about a possible sexual liaison with a male acquaintance of Aveline\u2019s, Subject 1 replies: \u201cI never experienced her\u2026consummating anything. That would be \u2026 I think maybe she was confused.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By leaving protagonists&#39; preferences open to interpretation, video games like\u00a0Assassin\u2019s Creed and\u00a0Tomb Raider\u00a0have been including characters not defined by gender or sexuality.", "author": "Jagger Gravning", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "By leaving protagonists&#39; preferences open to interpretation, video games like\u00a0Assassin\u2019s Creed and\u00a0Tomb Raider\u00a0have been including characters not defined by gender or sexuality.", "title": "How Video Games Are Slowly, Quietly Introducing LGBT Heroes", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/asscreedlib_big/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/02/how-video-games-are-slowly-quietly-introducing-lgbt-heroes/284017/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95c0\"", "article_summary": "The character of Aveline de Grandpre, protagonist of Assassin\u2019s Creed: Liberation, and with cameos in Assassin\u2019s Creed IV: Black Flag, is another example of an LGBT character whose orientation is there for the keen-eyed and open-minded to interpret.\nIndeed, in the PlayStation-exclusive Aveline mission in Black Flag the soldiers chasing her repeatedly say such things as, \u201cHe\u2019s getting away!\u201d \u201cAfter that man!\u201d etc.\nBecause the focus of the story is forced to be about something else, these LGBT characters are not defined only by their orientation.\nPlease consider disabling it for our site, or supporting our work in one of these waysBy leaving protagonists' preferences open to interpretation, video games like Assassin\u2019s Creed and Tomb Raider have been including characters not defined by gender or sexuality.\nIt\u2019s Hemingway\u2019s iceberg theory of writing, except enforced upon writers by anxious suits with money at stake."}
