There is no drainage system on her block, so Ms. D\u00edaz, a 44-year-old single mother of four, is accustomed to heavy flooding on her street when it rains.\n\nAs she looks into buying private health insurance under the federal Affordable Care Act, which requires most people to obtain coverage in 2014, Ms. D\u00edaz is facing a new type of rejection:. She probably does not make enough money to qualify for tax credits to afford coverage through the federal health insurance marketplace.\n\nThousands of residents of Texas\u2019 colonias along the United States-Mexico border are in similar situations after falling into the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d created when Texas\u2019 Republican leadership declined to expand Medicaid eligibility for poor adults under the A.C.A., saying Medicaid was a broken system. Living in unincorporated subdivisions, where the uninsured rate is between 50 and 80 percent, colonia residents may be largely left with little hope of obtaining coverage.\n\nBut community-based organizations are working to educate residents on the federal law and walk them through the application process with the goal of helping them obtain a \u201chardship waiver\u201d to be exempted from having to buy health insurance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe help people go through the application process, even if we can figure out pretty quickly that they\u2019re in the gap,\u201d said Rachel Udow, the program director for Migrant Health Promotion, a Weslaco-based group with six full-time navigators charged with helping individuals sign up for health insurance through the federal marketplace. \u201cBecause at the end, they\u2019ll receive the determination that essentially says they\u2019re in the gap, which they\u2019ll then be able to use to access the waiver.\u201d\n\nThe hardship waiver exempts those living in the coverage gap \u2014 individuals who make less than $11,490 a year or a family of four making less than $23,550 \u2014 from paying a penalty when they file their 2014 taxes.\n\nWhile some navigators have been surprised that several colonia residents have completed the application process and enrolled in the marketplace, the gap keeps many colonia residents from continuing the process after they realize they cannot afford full-price premiums, which can cost hundreds of dollars a month without tax credits, Ms. Udow said.\n\nColonia residents, who are predominantly Hispanic migrants, are among the minorities who make up three-quarters of uninsured adults in the state\u2019s coverage gap. But with more than 384,700 people living in Texas\u2019 colonias, which are in 10 border counties, outreach seems to be a bigger problem.\n\nSome colonia residents say they have never heard of the Affordable Care Act, although they live in areas that could benefit most from increased access to health insurance. The colonias, which were first established in the 1950s, have been known to be a breeding ground for disease because they often have no running water, adequate sewage systems or solid waste disposal, among other basic infrastructure.\n\nTo increase awareness, organizations like La Uni\u00f3n del Pueblo Entero, a nonprofit community union, hold public seminars and enrollment events, where staff members provide colonia residents information about the federal health reform law and navigator referrals.\n\nAnn Carol Cass, executive director of Proyecto Azteca, a nonprofit affordable-housing organization in the Rio Grande Valley, said the organization referred residents to navigators and helped with enrollment efforts but added that being uninsured was a situation to which colonia residents were accustomed.\n\n\u201cThey have never had health insurance, so to be left out doesn\u2019t change much in their lives,\u201d Ms. Cass said. \u201cI call it learned helplessness, after so many years of being exploited and excluded. It\u2019s just the way life is for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140222224641, "twitter": {"description": "Because Texas declined to expand Medicaid eligibility for poor adults, thousands of people, especially in the state\u2019s impoverished colonias, are finding it almost impossible to obtain health insurance.", "title": "Trying to Help Thousands in Colonias Obtain Health Coverage", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/us/trying-to-help-thousands-in-colonias-obtain-health-coverage.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002727679"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/23/us/23ttColonias/23ttColonias-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/us/trying-to-help-thousands-in-colonias-obtain-health-coverage.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002727679", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/us/trying-to-help-thousands-in-colonias-obtain-health-coverage.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Trying to Help Thousands in Colonias Obtain Health Coverage", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 22, 2014", "edt": "AddTexas", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Texas,Minorities,Poverty", "news_keywords": "Texas,Minorities,Poverty", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Alexa Ura", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/23/us/23ttColonias/23ttColonias-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ALEXA URA", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Because Texas declined to expand Medicaid eligibility for poor adults, thousands of people, especially in the state\u2019s impoverished colonias, are finding it almost impossible to obtain health insurance.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/23/us/23ttColonias/23ttColonias-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Because Texas declined to expand Medicaid eligibility for poor adults, thousands of people, especially in the state\u2019s impoverished colonias, are finding it almost impossible to obtain health insurance.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 22, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-02-23", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Poverty", "published": "2014-02-22", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Texas", "slug": "23ttcolonias", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140223014603, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/us/trying-to-help-thousands-in-colonias-obtain-health-coverage.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/23/us/23ttColonias/23ttColonias-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Because Texas declined to expand Medicaid eligibility for poor adults, thousands of people, especially in the state\u2019s impoverished colonias, are finding it almost impossible to obtain health insurance.", "title": "Trying to Help Thousands in Colonias Obtain Health Coverage"}, "pdate": 20140222, "des": "Poverty", "articleid": 100000002727679, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Trying to Help Thousands in Colonias Obtain Health Coverage", "col": "The Texas Tribune", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "She probably does not make enough money to qualify for tax credits to afford coverage through the federal health insurance marketplace.\nColonia residents, who are predominantly Hispanic migrants, are among the minorities who make up three-quarters of uninsured adults in the state\u2019s coverage gap.\n\u201cThey have never had health insurance, so to be left out doesn\u2019t change much in their lives,\u201d Ms. Cass said.\nAs she looks into buying private health insurance under the federal Affordable Care Act, which requires most people to obtain coverage in 2014, Ms. D\u00edaz is facing a new type of rejection:.\nSome colonia residents say they have never heard of the Affordable Care Act, although they live in areas that could benefit most from increased access to health insurance."}
