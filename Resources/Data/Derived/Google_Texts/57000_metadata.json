The House voted to increase sanctions last July. And it was sanctions, and the threat of increased sanctions, that surely drove Iran\u2019s leaders to the negotiating table where they hammered out an interim agreement with Secretary of State John Kerry in Geneva in November.\n\nThat agreement, however, left members of Congress of both parties \u2014 and the public \u2014 dissatisfied. For the first time the U.S. recognized, tacitly, Iran\u2019s right to continue possessing the centrifuges used to enrich uranium up to the levels needed to produce a nuclear bomb.\n\nIt does not take much time or effort to increase the level of enrichment from current to bomb-ready levels.\n\nThe agreement leaves a final agreement to be negotiated in six months. But that six-month period begins only when some still-unsettled issues are agreed on.\n\nSo Iran has more than six months, as things currently stand, to advance its nuclear program \u2014 during which time sanctions will be softened and economic pressure on the mullah regime will be reduced.\n\nThe public, which tended to give Barack Obama and his foreign policy positive marks during his first term, has tended to oppose Kerry\u2019s Iran agreement, polls show. Evidently many ordinary citizens who don\u2019t follow issues closely share the fear of many well-informed members of Congress that the United States is giving up too much and gaining too little.\n\nThe sponsors of the Senate sanctions legislation include leading Democrats, like Foreign Relations chairman Bob Menendez and New York\u2019s Charles Schumer, who has been something of a consigliere for Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nSix of the 13 Democratic co-sponsors are up for reelection in 2014, as are four of the 13 Republicans (another Republican is retiring).\n\nThe top Republican is Illinois\u2019s Mark Kirk, a consistent leader on the issue. He is joined with John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Kelly Ayotte, who work together on many foreign-policy issues, and prominent freshmen Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.\n\nThe Senate bill would impose increased sanctions six months after the Geneva agreement goes into effect unless Iran agreed to certain specified conditions. Top House leaders, including Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Ed Royce and ranking Democrat Eliot Engel, seem ready to pass similar or identical legislation.\n\nBackers argue that it would give administration negotiators leverage on Iran to gain agreement on objectives the president has often said he seeks.\n\nThe administration doesn\u2019t agree. White House press secretary Jay Carney said flatly last week that the president would veto the bill. Administration lobbyists have been beseeching Democrats not to back it.\n\nTheir arguments don\u2019t track with their stated objectives. They say they fear that Iran will walk out of negotiations if more sanctions are threatened. But tough sanctions are what brought them to the table.\n\nThey say new sanctions could be passed later. But the Senate bill doesn\u2019t put them into effect until later.\n\nThey argue that Iran won\u2019t ever agree to end uranium enrichment. But the whole point of sanctions is to get the mullah regime to do something it doesn\u2019t want to do. If getting to yes were the only objective, we might as well just accept a nuclear-armed Iran.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that the sanctions bill will ever get to the floor of the Senate. Even high-caliber sponsors such as Menendez and Schumer may be less persuasive with Harry Reid than calls from the White House.\n\nBut it is clear that there are majorities \u2014 solid bipartisan majorities \u2014 in both houses for additional pressure on Iran and for insistence on a final agreement that ends the threat of Iranian nukes rather than one that puts it off for another day.\n\nIn this regard Congress seems to be reflecting the will of the American people.
