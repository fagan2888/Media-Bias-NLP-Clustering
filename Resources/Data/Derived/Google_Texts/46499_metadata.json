She was a principal author of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and she worked for human rights for 50 years, from the teens of the last century until her death in the 1960s. She was the niece of a Republican president (TR) and the wife of a Democratic president (FDR), but is now remembered as being above politics.\n\nA plain child, she was nicknamed \u201cGranny\u201d by her own rather unthinking mother. The face of Eleanor Roosevelt on our money will make the statement that women are honored for their accomplishments instead of attractiveness.\n\nKathryn Christenson, St. Peter, Minn.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nI am acrimonious regarding the decision to remove Alexander Hamilton from our currency. As first secretary of the Treasury and creator of our monetary system, who better than Hamilton should have a presence on our money? In addition to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, Hamilton should have a permanent legacy on our cash. Lesser notables like Jackson, Grant and Franklin could be deleted. In fact, as long as the Treasury Department is willing to replace certain notables on our currency, perhaps it is time to add James Madison, principal author of our Constitution, to our money.\n\nHoward W. Schwartz, Golden Valley\n\nMETRO TRANSIT\n\nHere\u2019s one of those moments that inspires gratitude\n\nI witnessed an act of heroism Wednesday while riding light rail. I didn\u2019t actually see it \u2014 I felt it. I felt the headlong sensation of intense and sudden braking. I heard the shouts of the conductor in the cab as she reacted to the situation. And, thankfully, I then also saw the wide-eyed expression of a jogger who had almost been hit by the train. He stood a few feet away, his chest heaving, staring in disbelief. He was still wearing his headphones.\n\nI wish this incident were out of the ordinary. However, I\u2019ve been inattentive myself at times, and I\u2019ve seen close calls like a pedestrian assessing one-way car traffic, then stepping into an active bus lane going the opposite way. Thank you, Madam Green Line Conductor, whoever you are. Thank you for being attentive, acting swiftly and probably saving a jogger\u2019s life. All of our Metro Transit drivers deserve enormous credit. They surely face and avert these dangers every single day. These are the stories we don\u2019t hear about in the news but that make our drivers heroes in my eyes. It is indeed a privilege to ride on Metro Transit.\n\nNina Ebbighausen, Minneapolis\n\nTHE SUPREME COURT\n\nThis year\u2019s \u2018sensational\u2019 cases are really just part of the process\n\nTwo Supreme Court cases \u2014 on the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage \u2014 and \u201ctwo sensational rulings\u201d forthcoming, according to D.J. Tice (\u201cTwo key court cases, two occasions for restraint,\u201d June 14). Not likely \u2014 they\u2019ll both be written in dry legalese, and a search for drama will leave one unsatisfied. Two \u201cjudicial power plays\u201d are in the works, Tice writes. Not really \u2014 just two cases progressing through the system, not unlike thousands of others.\n\nWhat do the rhetorical flourishes add to reasoned discussion of complex issues? The court \u201cis not to decide what policy should be,\u201d so let\u2019s revisit Brown vs. Board of Education. Nobody supposed then that the definition of \u201cpersons\u201d guaranteed that equal protection of the laws would come to include corporations, but it came about.\n\nJohn Ammerman, St. Louis Park\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE\n\nDeal proponents like Editorial Board lack evidence in support\n\nIn the June 17 lead editorial (\u201cU.S. prestige at stake in free-trade battles\u201d), the Star Tribune Editorial Board claims that the TPP and T-TIP trade agreements would enhance the U.S. economy. With a current U.S. trade deficit of $500 billion per year, five times what it was when NAFTA was enacted 20 years ago, there is zero evidence that the claim is true. The board cites a letter from 17 former secretaries of defense and retired military leaders as backing fast-track authority for these agreements. It\u2019s almost certain that their only interest is funding the military-industrial gravy train on which, one suspects, they are all now comfortably riding.\n\nWorst of all, the board fails to mention the pending TiSA trade-in-services agreement, the most toxic of the trade trio. That one will ensure that no signatory nation can ever effectively regulate its country\u2019s financial services. After a worldwide financial catastrophe from which we have not yet recovered, and with weekly news reports that the 10 largest banks in the world are recidivist criminal enterprises, what could possibly go wrong?\n\nWilliam Beyer, St. Louis Park\n\nMEDICAL TESTS\n\nWhy cardiovascular screening matters, even without symptoms\n\nDr. Hanna Bloomfield, in her June 18 commentary \u201cDon\u2019t be lured into unnecessary tests,\u201d has expressed a commonly held misunderstanding that opposes the need for cardiovascular screening in asymptomatic adults. I\u2019m sure she advocates for routine colonoscopy and mammograms to detect possible signs of early cancer, even though far more men and women will die or be disabled by cardiovascular disease than by these cancers.\n\nThe problem is the difference between cardiovascular disease and cancer. Cancer usually begins in a single site, and its detection and removal may eliminate the problem. Most cardiovascular disease results from a widespread process in the arteries called atherosclerosis. The detection processes that Dr. Bloomfield impugns identify single sites of a generalized process for which localized treatment, especially if the lesions are asymptomatic, will not alter prognosis.\n\nThe importance of screening is not to aim treatment at a localized site but to inform therapy aimed at the generalized process. Lifestyle changes may be modestly effective, but the most important strategy is the administration of drugs that profoundly slow or even reverse the atherosclerotic process. Appropriate screening, which we perform with a series of noninvasive tests at the Rasmussen Center at the University of Minnesota, identifies the early disease in need of drug treatment that can slow its progression and lead to a long, asymptomatic life.\n\nDr. Bloomfield needs to know that even \u201cas a woman who never smoked and who has no symptoms,\u201d for her atherosclerosis may be progressing and a future heart attack or stroke may be lurking. Individualized screening and targeted drug treatment is the right strategy.\n\nDr. Jay N. Cohn, Minneapolis\n\nThe writer is a professor of medicine and director of the Rasmussen Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at the University of Minnesota.\n\nFOOTBALL STADIUMS\n\nHere\u2019s how to distinguish the two fiduciary nomenclatures\n\nHow to differentiate one \u201cBank\u201d stadium from the other? It\u2019s obvious to anyone who attended the University of Minnesota in the last 50 years: \u201cEast Bank\u201d and \u201cWest Bank.\u201d\n\nDavid Craig Smith, Minneapolis\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nIf the Vikings could persuade U.S. Bank to spend $220 million just to have its name on the new stadium, couldn\u2019t they have found someone to chip in the measly $1 million for bird-friendly glass?\n\nSteven White, Minneapolis", "article_metadata": {"description": "One reader supports Eleanor Roosevelt as the new face on the $10 bill.
