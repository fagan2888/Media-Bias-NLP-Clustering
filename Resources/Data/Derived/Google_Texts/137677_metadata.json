Tennessee banned same-sex marriage in 1996, and, in 2006, easily passed a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Trauger stayed her decision in May pending appellate rulings.\n\nThe case was one of a group of appeals from Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky challenging various aspects of those states' laws against same-sex marriages heard by a three-judge panel in Cincinnati, Ohio; sitting on the panel were Judge Deborah L. Cook, appointed by President George W. Bush, Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey, appointed by President Bill Clinton, and Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton, another Bush appointee.\n\nWorth listening\n\nListening to the oral arguments (http://player.piksel.com/p/w70z36r9) is enlightening both for understanding how arcane the legal process can seem, but also for hearing how human it is.\n\nTennessee's argument is the essence of arcane, asking the court to rule in favor of the constitutionality of its law on a \"rational review basis.\"\n\n\"No one can deny that marriage has other aspects,\" Whalen told the court, \"... but they are not the reasons the Supreme Court identified it as a fundamental right.\"\n\nWhalen argued that the state has a legitimate interest in making sure that children in Tennessee, whether created on purpose or accidentally, grow up in a stable household and that its laws defined a stable household as one where one man and one woman were married (presumably to each other, but I couldn't hear whether he made that distinction). \"There is nothing at all irrational about this connection,\" he said.\n\nHe said that the plaintiffs could argue that same sex marriages may provide stability and they \"ought to be recognized,\" but those arguments are irrelevant under a \"rational basis review\" of the law.\n\nHe argued that Tennessee has the right to proceed on a \"step basis\" to ensure its interest in stable families for children. The first step in furthering the state's interest, he said, is legally promoting one man-one woman marriages.\n\nWhalen did not comment in his argument what step two might be.\n\nA stark illustration of \"step two\" was sitting in the courtroom, listening to the oral arguments. Among the plaintiffs were several lesbian couples, each with their newborn children, a story in The New York Times reported.\n\nTanco and Jesky, both of whom had moved to Knoxville to teach at the University of Tennessee veterinary school, had a daughter in April, during the month-long period before Trauger stayed her decision. Jesky is listed as a parent on the birth certificate.\n\nProcreation and stable families\n\nI don't know how these judges do it. Listening to \"rational\" legal arguments that have little factual rational basis would drive me crazy.\n\nWe all know that Tennesse's law is about a rigid view of religious morality. And the law is one that is cloaked in legal illogic to preserve the state's ability to defend its will against constitutional challenge from those who think or live differently\n\nIf what we really wanted was for children to grow up in safe, stable and healthy families, we would welcome gay marriage. Nope, we want something different, and we are willing to subvert our legal system to make it happen.\n\nReach Frank Daniels III at 615-881-7039, or @fdanielsiii.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/frank-daniels/2014/08/07/rational-basis-marriage-discrimination/13727223/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Tennessee argues that its laws banning gay marriage should be upheld in a rational review by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Tennessee argues that its laws banning gay marriage should be upheld in a rational review by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.", "title": "The 'rational basis' of marriage discrimination", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/frank-daniels/2014/08/07/rational-basis-marriage-discrimination/13727223/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tennessee argues that its laws banning gay marriage should be upheld in a rational review by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.", "title": "The 'rational basis' of marriage discrimination", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9a16529f119701669b9708211a596ce10bb24e3c/c=0-145-2455-2600&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/07/frankdanielscrop.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/George W.
