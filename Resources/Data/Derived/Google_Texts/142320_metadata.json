Businesses with 50 or more full-time employees will need to provide heathcare for those employees or face a penalty by 2015.\n\nThe National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) wanted to learn what impact the Affordable Care Act (PDF), a.k.a. Obamacare, would have on costs associated with that insurance. The answer, according to a survey conducted by the NFIB this summer, is none at all so far.\n\nThe survey (PDF) included a total of 921 small businesses around the country with between 2 and 200 employees, NFIB officials said. The NFIB says 64 percent of these businesses paid more in premiums per employee this year than in 2012.\n\nThe survey is part of a three year study intended to map the impact of the Affordable Care Act on small businesses. Commenting in an official release, NFIB Research Foundation senior fellow and study author William J. Dennis explained:\n\nThe law\u2019s authors were primarily focused on increasing insurance coverage and expanding benefits\u2014they gave little or no consideration to concerns about cost or who would foot the bill. Ironically, had they instead made reducing costs a priority, this would have been a natural incentive for increasing coverage.\n\nThe NFIB has advocated a delay in the individual mandate of the law for at least a year. The organization also seeks relief on what it says are the more onerous aspects of the employer mandate set to go into effect in 2015.\n\nFor example, Dennis estimates about 150,000 small businesses in the U.S. will be impacted by the so-called aggregation aspect of the employer mandate.\n\nDennis says federal officials can count all the employees in multiple businesses operated by a single owner when determining whether that owner falls under the mandate.\n\nThe NFIB also wants to see the definition of a full-time employee in the law changed. The law currently defines a full-time employee as one who works 30 hours a week instead of the 40 hour a week definition they say has been the standard in most industries.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Obamacare survey of small businesses by the NFIB indicates that 64 percent said they paid more in premiums per employee this year than in 2012.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Small Business Trends", "description": "An Obamacare survey of small businesses by the NFIB indicates that 64 percent said they paid more in premiums per employee this year than in 2012.", "title": "Obamacare Survey: Small Businesses Still See High Medical Costs", "url": "http://smallbiztrends.com/2013/11/obamacare-survey-small-businesses-medical-costs.html", "image": {"width": 795, "identifier": "http://smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/obamacare-infographic2.gif", "height": 679}, "updated_time": "2013-11-03T18:01:08-04:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "[Click for full image] Most U.S. citizens will need to sign up for healthcare by 2014.
