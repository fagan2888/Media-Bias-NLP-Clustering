The proud native son, who had to move to Denver because of work, adores his hometown and its greatest assets \u2013- food, music, culture and football prospects.\n\nManning himself is the greatest football product to ever come out of New Orleans, the city that annually churns out NFL studs. But Peyton himself can attest that Leonard Fournette of St. Augustine is prodigious. Manning got a text this fall from his brother Cooper, who told the Broncos quarterback to turn on ESPN to see greatness.\n\n\u201cIt was big game between St. Augustine and John Curtis, who have always been powerhouses in New Orleans,\u201d Manning said. \u201cSo I was home on a Friday night, turned the game on and he\u2019s an impressive linebacker \u2013- and, oh by the way, he\u2019s also the top-rated running back, as well. He\u2019s some kind of athlete. And I haven\u2019t had a chance to meet him, but watching the game that he had against John Curtis, one of the best programs in the country, that kind of told me everything I needed to know about how good of a player he is\u201d\n\nFournette ran for 255 yards that night. It\u2019s arguable he\u2019s the best prospect out of New Orleans since Peyton Manning himself. ESPN asked the question if he was the next Adrian Peterson. The guy is considering LSU and Alabama. Lil Wayne tweeted \u201cLeonard Fournette is the truth!\u201d\n\nAfter Fournette\u2019s junior season, he won the Gatorade Louisiana Football Player of the Year in 2012 \u2014 the only junior ever to earn the honor. My good buddy Jeff Duncan, the columnist for NOLA.com, wrote this big piece on Fournette, pointing out that he won the state\u2019s 100-meter dash title in a time of 10.68 seconds. And Duncan also included this tidbit:\n\nTom Luginbill is a former college quarterback who makes his living evaluating high school football stars for ESPN. In his tenure as ESPN\u2019s national recruiting director, Luginbill and staff have awarded three players with grades as high 95 on their 1-100 scale: Da\u2019Quan Bowers and Julio Jones in 2008; and Jadaveon Clowney in 2010.\n\nFournette, along with classmates Jabrill Peppers, a cornerback from Peramus, N.J., and Cameron Robinson, an offensive tackle from West Monroe, also received 95 grades.\n\nBenjamin Hochman, Denver Post columnist: bhochman@denverpost.com or @hochman", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Adrian Peterson,Cooper Manning,Eli Manning,Leonard Fournette,Lil Wayne,Peyton Manning", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "It\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds arguable that Leonard Fournette is the best prospect out of New Orleans since Peyton Manning.", "title": "The Peyton Manning of RBs?
