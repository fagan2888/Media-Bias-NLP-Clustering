Truman said. \u201cThe papers may circulate around the Government for a while but they finally reach this desk. And then, there\u2019s no place else for them to go. The President \u2014 whoever he is \u2014 has to decide. He can\u2019t pass the buck to anybody. No one else can do the deciding for him. That\u2019s his job.\u201d\n\nTruman made that statement during his farewell address on Jan. 15, 1953. During most of his presidency, Truman had a sign on his desk that read \u201cThe Buck Stops Here.\u201d\n\nTruman recognized that ultimately the decisions made by his administration rested with him, and that he was ultimately responsible for them.\n\nApparently President Barack Obama is not aware of what his job actually entails. Just a hint, it is not playing golf.\n\nThroughout the course of his administration, Obama has passed the buck when scandal and problems rock his administration rather than standing up and taking responsibility for what happened.\n\nEither Obama is lying and he does know what is going on within his administration or he has abdicated his responsibilities and is an absentee president.\n\nEither way, this is a problem. The president should not be chronically and blatantly lying to the American people, nor should he abdicate his responsibilities as president of the United States.\n\nFurthermore, Obama is the chief executive of his administration. He needs to step up and be a leader. There is no excuse and no justification that absolves Obama from being unaware of what is happening within his administration.\n\nDuring Obama\u2019s reign, he claimed ignorance when it was revealed that the IRS had been targeting conservative groups since 2010.\n\nFurthermore, he claimed that the first time he heard about it was when the media first started reporting on the issue.\n\nWhen the media broke the news that the Department of Justice was spying on reporters and the media, a blatant violation of the First Amendment right of the freedom of the press, Obama claimed to know nothing.\n\nWhen the Obamacare website crashed on day one of the health insurance exchange sign-up, Obama claimed he was \u201cunaware\u201d that there were problems.\n\nMexican drug lords receive guns from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Obama claims he was unaware that this was occurring.\n\nThe NSA is spying on at least 35 world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Obama is clueless.\n\nWhen Americans started receiving notices that their insurance policy was being canceled because of Obamacare, Obama was ignorant.\n\nObama needs to be held accountable. Americans need to stop refusing to take action because they feel their actions are fruitless. We need to stand up across this country and demand that Obama be held accountable for the problems in his administration.\n\nThe number of issues and scandals that have rocked the Obama administration would have brought down any previous president.\n\nObama should be held to the same standard as every previous president. He has failed to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States as he swore an oath to do on Jan. 20, 2009, and Jan. 20 and 21, 2013.\n\nIt is time that America cleans house throughout the entire Obama administration beginning at the top and going all the way down to the lowest levels of the executive branch until the most corrupt and scandalous administration has been cleaned up and brought to justice.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://baylorlariat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/NaiveObama.jpg.jpeg"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://baylorlariat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cropped-11951174_10153541805483608_7798064881498409967_n-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "webmaster"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf877\"", "article_summary": "The number of issues and scandals that have rocked the Obama administration would have brought down any previous president.\nWhen the Obamacare website crashed on day one of the health insurance exchange sign-up, Obama claimed he was \u201cunaware\u201d that there were problems.\nThe NSA is spying on at least 35 world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Obama is clueless.\nThroughout the course of his administration, Obama has passed the buck when scandal and problems rock his administration rather than standing up and taking responsibility for what happened.\nWe need to stand up across this country and demand that Obama be held accountable for the problems in his administration."}
