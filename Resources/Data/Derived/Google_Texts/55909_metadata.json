For the month of December 2015 they report:\n\nFor the globe and the southern hemisphere, December 2015 was the warmest December in the satellite temperature dataset. It was the second warmest December in the northern hemisphere, and the third warmest in the tropics. ...\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o Pacific Ocean warming event continued to push temperatures to record highs in December, putting a record end to the third warmest year in the satellite temperature dataset, said Dr. John Christy, director of the Earth System Science Center at The University of Alabama in Huntsville. 2015 finished with an average temperature that was 0.27 C (about 0.49 degrees F) warmer than the 30-year norm. The warmest year on record is 1998, when the annual average temperature was 0.48 C (about 0.86 degrees F) warmer than normal. The five warmest years in the satellite temperature record are:\n\n1998 +0.48 C\n\n2010 +0.34 C\n\n2015 +0.27 C\n\n2002 +0.21 C\n\n2005 +0.20 C\n\nOcean temperatures related to the El Ni\u00f1o Pacific Ocean warming event are falling, which in the short term should mean temperatures in the atmosphere will continue to rise: The eastern central Pacific cools as it releases heat into the atmosphere. There is a lag between the two, so the atmosphere should continue to see El Ni\u00f1o-influenced high (even record high) temperatures for the next several months. This is a pattern seen in most of the El Ni\u00f1o events during the past several decades.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Global Temperature Trend Update December 2015", "title": "Hottest December in Satellite Record: Global Temperature Trend Update", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2016/01/07/hottest-december-in-satellite-record-glo", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14521202538167.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14521202538167.jpg", "description": "Global Temperature Trend Update December 2015", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hottest December in Satellite Record: Global Temperature Trend Update"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Science", "published_time": "2016-01-07T15:03:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ronald-bailey"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "This is a pattern seen in most of the El Ni\u00f1o events during the past several decades.\nFor the month of December 2015 they report:For the globe and the southern hemisphere, December 2015 was the warmest December in the satellite temperature dataset.\nEvery month University of Alabama in Huntsville climatologists John Christy and Roy Spencer publish the latest global temperature trend data obtained from NOAA satellites.\nThe warmest year on record is 1998, when the annual average temperature was 0.48 C (about 0.86 degrees F) warmer than normal.\n2015 finished with an average temperature that was 0.27 C (about 0.49 degrees F) warmer than the 30-year norm."}
