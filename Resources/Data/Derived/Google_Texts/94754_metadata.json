The states are supposed to be equal partners with the federal government.\u201d\n\nIn December, Pruitt joined a lawsuit against President Barack Obama\u2019s order to stop deportations of illegal immigrants, and the Associated Press reported Pruitt\u2019s strong support for states\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cPruitt campaigned on states\u2019 rights and has created a federalism unit in his office to push back against what he has described as \u2018government overreach,'\u201d according to the AP story.\n\nPruitt spokesman Aaron Cooper didn\u2019t return repeated calls and emails over two weeks to discuss the lawsuit.\n\nBruning spokeswoman Liz Eberle responded to an inquiry about the costs of the lawsuit, saying Nebraska is not using outside counsel so the only costs are staff salaries and about $3,000 for printing. Eberle said she wasn\u2019t prepared to answer any other questions about the lawsuit and didn\u2019t return subsequent calls and emails asking to find someone who could talk about the lawsuit.\n\nColorado Attorney General spokeswoman Carolyn Tyler said current costs are negligible, but could increase if the Supreme Court takes up the case. She declined to comment on whether there is any hypocrisy by the plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cWe are preparing a response to the litigation and will respond with 60 days,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will have no discussions about the matter until then.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Nebraska and Oklahoma a suing Colorado because of its recreational weed industry, but Oklahoma AG defended state's rights when it came to the Clean Air Act.", "title": "Blowing smoke: AGs tout states' rights except when it comes to weed - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/Colorda-Legal-Marijuana-AP.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-06T12:43:16+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/189916/ags-states-rigts-weed/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Colorado", "tag": "Lawsuit,Marijuana", "published_time": "2015-01-06T04:00:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-06T12:43:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Nebraska and Oklahoma a suing Colorado because of its recreational weed industry, but Oklahoma AG defended state's rights when it came to the Clean Air Act.", "title": "Blowing smoke: AGs tout states' rights except when it comes to weed - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/Colorda-Legal-Marijuana-AP.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Nebraska and Oklahoma a suing Colorado because of its recreational weed industry, but Oklahoma AG defended state's rights when it came to the Clean Air Act."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8adf\"", "article_summary": "By Arthur Kane | Watchdog.orgIn April, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt issued an opinion paper, saying states\u2019 rights trump federal Clean Air Act regulations.\nNebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning has spoken for state rights on a number of issues, including limiting federal enforcement of environmental laws in his state.\n\u201cPruitt campaigned on states\u2019 rights and has created a federalism unit in his office to push back against what he has described as \u2018government overreach,'\u201d according to the AP story.\n\u201c(T)he federalist system of government, as set forth in the CAA, requires that EPA recognize the rights and prerogatives of States,\u201d says The Oklahoma Attorney General\u2019s Plan: The Clean Air Act Section 111(d) Framework that Preserves States\u2019 Rights.\n\u201cIn our constitutional system, the federal government has preeminent authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, including commerce involving legal and illegal trafficking in drugs such as marijuana,\u201d the lawsuit states."}
