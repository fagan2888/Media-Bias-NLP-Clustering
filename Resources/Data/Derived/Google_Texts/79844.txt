Hyatt Hotels Corporation said late Wednesday that malicious software had infiltrated the company’s payment processing system, a development that makes the famous brand the latest addition to a rapidly growing list of breached hospitality firms.

The company did not say how many of its 627 hotels the malware had affected. Leading security firm FireEye has been brought in to investigate the breach, Reuters reported.

“Hyatt has taken steps to strengthen the security of its systems, and customers can feel confident using payment cards at Hyatt hotels worldwide,” the company said in a statement.

The hotel chain — controlled by the Pritzker family, which includes Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker Penny PritzkerOvernight Cybersecurity: Obama signs trade secrets bill Overnight Finance: Trump now open to raising minimum wage Pritzker urges passage of trade deals to boost US exports MORE — cautioned that the investigation was still ongoing. Hyatt customers should review their payment card accounts for any suspicious activities, the company added.

Hyatt is the third hotel chain to acknowledge a hack in the last month, and the fourth since October.

In late November, both Hilton Worldwide and Starwood Hotels & Resorts said hackers had infiltrated their payment systems.

Hilton said sensitive information on customers’ credit and debit cards was potentially exposed during a four-month period. But Starwood insisted that no information was stolen from its 54 compromised hotels.
