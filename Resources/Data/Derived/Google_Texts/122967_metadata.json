Desiree Lawson said the price tag starts at $8,000 and can go as high as $25,000.\n\n\u201cWe don't have that laying around, so we need to raise the funds so we can make sure Iz runs now,\u201d Desiree told News 9.\n\nIsabelle or \u201cIz\u201d loves sports.\n\n\u201cYou get to play, have fun and it doesn't matter if you lose or win, all that matters is if you have fun,\u201d Isabelle said.\n\n3/23/2015 Related Story: Metro Girl To Undergo Rare Cancer Operation\n\nThe 8-year-old had to put sports on hold when she got cancer in her thigh bone. Iz had a \u201crotationplasty\u201d, in which doctors cut out the cancerous part, then reattached the lower part of her leg backwards so her ankle functions as her knee. Every three months she has scans and bloodwork to see if the cancer has returned.\n\n\u201cIt's very emotional, I'm sorry,\u201d Desiree said.\n\nHer parents say it was tough enough on Iz losing her leg.
