The unfortunate coincidence only exists as a result of the letter-less \u201c1\u201d falling between the \u201c3\u201d (F) and the \u201c8\u201d (U) in the phone number.\n\nThe 1-800-381-2596 number created to provide more information about the Affordable Health Care Act actually spells out 1-800-F1--CKYO on a kepyad because the '1' doesn't correspond to any letters.

House Republicans have insisted that any resolution to keep the federal government funded must be tied to measures that defund or delay Obamacare, which they say will harm the economy.\n\nThe federal health exchanges created by the law nevertheless went into effect Tuesday. But their debut was plagued nationwide by computer and log-in glitches as well as crippling processing delays, after the websites set up for insurance seekers couldn\u2019t handle the overwhelming demand.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "ADAM EDELMAN", "twitter": {"description": "Critics of Obamacare who claim the law may end up screwing the people it aims to help might turn out to be right.", "title": "In search of more information on Obamacare?
