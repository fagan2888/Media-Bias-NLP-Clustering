Carson has proposed a system of health savings accounts to cover most individual health care needs.\n\nCarson, who has been hiring senior staff for a potential presidential run, ticked through a series of critiques of the current administration on domestic and foreign policy. He said radical Islam \"threatens to destroy\" the U.S., though he pointed to \"the Shia in Iran\" as \"every bit as dangerous if not more dangerous\" than the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThey need to grasp a healthcare alternative before they try and remove Obamacare.\u201d Ben Carson\n\nThe first speaking slot of the event is never ideal, with the traditionally boisterous crowd trickling in over the course of the remarks, and the ballroom was only half-full for his appearance. Still, Carson, who is polling higher than top potential establishment candidates Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, in surveys of potential Iowa Republican caucus-goers, received a standing ovation on his introduction.\n\nRaised in poverty in Detroit and Boston, Carson rose to become one of the world's premier neurosurgeons, the first to successfully separate twins conjoined at the back of the head. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush, has more than 60 honorary doctorate degrees, and serves on the boards of Kellogg Co. and Costco Wholesale Corp. His foundation, Carson Scholars Fund, is operating in all 50 states and has pledged nearly $6 million in scholarships to students for academic and humanitarian achievement.\n\nThat background, along with his blunt breakdowns of the perceived failings of the country under Obama, has helped make him a regular in the top tiers of polls throughout early Republican primary states. (\u201cWhat they need to do is defund everything, including his golf,\u201d he said at a separate CPAC event on Thursday.)\n\nHis remarks Thursday tracked closely with a stump speech that has been refined in events in as many as four or five states per week over the past year. Carson attacked Democrats for social welfare programs and chided Republicans who declined to speak out about their beliefs.\n\n\"We have to stop sitting silently by and express ourselves,\" Carson said.\n\nArit John contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Phil Mattingly", "description": "Islamic militancy \u201cthreatens to destroy\u201d the United States, he contends.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i36UNqdr9wyE/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "Islamic militancy \u201cthreatens to destroy\u201d the United States, he contends.", "title": "Carson Urges GOP to Propose Alternative Before Obamacare Repeal Efforts", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-26/carson-urges-gop-to-propose-alternative-before-obamacare-repeal-efforts", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i36UNqdr9wyE/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Islamic militancy \u201cthreatens to destroy\u201d the United States, he contends.", "title": "Carson Urges GOP to Propose Alternative Before Obamacare Repeal Efforts", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-26/carson-urges-gop-to-propose-alternative-before-obamacare-repeal-efforts", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i36UNqdr9wyE/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "Islamic militancy \u201cthreatens to destroy\u201d the United States, he contends."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Carson Urges GOP to Propose Alternative Before Obamacare Repeal Efforts", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NKDUPM6S972B01", "parsely-author": "Phil Mattingly", "date": "2015-02-26T14:24:58.394Z", "keywords": "CPAC 2015", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "CPAC 2015", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-26T14:24:58.394Z", "parsely-tags": "CPAC 2015,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-26/carson-urges-gop-to-propose-alternative-before-obamacare-repeal-efforts"}, "article_summary": "Carson has proposed a system of health savings accounts to cover most individual health care needs.\n\"They need to grasp a healthcare alternative before they try and remove Obamacare if they really want to gain some traction,\" Carson told the crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md.\nCarson attacked Democrats for social welfare programs and chided Republicans who declined to speak out about their beliefs.\n(\u201cWhat they need to do is defund everything, including his golf,\u201d he said at a separate CPAC event on Thursday.)\nCarson, who has been hiring senior staff for a potential presidential run, ticked through a series of critiques of the current administration on domestic and foreign policy."}
