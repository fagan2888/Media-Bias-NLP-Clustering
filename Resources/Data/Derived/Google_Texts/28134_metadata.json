MacIver Institute for Public Policy.\n\n\"Employer health coverage is more expensive in Wisconsin than only a handful of other states - yet it's likely to get much worse,\" said NCPA Senior Fellow Devon Herrick. \"Many Badger State workers will lose their current coverage when as many as two out of three Wisconsin firms are forced to switch health plans to meet new ACA standards.\"\n\nThe study notes:\n\nThe average cost of a family employer plan in Wisconsin was $16,248 in 2012, more than in 42 other states.\n\nFirms that employ 50 or more workers and don't provide health insurance will be subject to a tax penalty of $2,000 for each uninsured employee beyond the first 30.\n\nTwo-thirds to four-fifths of employer plans will likely lose their grandfathered status under ACA regulations.\n\nOverall, by 2016, about 10,000 Wisconsin workers will lose (or leave) small group employer plans due to regulations in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\"The fact that 10,000 Wisconsinites will lose or leave their employee sponsored plans because of Obamacare regulations is unbelievable,\" said Brett Healy, President of the MacIver Institute. \"It is clear the ACA is raising the costs of health care - the exact opposite of what the President promised - and it is having a profoundly negative impact on businesses and their employees all across Wisconsin.\"\n\nSee the full report by clicking here.\n\n\"As the new ACA requirements are implemented in Wisconsin and other states, they will have a profound ripple effect on other aspects of business operations - such as hiring, employee compensation and business growth, especially for small businesses,\" said Herrick.\n\n--30--\n\nThe John K.
