His final points were two free throws with 3.2 seconds left.\n\n\u201cWe got to the point where we needed someone to step up,\u201d Hoyas coach John Thompson III said. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard me say all year, when we need baskets, everyone knows who we\u2019re going to. \u2026 He answered today.\u201d\n\nThe Hoyas (21-9) will face sixth-seeded Xavier, which beat No. 22 Butler, the No. 3 seed, 67-61, in Friday night\u2019s semifinals. It is their first semifinal appearance since 2010. Georgetown has won the tournament seven times, tying former member UConn for the most titles.\n\nJames Milliken led No. 10 seed Creighton (14-19) with 17 points.\n\nThe Bluejays, who lost in the championship game to Providence last year, advanced to the quarterfinals with a 78-63 victory over DePaul.\n\nThe matchup that seemed so one-sided on paper was anything but. A scoop shot by Austin Chatman as the shot clock ran out gave the Bluejays a 51-45 lead with six minutes to play.\n\nIt was just about a minute later that Smith-Rivera started his run, hitting a 3-pointer, a three-point play and a driving shot when he was falling down. He closed his spurt with four free throws, including the clinchers.\n\n\u201cAt that point they were on the run. I really just wanted to make a play, and the guys were looking for me to make something happen,\u201d Smith-Rivera said of his run. \u201cAt that point that\u2019s what I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nCreighton hurt itself late by committing three of its 18 turnovers in the final 2:15.\n\n\u201cI felt like, in a lot of ways, we outplayed Georgetown tonight. Then in the last 3 minutes they made some plays and we didn\u2019t,\u201d Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. \u201cSmith-Rivera, obviously, made some big plays late in the game and then we had some costly turnovers that you can\u2019t have against a team the quality of Georgetown.\u201d\n\nThe win gave Georgetown a sweep of Creighton this season. The Hoyas won the two regular-season meetings by 15 and 27 points, holding the Bluejays to a season-low 40 points in the latter.\n\n\u201cThey played a lot faster today,\u201d Smith-Rivera said of Creighton. \u201cTheir transition was really good and they were really physical. \u2026 It\u2019s hard to beat anybody three times in a year. We knew they were going to come out tough.\u201d\n\nJoshua Smith added 10 points for the Hoyas. Chatman had 11 points for the Bluejays, who finished with a 31-28 rebound advantage.\n\n\u201cGeorgetown hit some good shots there in the end. They put themselves in position with a few minutes left to win the game,\u201d Creighton\u2019s Rick Kreklow said. \u201cWe had our chances, they had theirs. Unfortunately tonight we weren\u2019t able to hit the shots that we had or just let a pass or two get away from us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "There wasn't much doubt who Georgetown would turn to late in the game and D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera came through again.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "There wasn\u2019t much doubt who Georgetown would turn to late in the game and D\u2019Vauntes Smith-Rivera came through again.", "title": "No. 23 Georgetown advances in Big East with victory over Creighton", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/13/no-23-georgetown-advances-in-big-east-with-60-55-w/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/12/eb0b705c964f980b700f6a706700cc66.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/12/eb0b705c964f980b700f6a706700cc66.jpg", "description": "There wasn't much doubt who Georgetown would turn to late in the game and D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera came through again.", "card": "summary", "title": "No. 23 Georgetown advances in Big East with victory over Creighton"}, "Author": "Jim O'Connell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Joshua Smith, Georgetown"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 There wasn\u2019t much doubt who Georgetown would turn to late in the game and D\u2019Vauntes Smith-Rivera came through again.\nSmith-Rivera scored 25 points, including 12 of Georgetown\u2019s final 14, and the 23rd-ranked Hoyas beat Creighton, 60-55, on Thursday night in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden.\nThen in the last 3 minutes they made some plays and we didn\u2019t,\u201d Creighton coach Greg McDermott said.\nThe Bluejays, who lost in the championship game to Providence last year, advanced to the quarterfinals with a 78-63 victory over DePaul.\nThey put themselves in position with a few minutes left to win the game,\u201d Creighton\u2019s Rick Kreklow said."}
