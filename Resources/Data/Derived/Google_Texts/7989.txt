The Dallas Cowboys are set to sign Michael Sam onto the team’s practice squad, according to a report from NFL Insider’s Ian Rapoport and multiple other sources.

A team source said that if Sam passes his physical, he’ll be added to the practice squad. So while Sam may not be making history with the Rams, he could very well be making history with the Cowboys.

More to come.
