With changes in medicine, however, are the possibilities of changes in legislature.\n\nLike many others involved with state associations, Hahn said he also juggles multiple member-driven responsibilities \u2014 gathering lobbyists, monitoring regulatory issues, advocating to the General Assembly, communicating with departments to solve problems or seek clarification, as well as staying up to date on candidacies.\n\nWith its advocacy action, Hahn said the MOA has garnered consistent messages regarding various aspects of insurance, especially coverage.\n\n\u201cWe will probably be approaching the General Assembly with some insurance concerns to help serve our members,\u201d Hahn said.\n\nAnother constant message MOA members express, Hahn said, is the accessibility of patient healthcare. He said the MOA will continue to keep a close eye on the Affordable Care Act and \u201csee how it unfolds as a whole and see how it affects the profession of optometry.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 28, House Bill 315 was enacted into law. This bill states a \u201chealth carrier or health benefit plan\u201d must cover a prescription eye drop refill before \u201cthe last day of the prescribed dosage period.\u201d\n\nAs long as patients seek permission from their health carriers, they need not worry about an early refill coverage restriction.\n\n\u201cPreviously in Missouri, there were restrictions on early refills for maintenance eye drops and it created a scenario in which patients were, often times, running out of their prescription eye drops before their 30 days were up,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cSo, they would have lag time in which they would have access to medicine they needed. Sometimes, that was to treat glaucoma or other medical conditions.\u201d\n\nAs far as what\u2019s next for optometrists and the Affordable Care Act, Hahn could not yet say.\n\n\u201cNew regulations are being drafted every day,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone knows what that\u2019s going to look like in Missouri, so it puts pretty much all of us in the same boat.\u201d\n\nHe said the MOA teamed up with the Missouri Society of Eye Physicians and Surgeons to bring the bill to the General Assembly during last session. The bill, he added, was focused on patient care but was central to helping children and the elderly.\n\nIn the future, Hahn said the MOA will keep advocating for public health and added the MOA is a \u201cstrong supporter\u201d of the Missouri Children\u2019s Vision.\n\nDuring 2007, Senate Bill 16 passed and was to be reauthorized during 2012. One part of the bill stated \u201cevery child enrolling in kindergarten or first grade shall receive one comprehensive vision examination performed by a state licensed optometrist or physician.\u201d\n\nThe reauthorization of the bill, however, became \u201chighly contentious,\u201d Hahn said. With the best interest of Missouri children, Hahn said he hopes to readdress the bill\u2019s benefits.\n\n\u201c[O]ne thing we\u2019ve come to understand is that you have to be able to see to learn, and we don\u2019t want Missouri\u2019s children placed behind the eight ball,\u201d Hahn said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "ST.
