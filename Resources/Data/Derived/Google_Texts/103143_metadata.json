These include central-line bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections and eight types of injuries, including bed sores, falls and blood clots.\n\nHospitals were rated on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the poorest score. Marin General received a rating of 8. All hospitals whose performance ranked in the bottom 25th percentile \u2014 with a score of 7 or higher \u2014 were penalized. Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael received a score of 6.7 and Novato Community Hospital received a score of 3.9.\n\n\u201cThere is room for improvement in the incidence of hospital acquired conditions regardless of the institution or hospital,\u201d the CMS reported.\n\nDr. Joel Sklar, chief medical officer of Marin General Hospital, said, \u201cIn the period they measure, we had a cluster that we saw and had an action plan to deal with. It\u2019s too bad we don\u2019t get paid extra for the years we do great.\u201d\n\nSklar said the \u201ccluster\u201d was a series of catheter-related infections in the intensive care unit.\n\n\u201cFrom my standpoint this is quite ironic,\u201d Sklar said, noting that Marin General received high scores for clinical safety last year from two organizations that rate hospitals nationally: the Leapfrog Group and Healthgrades.\n\nA total of 724 hospitals nationwide had their Medicare reimbursements trimmed due to their performance in the hospital-acquired conditions reduction program, which is estimated to reduce federal spending by $373 million in 2015.\n\nMedicare revenue\n\nIn 2013, the most recent year for which numbers are available, Marin General reported net patient Medicare revenue of $54.6 million, and Novato Community reported $11.5 million. Medicare revenue data were not available on the state\u2019s website for Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael.\n\nCMS will shave San Rafael Kaiser\u2019s Medicare payments 1.24 percent due to the hospital\u2019s lackluster performance in CMS\u2019s hospital value-based purchasing program, which was authorized by the Affordable Care Act. Hospital mortality rates for several types of illness and patient satisfaction survey results are two of the criteria used to measure performance in this program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKaiser spokesman Joe Fragola said, \u201cOur leadership in Northern California is actively reviewing the CMS data to better understand why some of our infection and patient injury rates were noted by CMS as higher than average.\u201d\n\nFragola said the penalty is not reflective of Kaiser Permanente\u2019s overall performance.\n\n\u201cFor this year, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Medicare plan in California is rated with five stars, the highest designation available from the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Kaiser Permanente has the only five-star plan in the state,\u201d Fragola said.\n\nMarin General\u2019s reimbursement rate was cut another 0.45 percent due to its performance in the value-based purchasing program, while Novato Community was awarded a 0.20 percent bonus for good performance.\n\nSklar said Marin General has always done extremely well on the clinical portion of this program.\n\nBut, he said, \u201cIn the year they\u2019re talking about, our patient satisfaction was below the 50th percentile, and they valued that metric much higher in that year than they did previously.\u201d\n\nReadmissions\n\nCMS cut Novato Community\u2019s reimbursement rate by 0.32 percent, for its low ranking in the government\u2019s hospital readmissions reduction program, leaving Novato Community with a net reduction of just 0.12 percent.\n\n\u201cWe are working really hard to prevent readmissions to the hospital,\u201d said Mary Strebig, a Novato Community Hospital spokeswoman. \u201cThrough our joint replacement program, we are following our patients 90 days out, and we are working hard to prevent readmissions for patients who have serious chronic diseases.\u201d\n\nThe final 0.22 percent of Marin General\u2019s reimbursement reduction resulted due to its ranking in the readmissions reduction program.\n\nCMS\u2019s hospital readmissions reduction program looks at the readmission rates of patients who initially went into the hospital for one of five conditions: heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hip/knee arthroplasty. A total of 2,638 hospitals nationwide were penalized in 2014.\n\n\u201cThat one completely confuses me,\u201d Sklar said, noting that Marin General was above the benchmark score in all five categories looked at.\n\nAkin Demehin, associate director of policy for the American Hospital Association, said, \u201cWe are concerned that some existing pay-for-performance programs do not fairly assess hospital performance. For example, the readmission measures are not adjusted for issues such as poverty, which can affect a patient\u2019s likelihood of being readmitted but are beyond a hospital\u2019s control. \u201cIn addition, the hospital-acquired conditions program uses measures that do not accurately reflect hospital performance,\u201d Demehin said. \u201cWe will continue to urge the government to adopt changes that improve the fairness and effectiveness of these programs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government will cut inpatient Medicare payments to Marin\u2019s three hospitals this year due to their poor performance in several programs designed to improve patient care and cut medical costs.Marin General will take the biggest", "title": "Feds cut Medicare reimbursements to Marin hospitals due to poor performance", "og": {"url": "http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20150117/NEWS/150119867", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.marinij.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NO/20150117/NEWS/150119867/AR/0/AR-150119867.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "996px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Feds cut Medicare reimbursements to Marin hospitals due to poor performance"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marinij.com", "description": "The federal government will cut inpatient Medicare payments to Marin\u2019s three hospitals this year due to their poor performance in several programs designed to improve patient care and cut medical costs.Marin General will take the biggest", "title": "Feds cut Medicare reimbursements to Marin hospitals due to poor performance", "url": "http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20150117/NEWS/150119867", "image": {"src": "http://www.marinij.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NO/20150117/NEWS/150119867/AR/0/AR-150119867.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@marinij", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "marinnews, Home", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "marinnews, Home"}, "article_summary": "Akin Demehin, associate director of policy for the American Hospital Association, said, \u201cWe are concerned that some existing pay-for-performance programs do not fairly assess hospital performance.\nMarin General received a rating of 8.\nDr. Joel Sklar, chief medical officer of Marin General Hospital, said, \u201cIn the period they measure, we had a cluster that we saw and had an action plan to deal with.\n\u201cIn addition, the hospital-acquired conditions program uses measures that do not accurately reflect hospital performance,\u201d Demehin said.\nThe federal government will cut inpatient Medicare payments to Marin\u2019s three hospitals this year due to their poor performance in several programs designed to improve patient care and cut medical costs."}
