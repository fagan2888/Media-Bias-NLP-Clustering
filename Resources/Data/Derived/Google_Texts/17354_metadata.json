Like Warhol, Palombo devotes the majority of his work to irreverent pop art and satire. However, after losing a friend to breast cancer a few years back and developing his own rare form of cancer that left him disabled, the 41-year-old Italian artist turned his attention toward social activism.\n\n\u201cI lived fully in the 80s, the boom of pop culture, the years of consumerism, the cult of celebrity, and the desire for lightness,\u201d Palombo told BuzzFeed. \u201cI love the cartoon characters just like Andy Warhol loved celebrities, and cartoons are more human and real than celebrities.\u201d\n\nIn his newest series titled \u201cSurvivor,\u201d Palombo shows what iconic cartoon characters \u2014 such as Betty Boop, Marge Simpson, and Wonder Woman \u2014 would look like as breast cancer survivors with mastectomy scars and all. Palombo\u2019s message behind his \u201cAwareness Campaign\u201d is simple: \u201cNo one is immune to cancer, not even Disney Princesses.\u201d\n\nCheck out Palombo\u2019s Instagram, Facebook, and blog Humor Chic for more on the contemporary artist and activist.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alexsandro, palombo, disney, princesses, breast, cancer, survivor, mastectomy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Italian artist AleXsandro Palombo shows what iconic cartoon characters, including Disney princesses, would look like as breast cancer survivors.", "title": "'No One Is Immune To Cancer, Not Even Disney Princesses' [SLIDESHOW]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/artist-alexsandro-palombo-shows-what-disney-princesses-would-look-breast-cancer-335390", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/survivor.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Italian artist AleXsandro Palombo shows what iconic cartoon characters, including Disney princesses, would look like as breast cancer survivors.", "title": "'No One Is Immune To Cancer, Not Even Disney Princesses' [SLIDESHOW]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/artist-alexsandro-palombo-shows-what-disney-princesses-would-look-breast-cancer-335390", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/survivor.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/survivor.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-28T14:10:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T15:04:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Italian artist AleXsandro Palombo shows what iconic cartoon characters, including Disney princesses, would look like as breast cancer survivors."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4cc\"", "article_summary": "Like Warhol, Palombo devotes the majority of his work to irreverent pop art and satire.\nHowever, after losing a friend to breast cancer a few years back and developing his own rare form of cancer that left him disabled, the 41-year-old Italian artist turned his attention toward social activism.\nAleXsandro Palombo\u2019s artistic inspiration is Andy Warhol, which should tell you a little bit about his own style of art.\n\u201cI love the cartoon characters just like Andy Warhol loved celebrities, and cartoons are more human and real than celebrities.\u201dIn his newest series titled \u201cSurvivor,\u201d Palombo shows what iconic cartoon characters \u2014 such as Betty Boop, Marge Simpson, and Wonder Woman \u2014 would look like as breast cancer survivors with mastectomy scars and all.\nPalombo\u2019s message behind his \u201cAwareness Campaign\u201d is simple: \u201cNo one is immune to cancer, not even Disney Princesses.\u201dCheck out Palombo\u2019s Instagram, Facebook, and blog Humor Chic for more on the contemporary artist and activist."}
