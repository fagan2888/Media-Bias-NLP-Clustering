Health care, in particular, has seen a spree of takeovers as providers, insurers, pharmaceutical companies and drugstores reposition themselves for industry changes spawned by the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe law is \u201ccausing a lot of refocusing and reordering of companies\u2019 business models,\u201d said Jeff Greene, who leads the life-sciences mergers and acquisitions practice at Ernst & Young.\n\nAmong other deals, Anthem Inc. is buying rival health insurer Cigna Corp. for $51.9 billion, and drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. agreed last month to acquire competitor Rite Aid Corp. for $9.4 billion.\n\nThe biggest deal in health care this year might be yet to come: Drug giant Pfizer Inc., which makes Viagra and other top-selling products, has acknowledged that it\u2019s looking at buying Botox maker Allergan, and the potential purchase price based on Allergan\u2019s current stock value could exceed $120 billion.\n\nMany companies also are eager to buy, or be sold, because the economy and corporate sales and profits are growing slowly and acquisitions help them kick-start additional growth.\n\nWhether the deals end up benefiting employees, consumers and suppliers is another matter. Each transaction is different, but often an immediate goal is to eliminate the combined companies\u2019 redundant functions \u2014 especially on administrative staffs \u2014 and that means job cuts.\n\nIn the case of health care, critics also are concerned that as the number of players in each sector shrinks, consumers will have fewer choices and prices will rise. The possible Pfizer-Allergan deal drew such criticism amid the debate about higher drug prices.\n\nFailed deals\n\nMerger history also has no shortage of deals that failed to live up to their hype or were outright flops, most notably Time Warner\u2019s ill-fated purchase of AOL in 2001 for $147 billion.\n\nA company\u2019s desire to buy another is one thing; ability is another. This year, companies have been able to strike such a huge number of deals for several reasons.\n\nWith interest rates still low, businesses can borrow relatively cheaply to finance takeovers. The stock market, despite severe bumps late this summer and last week, remains at near record-high levels, and that gives buyers a strong currency to help pay for deals.\n\nAlso, \u201ccompanies got lean during the recession, and during that time they accumulated cash\u201d they can now use for acquisitions, Greif said.\n\nWaves of mergers aren\u2019t new, of course. They\u2019re part of what economist Joseph Schumpeter once called the \u201ccreative destruction\u201d that constantly occurs as businesses evolve. But the merger cycles have had changing goals.\n\nA few decades ago, for instance, the trend was for companies to diversify, and they bought a hodgepodge of disparate businesses with the thinking that one line would do well when another faltered as the economy kept changing.\n\nConglomerates rise\n\nThat gave rise to such conglomerates as Teledyne Inc., ITT Corp. and General Electric Co. Eventually, their attraction ebbed as companies turned their focus to being more efficient and nimble in specific areas, in large part because they faced increasing global competition.\n\nThat trend continues. GE, for instance, announced this spring that it would sell most of its GE Capital finance division.\n\nSome conglomerates remain, notably billionaire Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and Buffett this summer announced his largest deal yet. His company agreed to pay $32 billion for Precision Castparts Corp., a maker of parts and equipment with 5,000 employees in Southern California.\n\nBut most of this year\u2019s deals have been strategic, a way for companies to enhance their sales and profits in their primary fields. Case in point: Aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp. bought helicopter-maker Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. this year for $9 billion.\n\nThis year\u2019s merger wave is all about \u201ccorporate managements that see opportunities to extend their footprints and expand their market shares, and acquisitions are one way to do that,\u201d said Richard Peterson, a senior director at the research firm S&P Capital IQ.\n\nNo slowdown\n\nHe and others also believe that the merger wave will not slow markedly anytime soon, barring a major shock to the economy or financial system, because the factors fueling the takeovers remain in place.\n\nIndeed, they noted that private-equity firms that specialize in acquiring companies have been relegated to being secondary players in the current merger wave, which has been dominated by corporations seeking strategic partners.\n\nYet there is still $500 billion in global buyout funds waiting to be used, what Peterson calls \u201cdry powder\u201d that could help sustain the record pace of merger activity well into next year.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at a top\u201d in terms of the merger wave, Greif said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see anything in the near term that would cause me to say it\u2019s going to end.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "sailthru.author": "Los Angeles Times", "description": "The same trend is playing out in health care, oil and gas, technology, telecommunications, aerospace, home building and food products.
