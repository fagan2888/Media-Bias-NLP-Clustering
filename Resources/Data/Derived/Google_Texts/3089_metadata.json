(Johnnie St. Vrain/Times-Call)\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Johnnie: I have been perplexed over the strange layout of pipes in the construction area just east of Ken Pratt and Third Avenue. What is the purpose of all those white pipes sticking out of the ground?\n\nAs I recall, the workers had created a grid system, and then the pipes showed up within the grids. This is quite a mystery to me. Can you tell me (us) what it's about? -- Building Construction Lover\n\nDear Building Construction Lover: You are watching an apartment complex go up, and since you've been watching from the start -- at least it sounds like you have -- you are seeing it from the inside out.\n\nBefore the walls go up, even before the foundation is poured, other pieces must be in place, such as sewer lines and electrical conduit.\n\nMost of those white pipes you are seeing are wastewater lines. As the worker I stopped and spoke with over the weekend said: toilets. The gray pipes you see are electrical conduits.\n\nAll of these are the things that will end up behind walls and under floors, so they must come first.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_24634515/johnnie-st-vrain-that-patchwork-pipes-is-necessity", "modificationDate": "2013-12-01T19:05:26-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2013/1201/20131201__02tcajsv_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Longmont Times-Call", "description": "Hi Johnnie:  I have been perplexed over the strange layout of pipes in the construction area just east of Ken Pratt and Third Avenue.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:24634515:view"}, "startDate": "2013-12-01T19:02:35-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_24634515/johnnie-st-vrain-that-patchwork-pipes-is-necessity", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2013/1201/20131201__02tcajsv.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hi Johnnie:  I have been perplexed over the strange layout of pipes in the construction area just east of Ken Pratt and Third Avenue.", "title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: That patchwork of pipes is a necessity at construction site"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Hi Johnnie:  I have been perplexed over the strange layout of pipes in the construction area just east of Ken Pratt and Third Avenue.", "title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: That patchwork of pipes is a necessity at construction site", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_24634515/johnnie-st-vrain-that-patchwork-pipes-is-necessity", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2013/1201/20131201__02tcajsv.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-01T19:02:35-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2023-12-01T17:17:12-0700", "sailthru.title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: That patchwork of pipes is a necessity at construction site", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Johnnie St. Vrain", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "Longmont Times-Call", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2013/1201/20131201__02tcajsv.jpg", "pubDate": "2013-12-01T19:05:56-0700"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95b4\"", "article_summary": "(Johnnie St. Vrain/Times-Call)Hi Johnnie: I have been perplexed over the strange layout of pipes in the construction area just east of Ken Pratt and Third Avenue.\nWhat is the purpose of all those white pipes sticking out of the ground?\nMost of those white pipes you are seeing are wastewater lines.\n-- Building Construction LoverDear Building Construction Lover: You are watching an apartment complex go up, and since you've been watching from the start -- at least it sounds like you have -- you are seeing it from the inside out.\nPipes emerge from the ground at the site of what will be 1600 Ironhorse at Mill Village apartments."}
