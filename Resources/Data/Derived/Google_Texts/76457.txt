Another Chasin' the Sun Music Festival is in the books and officials are calling it a successful event.

Organizers say the event had visitors from 38 states, mostly from Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee.

The headliner Alan Jackson concert was sold out with more than 7,000 tickets sold at Aaron Bessant Park.

Now Panama City Beach is looking forward to the next musical festival that starts this Thursday.

"It was a wonderful weekend in Panama City Beach for live music. Following up on the Gulf Coast Jam, Chasin' the Sun, next weekend, we have the Chili Vibrations World Music Festival. It's a great opportunity for folks to see live music, under the stars at Aaron Bessant Park," said Dan Rowe, the Executive Director of the Panama City Beach Tourist Development Council.
