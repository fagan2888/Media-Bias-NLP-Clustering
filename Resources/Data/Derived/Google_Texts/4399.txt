Investigators said a man who died in an apartment fire was smoking while on oxygen.

Fire crews were called to Shadyway Plaza Tower, 1421 N. Spruce, Sunday afternoon.

Investigators said tubing caught fire and burned its way back to the oxygen tank. A medical alert the 70-year-old man was wearing alerted 911. The man died from his injuries.

The building, with 105 residents, suffered $16,000 in damage. The damage was limited to the victim's apartment. The building doesn't have sprinklers. Sprinklers weren't mandatory at the time the apartments were built.

One person has died in a fire Sunday afternoon at a Wichita retirement home.

Crews were called around 12:20 p.m. to a fire at Shadyway Plaza Tower at 1421 North Spruce, near 13th Street North and Grove. Smoke was showing from the high-rise when they arrived on scene.

The cause of the fire has not been released. Lt. Brad Crisp with the Wichita Fire Department says that one person died.

The fire was brought under control just after 12:40 p.m.

Most residents will be allowed back in the apartment complex.

Lt. Crisp says that the fire was contained to one apartment, saying the fire was reported to 911 by a resident inside the apartment that caught fire.

Fire alarms activated inside the building alerting residents to the fire.

More information is expected to be released on Monday morning.
