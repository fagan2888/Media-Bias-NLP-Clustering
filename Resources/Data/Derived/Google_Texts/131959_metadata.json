The marketplace is a new option for Americans looking for quality health insurance at a low rate.\n\nUnder the ACA, most Americans must purchase health care or face penalties, and the health insurance marketplace is a one-stop shop for determining the least expensive health plan that fits your needs and is offered in your area.\n\nPhoto: REUTERS\n\nThe creation of the marketplace is one of the key provisions of the health care overhaul, which has come to be the defining legislative accomplishment of Obama\u2019s presidency, but the specifics of just how it will affect individuals and how to apply to participate in it can be a bit complicated.\n\nThe first thing anyone thinking of applying to the health insurance marketplace should know is that coverage found through it will begin as early as January 1 -- and enrollment is only open through March 31.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThat means you should get on top of it as soon as possible if you\u2019re hoping to have new, cheaper insurance next year. That also means that this whole \u201cObamacare\u201d thing is at long last very close to having major impacts on the health care market, American families, and the national economy. It\u2019s best to educate yourself ahead of time in order to ensure that you can take advantage of any benefits available to you.\n\nFirst you need to determine if you are eligible to participate in the marketplace. The basic requirements are that you must live in the U.S., be an American citizen or national, and not be in jail at the time you apply.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve determined that you are eligible for the program, you will need to go ahead and apply. The initial ACA marketplace application was slated to be a 21-page headache, a fact that ticked off a lot of observers and pundits. But the final version of the basic application, which was released on April 30, will instead be just five pages.\n\nYou will need your Social Security number and information about your current coverage, employer and income, but most of the responses the final version of the application form requires are fairly standard identifying information.\n\nYou can fill your application out online -- likely the easiest and most efficient way to do it -- or by mail or in person. To apply online on Oct. 1 or later, simply visit the official website for the program by clicking here and navigate to the application page, which should be prominently displayed there starting that day.\n\nIf you choose not to purchase health insurance, unless you qualify to opt out due to low income or other considerations, you will have to pay a fee beginning in 2014. The 2014 fee will be one percent of your yearly income, or $95 per person, whichever is the higher amount, while the fee for an uninsured child is $47.50, though the maximum a family will be required to pay will be $285. These fees will rise significantly in coming years. These concerns and requirements are covered in greater depth here.\n\nIf you have questions about your application, eligibility or anything else regarding the health care marketplace, you can call the program\u2019s help line at 1-800-318-2596, or TTY: 1-855-889-4325, which is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or visit this website for information about other ways to find help.\n\nOf course, all of the above may be rendered moot if somehow Congress manages to defund \u201cObamacare,\u201d though you probably shouldn\u2019t hold your breath on that one.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obamacare open enrollment, affordable care act open enrollment, health insurance marketplace, health care open enrollment, how to apply obamacare, how to apply open enrollment, how to apply affordable care act, obamacare application, obamacare, apply aca", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Here's everything you need to know about open enrollment in the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchange, which begins Oct. 1.", "title": "\u2018Obamacare\u2019 Open Enrollment Begins Oct. 1: How To Apply To The ACA Health Insurance Exchange", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obamacare-open-enrollment-begins-oct-1-how-apply-aca-health-insurance-exchange-1408418", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2011/02/03/63166-dr-millie-marie-tolentino-r-examines-patient-dora-leon-at-clinica-sier.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here's everything you need to know about open enrollment in the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchange, which begins Oct. 1.", "title": "\u2018Obamacare\u2019 Open Enrollment Begins Oct. 1: How To Apply To The ACA Health Insurance Exchange", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obamacare-open-enrollment-begins-oct-1-how-apply-aca-health-insurance-exchange-1408418", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2011/02/03/63166-dr-millie-marie-tolentino-r-examines-patient-dora-leon-at-clinica-sier.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2011/02/03/63166-dr-millie-marie-tolentino-r-examines-patient-dora-leon-at-clinica-sier.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2013-09-19T14:49:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-05T23:03:42-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/casac8"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Here's everything you need to know about open enrollment in the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchange, which begins Oct. 1."}, "article_summary": "Under the ACA, most Americans must purchase health care or face penalties, and the health insurance marketplace is a one-stop shop for determining the least expensive health plan that fits your needs and is offered in your area.\nThe marketplace is a new option for Americans looking for quality health insurance at a low rate.\nThe initial ACA marketplace application was slated to be a 21-page headache, a fact that ticked off a lot of observers and pundits.\nPresident Barack Obama passed the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, in March 2010, and the next stage of its long rollout begins Oct. 1, when open enrollment in the \u201cObamacare\u201d health insurance marketplace begins.\nThe first thing anyone thinking of applying to the health insurance marketplace should know is that coverage found through it will begin as early as January 1 -- and enrollment is only open through March 31."}
