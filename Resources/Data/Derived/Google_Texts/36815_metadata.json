After 30 years running Cobble Hill\u2019s beloved Community Bookstore, and 43 years in the bookselling business, the 69-year-old is closing his shop. But Scioli isn\u2019t being priced out\u0097he's just ready to sell his building and retire. The winning offer: $5.5 million. After Scioli manages to clear the space of tens of thousands of books, he\u2019s thinking about moving to the South of France.\n\n\u201cI've been going to the South of France since 2004 and I meet a lot of Russian women there\u0097they go on holiday,\u201d Scioli explains between drags of his cigarette.\n\n\u201cSo they meet all these guys, and I overhear them\u0097producers, movie guys. I tell [the women] I have a used bookstore, and they coo, 'Oh, do you have Dostoyevsky?' You know, they want to talk about literature. The guys are like, 'What are you talking to this guy for?'\u201d\n\nScioli and his acerbic wit have roughly a year to move out of the bookstore and two more to leave his digs upstairs.\n\nA New York native, Scioli originally opened up shop in Park Slope in 1971. Three years later, he and his ex-wife launched their second store in Brooklyn Heights. The soon-to-be-closed Cobble Hill location, which opened in 1995, is the only one remaining.\n\nThe Community Bookstore smells of water damage and it\u2019s almost impossible to maneuver its aisles without knocking over stacks of books (the Times estimated his stock as somewhere between 60,000 and 100,000).\n\nScioli opens the shop around 5 p.m. and closes at midnight. He doesn\u2019t pay cash for used books, but he does accepts donations, which pile up overnight outside his store. As customers approach him with ratty paperbacks, Scioli quotes a seemingly arbitrary (but always reasonable) price.\n\nChain-smoking outside its front door, and occasionally peering inside to survey his customers, Scioli spoke about closing the neighborhood institution, and how he\u2019s watched his clientele change.\n\n\n\nJohn Scioli (Scott Heins / Gothamist)\n\nYour store is one of the last \u201cmessy bookstore\u201d strongholds in New York. How does it feel to be closing? It is one of the last of its kind. I\u2019m ambivalent about that, but I just cannot continue to do this. I\u2019m 69 years old and you have to retire at some point. And with the internet, it\u2019s been hard to make a living with a used bookstore.\n\nHow has Amazon\u2019s popularity affected your livelihood as a bookseller? People will scan a book with their phones, a new book, $15. They\u2019ll say, \u201cOh I can get this on Amazon for $6.\u201d I say, \u201cOkay, put it back and buy it in Amazon.\u201d Some people are annoyed. That affected the book business a lot.\n\nI saw that the Times wrote a cute piece about your store. Yeah, it was good. But the article drew too much attention. I don\u2019t really want all the attention. I appreciate people saying, \u201cWe\u2019re sorry to see you go,\u201d and \u201cCongratulations on selling the building,\u201d and all that. No, the article was fine. I just wasn\u2019t prepared for all the attention.\n\nDid it bring in customers you wouldn\u2019t normally have? After the article, it got busy. People came in from out of the neighborhood. I always had people coming in from out of the neighborhood as well, but it brought in a different kind of client.\n\nA lot of young people can\u2019t handle this type of store. They want everything to look like a supermarket, like Barnes & Noble. Very neat. Some young people come in and they say, \u201cDo you have a computer?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, do you want to buy a computer?\u201d and then they start to walk out. They don\u2019t know how they\u2019re supposed to find anything without a computer\u0097like, they want Hemingway, and I tell him that their book is under the \u201cHemingway\u201d section. \u201cOh my God, how did you find it?\u201d\n\nThey don\u2019t think to ask for help from me. Because they grew up on computers. They\u2019re very oriented that way. And they all take pictures of the store, even if they don\u2019t buy anything! It\u2019s because they never saw a messy bookstore. There used to be a lot of used bookstores in New York, for many years, on Fourth Avenue. People come by and say, \"Oh you\u2019re still here! Thank God, you\u2019re the last of the breed.\"\n\nWhat do you think about people coming in to take pictures of the store? Like, for Instagram? What do you mean, \u201cInstagram\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s an app on your phone that lets you post pictures online for your friends to see. What do their friends care about the books you look at? Look, this guy\u2019s taking a picture right now [he points inside]. I don\u2019t get that. That\u2019s a young person\u2019s thing.\n\nBut you admit that the store is a novelty. Yeah, it is. A lot of people will miss it. I\u2019ll miss it, too.\n\nWhy do you think that it\u2019s a novelty? It\u2019s the whole culture now. There are TV shows about how to de-clutter your life, personal assistants who come to organize your closet. The philosophy is, live with less stuff. That\u2019s why people throw out books, and so we take them.\n\n\n\n(Scott Heins / Gothamist)\n\nSo, what exactly is a community bookstore? It\u2019s just a name we chose, me and my ex-wife, many years ago. It\u2019s not like I have room for community gatherings in there. The books have first preference.\n\nWhy did you start selling books? In 1971, me and my ex-wife Susan opened a community bookstore in Park Slope. The neighborhood was changing. The young people were coming in and buying the brownstones. We thought there would be a need for a bookstore because there wasn\u2019t anything there. We started off with a tiny store and we worked very hard and it worked out.\n\nBut in 1974 we opened a store on Montague Street in the heights. Then we got divorced. I have to leave that [store] because the rent tripled. This building happened to be empty and it was for sale in 1995. I live upstairs. It all worked out fine.\n\nWhat were some problems you faced opening the store? We talked to people in the publishing industry and book wholesale. And they said, \u201cA bookstore in Brooklyn? You\u2019ll go broke!\u201d They were under the mentality that Brooklyn always had less bookstores than its population required. And they discouraged us, but we decided [to open] anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s a good business model: People just give you stuff for free and then you sell it. I know!\n\nWhat\u2019s your background? It ain\u2019t books. My background? I used to be an assistant manager in a supermarket in the Village. I was always in retail. I drove a cab for a while. My wife had been a teacher. She had more of a background in literature and stuff like that. We just decided to take a chance and open a bookstore.\n\nSo you became a reader after you the store opened. After I opened the bookstore. I gained more respect for reading, I learned a lot.\n\n\n\n(Scott Heins / Gothamist)\n\nHow has New York changed since your store opened? I\u2019m from here. I grew up in Little Italy. In the '70s and early '80s, there was a big fiscal crisis. The future of New York was in doubt at that time. No one had any money. Gradually it picked up.\n\nThis neighborhood now has its good side and its bad side. People hate to see people displaced, but still, it\u2019s much safer. I was held up twice in the \u201890s in my store. The guys were hard up. Now they don\u2019t even bother. People buy brownstones along this block and gut it and put in Jacuzzis and fancy kitchens. They have a lot of money.\n\nWhat are your regulars like? All kinds of people. Everyone\u2019s younger in the neighborhood now. Some are high-brow, some are low-brow.\n\nDo you have any regulars who stuck around for decades? Yeah.\n\nWhat are they like? They\u2019re all right\u0097they get older and then they die.\n\nOh. A lot of people became regular customers but moved out of the neighborhood because of the rents raising. A lot of customers are in their 20s and 30s now. They say, \u201cI used to come in here as a kid, play Ninja Turtles\u201d\u0097in the beginning, we had a lot of toys\u0097and they find the leftover toys and they show their girlfriends. And the girls are totally bored when they do that.\n\nBut then the girls say, \u201cI used to buy Baby-Sitters Club books here every month.\u201d They grow up. Some of them have kids now.\n\nI saw some Furbies inside. Yeah. People just give me stuff like that. One day a guy asked me, a young guy, \u201cDo you buy books?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t, because we have too many books. We take donations.\u201d He said he has some Camus. The next day, I come out, I open the store, and there are a couple of Camus titles and also pots and pans and stuff.\n\n\n\n(Scott Heins / Gothamist)\n\nWho\u2019s moving in after you clear out? The people who bought it don\u2019t know yet. But that\u2019s down the road, at least a year away. They\u2019ll renovate and then decide what to put in here. I have no idea. For all the people who\u2019ll miss the store, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be sad if a Prada or something comes in, some kind of boutique. But some people will think, thank God that bookstore\u2019s gone\u0097now we can buy handbags.\n\nWhat\u2019s the worst thing your bookstore could turn into? I don\u2019t know. A gentleman\u2019s club?\n\n\n\nYour first bookstore was gonna turn into an ice cream shop, right? It didn\u2019t in the end. There was a protest. The idea of books being replaced by ice cream was sort of incongruous. But then it became a Japanese restaurant eventually.\n\nYou\u2019re about to get $5.5 million. What will you do with that? It\u2019s got to last me the rest of my life. I won\u2019t get another job. Taxes. I had to refinance and pay off the bank.\n\nWhat will happen to all the books when you close? They still won\u2019t disappear. You can\u2019t give them all away. I\u2019ll have a big sale and end up donating a lot of books. Some people have said I should donate them to Africa. The worst thing would be to throw them out.\n\nWhat are your favorite books? I don\u2019t have any.\n\nDo people ask you to recommend books? Yeah, I hate that. \u201cWhat should I get my father for Father\u2019s Day?\u201d I don\u2019t know your father.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nCecilia D'Anastasio is a Brooklyn-based journalist who writes for VICE, The Nation, VICE Motherboard and elsewhere.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Gothamist", "description": "\"I'm sure they'll be sad if a Prada or something comes in, some kind of boutique.
