Sitting for just 20 minutes each morning, he says, can bring better mental and physical health. YouTube\n\nDef Jam co-founder Russell Simmons took a seat on The Couch last week to discuss his new book, Success Through Stillness: Meditation Made Simple. During his interview, Simmons spoke about the power of meditation and how meditating for just 20 minutes each morning can bring about happiness and better mental and physical health. It\u2019s easy to do, Simmons said, \u201cjust sit down, repeat the mantra, and don\u2019t move until the alarm goes off.\u201d Although it may be hard at first, the mind will settle, Simmons said.\n\nHis self-proclaimed easy-to-read book also covers mindful eating, compassion, and more. During the interview, Simmons talks about his daughters continued dedication to clearing her mind through meditation, how meditation transcends religious boundaries \u2014 it is, after all, good for everyone \u2014 and about the state of mindfulness and meditation in the world of Hip-Hop, an industry that sometimes looks at meditation and other forms of self-betterment as too soft.\n\nRegardless of age, race, and religion, meditation has shown vast health benefits. As time passes in a meditative state, thoughts begin to be seen from more of an outsider\u2019s perspective, Simmons says, allowing us to see \u201cthat they don\u2019t have much importance\u201d in the bigger picture of being happy in life. Studies have linked meditation to lower levels of anxiety and depression, less pain among arthritis and asthma patients, and reducing the urge to smoke, among many other benefits.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "russel simmons and meditation, the power of meditation, meditation and happiness, meditation and mental health, success through stillness, meditation made simple,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In his new book, Russell Simmons speaks about the power of meditation in one's life.
