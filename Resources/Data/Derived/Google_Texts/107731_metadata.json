I knew from the start that he was going to be good, by the way he moved his hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI enjoy giving back,\u201d said Washington, 25, of Jersey City. \u201cI love it because I love what I do.\u201d\n\nCousins Jessica and Claudia Bau, of Newark, were anxious to begin working on their subjects.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea, but I\u2019m a bit nervous,\u201d said Claudia.\n\nMayor Mark Smith is impressed with the program.\n\n\u201cThis program is a win-win for our community,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe students get the real-world experience that will help them in the job market, and the seniors get beauty services, free of charge.\u201d\n\nSeniors interested can make reservations for Thursdays at 3 p.m. when school is in session. Seniors can obtain tickets at any of the three locations, 555 Kennedy Blvd., 535 Avenue A, and the Nutrition Program at 16 West 4th St. For additional information seniors can contact Lori at the BEOF at (201) 437-7222, ext. 13.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "bayonne", "title": "Cosmetology students give seniors first-class haircuts for free under BEOF program", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Cosmetology students give seniors first-class haircuts for free under BEOF program\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/01/cosmetology_students_give_seni.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/01/14106619-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12057344\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-25T08:04:08Z\", \"author\": \"Felix Alarcon/The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"bayonne\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/01/14106619-small.jpg", "creator": "@falixalex", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Bayonne resident Ruth Burke, 76, found herself back in high school."}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, January 25, 2014,  3:04 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/01/14106619-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"felixalarcon\", \"author_nickname\": \"Felix Alarcon/The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"10938433\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Bayonne resident Ruth Burke, 76, found herself back in high school.", "title": "Cosmetology students give seniors first-class haircuts for free under BEOF program", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/01/cosmetology_students_give_seni.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, January 25, 2014,  3:00 AM", "article_author": "Felix Alarcon/The Jersey Journal", "Description": "Bayonne resident Ruth Burke, 76, found herself back in high school."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd245e\"", "article_summary": "The program launched on Dec. 6 and offers the opportunity for senior citizens to get shuttled to Bayonne High School for free beauty services.\nChickie Panaccione, the cosmetology teacher, said more than 30 seniors have participated in the program with some receiving standard haircuts and other getting perms.\nThe free new look was courtesy of a partnership between the Bayonne Board of Education, Hudson County Schools of Technology and the Bayonne Economic Opportunity Foundation (BEOF).\nBayonne resident Ruth Burke, 76, found herself back in high school.\nLiana Petrie, 18, of Bayonne, who chatted with Burke while working on her new hairstyle, said this wasn\u2019t her first time cutting a senior\u2019s hair."}
