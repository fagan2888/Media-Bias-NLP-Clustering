Gallagher says the costs were \u201cpaid completely by a group formed by old friends, Education for Public Service,\u201d and \u201cbe assured no tax dollars were used on the film.\u201d The blog post below has been updated to reflect that information.\n\nDenver Auditor Tim O\u2019Brien had a low profile even when he won the office last spring. Since he took office July 20, he\u2019s been working to build more community connections and to put his imprint on the office.\n\nSince he succeeded three-term Auditor Dennis Gallagher \u2014 a Denver political icon from decades in elected office at the state and local levels \u2014 he\u2019s had flashy shoes to fill with his lower-key approach.\n\nThe office has sought to maintain some visibility recently through promotional spending, along with placing print and online ads to seek out workers still owed back pay from past public projects because their employers failed to pay prevailing wages. O\u2019Brien and his office stress that both kinds of paid outreach serve a purpose and keep pace with the office\u2019s activities under Gallagher.\n\nOn the promotional side, a recent mailer to 50,000 homes introduces O\u2019Brien and outlines some of the Denver auditor\u2019s office functions, along with laying out some details of its audit plan for this year. The cost, according to communications director Kathleen MacKenzie, was 39 cents per piece, or $19,500.\n\nShe says the plan is to convey regular information in the future using the office\u2019s low-cost (or virtually no-cost) e-mail newsletter, but first the office has to build a list. The mailer includes an invitation for recipients to sign up on the website.\n\nGallagher\u2019s office didn\u2019t leave behind any e-mail distribution lists it had compiled, MacKenzie said, so O\u2019Brien\u2019s staff is starting from scratch.\n\n\u201cDuring the campaign, so many people I spoke to asked me, \u2018How are you going to communicate with me?\u2019 \u201d O\u2019Brien said in a comment provided by his office. \u201cWe publish an email newsletter every month, it\u2019s just that lots of people in Denver don\u2019t subscribe to it yet. Part of the reason we mailed the Action Card was to encourage residents to sign up for the electronic newsletter, and many have.\u201d\n\nThe office said it tried to avoid heavy promotion of O\u2019Brien, who will face re-election in three years, instead focusing on what the office is doing \u2014 similar to how legislators can send constituents taxpayer-paid mail describing what they are working on.\n\n\u201cWith the Action Card, we tried to transmit as much substantive information as we could, condensing our 22-page audit plan into an inexpensive format,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI\u2019ve already gotten feedback from recipients who are impressed with the number of audits in our plan. As an added bonus, we\u2019ve gotten information from the community on what their concerns are about city government. This is important input for current and future audits.\u201d\n\nMacKenzie, a former City Council member hired by O\u2019Brien after he took office, said the money for the mailers came from unspent money in the 2015 budget, since O\u2019Brien had not finished filling out executive positions.\n\nShe said Gallagher used the office\u2019s budget last year for activities that included producing a 20-page, full-color booklet promoting Gallagher\u2019s impact as auditor over his dozen years in office. His supporters also made a short documentary about Gallagher\u2019s public service, but Gallagher says that effort didn\u2019t use taxpayer money.\n\nO\u2019Brien has been less visible so far. But he recently had his most visible moment when his office released a scathing and outrage-spurring audit of Rocky Mountain Human Services, a nonprofit that receives dedicated tax revenue to serve disabled people. It was found to have misused millions of dollars.\n\nCurrently, the auditor\u2019s office homepage seems to revel in the attention the audit received by summarizing reaction and linking to various media reports, including several articles and editorials run by The Denver Post.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Dennis Gallagher,Kathleen MacKenzie,Tim O'Brien", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "A recent taxpayer-funded mailer sent to 50,000 homes is among recent promotional efforts by new Denver Auditor Tim O'Brien.", "title": "New Denver auditor sends taxpayer-funded promotional mailer", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2016/01/16/new-denver-auditor-tim-obrien-sends-taxpayer-funded-mailer-promoting-office/124558/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/05/Obrien-495x495.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "A recent taxpayer-funded mailer sent to 50,000 homes is among recent promotional efforts by new Denver Auditor Tim O'Brien.", "title": "New Denver Auditor Tim O\u2019Brien raises profile with taxpayer-funded mailer promoting office", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2016/01/16/new-denver-auditor-tim-obrien-sends-taxpayer-funded-mailer-promoting-office/124558/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/05/Obrien-495x495.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "A recent taxpayer-funded mailer sent to 50,000 homes is among recent promotional efforts by new Denver Auditor Tim O'Brien."}, "article_summary": "Denver Auditor Tim O\u2019Brien had a low profile even when he won the office last spring.\nUPDATED (Jan. 20): Former Auditor Dennis Gallagher has clarified an assertion by current Auditor Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s spokeswoman that a documentary about Gallagher was produced using taxpayer money.\nOn the promotional side, a recent mailer to 50,000 homes introduces O\u2019Brien and outlines some of the Denver auditor\u2019s office functions, along with laying out some details of its audit plan for this year.\nSince he succeeded three-term Auditor Dennis Gallagher \u2014 a Denver political icon from decades in elected office at the state and local levels \u2014 he\u2019s had flashy shoes to fill with his lower-key approach.\n\u201cWith the Action Card, we tried to transmit as much substantive information as we could, condensing our 22-page audit plan into an inexpensive format,\u201d O\u2019Brien said."}
