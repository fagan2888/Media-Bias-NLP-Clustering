For Capital High School\u2019s drama program, all the practice is worth it as they get ready for their winter production, \u201cAnd Then They Came For Me: Remembering The World of Anne Frank.\u201d\n\nThis production is very different from what students are used to performing. It\u2019s a multimedia show, using video interviews to tell the story of Eva Schloss and Ed Silverberg, both survivors of the holocaust who knew Anne Frank personally. Ed and Eva tell their story through interviews, while students act out flashbacks.\n\nCHS student actors find their roles to be both challenging and rewarding. Sophomore Kameron Bustetter, who plays Ed says, \u201cIt\u2019s been a journey so far and it\u2019s going to continue to be.\u201d\n\nThe cast has done extensive research as a group on the Holocaust and the events that transpired. They want to immerse themselves in it, so they can do justice to the real life characters they play and the difficult era in history. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to imagine something so terrible happening to you, but these are real people and real stories,\u201d says Sophie Bustetter, who plays Eva. \u201cWe want to do justice to their story.\u201d\n\nThe students have found portraying real life people especially challenging. \u201cYou can\u2019t make up how they would act or their mannerisms,\u201d explains Kameron. \u201cYou have to go out and find how that person acted, how they said and pronounced things.\u201d\n\nHayley Kuster, who plays Anne Frank adds, \u201cit\u2019s definitely harder when you play a real character because you can\u2019t make up a story for them.\u201d Though difficult she has found the process rewarding. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of fun researching, watching movies and seeing how different people have interpreted her.\u201d\n\nDirector and drama teacher Kristina Cummins believes her cast has done a wonderful job overcoming these obstacles. \u201cI\u2019m so incredibly proud of my cast and crew,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey have embraced the material, and are seeking a depth of understanding for the Holocaust and the characters that they\u2019re portraying.\u201d\n\nFor the tech crew, the multimedia production has posed different challenges. Timing is everything when it comes to the projection screen that is on stage for the duration of the show. \u201cThe challenge of this show is that you have to match it up,\u201d says Stage Manager Graceanne Moses of the live acting and the recorded real-life interviews. Besides Eva and Ed\u2019s interviews, there will also be pictures of them and Anne that match up to scene being acted out on stage.\n\nThe students feel that despite the many challenges, it\u2019s a story that needs telling. While first reading the scripts, the cast immediately felt an emotional connection. Sophie shares of the script, \u201cIt\u2019s so intense.\u201d The cast is hoping to move the audience in the same manner with their performance.\n\nHandling such difficult and emotional material is made easier by the close knit relationships among the cast. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to do a harder show like this when everyone around you is positive,\u201d Kuster explains.\n\nThe cast usually works for a couple hours, every day after school. Outside rehearsals, they also bond together through various team building exercises such as volunteering together at the Thurston County Food Bank.\n\nTo the cast, it\u2019s more than just a show. It\u2019s more than a performance or the compilation of hours of rehearsals. It\u2019s more than memorized lines or perfecting the character. It\u2019s a story that needs to be told. It\u2019s a message that needs to be spread.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had conversations together about why we need to tell this story,\u201d Cummins explains. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that the only way to combat hate is through compassion and love.\u201d It\u2019s a message that can be applied to all aspects of life, in the CHS production, the lives of the cast and crew and in our own lives as well.\n\nCummins hopes that the audience takes something away from this performance. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to remind our community to continue to have compassion for one another.\u201d\n\nThe show continues January 29 and 30 at 7:30 p.m. and January 31 at 2:30 p.m. Each performance will be held in the Performing Arts Auditorium at Capital High School, 2707 Conger Avenue N.W., Olympia.\n\nTickets are $7 for students and senior citizens and $10 for the general public.\n\nCall the box office at (360) 596-8053 for more information and to reserve your tickets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Lauren Frasier, Capital High School Intern to ThurstonTalk The cast has been working hard to tell their character's stories.
