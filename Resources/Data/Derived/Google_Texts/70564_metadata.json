(NYSE: HUM) announced today that Humana At Home has acquired the business of South Florida-based Your Home Advantage (YHA), a leading provider of nurse practitioner in-home visits.\n\nThis transaction with YHA results in a strengthening of Humana\u2019s home-based capabilities, allowing for better integration with the company\u2019s clinical model through tighter connections with other clinical programs and integration of the care management team and related clinical data. By improving the integration of the clinical model, Humana can further enhance both member engagement and the overall consumer experience. YHA\u2019s service area covers multiple states with a concentration in Florida, Texas, Georgia and Missouri.\n\n\u201cThe capabilities that Your Home Advantage brings us will help Humana build on the significant clinical results that Humana At Home has achieved for our Medicare Advantage members living with chronic conditions,\u201d said Eric C. Rackow, M.D., Humana At Home President. \u201cTogether we can foster a broader care platform that enables us to provide members more beneficial health-related services in the comfort of their homes. By shifting care to the home, we\u2019re better able to meet member needs as well as improve clinical outcomes.\u201d\n\nFinancial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Additionally, the transaction is not anticipated to materially impact Humana\u2019s earnings per diluted common share for the year ending December 31, 2015. Humana subsidiaries and joint ventures accounted for approximately 70 percent of YHA\u2019s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nCautionary Statement\n\nThis news release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in investor presentations, press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of Humana\u2019s executive officers, the words or phrases like \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201clikely will result,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cprojects\u201d or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the company\u2019s SEC filings, a summary of which includes but is not limited to the following:\n\nIf Humana does not design and price its products properly and competitively, if the premiums Humana receives are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to its members, if the company is unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for its members, lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of its members, or if its estimates of benefits expense are inadequate, Humana\u2019s profitability could be materially adversely affected. Humana estimates the costs of its benefit expense payments, and designs and prices its products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. These estimates, however, involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends.\n\nIf Humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic initiatives, particularly its Medicare initiatives, state-based contract strategy, and its participation in the new health insurance exchanges, the company\u2019s business may be materially adversely affected, which is of particular importance given the concentration of the company\u2019s revenues in these products.\n\nIf Humana fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, to strategically implement new information systems, to protect Humana\u2019s proprietary rights to its systems, or to defend against cyber-security attacks, the company\u2019s business may be materially adversely affected.\n\nHumana\u2019s business may be materially adversely impacted by the adoption of a new coding set for diagnoses (commonly known as ICD-10), the implementation of which has been deferred to at least October 1, 2015.\n\nHumana is involved in various legal actions, or disputes that could lead to legal actions (such as, among other things, provider contract disputes relating to rate adjustments resulting from the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, commonly referred to as \u201csequestration\u201d; other provider contract disputes; and qui tam litigation brought by individuals on behalf of the government) and governmental and internal investigations, any of which, if resolved unfavorably to the company, could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in its business practices. Increased litigation and negative publicity could also increase the company\u2019s cost of doing business.\n\nAs a government contractor, Humana is exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect its business or its willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs including, among other things, loss of material government contracts, governmental audits and investigations, potential inadequacy of government-determined payment rates, potential restrictions on profitability, including by comparison of profitability of the company\u2019s Medicare Advantage business to non-Medicare Advantage business, or other changes in the governmental programs in which Humana participates.\n\nThe Health Care Reform Law, including The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, could have a material adverse effect on Humana\u2019s results of operations, including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting the company\u2019s ability to expand into new markets, increasing the company's medical and operating costs by, among other things, requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products, lowering the company\u2019s Medicare payment rates and increasing the company\u2019s expenses associated with a non-deductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments; the company\u2019s financial position, including the company's ability to maintain the value of its goodwill; and the company\u2019s cash flows.\n\nHumana\u2019s participation in the new federal and state health care exchanges, which entail uncertainties associated with mix, volume of business, and the operation of premium stabilization programs, which are subject to federal administrative action, could adversely affect the company\u2019s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nHumana\u2019s business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase the company\u2019s cost of doing business and may adversely affect the company\u2019s business, profitability and cash flows.\n\nIf Humana fails to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to its members, the company\u2019s business may be adversely affected.\n\nHumana\u2019s pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects it to regulations in addition to those the company faces with its core health benefits businesses.\n\nChanges in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect Humana\u2019s financial performance.\n\nIf Humana does not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels, Humana\u2019s gross margins may decline.\n\nHumana\u2019s ability to obtain funds from certain of its licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations.\n\nDowngrades in Humana\u2019s debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nThe securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption, which may adversely affect Humana\u2019s business.\n\nIn making forward-looking statements, Humana is not undertaking to address or update them in future filings or communications regarding its business or results. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed herein may or may not occur. There also may be other risks that the company is unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.\n\nHumana advises investors to read the following documents as filed by the company with the SEC for further discussion both of the risks it faces and its historical performance:\n\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014;\n\nForm 8-Ks filed during 2015.\n\nAbout Your Home Advantage\n\nYour Home Advantage (YHA) is a healthcare management company dedicated to improving clinical and quality outcomes by bridging the gap between the physician\u2019s office and the member\u2019s home.
