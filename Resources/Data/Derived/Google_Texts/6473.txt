(KSNV) Magicians Siegfried & Roy are welcoming three new snowy white lion cubs to their Secret Garden habitat on the Las Vegas Strip.

The 14-week-old felines were born near Johannesburg, South Africa. They were brought to the Mirage casino three weeks ago. The lion cubs will be available for public viewing starting on Friday.

The cubs are named Freedom, Madiba and Timba-Masai. They have rare white coats after inheriting their parents' recessive genes. They are expected to weigh 500 pounds each when they reach their full size in two to four years.
