A number cited as evidence of interest in the program. However, it is not clear how many of those who have visited the site were able to successfully use it, or stopped because of technical issues and slow speeds.\n\n\u201cWe would expect based on experiences watching other programs like that of Massachusetts, that the first month number will be low, particularly since insurance doesn't actually start until January 1. We expect the first couple of months is mostly people gathering information and learning more, purchasing is likely to come later,\u201d the senior administration official said.\n\nThe official rejected suggestions that the administration\u2019s reluctance to share numbers was because the website\u2019s myriad glitches were keeping so many people from registering for health insurance, that the number of those who have managed to actually sign up is embarrass ingly low.\n\nAs of Friday, around 52,000 insurance applications have been started online on the sites of the 24 states that are operating their own exchanges, based on CNN\u2019s own survey.\n\nEven supporters of the president have complained about the website\u2019s inefficiency, with The Washington Post\u2019s liberal columnist Ezra Klein writing a story titled \u201cObamacare\u2019s Web site is really bad.\u201d\n\nThis weekend, in fact, the administration took the application part of the website down for maintenance during off-peak hours.\n\nAll of it is grist for Republican critics, such as House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who said in a statement on Friday that the \u201cnews that its enrollment system is already going offline confirms that the launch of the president\u2019s health care law has been an unmitigated disaster. What the administration wanted to dismiss as simple glitches have turned out to be a system-wide failure. The White House cannot even say how many Americans were able to navigate the fatally-flawed system to actually enroll in a plan.\u201d\n\nBoehner said that the announcement was \u201cmore proof that we need to delay the law.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Monday, \u201cInformation technology experts who examined the healthcare.gov website at the request of The Wall Street Journal said the site appeared to be built on a sloppy software foundation. Such a hastily constructed website may not have been able to withstand the online demand last week, they said. Engineers at Web-hosting company Media Temple Inc. found a glut of stray software code that served no purpose they could identify. They also said basic Web-efficiency techniques weren't used, such as saving parts of the website that change infrequently so they can be loaded more quickly. Those factors clog the website's plumbing, Media Temple said.\u201d\n\nBut the senior administration official rejected suggestions from internet technology experts that the website is poorly designed and flawed.\n\n\u201cVolume is the problem,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe are expanding capacity to deal with it but \u2013 evidently \u2013 that is a delicate and long process.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press Friday, President Barack Obama told would-be enrollees, \u201cThey definitely shouldn't give up. Typically, what happens is when people are shopping for insurance, they visit a site or make phone calls or look at brochures five, six, seven times before they make a final decision. And they're not going to have to pay premiums until December \u2013 the insurance doesn't start until January. So they'll have plenty of time. And my message to them would be, each day the wait times are reduced. Each day, more and more people are signing up, and the product will save you money. People will save hundreds of dollars \u2013 in some cases, thousands of dollars \u2013 as a consequence of being able to get health insurance that is priced for them and gives them the choices that they need.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "By CNN Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper The Obama administration is not planning on releasing enrollment numbers on Obamacare until November, senior administration officials said Monday, as they continued to insist that delays with the healthcare.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Obama administration: No Obamacare enrollment numbers until November at earliest, volume is problem on website", "og": {"url": "http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/07/obama-administration-no-obamacare-enrollment-numbers-until-november-at-earliest-volume-is-problem-on-website/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131002191139-tsr-moos-obamacare-sign-up-glitches-00000812-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By CNN Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper\r\n\r\nThe Obama administration is not planning on releasing enrollment numbers on Obamacare until November, senior administration officials said Monday, as they continued to insist that delays with the healthcare.", "title": "Obama administration: No Obamacare enrollment numbers until November at earliest, volume is problem on website"}, "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "The Lead with Jake Tapper", "keywords": "national lead, jake tapper", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/4737184dce24053dfe8c239d71594a1e?s=16"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe will release monthly data when it is available,\u201d a senior administration official told CNN.\nWe expect the first couple of months is mostly people gathering information and learning more, purchasing is likely to come later,\u201d the senior administration official said.\nThose factors clog the website's plumbing, Media Temple said.\u201dBut the senior administration official rejected suggestions from internet technology experts that the website is poorly designed and flawed.\nBy CNN Chief Washington Correspondent Jake TapperThe Obama administration is not planning on releasing enrollment numbers on Obamacare until November, senior administration officials said Monday, as they continued to insist that delays with the healthcare.gov website were entirely the result of high volume.\nSuch a hastily constructed website may not have been able to withstand the online demand last week, they said."}
