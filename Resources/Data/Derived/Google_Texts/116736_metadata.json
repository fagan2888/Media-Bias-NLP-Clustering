I'm not a fan of tattoos. I see many people get the tattoos,\" Trump tells Piers Morgan. \"I don't know what's going on nowadays, but just everybody's getting tattoos. Many of them regret it later.\"\n\nThe reigning Miss Kansas, and a sergeant in the U.S. Army, Vail is choosing not to cover her ink during the event, as she feels it provides her with a platform to help empower women. Trumps stance, meanwhile, is based not only on an ideal, but also on aesthetics and execution:\n\n\"Many of them are done by people that aren't even artists. They have no talent, they have less talent than I would have in putting on a tattoo. I see these people with tic-tac-toe boards on their arms and legs,\" notes the man whose net worth exceeds three billion dollars. \"I don't understand what's going on with the tattoos. I would certainly not want it. I would not want anybody that I'm close to to have it.\"\n\nWatch the rest of the clip to hear Trump's analysis of tattooed pro basketball players, then tune in this evening at 9 for the rest of Morgan's interview with the man who once chose not to fire him, instead choosing to crown him the first-ever winner of \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\"\n\n-\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the abdominal artwork of Theresa Vail captures that attention - and in some cases, ire - of the media and beauty pageant community leading up to Sunday's Miss America contest, this evening \"Piers Morgan Live\" invites renowned television personality and business magnate Donald Trump to share his c...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Donald Trump on Miss Kansas' tattoos:  \"I don't know what's going on nowadays, everybody's getting tattoos\"", "og": {"url": "http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/13/donald-trump-on-miss-kansas-tattoos-i-dont-know-whats-going-on-nowadays-everybodys-getting-tattoos/", "image": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/sect/blogs/fb/piersMorgan.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "As the abdominal artwork of Theresa Vail captures that attention - and in some cases, ire - of the media and beauty pageant community leading up to Sunday's Miss America contest, this evening \"Piers Morgan Live\" invites renowned television personality and business magnate Donald Trump to share his c...", "title": "Donald Trump on Miss Kansas' tattoos:  \"I don't know what's going on nowadays, everybody's getting tattoos\""}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Piers Morgan", "keywords": "piers morgan live, jason kurtz", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/169bdd3c913ad32d5e743b1d82ca1052?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded57\"", "article_summary": "-\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram\nI see many people get the tattoos,\" Trump tells Piers Morgan.\nThe owner of the Miss Universe Organization, which produces the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA pageants, Trump was rather clear in expressing his staunch disapproval of body art:\"We don't encourage it.\n\"I don't know what's going on nowadays, but just everybody's getting tattoos.\n\"I don't understand what's going on with the tattoos."}
