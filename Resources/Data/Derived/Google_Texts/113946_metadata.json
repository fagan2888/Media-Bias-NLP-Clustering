If the debt ceiling is not raised by early November, the U.S. government will not have enough money on hand to pay the millions of bills and other obligations that come due every day.\n\nIn response, House Republicans have a plan. It isn\u2019t a plan to raise the debt ceiling, though, even though that is currently the only viable option for avoiding default. It is, instead, a scheme to allow the government to claim \u2013 in the narrowest possible technical sense \u2013 that when it stops making payments to some of its creditors that it hasn\u2019t actually \u201cdefaulted.\u201d\n\nRelated: What a Debt Ceiling Disaster Could Mean to You\n\nThe plan, which could come to the House floor next week, relies on making a distinction between a \u201cdebt default\u201d and more generalized default. The so-called Default Prevention Act makes it possible for the Treasury Department to borrow additional money \u201csolely\u201d for the purpose of making principle and interest payments on the nation\u2019s publicly-held debt and debt held by the Social Security trust funds.\n\nThe measure basically prioritizes bondholders and Social Security recipients over everyone else the government owes money to \u2013 veterans, contractors, government employees, and more.\n\nProtecting the reliability of U.S. Treasury debt is, of course, vitally important. The U.S. enjoys extraordinarily low interest rates on its debt precisely because bondholders are confident that they will be repaid on time and in full. Treasury securities are the closest thing investors can get to a completely risk-free asset.\n\nThe stability of Treasury debt actually underpins much of the U.S. economy \u2013 interest rates on it serve as benchmarks for other assets, pension funds hold government bonds for their investors, and banks and insurance firms rely on them as stable, but liquid, assets.\n\nRelated: McConnell\u2019s Last Stand \u2013 He Wants Medicare, Social Security Cuts to Raise Debt Limit\n\nSo, yes. Not defaulting on federal debt is important. But making a distinction between \u201cdebt default\u201d and default in general is practically meaningless. Money owed is a debt, regardless of whom it is owed to, and the credit markets aren\u2019t that stupid.\n\nIf the Treasury paid off bondholders, but denied pay to the military and stiffed contractors, building infrastructure projects and government employees, the credit markets would immediately begin viewing U.S. government debt as much riskier. Rates would go up, credit ratings would come down, and the Treasury would be facing a situation similar to what it could expect from missing a bond payment, except with the added bonus of voters furious about their missing checks.\n\nIn a blog post on the Treasury website Friday afternoon, Treasury spokesman Daniel Watson wrote, \u201cProponents of this legislation claim that missing payments on some of our obligations, while prioritizing principal and interest, would be acceptable. On the contrary, it would be untenable for the United States to pick and choose which payments to default on, and is just another distraction from what Congress needs to do: take action to raise the debt limit as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nRep. Xavier Becerra (D-CA), the chairman of the House Democratic Conference, took the opportunity of looming default to blast the GOP.\n\nRelated: The Debt Ceiling \u2013 What Is It and Why Should We Care?\n\n\u201cIn this Republican-led Congress, governing has become a casualty of Republicans' protracted political civil war. Like a government shutdown, a payment default could deeply damage our economic recovery and risk the livelihood of millions of American families.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAmericans know that playing with credit is no game. Payment deadlines are real. The clock is ticking; default is not an option. I urge my Republican colleagues to resolve their feuding and let's get to work.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), who has announced his desire to retire at the end of the month \u2013 assuming he can find someone willing to take his job \u2013 and has hinted that he wants to strike a debt limit deal before he goes. But the misleadingly named Default Prevention Act is almost as bad as no deal at all.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With the government on the edge of fiscal crisis, House Republicans are floating a scheme to allow the government to claim \u2013 in the narrowest possible technical sense \u2013 that when it stops making payments to some of its creditors that it hasn\u2019t actually \u201cdefaulted.\u201d", "title": "House GOP Hatches Harebrained Debt Ceiling Fix", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/16/House-GOP-Hatches-Harebrained-Debt-Ceiling-Fix", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01072013_debt_ceiling_capitol_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/16/House-GOP-Hatches-Harebrained-Debt-Ceiling-Fix", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01072013_debt_ceiling_capitol_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With the government on the edge of fiscal crisis, House Republicans are floating a scheme to allow the government to claim \u2013 in the narrowest possible technical sense \u2013 that when it stops making payments to some of its creditors that it hasn\u2019t actually \u201cdefaulted.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb9bc\"", "article_summary": "It isn\u2019t a plan to raise the debt ceiling, though, even though that is currently the only viable option for avoiding default.\nRelated: The Debt Ceiling \u2013 What Is It and Why Should We Care?\nProtecting the reliability of U.S. Treasury debt is, of course, vitally important.\nBut making a distinction between \u201cdebt default\u201d and default in general is practically meaningless.\nIf the debt ceiling is not raised by early November, the U.S. government will not have enough money on hand to pay the millions of bills and other obligations that come due every day."}
