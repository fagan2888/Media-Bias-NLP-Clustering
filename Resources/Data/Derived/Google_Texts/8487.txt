Police believe a man whose body was found outside a downtown Wichita church died of natural causes.

Monday morning, a passerby spotted the body near 2nd and Topeka and called 911. Emergency crews responded and the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police say the man, who was in his 50s, was homeless and had been sleeping in the area. They believe he died from natural causes but an autopsy will be performed later this week.

Another homeless man is being questioned by officers for allegedly taking items from the body.
