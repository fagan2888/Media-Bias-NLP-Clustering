Every month!\" Says Kirkpatrick.\n\nAnd she's just 18 months from the premium doubling for her three-year-old as well.\n\n\"I would like to not blame state government but I whole hearteldy do.\" Said Kirkpatrick.\n\nHowever, the Florida Healthy Kids Board of Directors has something to say about that.\n\n\"This has nothing to do with the governors or the legislatures position on medicaid expansion or any of that, says Wendy Sartory Link, the chair of the board.\n\n\"This is not something you're happy about obviously?\" Asked Werksma.\n\n\"Well, we're happy we're able to offer a full pay plan still as an option but certainly we're not happy about the increased cost, no,\" said Link.\n\nLink says the state is only required to offer the subsidized plan but decided to continue the full payer option as a convenience. Families like the Kirkpatrick's say there's nothing convenieint about the cost.\n\n\"So do they have any options right now?\" asked Werksma. \"Sure,\" answered Link. \"They can go through the federal market place. They can get private insurance.\"\n\nKirkpatrick says her family has already contacted the broker who helped she and her husband enroll for insurance through the federal health care exchange. She says however her family handles this crisis, she thinks the state could have handled it better.\n\n\"I'm angry but i think I'm more sad because I think a lot of kids are going to get dumped out into the system and I think it's going to just increase the cost of healthcare more than it already is, said Kirkpatrick.\n\nThe premium increase for Florida Healthy Kids families that don't qualify for subsidized plans will takes effect October 1.\n\nHealthcare professionals say if you're affected by this premium hike you can enroll your kids in private insurance or through the federal exchange immediately. If you have insurance through your employer, check the policy because you may need to wait for open enrollment.", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "Families\u00a0with healthcare through \"Florida Healthy Kids\" are finding out this week that their rates will soon be doubling.", "author": "Jared Werksma", "og": {"site_name": "WPTV", "description": "Families\u00a0with healthcare through Florida Healthy Kids are finding out this week that their rates will soon be doubling.", "title": "Healthcare premiums to double for more than 34,000 Florida kids", "url": "http://www.wptv.com/news/health/healthcare-premiums-to-double-for-more-than-34000-florida-kids", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media2.wptv.com/photo/2014/11/17/wptv-health-care_1416247689718_9647738_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 483190653, "iphone": 487668935}}, "site": "@wptv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "Healthcare costs doubling for families", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.wptv.com,recp.mkt32.net", "hasVideo": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 207362756082470}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false", "author": "Jared Werksma"}, "keywords": "Health,Homepage Showcase,Tablet Showcase,Mobile Showcase", "google-site-verification": "wC61UByVj5fiZY--ruGCAnX8tqv4rXry8Pfwou1uSO0", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WPTV5", "section": "Health", "published_time": "2015-08-19T08:08:44+0000", "modified_time": "2015-08-19T08:08:44+0000", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Families with healthcare through \"Florida Healthy Kids\" are finding out this week that their rates will soon be doubling.\nKirkpatrick says her 9-year-old son has been insured by Florida Healthy Kids since he turned eligible at age 5.\nThe board for Florida Healthy Kids says one of the most expensive changes is the elimination of a lifetime insurance cap.\nThe premium increase for Florida Healthy Kids families that don't qualify for subsidized plans will takes effect October 1.\nThe spike is due to Florida Healthy Kids needing to meet minimum requirements of the Affordable Health Care Act."}
