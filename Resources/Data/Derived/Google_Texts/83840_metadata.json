One major liberal wish-list entry, immigration reform, seemed not only within reach but almost inevitable.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama hasn\u2019t gotten back on track since,\u201d observes the leftist political correspondent\u2014either uncannily shrewdly or by frantically grasping at a bizarre, illogical explanation.\n\nJust as immigration reform was about to happen, \u201cLanza\u2019s rampage altered the debate in Washington.\u201d Obama, who once told his political director Patrick Gaspard that he thinks he is \u201ca better political director than my political director,\u201d had no choice but to pour all of his energies into a failed attempt at federal gun control legislation.\n\n\u201cDemocrats moved ahead with gun control first,\u201d Seitz-Wald recalls, because the fresh memories of 20 murdered children and six murdered adults would help the left demagogue the issue more effectively. However, a Republican filibuster caused even a watered-down bill to die in April.\n\nSimultaneously, the National Journal reporter laments, pushing gun control \u201cantagonized the populist libertarian Right, the same people whom mainstream Republicans and Democrats needed to stay on the sidelines for immigration reform to succeed.\u201d\n\nSeitz-Wald mentions that the Boston Marathon bombing \u201coccurred just two days before gun control officially died in the Senate\u201d but this fact doesn\u2019t help his thesis, so he ignores it.\n\nHe then notes the Benghazi scandal, the IRS targeting scandal, the Justice Department surveillance scandal and the Edward Snowden leaks. \u201cMany of these developments deepened partisan resentments.\u201d\n\nThere was also Syria and, of course, the Obamacare fiasco.\n\nThe next thing you know, Obama\u2019s approval rating has now fallen to the high 30s.\n\nIt all started with crazy Adam Lanza, though. \u201cThe tragedy in Connecticut shocked the nation\u2019s and the president\u2019s conscience, and he felt compelled to respond to polls that showed overwhelming support for action.\u201d\n\nBut for a school shooting in Connecticut last year, Seitz-Wald says, Obama\u2019s second term would be totally different.
