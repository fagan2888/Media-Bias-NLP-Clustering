Despite his overwhelming respect and admiration for President Obama, Bernie Sanders said tonight that if he’s elected, he won’t repeat Obama’s “biggest political mistake.”

Sanders spoke with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes tonight at length about his boost in the polls, his legislative experience, the Syrian refugee crisis, and the plight of the middle class.

But as Sanders said, no president––”not the best president in the history of the world”––can really address the biggest issues facing Americans today without a “political revolution.”

And this is where his critique of Obama came in:

“Biggest political mistake that he made is after his brilliant campaign in 2008, he basically said to the millions of people who supported him, ‘Thanks for getting me elected, I will take it from here.’ I will not make that mistake.”

Sanders said as president, he will be working with millions of Americans to make sure they join his fight for a better America.
