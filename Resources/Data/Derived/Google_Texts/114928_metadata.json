They\u2019ll go 16-0 in the regular season, and they\u2019ll return to the Super Bowl, where they will again face the Seahawks.\n\nAnd this time, Gonzalez said, the Broncos will go home with the Lombardi Trophy in hand.\n\n\u201cRight now, Denver has a team built just like the New England Patriots back when they went undefeated [in the 2007 regular season],\u201d Gonzalez told Newsday.\n\n\u201cIn looking at Denver in the preseason and Peyton Manning\u2019s command of that offense, he\u2019ll pick up right where he left off last year. And defensively, they went out like good organizations do and addressed their weaknesses.\u201d\n\nThe 2007 Patriots were the last team to go unbeaten in a 16-game season, but they lost to the Giants in the Super Bowl, thanks to David Tyree\u2019s memorable catch (with a little help from his helmet) late in the fourth quarter that led to the winning score. The 1972 Dolphins, meanwhile, still stand as the only NFL team to finish with a perfect record (17-0).\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a Denver-Seattle rematch in the Super Bowl,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cAnd I would go with Denver this time. Giving Peyton two shots at it, to go against the same team, I\u2019ll take Peyton. He didn\u2019t have his All-Pro left tackle [Ryan Clady] against them last year [in Seattle\u2019s 43-8 romp] and they didn\u2019t have their right corner [Chris Harris].\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they can stay healthy, how do you beat this team?\u201d Gonzalez added, acknowledging the team\u2019s defensive acquisitions during the offseason. \u201cThey\u2019re balanced on both sides of the ball. They can run, they can pass, they can stop the run and they can stop the pass now on a consistent basis. It\u2019s going to be very, very tough to beat them.\n\n\u201cYou better play mistake-free football and come up with some luck plays, just like New England got beat by a luck play against the Giants in the Super Bowl. That\u2019s the only reason they got beat. If you don\u2019t have that play, it\u2019s over.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Broncos,NFL,Peyton Manning,Ryan Clady,Seahawks,Super Bowl,Tony Gonzalez", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Tony Gonzalez believes the Broncos will go 16-0 in the regular season and defeat the Seahawks in the Super Bowl this season.", "title": "Tony Gonzalez said the Broncos will go 16-0 and win the Super Bowl this season", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/20/tony-gonzalez-broncos-will-go-undefeated-season/28934/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/broncos-seahawks-495x316.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Tony Gonzalez believes the Broncos will go 16-0 in the regular season and defeat the Seahawks in the Super Bowl this season.", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/20/tony-gonzalez-broncos-will-go-undefeated-season/28934/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/broncos-seahawks-495x316.jpg", "title": "Tony Gonzalez: Broncos will go undefeated this season", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Tony Gonzalez believes the Broncos will go 16-0 in the regular season and defeat the Seahawks in the Super Bowl this season."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c29\"", "article_summary": "They\u2019ll go 16-0 in the regular season, and they\u2019ll return to the Super Bowl, where they will again face the Seahawks.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a Denver-Seattle rematch in the Super Bowl,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\u201cRight now, Denver has a team built just like the New England Patriots back when they went undefeated [in the 2007 regular season],\u201d Gonzalez told Newsday.\n\u201cYou better play mistake-free football and come up with some luck plays, just like New England got beat by a luck play against the Giants in the Super Bowl.\nAnd this time, Gonzalez said, the Broncos will go home with the Lombardi Trophy in hand."}
