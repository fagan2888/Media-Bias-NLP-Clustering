Consumers have spent hours trying to sign up for health insurance on the Massachusetts Health Connector\u2019s problematic website and waiting for help from customer service representatives.\n\nBut just imagine how frustrating the Connector\u2019s problems have been for Tom Policelli, chief executive of Minuteman Health. The new insurer launched just as the state\u2019s new website went live this fall, knowing that many people would be shopping for insurance to comply with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA longtime insurance executive, Policelli has worked for CIGNA Healthcare, led a division at United Health Group, and co-founded Averde Health, a provider contract management company.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nI talked with Policelli Friday morning about the goals of Minuteman and how they have been affected by the Connector\u2019s slow progress. Here is our conversation, edited for length and clarity:\n\nWhy were you interested in leading Minuteman?\n\nPolicelli: Massachusetts has done a very good job covering people, but it has not done such a great job making it affordable for people to have coverage. Eastern Massachusetts in particular is a market that has just been fascinating\u2014how broken it has been\u2014in terms of delivering value to consumers. There is radical price differential in the marketplace. I\u2019ve always viewed Boston as being a market with great opportunity.\n\nWhat is Minuteman Health? What is the goal of the company, exactly?\n\nPolicelli: Our goal has been to be significantly cheaper than the big three\u2014Blue Cross, Harvard Pilgrim, and Tufts Health Plan. Could we save your typical family over $1,000 per year? If you compare our metallic tier pricing to the big three, you see that we\u2019ve done that.\n\nWhy launch at the same time as the Connector role out?\n\nPolicelli: We have targeted individual and small group [customers], just given the enrollment cycle and the big rollout that the Connector has made. But we can serve any size employer with all sorts of different products.\n\nIt\u2019s been important for us as the new entrant to make people understand that they should comparison price. If they go shopping, they are going to see the brands that they have known for a long time, and then they are going to see we have significantly different pricing. Then, they can see if we\u2019re the right plan for them.\n\nWe really want to be spreadsheeted. Typically, health care pricing has been very confusing, and that\u2019s benefited most insurance companies. Pricing should be very simple, and we invite people to compare prices against the big carriers.\n\nHow are you keeping costs low? What difference will people see in what your plans offer?\n\nPolicelli: Two big inputs that go into prices are the administrative costs and the medical costs. The administrative costs are a smaller part. If you were in our offices, you would see, we are not your mahogany insurance company. We are extremely low-cost. That\u2019s our culture.\n\nOn the medical cost side, we have focused on those higher efficiency providers. We do not have every single hospital in Boston in our network.... It\u2019s been really taking the market and breaking it down and saying, who exactly are we looking to serve, and what do they need?\n\nI have written a lot about the Connector\u2019s problematic relaunch. Only a few thousand people have been able to choose their own health plan. Many more have been put in temporary coverage through the state while the Connector fixes the system. How much did your early plans for Minuteman rely on Connector business?\n\nPolicelli: Obviously it\u2019s been very unfortunate. The bad news, as you just said, is that the number of true shoppers in the marketplace, people who can shop and close the sale, if you will, has been a lot lower than any of us have predicted. That\u2019s been the frustration for all of us, including the Connector.\n\nThe good news is that from the very early data, about 8 to 10 percent of shoppers [are buying Minuteman plans]. When the consumer can make a decision on a plan, we\u2019ve done well. Unfortunately, it\u2019s been a low number of people thus far. We are looking forward to the fixes, as more and more people can sign up.\n\nThe old Connector website had a very easy-to-use price comparison tool. The new website has one but it is not as easy to find, and I think it\u2019s not as clear. I would imagine that\u2019s a problem for you. You\u2019re asking customers to compare you with others and judge for themselves, right?\n\nPolicelli: The new Connector and the old Connector are very different in terms of what we can see, what looks different on the site. It\u2019s also very different because the new Connector had much, much higher aspirations, serving different populations and with a much more complicated eligibility process... I think the Connector is as frustrated as everyone else on some of the changes, or the impact that some of those changes have had. It hasn\u2019t worked out as all of us had hoped.\n\nIt\u2019s a real shame. I know it will be fixed, and a lot of people are working on it. In the meantime, I think it\u2019s very important for people to know that they still can get comparisons out there, if they go to [Health Services Administrators] website or if they go through our website.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "1.0.54843695", "eomportal-id": 246190, "description": "Minuteman Health launched just as the state\u2019s new insurance website went live this fall, knowing that many people would be shopping for new insurance to comply with the Affordable Care Act.
