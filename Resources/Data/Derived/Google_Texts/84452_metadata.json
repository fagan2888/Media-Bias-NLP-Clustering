Open enrollment for New York State of Health takes place November 15, 2014 through February 15, 2015.\n\n\u201cHHC wants to help people make the most of their health coverage options,\u201d said HHC President Dr. Ram Raju. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act and the State\u2019s health insurance exchange offer many people subsidies to make health coverage affordable. Our partnership with CMS will help City residents understand the ACA and maximize their Medicare benefits.\u201d\n\nWorkshop participants will learn about:\n\nThe benefits of the Medicare program and how to apply;\n\nThe parts of Medicare \u2013 Part A: hospital insurance; Part B: medical insurance \u2013 outpatient visits, lab work, preventive services; Part C: health plans; and Part D: prescription drug coverage;\n\nThe Medicare appeals process;\n\nThe Medicare programs in place for people with limited income and resources;\n\nMedicare information and resources now available online;\n\nUpdates on the New York State of Health;\n\nEnrollment resources for the uninsured.\n\nCMS is the federal agency that provides health coverage for 100 million people through Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Medicare is a health insurance program for people age 65 or older, people younger than 65 with disabilities, and people with end stage renal disease who require dialysis or a transplant.\n\n\u201cClose to a million New Yorkers have signed up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act and over three million are enrolled in Medicare, yet most are not aware of how to get the most of their health benefits,\u201d said Frank M. Winter, Partnership Manager, CMS New York Regional Office. \u201cMany others need help obtaining coverage. Our Health Insurance Workshops at HHC facilities throughout New York City provide us a unique opportunity to provide our partners and community members information they can use to sign up for health insurance and to use their new benefits. Our goal this year is to help our partners connect those who are insured from coverage to care.\u201d\n\nWorkshops take place from 8:30am to 1:00pm.
