The Cardinal Newman Society, a watchdog group that monitors Catholic identity, blasted the university for \"betraying\" its religious mission.\n\nPope Francis, please book a return flight.\n\nKnow a recent high school graduate?

John Jenkins, Notre Dame's president, is sending a message in line with the pope's vision. By recognizing two Catholics from different political parties, the university is offering a dignified rebuke to the toxicity and hyperpartisanship that pollute our political culture. It's also a healthy attempt to heal wounds in the nation's largest church that have festered for too long.\n\nDuring the nearly three decades that St. John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI led the church, the American Catholic culture wars raged. Prominent theologians faced scrutiny and sometimes censoring from the hierarchy. An American cardinal described President Obama's election as \"apocalyptic.\"\n\nAfter the University of Notre Dame invited Obama to give the commencement address in 2009, more than 80 bishops protested. Catholic pro-life activists rented a plane that flew over campus with the image of an aborted fetus.\n\nIn 2012, the Vatican's doctrine office clamped down on the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, which represents 80 percent of U.S. Catholic sisters, for espousing \"radical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith.\"\n\nObamacare and the still-unfolding fights over contraception coverage can seem like a border wall running through the heart of the Catholic landscape.\n\nFrancis knows these painful realities can turn Catholics against each other and make political cooperation harder. He recognizes that the culture wars are a quagmire, and calls instead for a \"culture of encounter\" that builds bridges.\n\n\"I cannot tire of encouraging you to dialogue fearlessly,\" he told 300 U.S. Catholic bishops during a speech in Washington, stressing that \"harsh and divisive language\" is sometimes tempting but never effective or reflective of the gospel.\n\nAlong with almost every Catholic public official, the vice president and the former House speaker don't always live up to the fullness of Catholic teaching in their policy positions. A church that defends the unborn, the undocumented immigrant, the death row convict and the striking worker makes every Catholic elected official uncomfortable in different ways.\n\nFrancis' critique of a \"throwaway culture\" includes myriad threats to human life: abortion, war, climate change and what he calls an \"economy of exclusion and inequality\" that destroys lives and hurts families.\n\nIf the vice president deserves scrutiny from Catholics for his views on abortion, Boehner doesn't get a free pass. As a 2011 letter from prominent Catholic theologians and scholars noted before he gave the commencement address at Catholic University in Washington, the former speaker supported budget proposals, strongly opposed by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, that slashed funding for programs that help low-income pregnant women, children, the elderly and other vulnerable populations.\n\nInequality, as Francis starkly puts it, is the \"root of social evil.\" Boehner also refused to oppose torture, an \"intrinsic evil\" according to Catholic teaching. And while Boehner spent years criticizing Obama for addressing climate change, Francis called for \"decisive action\" in a landmark encyclical last summer and warned at the White House that an urgent problem disproportionately impacting the world's poor can \"no longer be left to a future generation.\"\n\nThe University of Notre Dame isn't endorsing the politics of Biden or Boehner this weekend. In a bruising election year when demagoguery and division tear us apart, a Catholic institution is reminding us something better is possible.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=4, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "During the nearly three decades that St. John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI led the church, the American Catholic culture wars raged.\nThe University of Notre Dame isn't endorsing the politics of Biden or Boehner this weekend.\nAfter the University of Notre Dame invited Obama to give the commencement address in 2009, more than 80 bishops protested.\nJohn Jenkins, Notre Dame's president, is sending a message in line with the pope's vision.\nBy recognizing two Catholics from different political parties, the university is offering a dignified rebuke to the toxicity and hyperpartisanship that pollute our political culture."}
