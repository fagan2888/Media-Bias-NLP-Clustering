Former President Bill Clinton made a campaign stop in Reno on Friday to support his wife, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Hundreds turned out to hear him speak at the Boys and Girls Club on Foster Drive.

In the most recent polls in New Hampshire, Clinton is trailing fellow democratic candidate, Bernie Sanders. Clinton holds a slim lead over Sanders in Iowa. Timing is key during Mr. Clinton's stop in Nevada. There are less than 30 days until the Nevada caucuses, the first in the west.

Clinton did not spend too much time talking about the campaign's competition either in the republican or democratic fields. While he briefly mentioned the divisive nature of recent GOP debates, he focused on standing with Hillary Clinton.

"From the time I met her, 45 years ago, through the time I married her, 40 years ago last October, through all the ups and downs and interesting things that have happened in our lives, she's the best change maker I've ever knew," he explained to the crowd.

Clinton touched on a wide range of topics, from the Syrian migrant crisis to the Black Lives Matter movement, renewable energy and gun safety, to curtailing drug addiction and keeping the Affordable Care Act intact. President Clinton spoke of the candidate's achievements in several public service roles as First Lady, a Senator, and Secretary of State.

Many in the crowd said Clinton delivered positive message.

"It was the positive and the qualifications," says Clinton supporter, James Heller. "I mean, when you think of all the things she's accomplished in her life time, she has a lot to bring to a very demanding job."

Clinton ended his speech urging support from Northern Nevadans.

"Every day, she will roll that rock up the hill if you carry her through the caucus. We need your help."

The democratic Nevada caucuses will be held on February 20th.
