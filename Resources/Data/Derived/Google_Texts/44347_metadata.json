Train breaks down? Imagina na copa. No seats at the bar? Imagina na copa. Parking ticket? Imagina na copa.\n\nIn the muffled melodies of Portuguese, this might sound like the Paulista equivalent of hakuna matata. The sentiment is in fact the opposite: Imagine the World Cup. Something has gone wrong today? Imagine what things will be like when the World Cup, a half-million visiting fans in tow, descends on Brazil for four weeks this summer. As Brazil\u2019s preparations flounder towards completion, this comic remark carries an undertone of dread.\n\nThe apprehension is partly reflexive; city-dwellers are by nature overstimulated. Skepticism to global sports pageantry is a default setting, open excitement the mark of tourists and country bumpkins. When the competition finally arrives \u2014 as at the London Games two years ago \u2014 world-weary urbanites often wind up enjoying it all in spite of themselves.\n\nYet events on the grandest scale also engender more grave and lasting doubts: The party lasts only a few weeks. The memories will last longer. The infrastructure \u2014 and the debt engaged to build it \u2014 will endure longest of all. When skeptics ask, \u201cWhy bother?\u201d the answer had better involve long-term plans, for the worth of the Olympics will ultimately be measured by the use of their urban footprint.\n\nThis standard ought to be applied with particular scrutiny to the Winter Olympics in Sochi. These Olympic Games are the most expensive in history. They will take place \u201con the edge of a war zone,\u201d and in one of the only areas of Russia that is not reliably covered by snow each winter. So what will the $51 billion investment do for Sochi, and for Russia, when all the television cameras have gone home?\n\nThe logic can\u2019t be reduced down to economics. Olympic planners often envision the games as a transcendent event capable of renewing a country\u2019s spirit, and Sochi is no exception, but it only sometimes works out that way. In 1964, Tokyo became a symbol for the new Japan, a dazzling phoenix city risen from the ashes of the fire-bombing not two decades earlier. More recently, the 2008 Olympics in Beijing were seen as an announcement of China\u2019s newfound confidence. The intention of the 1972 games in Munich, by contrast \u2014 to reintroduce West Germany to the world with \u201cDie Heiteren Spiele\u201d (\u201cThe Happy Games\u201d) \u2014 was marred by the murder of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches.\n\nThere is no doubt that Putin has viewed Sochi \u2014 woefully unequipped for the competition and situated on Russia\u2019s contested southern border \u2014 as a kind of personal challenge. Quashing the movement for Chechnyan independence was Putin\u2019s great foreign policy triumph, and what better symbol of the New Caucasus than a shiny vacationland in Sochi?\n\nPutin believes this optimism will resonate throughout Russia. Here\u2019s Christian Caryl, writing in the New York Review of Books:\n\nPutin explicitly links the Games to the humiliations of the recent past: \u201cThere is also a certain moral aspect here and there is no need to be ashamed of it,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, after the dark and, let us be honest, bloody events in the Caucasus, the society had a negative and pessimistic attitude.\u201d The Olympics, he explains, \u201care a necessary part of an effort to \u2018strengthen the morale of the nation.\u201d\n\nThe anti-gay laws, stray-dog extermination, shower surveillance and frantic terrorist manhunt may have prematurely skewered Sochi\u2019s chance to bolster Russia\u2019s image abroad. It is hard to tell how many Russians share Putin\u2019s buoyant attitude \u2014 or if they do agree that Sochi constitutes a moral watershed, a chance to replay the spurned Moscow Olympics of 1980. Do they consider it worth the cost?\n\nFor the most part, it seems, Sochi is viewed as a pet project of President Putin and his merry band of oligarchs (who have ostensibly \u201cearned\u201d the construction contracts). These Winter Olympics are an \u201cextravagant caprice,\u201d with few pretensions to rallying national sentiment. In a neat bit of symbolism, Russia put the search for a Sochi mascot to an online vote, only to find that voters overwhelmingly supported a bug-eyed frog called Zoich. The satirically patriotic amphibian was later excised from the competition in favor of the more regular bear, hare and leopard.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Complaints about waste and corruption are already common \u2014\u00a0and things could get so much worse", "title": "Sochi\u2019s post-Olympics time bomb: Can the city survive when the games are gone?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Complaints about waste and corruption are already common \u2014\u00a0and things could get so much worse", "title": "Sochi\u2019s post-Olympics time bomb: Can the city survive when the games are gone?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/09/sochis_post_olympics_time_bomb_can_the_city_survive_when_the_games_are_gone/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/sochi_dream_city.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Complaints about waste and corruption are already common \u2014\u00a0and things could get so much worse", "title": "Sochi\u2019s post-Olympics time bomb: Can the city survive when the games are gone?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/sochi_dream_city.jpg", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Henry Grabar", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 Olympics, Dream City, Editor's Picks, Olympics, Russia, sochi", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb604\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2014 Olympics, Dream City, Editor's Picks, Olympics, Russia, sochi, Innovation News, Sustainability News, Business News, NewsThere\u2019s a new retort going around Brazil.\nThese Winter Olympics are an \u201cextravagant caprice,\u201d with few pretensions to rallying national sentiment.\nThis standard ought to be applied with particular scrutiny to the Winter Olympics in Sochi.\nSo what will the $51 billion investment do for Sochi, and for Russia, when all the television cameras have gone home?\nThe satirically patriotic amphibian was later excised from the competition in favor of the more regular bear, hare and leopard."}
