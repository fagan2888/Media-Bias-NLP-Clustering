The change was announced Friday night to officially open the three-day comic book and pop culture extravaganza at the Colorado Convention Center.\n\nChristine Tubbs, executive director of the nonprofit, said the mission was originally to encourage education by promoting literacy and self-expression through comic books, but the group is expanding the methods of its outreach.\n\n\u201cIt has worked so well in comic books, in what we are calling \u2018storytelling through comics,\u2019 we are now expanding it to other areas of popular culture,\u201d Tubbs said. \u201cSo, music, film, gaming are a few of the areas we\u2019ll use to expand it.\u201d\n\nAt this weekend\u2019s convention, the Classroom Kids Corral area featured a variety of activities for kids to explore, from video games to creating their own comics. Moving forward, Tubbs said the group is working to package the programs and offering it to educators to use in their own classrooms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be working to make sure we can get them into schools that can\u2019t afford to have them in there; we\u2019ll make them free. And other schools, we\u2019ll work with them to make it affordable for them as well,\u201d she said.\n\nThe move seems to make sense at a time where a \u201ccomic book\u201d convention has guests ranging from sci-fi celebrities to TV stars, voiceover artists and everything between.\n\nMeridith Cahill, 17, frequently attends anime conventions. She went to Denver Comic Con to watch people and take in the experience.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t gone to much of the programming,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of focus on literacy, and I think that\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nFor 6-year-old-Clive Higgins, it\u2019s all about Spider-Man.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a superhero and he has lots of very good things and powers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe newly graduated kindergardner, who has liked Spider-Man since he was \u201cvery, very little\u201d was dressed from head to toe in his favorite hero\u2019s garb, sporting a Spidey hat, shoes and costume, and carrying a newly purchased Spider-Man print from artist David Wong for his bedroom \u2026 which, of course, is decorated in a Spider-Man theme.\n\nClive and his mom, Brandy Higgins, are among the expected 75,000 fans converging on downtown this weekend for the convention. Friday\u2019s attendance topped 25,000, according to organizers, and was marked by a much smoother entry process than last year\u2019s.\n\nAbout 6,000 people had to be turned away on Saturday in 2013, a black eye for the event that fans remembered all winter.\n\nSo, was it faster than a speeding bullet? Maybe not quite that quick, but Denver Comic Con officials say they spent all year working on a plan to speed the process of getting fans inside the convention center, and the improved flow was just as smooth Saturday.\n\nHow long was the wait?\n\n\u201cProbably five minutes. It was more like walking to the right spot,\u201d said Ty Hart of Boulder, who is at Denver Comic Con for the first time. \u201cOnce we found the right line, we jumped right in, and there was hardly any wait at all.\u201d\n\nScores of fans visited Artists Valley to meet, chat with, and purchase art and books from their favorite comic book artists. Christopher Jones, an artist who has worked on DC\u2019s \u201cYoung Justice,\u201d The Batman Strikes!\u201d and more spent much of his day conversing with fans, both new and those familiar with his work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a mixture of both. I\u2019ve had fans that are really excited to see me here and they thank me for coming, and then there are people who have just stopped by because they saw me on a panel or saw the art and they want to hear more about what I do and what I\u2019m working on.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all in the name of fun, superheroes, and literacy. Tubbs said the outpouring of support and sense of community is only growing stronger.\n\n\u201cI asked in the opening ceremonies for anyone who wanted to come and help (with Pop Culture Classroom) and in every hallway and every room I\u2019ve been today someone has come up to me and handed me their business card and said \u2018I want to be part of this. \u2026 I know we\u2019re on the right track. I cannot tell you how excited I am about it.\u201d\n\nDenver Comic Con continues from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nJoe Nguyen, Daniel J.
