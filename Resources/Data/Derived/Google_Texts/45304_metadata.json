Photo courtesy of Aaron Webb.\n\nDo you approve of the job Congress is doing? Only 14% of Americans say yes. But here\u2019s a silver lining that may surprise you: low approval for Congress often translates to more people turning out to vote.\n\nThis makes sense, of course. If you don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening, you should do what you can to change it. But it may come as a pleasant surprise to anyone who\u2019s familiar with the fact that midterm elections \u2013 those in which we elect members of Congress but not a President \u2013 usually draw less than half of eligible voters.\n\nMore people might vote in midterms if they appreciated what was at stake: while the President proposes his ideal budget every year, that proposal is just a suggestion. It\u2019s Congress that actually passes the budget that becomes law. The lawmakers we elect in the midterm elections hold tremendous power, and will do so for years to come.\n\nFor more information about the issues at stake in this election, check out our Voter\u2019s Guides and Competing Visions: Election Edition.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping that Americans take the power into their own hands and vote this Election Day.
