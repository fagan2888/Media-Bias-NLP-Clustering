'I’m disappointed in how it’s been implemented and rolled out,' Begich says. Begich: I'm not waiting for Obama

Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) on Thursday said he is “not waiting for the president” on a fix for the millions of consumers facing health insurance cancellations, and will join a handful of Senate Democrats cutting in front of the White House to propose their own solution.

“I am not waiting for the president’s promise. I want to see results,” Begich said on “Fox and Friends.” “Today we’re proposing another solution to that, and I think there is a great opportunity to move forward.”

Begich is part of a growing chorus of Democratic lawmakers who, although supportive of the Affordable Care Act, are frustrated with the law’s rocky rollout.

“I’m disappointed in how it’s been implemented and rolled out. There was too many people making decisions that weren’t coordinated. There wasn’t a focus on how this would work,” Begich said.

Begich faces a tough reelection next year in Alaska and has come under fire in his home state for supporting the health reform act. On Wednesday, Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell penned a sharp rebuke of Begich’s vote for the law.

“We are witnessing the destruction of private insurance as an option for Alaskans and all Americans,” Parnell said in a statement. “You must not stand by and watch it happen, particularly where you helped create this unfolding catastrophe upon us.”

Begich, while critical of the ACA’s implementation, is standing behind many of its benefits. Thirty-four percent of Alaskans, he points out, were turned away from the individual market before the ACA passed.
