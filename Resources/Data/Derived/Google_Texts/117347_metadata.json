For the most part, opinion hasn\u2019t changed much \u2014 it\u2019s ticked up slightly over the last four or five months for most demographic groups, during the law\u2019s troubled rollout, but not by a huge amount (a finding Gallup\u2019s replicated).

A caveat: Kaiser\u2019s sample size for the uninsured isn\u2019t that big, so this has a substantial margin of error.

For one, they\u2019re more likely to be interacting with the law: Navigators are trying to reach them; some of them have probably been on the individual market at times, which only a limited percentage of Americans are, and are now seeing themselves priced out of coverage; others are perhaps just disappointed with what the law has to offer, or that its plans aren\u2019t free, period. Some of them could be people who would have been eligible for Medicaid if their state had expanded it, and now see people making a little more money getting heavily subsidized insurance while they\u2019re left out in the cold. As Jason Sorens points out on Twitter, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re seeing a selection effect \u2014 people who like the ACA and for whom it works well are now leaving the ranks of the uninsured. We\u2019ll have to see if this trend holds up.\n\nSome Republican strategists and conservatives have argued that as Obamacare is implemented, its costs are going to be so great that Americans will turn against it in droves. But besides a slight boost to disapproval from the bad PR around the rollout of the exchanges, that doesn\u2019t seem to be panning out in polling, so far. The implementation of the law has not fundamentally changed whether people have favorable or unfavorable views of it, except, it seems, among those whom it was specifically targeted to help (which are just a slice of the electorate and probably don\u2019t vote in strong numbers). That\u2019s interesting, though it\u2019s important to note it\u2019s not an indictment of the law, per se: Whether individuals targeted by a given public policy actually support that policy or not is not dispositive.\n\nMore data after the jump.\n\nDisapproval overall, as you can see, has steadily outweighed approval, and has risen a bit since last fall:\n\nIt\u2019s risen a bit among political independents, too (it\u2019s stayed relatively steady with Republicans and Democrats)\n\nAnd it\u2019s not changed dramatically among senior citizens or those aged 18\u201364:\n\nPeople do seem to be following the rollout of the law closely, though, according to Kaiser\u2019s February poll: While there\u2019s some social-desirability bias here, Americans say they\u2019re following it and even more esoteric aspects of the law (e.g., the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimate of its effects on employment) with the same level of attention they gave to the Winter Olympics.
