Volunteer fire departments will not have to worry about providing fire fighters insurance under the Affordable Care Act thanks to an amendment to exempt emergency personnel.

Gary Vincent, chief of the Magnolia Fire Department, said without the exemption, it would have a “substantial financial impact” on volunteer departments that are already “cash strapped.”

“Under the Affordable Care Act, volunteer fire fighters would be classed as employees,” he said. “If you have more than 50 volunteer fire fighters, you would have to provide health care for them.

“This would be a big problem for … departments in the area. It would have been a financial burden for the department and not in the best interest of the community.”

Vincent said he contacted Congressman Kevin Brady R-The Woodlands in an effort to exempt volunteer departments from the ACA.

“The President’s new health care law hurts so many people. We’re learning that more and more each day,” Brady said. “And when Chief Vincent reached out to us about the harmful impact of ObamaCare on fire departments across the nation, including the Magnolia Fire Department, we listened and my committee acted.”

Vincent said he was glad to see the amendment made.

“Volunteer firefighters were not expecting to have health benefits when they volunteered to help their community,” he said.

“For all our firefighters do to protect our families and communities, they should never have to worry about Washington punishing them for their selfless service,” Brady said. “We’ve acted to protect them from being harmed by this ObamaCare mandate.”

The amendment was effective Jan. 1.
