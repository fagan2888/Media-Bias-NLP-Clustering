The study asserted \u201cthe overwhelming majority\u201d of oil flowing to refineries in the Gulf Coast would be refined and consumed in the U.S., even after XL is built\u2014which is true, but irrelevant. If I pour a glass of water (Keystone XL) into an already full bucket (Midwest and Gulf Coal oil markets) most of the water stays in the bucket\u2014but the bucket does not hold any more water\u2014the increment just slops on the floor, or in this case gets exported.\n\nThe President focused on a more relevant point in his comments in Fargo last week, saying that \u201cI\u2019ve already said I\u2019m happy to look at increasing pipeline production for U.S. oil. But Keystone is for Canadian oil. Sending it down to the Gulf it bypasses the U.S., it estimated to create 250, maybe, 300 permanent jobs. We should be focusing on American infrastructure for American jobs for American producers \u2026 \u201d\n\nKeystone is an enormously important environmental symbol. But it is also a commercial struggle. Alberta tar sands oil and North Dakota light shale oil flows into the same markets, have access to the same refineries, and rely on the same pipelines and railroads to get them to the same customers. So it was never terribly plausible that Keystone would be good for the U.S.\u2014it was designed to make Canadian oil more competitive in global markets, which, on balance, is not good for American producers or, since the Canadians want to escape from American markets, American consumers.\n\nThe logic of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was, in some minds, that we would collaborate, rather than competing with Canada and Mexico, and would allow Canada, for example, to put U.S. territory, waterways and airsheds at environmental risk to provide the cheapest route for Canada\u2019s oil to global markets. But the Canadians walked away from their Kyoto commitment to the curb to global warming emissions precisely because doing so would put them at a competitive disadvantage with U.S. oil and gas producers\u2014so the kumbaya theory of NAFTA was always pretty threadbare. Obama now seems to recognize this. Canada needs Keystone. The U.S. does not.\n\nNow the lack of permit for Keystone is the least of Prime Minister Harper\u2019s problems. He bet Canada\u2019s future on finding ever increasing markets for the world\u2019s most expensive\u2014$90/barrel+ break-even for new projects\u2014crude. With global prices down at $60, returns from tar sands projects are a fraction of what they were a year ago. Even before global prices reached the bottom, three major projects had been cancelled. Shell just pulled out of its Pierra River Project last week. Investment is collapsing. Most companies will survive\u2014but they survive by cutting payrolls and supply chains, the two factors Harper was counting on to keep the Canadian economy afloat through his reelection bid this year. But unemployment rolls are soaring, and the Canadian dollar has lost 20 percent of its value. Harper is now running barely even with his leading opponent, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau, who acerbically attacks Harper\u2019s bet on oil. \u201cIt\u2019s not fiscally responsible,\u201d said Trudeau in January, \u201cto pin all your hopes on oil prices remaining high, and when they fall, being forced to make it up as they go along.\u201d\n\nHarper must call an election by November. One of the major issues in that election is certain to be Canada\u2019s next economic strategy\u2014because the petro-exporter bubble just burst. Which is why Bloomberg\u2019s suggestion\u2014that Canada embraces its former climate leadership, and bet its economic future on low carbon energy and high knowledge manufacturing\u2014is almost certain to have at least one taker among Canada\u2019s three major parties? But it would be much better news for the climate if all three Canadian parties, led by Harper\u2019s Conservatives decided that Canada doesn\u2019t have the cheap oil resource base to become the next Saudi Arabia\u2014and might not want to even if it could.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\n\nMichael Brune: The End Game Begins\n\nRobert Redford: Fossil Fuels Need to Stay in the Ground, Renewable Energy Is the Future\n\nNo, Climate Change Is Not Experiencing a Hiatus", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama\u2019s veto last week of a Republican bill passed mandating the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline does, indeed, as Michael Bloomberg pointed out, s", "og": {"site_name": "EcoWatch", "description": "President Obama\u2019s veto last week of a Republican bill passed mandating the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline does, indeed, as Michael Bloomberg pointed out, s", "title": "Carl Pope: Beyond Keystone", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://ecowatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamakxlfb.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-03T08:55:26-04:00", "url": "http://ecowatch.com/2015/03/03/carl-pope-beyond-keystone/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama\u2019s veto last week of a Republican bill passed mandating the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline does, indeed, as Michael Bloomberg pointed out, s", "creator": "@ecowatch", "image": "http://ecowatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamakxlfb.jpg", "title": "Carl Pope: Beyond Keystone", "site": "@ecowatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-03T08:55:04-04:00", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/EcoWatch", "section": "Energy", "tag": "featured-home", "published_time": "2015-03-03T08:55:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-03T08:55:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "featured, featured-home, science, environment, eco, green"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36c6\"", "article_summary": "We should be focusing on American infrastructure for American jobs for American producers \u2026 \u201dKeystone is an enormously important environmental symbol.\nBut Keystone is for Canadian oil.\nCanada needs Keystone.\nNow the lack of permit for Keystone is the least of Prime Minister Harper\u2019s problems.\nSo it was never terribly plausible that Keystone would be good for the U.S.\u2014it was designed to make Canadian oil more competitive in global markets, which, on balance, is not good for American producers or, since the Canadians want to escape from American markets, American consumers."}
