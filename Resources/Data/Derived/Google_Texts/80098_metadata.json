While under fire for his past support of Democrats and liberal policies, businessman Donald Trump took a shot at Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and accused him of being partly responsible for the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.\n\nTrump said Cruz supported the nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005 and made a point of mentioning that Roberts\u2019 votes were integral to upholding the Affordable Care Act, in what was otherwise considered a conservative court.\n\n\u201cThis is a rough thing and I know Ted feels badly about it,\u201d Trump said of Cruz\u2019s support of Roberts just over a decade ago. \u201cI think he probably still respects this judge.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Reuters\n\nCruz quickly countered, saying he did support the nomination once it was made. He then said that he would\u2019ve nominated his former boss, Mike Luttig, if he had the choice.\n\nWhat Cruz thought about Roberts before he was nominated is hard to say, but he does have a history with the chief justice. In 2000, when tasked with putting together the legal team to support President George W. Bush in front of the U.S. Supreme Court against Vice President Al Gore \u2014 a case that decided the presidential election in Bush\u2019s favor \u2014 Cruz chose to reach out to Roberts for the gig.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cJohn had been a friend and [former Chief Justice William] Rehnquist clerk \u2014 I\u2019ve known John a long time,\u201d Cruz told the New Yorker magazine in a 2014 profile.\n\nHeading into Super Tuesday \u2014 where a big portion of the nomination's delegates will be decided \u2014 the outlook to beat Trump does not look good for either Cruz or fellow Sen. Marco Rubio, who is from Florida. Trump leads the two senators in all but three of the 12 mostly Southern states lined up to vote. But even in two of the states where Trump is trailing, his delinquency is decidedly modest. Cruz is in first place in polling in both Arkansas and his home state of Texas, but is ahead of Trump by an average of only 4 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who once seemed to be running an ascendant and promising campaign but has since dropped in a big way according to polls, leads the pack only in Colorado, where he is followed by Rubio 6 percent behind him and then Trump 2 percent further.\n\nThat Cruz is trailing in so many states in the South is significant. His campaign has been geared toward exciting Christian conservatives, and the Bible belt certainly has plenty of those sorts of voters. Further evidence of Cruz\u2019s general vulnerability in the 2016 GOP race can be seen in that 4.7 percent lead in Texas. While some polls show the Texan leading Trump by better figures than that average, others show the two in virtual ties, according to Real Clear Politics.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ted cruz, texas, super tuesday, bible belt, marco rubio, donald trump, polls, debate, 2016, ted cruz, texas, super tuesday, bible belt, marco rubio, donald trump, polls, debate, 2016, ted cruz, texas, super tuesday, bible belt, marco rubio, donald trump,", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "In Thursday's GOP debate, the Texas senator was attacked for saying he supported the Supreme Court chief justice whose vote decided Obamacare cases.", "title": "Election 2016: Did Ted Cruz Support John Roberts, Who Later Voted In Favor Of Obamacare?
