John Kasich spoke with supporters after his surprise second-place finish in the GOP New Hampshire primary. (Reuters)\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich spoke with supporters after his surprise second-place finish in the GOP New Hampshire primary. (Reuters)\n\nJohn Kasich was \u201cirrelevant\u201d in Donald Trump\u2019s assessment three months ago. After a second-place finish Tuesday, Kasich has a rejoinder: Not anymore.\n\nFor months, the Ohio governor was the un-Trump, trying to stay positive while quietly and methodically building a New Hampshire base the old-fashioned way \u2014 one town hall meeting at a time.\n\nHe skipped the Iowa caucuses, betting that his centrist, laid-back brand wouldn\u2019t break through in that conservative bastion. Meanwhile, back in New Hampshire, he sneaked up from behind the pack, designing a data-driven campaign to target Republicans and independents alike.\n\nIn the end, when voters here tuned in most intensely in the closing days, Kasich was in position to grab them. A quarter of the GOP electorate decided late, and Kasich performed strongly among them, according to network exit polls.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s magic in the air with this campaign,\u201d a jubilant Kasich said Tuesday night.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush addressed supporters following the New Hampshire primary. (Reuters)\n\nKasich had maintained that he had \u201cmy own lane\u201d in the GOP field, bristling at the suggestion that he should be lumped in with fellow establishment-friendly candidates, including the two others with gubernatorial experience, Jeb Bush and Chris Christie, as well as Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Ted Cruz (Tex.).\n\nFor now, his finish puts him on top of that pack.\n\nBut Kasich still placed far behind the front-runner Trump. And he faces a far greater challenge. He must compete in less-hospitable Southern territory before heading to his home ground of the Midwest.\n\nAnd, after being mostly ignored by Trump and the rest of the field, he is bound to come under sustained assault from the competition, prompting a deeper examination of his record than occurred here, and testing his vow to remain \u201con the sunny side of the street.\u201d\n\nNor did Kasich pull far enough ahead to shake off Bush and others competing to be the party\u2019s Trump alternative.\n\nKasich had been the only candidate to explicitly vow to drop out if he performed poorly in New Hampshire. Now he and the other leading candidate plan to head to the next primary, in South Carolina on Feb. 20, and beyond. Christie, with a more disappointing finish in New Hampshire, is expected to decide Wednesday whether to continue.\n\nBefore Tuesday, the trio with gubernatorial experience had pitched their executive background and belittled the talka\u00adthon role of the senators, Rubio and Cruz, all while Trump held a wide lead.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Chris Christie addressed supporters following the New Hampshire primary. (Reuters)\n\nBush, who entered the race with high expectations and was backed by a super PAC that had more than $100 million, was briefly in first place in the polls before plummeting, hurt both by voter wariness of extending a family dynasty and by an anti-establishment mood that helped Trump\u2019s rise. Trump hammered at Bush\u2019s proposal to provide a path to citizenship or legal status to 11 million illegal immigrants, and he lampooned Bush as \u201clow-energy.\u201d\n\nChristie, while performing worse than he had hoped, played a vital role in the political dynamics of the race by taking on the attack role that Kasich eschewed. Christie savaged Rubio in Saturday\u2019s debate for a robotic performance. That may have taken votes away from Rubio \u2014 some of which may have gone to Kasich.\n\nBush advisers also seized on Rubio\u2019s performance, saying it proved their argument that the senator\u2019s carefully crafted image masked inexperience and raised questions about whether he would be able to hold his own against a Democratic opponent.\n\nBush advisers dismissed the importance of Kasich\u2019s showing here, arguing that Bush has the resources to run a national campaign while Kasich does not.\n\nBush\u2019s South Carolina operation is led by Brett Doster, a longtime aide who was responsible for driving Bush across Florida during his failed 1994 gubernatorial campaign. In addition to the operation built by his team in the past seven months, they\u2019ve recently inherited a political operation led by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), whose aides and donors have fallen into line with the Bush camp across the state.\n\nGraham said in an interview Tuesday that Kasich will fade as the campaign moves south.\n\n\u201cOf the three early states, South Carolina has always been Jeb\u2019s best, in terms of infrastructure and dynamics,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe have a reputation for voting for the most conservative candidate who\u2019s electable. John\u2019s a good guy, and a good governor, but when it comes to military issues, he\u2019s been more of a budget-cutter than a hawk.\u201d\n\nThat was a knock, with an eye on South Carolina as a \u00adpro-military state, at Kasich\u2019s comments in September that the government should consider whether there is \u201cexcess infrastructure\u201d being paid for in the military budget.\n\nKasich has spent months overshadowed by his rivals. He entered the race over the summer as Bush began his slide, telling voters here that, \u201cfrankly, I thought Jeb was just going to suck all the air out of the room, and it just hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d\n\nHe had won a hard-fought gubernatorial election in 2014, leaving him a battle-tested team that has transferred its skills to the presidential bid.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Kasich\u2019s campaign strategy was months in the making \u2014 identifying potential supporters, cultivating them and turning them out.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a science to it, but a lot of it is just sweat and work \u2014 it\u2019s calling people, it\u2019s knocking on doors,\u201d Kasich adviser Tom Rath said. \u201cIn many ways here you treat an independent voter like you treat a Republican \u2014 they\u2019re a potential voter.\u201d\n\nAs he campaigned here, Kasich unabashedly walked the middle of the road on two touchstone issues for conservatives\u2014 immigration and health care.\n\nKasich has aggressively rejected the feasibility of deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.\n\nHe has instead advocated strengthening border control while giving such immigrants a path to legalization so long as they meet certain conditions and pay back taxes.\n\nKasich\u2019s greatest vulnerability in the Republican primaries relates to his decision to expand Medicaid in Ohio under provisions created by the Affordable Care Act. The governor has been lambasted by critics who accuse him of increasing the size of government in the state; Kasich instead says his decision was based on the premise that accepting the $13 billion offered by the federal government would serve the dual purposes of helping to balance the state\u2019s budget while fulfilling a moral duty to its poorest citizens. Anticipating the battle ahead, Bush\u2019s campaign on Sunday posted a Web-only ad that criticized Kasich\u2019s decision to accept the money.\n\nDavid Weigel and Ed O\u2019Keefe contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThere\u2019s magic in the air with this campaign,\u201d the Ohio governor says.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jdelreal/", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s magic in the air with this campaign,\u201d the Ohio governor says.", "title": "With second-place finish, Kasich is thrust into relevance", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/with-projected-second-place-finish-kasich-is-thrust-into-relavence/2016/02/09/60f9a73c-cf88-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/10/National-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Kasich-008bc-4509.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "jdelreal"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/with-projected-second-place-finish-kasich-is-thrust-into-relavence/2016/02/09/60f9a73c-cf88-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jdelreal/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "60f9a73c-cf88-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad"}, "article_summary": "John Kasich spoke with supporters after his surprise second-place finish in the GOP New Hampshire primary.\nAfter a second-place finish Tuesday, Kasich has a rejoinder: Not anymore.\nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush addressed supporters following the New Hampshire primary.\nIn the end, when voters here tuned in most intensely in the closing days, Kasich was in position to grab them.\nKasich had been the only candidate to explicitly vow to drop out if he performed poorly in New Hampshire."}
