Rosa DeLauro\u2019s Third District told the congresswoman Tuesday that they want her to work to repeal the so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d associated with the Obama administration\u2019s health care reform plan.\n\nThe financial impact that the tax is estimated to have on communities in the district ranges from $750,000 in a town like North Haven to several million dollars for the city of Milford. Starting in 2018, the Affordable Care Act will impose a 40 percent excise tax on the portion of most employer sponsored health care coverage \u2014 excluding dental and vision \u2014 that tops $10,200 a year for individuals and $27,500 for families.\n\nThe tax, according to the policy journal Health Affairs, is designed to slow growing healthcare costs and finance expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But the 20 local municipal leaders who attended DeLauro\u2019s annual gathering with public officials in her district see the tax as yet another strain on their already tight budgets.\n\n\u201cIt was something that I opposed right from the outset when we were debating the Affordable Care Act,\u201d DeLauro said after the meeting. \u201cI believe there is bipartisan support to repeal the Cadillac tax.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the municipal leaders attending the meeting with DeLauro were Milford Mayor Ben Blake and Middletown Mayor Daniel Drew. Blake called the tax consequences the city is facing with the Cadillac tax \u201ca huge liability.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, we spend about $40 million a year for the city\u2019s health care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about 20 percent of our overall budget.\u201d\n\nDrew said Middletown has \u201ca very similar dynamic, a similar cost structure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dialogue we\u2019ve had helps us to better understand what we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Drew said of the meeting with DeLauro and her staff.\n\nNorth Haven First Selectman Michael Freda is chairman of the South Central Regional Council of Governments, whose member municipalities include Third Congressional District towns. Other key issues discussed during the meeting with DeLauro, Freda said, were getting federal money to help cover the cost of snow removal this winter and separate funding for road repairs cause by the harsh winter weather.\n\n\u201cIn that past, we\u2019ve sought to recover 75 percent of the costs,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ll get that this year. But these meetings are critically important letting municipal officials know what they need to go through in order to get help from the Third District office.\u201d\n\nFreda said he also got an update on possible federal funding for a train station off of Devine Street that would be part of a commuter rail service that will begin running between Springfield, Massachusetts and New Haven late in 2016. Funding for the design of the Devine Street train station was part of a $5.75 million bonding package the state\u2019s Bond Commission approved in January.\n\n\u201cThe (federal) money is not locked in yet,\u201d Freda said. \u201cBut the process is far enough along that we\u2019re going have public hearing on the station this spring.\u201d\n\nCall Luther Turmelle at 203-680-9388.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, Politics news, New Haven Politics news, CT Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "title": "Connecticut municipal leaders urge repeal of \u2018Cadillac tax\u2019 in meeting with DeLauro", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150310/NEWS/150319949", "image": {"width": "800px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150310/NEWS/150319949/AR/0/AR-150319949.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "990px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Connecticut municipal leaders urge repeal of \u2018Cadillac tax\u2019 in meeting with DeLauro"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "WALLINGFORD  >> Municipal officials from across U.S. Rep.
