Millions more will have fewer health care benefits and higher out-of-pocket costs.\"\n\nCHIP, created in 1997, was designed to cover families who made too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough money to afford private insurance. It offered money to states but allowed them flexibility to tailor the program to fit their specific needs. Some states created a new program while others expanded Medicaid to cover more children.\n\nClinton, who was then first lady, aggressively pushed Congress to approve the program, and many of its architects on Capitol Hill credited her public advocacy with pushing a bill over the finish line.\n\n\"She was a one-woman army inside the White House to get this done,\" an aide to then-Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, who co-sponsored the bill, told the New York Times several years after its passage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton and a former Republican senate leader warn Congress not to push a deadline on funding, which expires in September", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-bill-frist-reauthorize-childrens-health-insurance-program/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/02/13/121bee15-ee6d-482e-859b-28e4c3ae9fea/thumbnail/1200x630/243aed1ee0593e822da300502566458f/71335243.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Hillary Clinton and a former Republican senate leader warn Congress not to push a deadline on funding, which expires in September", "title": "Hillary Clinton, Bill Frist: Reauthorize children's health insurance program"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton and a former Republican senate leader warn Congress not to push a deadline on funding, which expires in September", "title": "Hillary Clinton, Bill Frist: Reauthorize children's health insurance program", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/hillary-clinton-bill-frist-reauthorize-childrens-health-insurance-program/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/hillary-clinton-bill-frist-reauthorize-childrens-health-insurance-program/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-bill-frist-reauthorize-childrens-health-insurance-program/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/02/13/121bee15-ee6d-482e-859b-28e4c3ae9fea/thumbnail/1200x630/243aed1ee0593e822da300502566458f/71335243.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-bill-frist-reauthorize-childrens-health-insurance-program/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/hillary-clinton-bill-frist-reauthorize-childrens-health-insurance-program/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb54c\"", "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton joined forces with former Senate Republican leader Bill Frist on Thursday to push Congress to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) well ahead of a late September deadline, arguing that \"our most vulnerable children shouldn't be caught in the crossfire\" of the continued fighting over the budget and Obamacare.\nA failure to reauthorize the program, they warned, could have dire consequences: \"As many as two million children could lose coverage altogether.\nOne such gap, which they labeled the \"family glitch,\" prevents families from receiving subsidized insurance through an Obamacare exchange if they're offered \"affordable coverage\" by their employer.\n\"As parents, grandparents, and former legislators, we believe that partisan politics should never stand between our kids and quality health care.\"\nIt offered money to states but allowed them flexibility to tailor the program to fit their specific needs."}
