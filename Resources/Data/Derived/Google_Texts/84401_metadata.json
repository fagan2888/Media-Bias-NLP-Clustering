Environment Programme headquarters.\n\nHe noted that some scientists consider protection of the Congo basin tropical forest, which spreads over six countries and is the world's second-largest after the Amazon, essential for the future of the planet because of its biodiversity.\n\nILLEGAL EXPLOITATION\n\nFrancis, who took his name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of nature, has made protecting \"God's creation\" a plank of his pontificate. In June, he issued a landmark encyclical calling for urgent action to save the planet.\n\nIn his address at the U.N. compound in Nairobi, he called for action against poaching and illegal mineral exploitation in Africa and called for \"a new energy system\" reducing fossil fuels to the minimum and a re-think \"of the current model of development\".\n\nHe said the international community had to listen to the \"cry rising up from humanity and the earth itself.\"\n\nFrancis, who moves on to Uganda on Friday, began his first full day in the Kenyan capital by meeting Muslim and other religious leaders before saying an open-air Mass for tens of thousands of rain-drenched people who sang, danced and ululated as he arrived in an open popemobile.\n\n\"All too often, young people are being radicalized in the name of religion to sow discord and fear, and to tear at the very fabric of our societies,\" he told about 25 religious leaders, adding that inter-religious dialogue was essential and God's name \"must never be used to justify hatred and violence.\"\n\nHe referred to Somalia's al Shabaab Islamists' 2013 attack on Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall and this year's assault on Garissa university. Hundreds have been killed in the past two years or so, with Christians sometimes singled out by gunmen.\n\nIn his homily at the Mass, Francis urged the faithful \"to resist practices which foster arrogance in men\", speaking in a nation rattled by a series of corruption scandals.\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta, a Catholic who attended Mass, reshuffled his cabinet this week after several ministers were embroiled in graft allegations.\n\n(Writing by Edmund Blair and Philip Pullella; Editing by Ralph Boulton)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - World leaders must reach a historic agreement to fight climate cha", "title": "Pope, in Africa, says failure of climate summit would be catastrophic", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/26/Pope-Africa-says-dialogue-vital-avert-violence-Gods-name", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pope-africa-kenya_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/26/Pope-Africa-says-dialogue-vital-avert-violence-Gods-name", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pope-africa-kenya_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - World leaders must reach a historic agreement to fight climate cha", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - World leaders must reach a historic agreement to fight climate change and poverty at coming Paris, facing the stark choice to either \"improve or destroy the environment\", Pope Francis said in Africa on Thursday.\nIn his homily at the Mass, Francis urged the faithful \"to resist practices which foster arrogance in men\", speaking in a nation rattled by a series of corruption scandals.\nIn Kenya, at the start of his three-nation Africa trip, the pope also said dialogue between religions was essential to teach young people that violence in God's name was unjustified.\n\"We are confronted with a choice which cannot be ignored: either to improve or destroy the environment,\" the pope said in Nairobi, home to the U.N.\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta, a Catholic who attended Mass, reshuffled his cabinet this week after several ministers were embroiled in graft allegations."}
