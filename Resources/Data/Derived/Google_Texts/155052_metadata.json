But it won\u2019t be a defamation suit, no, no, no. He\u2019s threatening to start a birther lawsuit alleging that Cruz is ineligible to be president.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz is a totally unstable individual,\u201d Trump said in his statement. \u201cHe is the single biggest liar I\u2019ve ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them.\u201d\n\nWhat did Cruz say? What horrible, disgusting things did his campaign convey in those attack ads? Trump accuses of Cruz of misrepresenting him as a liberal, not a conservative.\n\nFor example, Cruz allegedly had the nerve, the utter gall, to say Trump supported the Affordable Care Act. There\u2019s a handful of other falsehoods floating about, Trump alleges. Telling people he was anti-Second Amendment when he insists he\u2019s \u201cone of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms.\u201d Construing him as pro-choice when he, \u201clike Ronald Regan, on many issues,\u201d became a pro-lifer.\n\nThen there\u2019s the apparent claim that Trump would appoint liberal judges to federal court. Well, Trump would have you know he only chooses individuals who protects conservative values, so there.\n\nTrump says he\u2019ll insist the Republican National Committee to support on the suit, \u201cand if they don\u2019t, they are in default of their pledge to me.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s where we are. The Republican candidates are fighting over whether one is too liberal to be president, and the other too Canadian.\n\nCruz was born up in Canada, but managed to win the Iowa caucus anyway. As for Trump, he\u2019s a high-profile opponent, and some observers think he could actually take the election.\n\n[image via screengrab of Right Side Broadcasting]\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Alberto Luperon on Twitter (@Alberto Luperon)", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a press release obtained by LawNewz.com, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump promised to sue Ted Cruz\u2014if the Texas Senator doesn\u2019t take down", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://lawnewz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Donald-Trump-via-Right-Side-screengrab.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump Says Ted Cruz is \u2018Unstable,\u2019 Threatens Lawsuit"}, "twitter": {"site": "@law_newz", "image": "http://lawnewz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Donald-Trump-via-Right-Side-screengrab.jpg", "description": "In a press release obtained by LawNewz.com, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump promised to sue Ted Cruz\u2014if the Texas Senator doesn\u2019t take down \u201cfalse lies\u201d made in attack ads.
