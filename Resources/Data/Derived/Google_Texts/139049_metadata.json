Two-time Oscar-nominee and French speaker Bradley Cooper was at the White House for a February 11 state dinner with French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Cooper met with Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to discuss ways he could help promote Obamacare sign-ups.\n\nCooper, according to Politico, pitched Jarrett on Between Two Ferns, the viral mock-interview series hosted by Zach Galifianakis, Cooper\u2019s cast mate from The Hangover movies. Cooper reportedly took out his cell phone and put Galifianakis on speaker. The host was game, and Jarrett and Press Secretary Jay Carney sold Obama on the idea. One month after Cooper floated the idea to Jarrett, the public was watching the president mock The Hangover and deliver his own Obamacare pitch to the American people. Healthcare.gov traffic increased by almost 40 percent compared with the day prior, and FunnyorDie\u2014where Between Two Ferns lives\u2014was the Web site\u2019s biggest source of referrals that day.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius went on HuffPost Live to say the administration \u201cdefinitely saw the Galifianakis bump,\u201d noting that \u201cWeb site traffic surged once the Between Two Ferns interview went on.\u201d The video itself now has more than 20 million views, and a healthy share of viewers followed links to healthcare.gov to sign up for the insurance offered under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Hangover Part III earned Cooper and Galifianakis plenty of ridicule and dismal reviews in 2013, but since its release, Cooper received his second Oscar nomination and Galifianakis interviewed a sitting president. Together, they also helped get millions of Americans insured\u2014and handed Obama his largest victory of 2014.
