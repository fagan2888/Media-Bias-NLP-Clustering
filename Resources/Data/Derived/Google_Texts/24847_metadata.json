Bush administration with enrollment in Medicare Part D and the Obama administration with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut, he noted that Congress could pass legislation arguing the creation of this special enrollment period doesn\u2019t qualify as an \u201cexceptional circumstance.\u201d\n\nHHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell is debating whether to add a grace period to assist those who may not know they are required to pay a fine for not having health insurance. The window to enroll in health insurance under the Affordable Care Act ended Sunday, and the administration announced Monday that 11.4 million Americans have signed up for insurance so far.\n\n>>> How One Nebraska Woman Lost Her Health Insurance Three Times Under Obamacare\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to analyze it. We\u2019re going to think about it, and we\u2019ll be back,\u201d Burwell said Wednesday. \u201cWhat we will try to do is focus deeply on the issue of the customer.\u201d\n\nShe is expected to announce her decision within the next two weeks.\n\nBurwell is under pressure from a group of Senate Democrats who sent her a letter asking to \u201callow certain individuals who were uninsured in 2014 another chance to enroll in 2015 health coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch a special enrollment period would increase coverage in affordable private health insurance and reduce the costs that the uninsured pass along to the insured,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nLed by Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, the Democrats who signed the message are: Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Jon Tester of Montana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Angus King of Maine, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Mark Warner of Virginia, Chuck Schumer of New York and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.\n\nAmericans must report for the first time this tax season whether they had health insurance in 2014. Those who do not face a penalty of $95 per adult or 1 percent of their annual household income. The Obama administration estimates approximately 6 million Americans will be forced to pay the fine this year.\n\nThose who do not purchase health insurance in 2015 face a higher penalty next year during filing season: $325 per adult or 2 percent of their household income. The fines continue to increase each year.\n\nThe administration is allowing consumers who had technological issues with HealthCare.gov an additional week to purchase health insurance.\n\nTwo states\u2014Minnesota and Washington\u2014added grace periods for residents to sign up for Obamacare through April, when filing season ends.\n\n\u201cThis is the first year that residents may incur a tax penalty for not having health insurance under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Richard Onizuka, head of the Washington Health Benefit Exchange, said in a statement. \u201cThis special enrollment window will allow these individuals\u2014as well as those who experienced difficulty completing their applications\u2014additional time to get enrolled for 2015 coverage.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, California, New York and Kentucky are considering their own grace periods aimed at consumers who may not have realized they will pay a fine for not having health insurance.\n\n\u201cThis is a teachable moment,\u201d Peter Lee, executive director of California\u2019s exchange, Covered California, said. \u201cThis is the first time ever in our history that health care and taxes are totally intertwined.\u201d\n\n>>> Appeals Court Rules Against Geneva College in Obamacare Abortion Drug Case\n\nFamilies USA, a nonprofit in favor of the Affordable Care Act, encouraged the Obama administration to create a special enrollment period for those who didn\u2019t purchase insurance this year.\n\n\u201cThis enrollment period is unusual because this is the first time people are facing tax consequences for not getting enrolled,\u201d Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, told The Daily Signal. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean it would happen again the following year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of passing the legislation is to give as many people coverage for the first time,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf tax season offers the first opportunity for people to learn about subsidies and the potential penalty, there\u2019s a chance many more people could get the coverage that would help themselves and their families.\u201d\n\nSome, though, argue extending enrollment sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nAccording to The Hill, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., opposes the special enrollment period. Instead, she called the penalty for not having insurance an \u201cunwelcome reminder\u201d of Obamacare.\n\nSimilarly, Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, told the Huffington Post that the additional enrollment period needs to be explained by the administration.\n\n\u201cSpecial enrollment periods need to be clearly defined in terms of who qualifies and the start and end date to make sure that consumers understand and health plans can help these folks navigate that process,\u201d she said.\n\nJost disagrees. He told The Daily Signal because this is the first year the uninsured have incurred a fine for not having coverage, it qualifies as an exceptional circumstance.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people who have not yet filed their taxes, and that includes most Americans, people are going to realize that this penalty is there,\u201d Jost said. \u201cAs of next year, they will have already been through it once, and presumably they\u2019ll realize that they\u2019re going to have to get things together.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The White House is exploring whether to add a special enrollment period under Obamacare for those who are unaware of the fine for not having insurance.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The White House is exploring whether to add a special enrollment period under Obamacare for those who are unaware of the fine for not having insurance.", "title": "It\u2019s Legal for Obama to Create a Special Enrollment Period", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/polspphotos115141.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-19T22:59:56+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JsjEhk"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The White House is exploring whether to add a special enrollment period under Obamacare for those who are unaware of the fine for not having insurance.", "title": "It\u2019s Legal for Obama to Create a Special Enrollment Period", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/polspphotos115141.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-02-19T17:23:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-19T22:59:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Timothy Jost, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Tammy Baldwin, Washington Health Benefit Exchange, Richard Onizuka, Obamacare fine, Joe Manchin, Heidi Heitkamp, Jon Tester"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e9b\"", "article_summary": "According to The Hill, Rep.
