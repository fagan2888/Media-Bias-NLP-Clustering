After transferring to Florida, Garcia had to sit out the 2012 season, per NCAA rules, but started 12 games for the Gators the next season, including seven at left guard and five at left tackle.\n\nIn 2014, after switching from left guard to center in the spring, Garcia earned second-team All-SEC honors.\n\n\u201cI feel pretty good about all the different players that we had,\u201d Broncos general manager John Elway said. \u201d I think that when we looked at the different options that we did have, obviously offensive line was a place that we needed to get better, and we feel that we really did with Ty and Max Garcia.\u201d\n\nIn the fifth round, at No. 164, the Broncos took Lorenzo Doss, a cornerback from Tulane.\n\nThe 5-foot-10, 182-pound Doss was a three-year letterman for The Green Wave who recorded 126 career tackles and 14 interceptions.\n\nDarius Kilgo, a 6-foot-3, 319-pound defensive lineman from Maryland, was taken in the sixth round (No. 203) by the Broncos.\n\nWith the first of their three consecutive compensatory picks in the seventh round, the Broncos took 6-foot-3, 215-pound quarterback Trevor Siemian from Northwestern at No. 250.\n\nSiemian tore his left anterior cruciate ligament in November and was unable to play the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about five months out of my surgery,\u201d he said. \u201cI probably have about a month left of good rehab, and I\u2019m trying to stay the course.\u201d\n\nAfter the selection, Elway tweeted that Siemian \u201chad a productive career as a quarterback at Northwestern. He has raw talent and we think he will develop nicely.\u201d\n\nHe will join Brock Osweiler and Zac Dysert as Peyton Manning\u2019s backups.\n\nAt No. 251, Denver took another cornerback from Tulane, Taurean Nixon (6 feet, 183 pounds). And with its final pick, Denver selected Josh Furman, a 6-foot-2 202-pound safety from Oklahoma State.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Max Garcia, Lorenzo Doss drafted by Denver Broncos on Day 3", "title": "Max Garcia, Lorenzo Doss drafted by Denver Broncos on Day 3", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/02/max-garcia-lorenzo-doss-drafted-by-denver-broncos-on-day-3/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150502_014622_max-garcia.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150502_014622_max-garcia.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-02T10:10:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T13:18:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90a0\"", "article_summary": "164, the Broncos took Lorenzo Doss, a cornerback from Tulane.\nGarcia started his college football career at Maryland, where he started all 12 games at left tackle in 2011.\nWith the first of their three consecutive compensatory picks in the seventh round, the Broncos took 6-foot-3, 215-pound quarterback Trevor Siemian from Northwestern at No.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a great fit for the Broncos as far as what they do for the zone blocking,\u201d Garcia said.\nThe Broncos met with Garcia several times and have told him they want him to come in and compete for the starting job."}
