Feulner, Ph.D. Founder, Chairman of the Asian Studies Center, and Chung Ju-yung Fellow\n\nFounder's Office\n\nWhether you\u2019re liberal or conservative, it\u2019s usually easy to say what you oppose. Both sides spend a good deal of time trying to shoot down policies from the other side. But do you know what you favor?\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to simply say \u201cno\u201d all the time. Yes, that\u2019s an important function in our system of government. Opposing bad policies is part of the job. But only part. You also need to promote good policies. And if you lose sight of what you\u2019re for, you won\u2019t be able to do that \u2014 at least not effectively.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m glad to see the Heritage Foundation\u2019s \u201cSolutions 2016\u201d come out. It\u2019s more than a handbook of sensible policy solutions on a wide range of issues, both domestic and foreign. It\u2019s a gut check for conservatives \u2014 a reminder of why we do what we do.\n\nTake, for example, calls for fiscal responsibility \u2014 for government to spend less, and to limit federal programs in number and scope. Does this spring from stinginess? From a desire to act like 21st century Scrooges? To hear liberals describe us, it does. We hate the poor and just about everyone else, right? Wrong.\n\nFor one thing, an ever-expanding government, even if you think it\u2019s a marvelous idea, is unsustainable. As Margaret Thatcher famously quipped, \u201cThe problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people\u2019s money.\u201d It\u2019s impractical and irresponsible to grow government endlessly.\n\nSo \u201cSolutions 2016\u201d rightly points out that the costs of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, left unchecked, are on pace to overwhelm the federal budget. One of the problems with Obamacare is that it will add nearly $2 trillion (note the \u201ct\u201d) to the federal budget over the next decade.\n\nPerhaps the most startling chart in \u201cSolutions 2016\u201d puts federal spending into stark perspective. It shows four stacks of twenty-dollar bills. One stack represents the median family income of $54,000. The next one, slightly higher, is the $61,000 a family would blow if it spent like the federal government. A tiny one then shows the $7,000 they\u2019d be putting on a credit card. A final, huge stack stands in for the $300,000 of debt they already have.\n\nBut the book goes beyond that: \u201cSince the beginning of the 20th century, the federal government\u2019s domestic activities have expanded well beyond what the Founders envisioned, leading to ever more centralized government, smothering the creativity of states and localities.\u201d Exactly.\n\nIt goes on: \u201cEven when Washington allows states to administer the programs, it taxes families, subtracts a hefty administrative cost, and sends the remaining revenues back to state and local governments with specific rules dictating how they may and may not spend the money.\u201d\n\nOr take conservative policies on taxes. Cut them, yes, but good policy goes beyond this. As \u201cSolutions 2016\u201d points out: \u201cThere is a growing consensus that a simpler, flatter tax code \u2014 one with fewer, lower marginal rates and only essential deductions \u2014 is one of the best ways to promote growth.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s the key: growth. The right policy won\u2019t just save us money. It will create a stronger, more vibrant economy. That\u2019s something that benefits everyone.\n\nIn short, conservatives are not anti-government. We are anti-big government. Anti-overreaching government, one that is permitted or encouraged to expand beyond its constitutional limits, to the point where it encroaches on the God-given freedoms of hard-working Americans.\n\n\u201cThe conservative project is a constructive one,\u201d the introduction to \u201cSolutions 2016\u201d points out. \u201cOur task \u2014 like the task of every generation of Americans \u2014 is to distinguish what should be conserved from what should be reformed, abolished or overturned, and to implement principled reforms that protect rights, expand opportunity, strengthen civil society, and eliminate favoritism.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a compass reading that\u2019s well worth taking as we enter a presidential election year. Conservatives have solutions, all right \u2014 as long as we remember what we stand for.\n\n- Ed Feulner is the Founder of the Heritage Foundation\n\nThis piece originally appeared in the Washington Times\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Heritage Foundation", "title": "In Search of Solutions", "url": "http://www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2016/1/in-search-of-solutions", "image": "http://www.heritage.org/~/media/heritage.ashx", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/heritagefoundation"}, "twitter": {"site": "@heritage", "card": "summary", "creator": "@heritage"}, "robots": "NOODP", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2eb9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe conservative project is a constructive one,\u201d the introduction to \u201cSolutions 2016\u201d points out.\nIt\u2019s more than a handbook of sensible policy solutions on a wide range of issues, both domestic and foreign.\nPerhaps the most startling chart in \u201cSolutions 2016\u201d puts federal spending into stark perspective.\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m glad to see the Heritage Foundation\u2019s \u201cSolutions 2016\u201d come out.\nSo \u201cSolutions 2016\u201d rightly points out that the costs of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, left unchecked, are on pace to overwhelm the federal budget."}
