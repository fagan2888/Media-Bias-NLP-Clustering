The helicopter was returning from an operation to search for those still missing from the ferry Sewol which sank in waters off the country\u2019s southwest coast on April 16. Reuters\n\nIn a fresh tragedy related to South Korea\u2019s deadly ferry sinking, a helicopter carrying rescue workers who participated in the search operation for those still missing crashed on Thursday, killing all five on board.\n\nThe helicopter crashed onto a street in the southern city of Gwangju just before 11am while traveling back to a base in the north of the country. No other serious injuries were reported. The reason for the crash is unclear.\n\nThe crash comes almost exactly three months after one of South Korea\u2019s worst-ever maritime disasters. At the site of the April 16 sinking, divers continue to search for missing bodies, while a key fugitive remains on the run and politicians are squabbling over the creation of an independent committee to look into disaster.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, 43 student survivors of the sinking arrived at the National Assembly in Seoul to support a hunger strike outside parliament by parents of their dead classmates to demand the swift passage of a bill to set up the committee. The students walked for two days from their high school in Ansan, a Seoul suburb, about 47 kilometers, or 29 miles, away.\n\nPoliticians are split over issues such as whether to give the committee power to investigate and prosecute. The ruling party opposes the idea, noting that the case is already being investigated by authorities and insisting that state powers can\u2019t be given to a civil committee.\n\nOpposition politicians and the families argue that the committee can\u2019t function properly unless given such strong authority.\n\n\u201cWe will do our best to get the bill passed in order to seek the truth and allow no \u2018sanctuary\u2019 of the investigation,\u201d Kim Han-gil, co-leader of major opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said during a meeting with family members.\n\nParents of the student victims of South Korea\u2019s ferry disaster, watched by police, are on a hunger strike with placards at the entrance of parliament in Seoul on Wednesday.

Most of the bodies from the wreck have been recovered, although divers are still making daily searches of the murky sea in search of 11 missing people who traveled on the ferry.\n\nAuthorities are also still chasing a man and his son who are believed to been deeply involved in the operation of the doomed ferry.\n\nIf parliament fails to pass the bill by Thursday, which is the last day of the current parliamentary session, it will have to wait until next extraordinary session, likely later this month.\n\nMore than 30 student survivors of South Korea\u2019s ferry disaster march with yellow umbrellas near parliament in Seoul on July 16, 2014 to press demands by victims\u2019 relatives for an independent inquiry into the tragedy that claimed around 300 lives.
