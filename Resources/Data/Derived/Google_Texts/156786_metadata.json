With some very famous people, and some very not famous people,\" she shares. \"I've been engaged three times.\"\n\nOffering a rare window into her private life, Crow goes on to reveal details of a previous relationship, including specifics about couture that lasted much longer than the couple:\n\n\"I am very close to Ralph Lauren, I love him very much,\" she explains. \"I still have the sketches for the wedding dress he designed for me. I got rid of the guy I was going to marry, but I still have the sketches.\"\n\nSpeaking honestly, the woman with eight studio albums to her credit admits that she is often to blame for failings in her love life:\n\n\"I take great credit, for some of the demises,\" says Crow, whose newest record, \"Feels Like Home,\" was released this week. \"It's difficult to date a woman who's strong, and who runs a business, and who's gone a lot.\"\n\nWatch the clip for more of Morgan's interview with Crow \u2013 including the portion in which the singer addresses frequently reported similarities she shares with actress Jennifer Aniston \u2013 and for the full episode of \"Piers Morgan Live,\" tune to CNN at 9.\n\n-\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram", "article_metadata": {"description": "Coming up this evening at 9, Piers Morgan adds some musical flare to his program, welcoming Sheryl Crow for a face to face, primetime exclusive interview.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Sheryl Crow on the number of times she's been properly in love: \"Many, many\"", "og": {"url": "http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/12/sheryl-crow-on-the-number-of-times-shes-been-properly-in-love-many-many/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130911172708-exp-pmt-sheryl-crow-properly-in-love-00005330-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Coming up this evening at 9, Piers Morgan adds some musical flare to his program, welcoming Sheryl Crow for a face to face, primetime exclusive interview.", "title": "Sheryl Crow on the number of times she's been properly in love: \"Many, many\""}, "keywords": "piers morgan live, jason kurtz", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Piers Morgan", "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/169bdd3c913ad32d5e743b1d82ca1052?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5e22\"", "article_summary": "-\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram\nComing up this evening at 9, Piers Morgan adds some musical flare to his program, welcoming Sheryl Crow for a face to face, primetime exclusive interview.\n\"It's difficult to date a woman who's strong, and who runs a business, and who's gone a lot.\"\nWatch the clip for more of Morgan's interview with Crow \u2013 including the portion in which the singer addresses frequently reported similarities she shares with actress Jennifer Aniston \u2013 and for the full episode of \"Piers Morgan Live,\" tune to CNN at 9.\nWith relationships and romances often serving as the thematic heartbeat of her songwriting, Crow's answer isn't all that surprising:\"Many, many."}
