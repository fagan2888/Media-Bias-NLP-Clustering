The success led the studio to ready a follow-up, \u201cMuppets Most Wanted,\u201d for a March 21 release. Meanwhile, \u201cSesame Street,\u201d another Henson classic, launches its 45th season in September.\n\nThough there are many details still to be ironed out, from selecting the material for the building facade panels to the final list of objects that will be shown inside it, Anthony said he was pleased the expansion is finally moving forward after more than six years of pitching the project to potential contributors.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel proud,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cThe exciting part is, this will be a living, breathing legacy to the genius of Jim Henson that people can look at and can be a part of.\u201d\n\nThe puppets on view will range from megastars of the Henson stratosphere - including Kermit, Miss Piggy, Big Bird, Cookie Monster and Oscar the Grouch - to more obscure creations. Those include Omar, a character from Henson\u2019s first television show, \u201cSam and Friends,\u201d in Washington in 1955, and Roosevelt Franklin, who debuted in \u201cSesame Street\u2019s\u201d first season (1970).\n\nOther Henson characters represented will hail from the TV show \u201cFraggle Rock\u201d and movies \u201cDark Crystal\u201d and \u201cLabyrinth,\u201d even from a 1966 \u201cEd Sullivan Show\u201d appearance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any collection as large as what\u2019s going to be at the Center for Puppetry Arts,\u201d said Bonnie Erickson, executive director of The Jim Henson Legacy.\n\nHenson\u2019s family and friends founded the nonprofit in 1993 to preserve and perpetuate Henson\u2019s contributions to puppetry, television, movies, special effects and media technology. Last year, the nonprofit also donated Henson puppets and objects to the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of American History and the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, N.Y.\n\n\u201cDuring his lifetime, Jim explored so many different varieties of puppetry,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that the Center for Puppetry Arts is so uniquely qualified to tell.\u201d\n\nThe tentative plan shows \u201cThe World of Jim Henson\u201d as a chronological tour across 14 galleries following Henson\u2019s 35-year career. He died unexpectedly at age 53 in 1990.\n\nHighlights will include re-creations of Henson\u2019s office and the Muppet Workshop - where the furry, funny characters are created - and a mock-up of a TV studio.\n\n\u201cThere will be a lot of interactive and video elements, and different kinds of touch screens,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a pretty comprehensive experience.\u201d\n\nThe Henson exhibit will share the upper level with an exhibit of the center\u2019s international puppets. Its tentative title: \u201cA World of Puppets.\u201d\n\nErickson, who designed and built puppets that included Miss Piggy after being hired by Henson in 1970, believes these side-by-side exhibits will make a perfect pair because he drew great inspiration from puppetry traditions in Europe, starting with a trip there in the late 1950s.\n\nVisitors will continue to enter the puppetry center\u2019s original facility from the rear parking lot, moving into the museum wing through its atrium.\n\nThe architect is Clark Patterson Lee, a Suwanee firm whose credits include the Mint Museum Uptown in Charlotte and Birmingham\u2019s McWane Science Center.\n\nThe expansion\u2019s lower level will house a library, museum offices, storage and a future multipurpose room/lunchroom.\n\nAnthony said that final space will be \u201croughed in\u201d but unfinished until funds can be secured.\n\nThen the eternal fundraiser added: \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a donor for as we speak, and that\u2019s $700,000.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, http://www.ajc.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "While Kermit the Frog's most famous song is \"It's Not Easy Being Green,\" the Center for Puppetry Arts might add that it's not easy raising green either.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/25/center-for-puppetry-arts-to-expand-in-atlanta/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "While Kermit the Frog\u2019s most famous song is \u201cIt\u2019s Not Easy Being Green,\u201d the Center for Puppetry Arts might add that it\u2019s not easy raising green either.", "title": "Center for Puppetry Arts to expand in Atlanta"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "While Kermit the Frog's most famous song is \"It's Not Easy Being Green,\" the Center for Puppetry Arts might add that it's not easy raising green either.", "card": "summary", "title": "Center for Puppetry Arts to expand in Atlanta"}, "Author": "HOWARD POUSNER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Center For Puppetry Arts, Vince Anthony"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda91\"", "article_summary": "The puppetry center reached its $14 million project goal but fundraising continues for a list of extra features.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t anticipate it would take this long, but the financial downturn certainly added to the delay,\u201d puppetry center executive director Vince Anthony said.\nATLANTA (AP) - While Kermit the Frog\u2019s most famous song is \u201cIt\u2019s Not Easy Being Green,\u201d the Center for Puppetry Arts might add that it\u2019s not easy raising green either.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any collection as large as what\u2019s going to be at the Center for Puppetry Arts,\u201d said Bonnie Erickson, executive director of The Jim Henson Legacy.\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that the Center for Puppetry Arts is so uniquely qualified to tell.\u201dThe tentative plan shows \u201cThe World of Jim Henson\u201d as a chronological tour across 14 galleries following Henson\u2019s 35-year career."}
