After all, they were elected by a great number of their constituents to represent them in the capital of the world\u2019s most powerful nation. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nIn denouncing Republicans for their lack of a plan regarding climate change, Democrats took to the Senate floor with a sign that had Internet emoticons on them.\n\nThis reporting is from The Hill, not The Onion (emphasis mine):\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) spoke from the Senate floor with a sign that read \"#WhatsTheGOPsClimatePlan \u00af\\_(?)_/\u00af\u201d Sen. Ed Markey also spoke from the Senate floor with a sign that included a sad-faced shruggie. The Massachusetts Democrat suggested that Republicans didn't have a plan to combat climate change, adding that \"shruggie says 'I'm not happy. I'm sad.' \" It's not the first time Democrats have used the internet emoticon to help them sum up their critiques of Republican policies. Earlier this year, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) used the symbol during a speech suggesting that Republicans didn't have a plan if the Supreme Court struck down subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDemocrats can disagree, debate, and slam Republicans all they want\u2014on anything. But can we please move past the childish antics and debate serious issues like grownups? Or is that asking too much?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thank you. .05/27/2016 8:15:26AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Thank you.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Democrats, Please Stop Using Emoticons on the Senate Floor", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/07/29/dems-gops-climate-change-plan-n2032061", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/7/29/21.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Thank you.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Democrats, Please Stop Using Emoticons on the Senate Floor", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/07/29/dems-gops-climate-change-plan-n2032061", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/7/29/21.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Democrats, Please Stop Using Emoticons on the Senate Floor, Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "One would hope, and I dare say expect, that members of Congress conduct themselves in a manner of utmost professionalism, especially when on the Senate floor.\nIn denouncing Republicans for their lack of a plan regarding climate change, Democrats took to the Senate floor with a sign that had Internet emoticons on them.\n)_/\u00af\u201d Sen.
