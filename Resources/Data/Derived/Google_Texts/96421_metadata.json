Hospital executives must make consumer-friendly pricing information a top revenue cycle focus or else the medical billing process will merely fall apart before it even begins.\n\nUnder the ACA, hospitals must establish what their standard charges are for items and services and make this information publicly available, said the policy brief\u2019s authors, Barbara Anthony, Senior Fellow in Healthcare, and Scott Haller, Research Associate.\n\nAdditionally, guidelines from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) mandate hospitals must make the information available if an inquiry arises so consumers can compare prices with ease.\n\nFifty-four surveyed acute care hospitals nationwide said they are ill-prepared to provide price information to healthcare consumers. The authors pushed for greater regulatory reform to enact change.\n\nNinety percent of states reportedly fail to provide adequate consumer pricing information, according to the Catalyst for Payment Reform (CPR).\n\nFifty-six percent of Americans have searched for price information before receiving care, said David Schleifer, PhD, Public Agenda\u2019s Senior Research Associate.\n\nThe Pioneer Institute said there is a lack of standardization across hospitals. Healthcare transparency rules apparently vary sizably according to state.\n\nMost healthcare consumers are unaware variation exists, Schleifer said. Healthcare providers, physicians, nurses, and medical billing staff members need to be on board to enact collective change, he asserted.\n\nAccording to the Pioneer Institute, a sample of how mandates vary across states is as follows:\n\nCalifornia: all hospitals must make their master charge list available to the public and make common costs available upon request\n\nFlorida: cost estimates are provided to patient per request, as per state law\n\nNorth Carolina: under state law, a report must be created that compares prices for common procedures at top hospitals and free-standing clinics\n\nTexas: hospitals must provide estimates at or before patient admittance\n\nNew York: hospitals must either have charges up on their website \u201cor provide a way for consumers to find them\u201d\n\nAll surveyed hospitals were covered by the ACA\u2019s requirements regarding price transparency for consumers, the authors said. The only state that did not offer healthcare consumers the right to see price information was Iowa.\n\nWhether or not state laws are in place \u201cdoes not seem to influence how easy or difficult it is for consumers to obtain price estimates,\u201d they said.\n\nFurther complicating matters is that price summary information apparently varied sizably according to region.\n\nAccording to the Pioneer Institute, \u201cnon-disclosure of healthcare prices interferes with the normal operation of market forces and prevents consumers from spending their healthcare dollars wisely.\"\n\nAnd because of the growth of high-deductible plans among non-subsidized middle-income healthcare consumers, healthcare price transparency is an even more important issue than ever before, the authors stated.\n\nAs the Commonwealth Fund reported early last year, insurance premiums have been increasing at an alarming rate.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Affordable Care Act offers a platform from which to build, securing a more affordable future will likely require action beyond those reforms, focusing on costs of care, particularly for the privately insured,\u201d the Commonwealth Fund said.\n\nFuture initiatives \u201cshould focus on prices paid by private insurers, as well as incentives to reorganize the delivery system to improve care experiences and outcomes,\u201d the organization stated.\n\nIn 2013, a typical employer-sponsored family insurance premium reportedly ranged from over $13,400 to $20,000 depending on state.\n\nAccording to the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s 2015 Healthcare Affordability Index, 43 percent of adults with moderate incomes said their deductible was \u201cdifficult or impossible to afford.\u201d\n\nThe Pioneer Institute reported that under the ACA, deductible amounts may increase by up to $6,500 per person and may top $13,000 per family.\n\nWhen it comes to transparency, the Pioneer Institute said healthcare consumers are actively trying to figure out how much their care delivery costs and make informed, educated choices.\n\nBut when consumers attempt to gather pricing data, it is mostly \u201cimpracticable to obtain,\u201d Anthony and Haller asserted.\n\nWhen researchers called various hospitals nationwide asking for pricing information, they were often met with long wait times.\n\nIt took \u201clots of persistence and diligence on the part of our researchers to obtain price information,\u201d the authors said.\n\nComplete price estimates could not be obtained from 14 of the 54 hospitals. Up to 11 phone calls were made.\n\nCalls were quick to be transferred \u201cback to the operator, billing, financial aid, patient registration, \u2018upstairs,\u2019 \u2018over there,\u2019 or \u2018downstairs,\u2019\u201d they explained.\n\n\u201cOur callers were frequently required to provide medical billing codes about which an ordinary consumer would have no knowledge and further, our staff was often told to call a separate organization altogether to obtain a complete estimate.\u201d\n\nOther physician staff \u201cwere quite hesitant to provide price information under the mistaken belief that disclosing price to a prospective patient was not permitted,\u201d they explained.\n\nPrice information was generally not available on hospital websites, they revealed. Prices obtained were often nothing more than broad estimates with \u201cwide variations,\u201d they added.\n\nFifty-seven percent of hospitals took up to 74 minutes to provide the price, or failed to provide a complete price.\n\nThe city of Orlando reportedly received the lowest overall score for timeliness, with 40 percent of its surveyed hospitals taking up to 75 minutes to provide pricing information.\n\nOn a positive note, \u201csome hospitals do get it right,\u201d the authors said. Not every hospital sent researchers on a phone transfer whirlwind, expected healthcare consumers to know medical billing codes offhand, or made transfers to wrong departments.\n\nAuthors reported the following hospitals received top marks:\n\nThe Iowa Clinic, Des Moines\n\nDr. P. Phillips Hospital, Orlando\n\nDallas Regional Medical Center\n\nCedars Sinai, Los Angeles\n\nNYU Langone, New York\n\nMount Sinai, New York\n\nWake Med Cary Hospital, Raleigh/Durham\n\nDuke University Hospital, Raleigh/Durham\n\n\u201c[Price] transparency can be accomplished, and consumers can access their right to healthcare price estimates,\u201d they concluded. \u201cIf some hospitals can do this, it shows that there are systems and protocols in place that can be replicated across the country.\u201d\n\nAs far as recommendations to close the gap, the authors advocated going back once more to the ACA drawing board.\n\n\u201cWe need to create a national culture of healthcare price transparency. There already exists a legal foundation upon which to build this cultural change,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cHospitals working with federal and state governments can lead the way to promote and encourage price transparency as a consumer right. There is a great deal of progress yet to be made and plenty of opportunities for all major stakeholders.\u201d\n\nA review of hospital website content and making sure consumers do not have to spend time digging through medical billing code information to know what their medical bill may look like is key.\n\n\u201cHospitals should make strong efforts to raise awareness among hospital staff of a consumer\u2019s right to price information and invest in appropriate personnel training to facilitate such requests.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin hospitals, a culture of consumer price transparency should start at the top with boards of trustees and CEOs establishing consumer-friendly and timely access to price transparency information as a priority goal for their institutions.\u201d\n\nImage Credit: [Pioneer Institute] (Chart 2)\n\nImage Credit: [Pioneer Institute] (Orlando)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital revenue cycle needs to place greater focus on healthcare transparency.
