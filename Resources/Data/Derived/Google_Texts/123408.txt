There are currently zero cases of Ebola in the United States. Remember how freaked out we were just a month ago? Chris Hayes does, and he reminded viewers last night of just how crazy CNN and Fox News went with hyping Ebola panic.

This week, Dr. Craig Spencer was officially released from the hospital, and New York (along with the rest of the nation) is now Ebola-free. “Public health experts said all along,” Hayes said, “Ebola would very likely be contained in the U.S., and, you know, that’s why I think all the commentators and pundits were so calm and rational about Ebola instead of panicking or trying to score political points.”

And then Hayes proceeded to show exactly the opposite in a segment titled “The Media’s Totally Rational Response to Ebola,” with clips from CNN and Fox News galore. They included Megyn Kelly calling Spencer “irresponsible,” CNN wondering if Ebola was Obama’s Katrina, several different Fox News hosts using Ebola to push border security, and Fox’s Jeanine Pirro freaking the ever-loving hell out over Ebola.

Hayes concluded with a smattering of applause and congratulated both networks for keeping their cool.
