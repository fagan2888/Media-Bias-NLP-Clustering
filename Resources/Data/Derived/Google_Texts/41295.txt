It’s not Christmas in Dallas until it’s Tubachristmas.

About a thousand people gathered near the bell tower at Thanks-Giving Square on Christmas Eve afternoon to hear such carols as “Deck the Halls and “Oh Come, All Ye Faithful” performed by more than 200 tubists, most sporting festive hats and scarves. This year’s event, which ran an hour, was the 37th, and as always the tubists were of all ages and backgrounds. One man came all the way from from Manchester, England, to perform.

The first Tubachristmas was celebrated at the Rockefeller Center in New York City in 1974. The event has grown to more than 150 cities across the country.

“This is one of the most fun events that we provide to the community,” said Chris Slaughter, president of the Thanks-Giving Square Foundation. “And it is a way for everybody to really get into the holiday spirit.”
