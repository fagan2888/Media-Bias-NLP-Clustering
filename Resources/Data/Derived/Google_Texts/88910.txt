Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will rally with home health care aides Wednesday as part of the Fight for $15 movement.

Schneiderman plans to join as many as 5,000 health care aides on 64th St. and Central Park West ahead of the larger march to Times Square.

Home health care has become the fastest-growing job in America, but the wages for most are $10 or less.

In New York City, where there are roughly 150,000 home health care aides, only those who are part of the 1199 SEIU union are eligible for health insurance benefits.

The 1199 SEIU workers also earn $10 an hour — while their nonunion counterparts average $8, with no benefits.

The Fight for $15 aims to raise the minimum hourly pay for low-wage workers all across the country — not just in New York City.

Schneiderman will address a raucous crowd when he speaks at 4:30 p.m.

The home health care aides — union and nonunion — will wear white lab coats and rally along with a steel drum and brass marching band.

After the rally organized by 1199 SEIU, the health care workers will feed into the larger Fight for $15 rally at Columbus Circle.

The group — expected to be 15,000 strong — will march to Times Square.

Among the health care workers will be Rosemarie Rumbley.

She makes $10 an hour caring for a woman who was paralyzed during routine back surgery — but when it comes to her own health insurance, she has to rely on Obamacare.

Rumbley, 57, raised two kids as a single mom by working 12 hours a day, seven days a week for most of their childhood.

When she started in the industry, she earned $3.35 an hour.
