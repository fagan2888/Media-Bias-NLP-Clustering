Can't wait for the season. Next up in our "heat index," it turns out that limes can cause skin burns. Doctors putting out a warning. These girls were hospitalized with burns with all over their bodies. Abc's abbie boudreau has the story. The size of a baseball. I have a big lister right there. Reporter: Look at the second-degree burns and severe blisters. It hurt really bad. It felt like ten-times worse than a sunburn. Reporter: These 7-year-olds to 11-year-olds were playing in this fresno backyard, when they decided to pick limes from their neighbor's tree. After adding a little lime juice to their soda, it became a game. We were dashing each other to drink the lime juice. That's how it got all over our face. Reporter: But the next day, the girls were in excruciating pain. It was like 100 needles going into one spot. It was probably the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. Reporter: So painful, the parents rushed them to the hospital. A parents' worst nightmare is watching your kids scream and cry and begging you to stop the pain. Reporter: It turns out the girls had sufficiented second-degree burns with the acid in the limes, combined with sunlight. Dr. Richard besser says their scarring can take 6 to 12 months to heal.

The only advice around this, is if you've been handling limes, wash your hands if you go out in the sun. The girls are back in school and say they've learned their lesson. I'm done with limes and lemonade. I'm not touching it. Reporter: For "good morning america," abbie boudreau, abc news, los angeles. Wow. Right? I mean, in california, lime trees in so many backyards.
