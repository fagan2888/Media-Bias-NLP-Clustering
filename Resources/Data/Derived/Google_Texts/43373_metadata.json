(AP) \u2014 When Eric Church saw video of Luke Bryan\u2019s nasty fall from the stage last week, his first thought was to reach out to his friend and make sure he was OK.\n\nWhile everybody could chuckle afterward \u2014 it was the talk of Nashville during the CMT Awards and CMA Music Fest \u2014 Bryan\u2019s fall onto the metal security stanchion underscored the dangers involved with live performances.\n\n\u201cLuke\u2019s lucky he didn\u2019t break his neck,\u201d Church said. \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s pretty nasty, the way he went into it. When you first see it, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, no, he might be really hurt there.\u2019 But then he pops up.\u201d\n\nBryan has good-naturedly answered questions from reporters and taken jokes from friends with a smile since his fall May 29 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Jokers at CMT Awards rehearsals put caution tape and orange hazard cones near the edge of the stage, and he allowed himself to be wrapped in the yellow tape during the broadcast.\n\nBryan took some stitches in the fall and was a little gimpy maneuvering around town this week. He\u2019s one of the country music\u2019s most energetic performers, though, and the fall didn\u2019t slow him down. He performed twice at the CMTs, springboarding through a trapdoor in the stage floor several feet in the air on one song and walking the length of the arena on the second.\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s a job hazard,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cYou go do 100, 130 shows a year \u2014 different stages, different nuances. We all gather around and say a little prayer before we go onstage that we stay safe. What\u2019s always scary is about how much stuff is hanging above your head. There\u2019s a lot of little things that can happen.\u201d\n\nCountry stars convening in Nashville this week all had a mishap to relay. Most were humorous in hindsight, and a little scary at the time.\n\nTyler Hubbard of Florida Georgia Line took a spill while performing with Bryan last year, \u201cand kinda cut my hands up. But nothing too bad. It\u2019s more of an ego hurt than anything else, and I am sure that\u2019s how it was for Luke, too.\u201d\n\nKiefer and Shawna Thompson of Thompson Square also had a few mishaps while performing with Bryan.\n\n\u201cI almost went over backwards on a monitor one night but I caught myself,\u201d Kiefer Thompson said. \u201cActually, that happened with Luke when we were coming back onstage, my boot caught the corner of the stage and I almost went over. Did the slow fall dance for about 20 yards, but I pulled up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Luke Bryan\u2019s not the only star to take a tumble", "title": "Luke Bryan\u2019s not the only star to take a tumble", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Luke Bryan\u2019s not the only star to take a tumble", "title": "Luke Bryan\u2019s not the only star to take a tumble", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/06/luke_bryans_not_the_only_star_to_take_a_tumble/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/music-stage-mishaps.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Luke Bryan\u2019s not the only star to take a tumble", "title": "Luke Bryan\u2019s not the only star to take a tumble", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/music-stage-mishaps.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chris Talbott", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb80\"", "article_summary": "\u201cActually, that happened with Luke when we were coming back onstage, my boot caught the corner of the stage and I almost went over.\nBryan took some stitches in the fall and was a little gimpy maneuvering around town this week.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsNASHVILLE, Tenn.
