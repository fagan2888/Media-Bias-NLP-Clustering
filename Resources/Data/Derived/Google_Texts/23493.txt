After years of planning, Spring Hill officials on Friday will break ground on Port Royal Park and Fire Station No. 2, two of the city’s biggest construction projects in years.

Port Royal Park, to be the city’s largest park, will be built on 31 acres in the southeast part of the city, adjacent to the Deerfield subdivision. The $4.7 million project will be done in two phases. It will include football and soccer fields, a splash pad, a greenway path, sidewalks, playground, pavilions, basketball and tennis courts and a building for concessions and restrooms. On the grounds of the new park, Fire Station No. 2 will be built after years in which firefighters have worked out of a renovated house at 4237 Port Royal Road. The project is estimated to cost $2,025,000.

The public is invited to the ground-breaking ceremony, hosted by the Spring Hill Parks and Recreation Commission and the Spring Hill Fire Department, at 5 p.m. on the park site.
