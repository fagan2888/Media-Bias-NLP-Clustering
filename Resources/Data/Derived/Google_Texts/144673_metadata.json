The applicant is requesting several variances, including building a health care facility in a singlefamily residential zone, before the project can be built.\n\nThe developer is under contract to buy the property on Dunkerhook Road, where the historic Jacob Vanderbeck Jr. House sits from the estate of Henrietta Vander Plaat. That home is a Dutch stone house that has been standing since before the Revolutionary War and is next door to another historical home that is owned by the borough.\n\nRobert Milanese, the builder\u2019s president, has said that the project could not move forward with the house remaining in its current location.\n\nBut during Thursday\u2019s meeting, attended by around 40 residents and historic preservationists, Milanese said his team revised the plans to move a portion of the home near the facility, preserving the older part. The changes stemmed from a resident\u2019s suggestion during a prior meeting, Milanese said.\n\n\u201cIt fit very nicely with the adjustments in our site plan and building,\u201d Milanese said.\n\nThe new plans call for removing one of two entrances to the facility and reconfiguring the building slightly, dropping the number of beds by three and lowering the height of the structure, among other changes. The proposed height was 38 feet; now the height, measured from the first floor to the midpoint of the roof\u2019s ridge, would be 36 feet and 8 inches, Milanese said.\n\nThe changes allow for the developer to move the left part of the Vanderbeck House \u2014 the older piece \u2014 to the front portion of the property. Milanese would hire a contractor with experience in moving historical buildings to undertake the effort.\n\nThe contractor would pour new footings for the structure, but also would move over its original stone foundation. The exterior would be restored, Milanese said.\n\nThe home likely would be used as an accessory to the senior living facility, such as to house security or administration. Nothing has been determined yet, Milanese said.\n\nThursday\u2019s hearing continued deep into the evening and the proposal will be subjected to more board review.\n\nIf the historic house were moved, it would change the architecture of the structure, Milanese said, as it currently stands on sloped land but is being moved to a flat surface.\n\nThe house\u2019s orientation also would change. Like all stone houses in Bergen County, the Vanderbeck house faces south to receive heat from the winter sun, said Jane Diepeveen, Fair Lawn\u2019s historian, who called the change \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n\nSome residents asked if there was any way that the entire home could be preserved. Milanese said it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to keep the whole house should the senior living facility be approved.\n\nThe developer said he also researched applying for Green Acres funding \u2014 state funds that go toward preserving historical structures and open spaces \u2014 but it could take up to a year for approval. Milanese said his contract does not allow for him to wait that long.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "A developer who wants to build a senior living facility on the site where a Colonial-era home now stands changed his application to move a portion of the historic house to the front of the proposed project, saving the oldest part of the structure.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "mary diduch", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/developer-would-save-part-of-fair-lawn-historic-home-1.1118020", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com:80/polopoly_fs/1.663115!/fileImage/httpImage/vanderbeck-082913-cn-tif.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A developer who wants to build a senior living facility on the site where a Colonial-era home now stands changed his application to move a portion of the historic house to the front of the proposed project, saving the oldest part of the structure."}, "title": "Developer would save part of Fair Lawn historic home", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "mary diduch", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "Developer would save part of Fair Lawn historic home"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt fit very nicely with the adjustments in our site plan and building,\u201d Milanese said.\nThe developer is under contract to buy the property on Dunkerhook Road, where the historic Jacob Vanderbeck Jr. House sits from the estate of Henrietta Vander Plaat.\nThe changes allow for the developer to move the left part of the Vanderbeck House \u2014 the older piece \u2014 to the front portion of the property.\nIf the historic house were moved, it would change the architecture of the structure, Milanese said, as it currently stands on sloped land but is being moved to a flat surface.\nThat home is a Dutch stone house that has been standing since before the Revolutionary War and is next door to another historical home that is owned by the borough."}
