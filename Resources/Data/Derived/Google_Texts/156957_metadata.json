Four years later, tens of thousands of people are still living in temporary housing. Adding to the hardship is a nuclear catastrophe that has created a no-go zone around the Fukushima atomic plant.\n\nDuring his stay in Tokyo, which began Thursday, William visited with the cast of a samurai TV show, performed a good-luck sake-barrel-breaking ceremony at a shopping mall and had tea with Japan\u2019s crown prince. He is scheduled to leave Sunday for China.\n\nSome highlights from William\u2019s trip:\n\n___\n\nDIANA\u2019S SON\n\nMemories of William\u2019s mother, who died in 1997, are everywhere. The media in Japan, a culture that traditionally values male heirs, have been referring to him as \u201cDiana\u2019s first-born son,\u201d as though that was more important than his being second in line to the throne.\n\nAfter William on Friday laid a wreath at a grave for Commonwealth servicemen who died while prisoners of war in Japan, he signed a visitors\u2019 book. Next to the book was a framed photo of his mother laying a wreath at the same cemetery when she visited in 1995. Next to the picture were written the words: \u201cMay she rest in peace.\u201d\n\nThe master who performed the ancient art of tea ceremony for William in a Tokyo garden had done the same for Diana, and recalled how she had loved the green tea. William\u2019s trip to the tsunami-devastated northeastern region, relatively unusual for visiting foreign dignitaries, follows in the path of his mother\u2019s humanitarian efforts.\n\n___\n\nBRAVING RADIATION\n\nOn Saturday, William visited with children in a playground in Fukushima, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of the meltdown-stricken nuclear reactors. The children were being allowed to play outdoors for the first time recently. Previously, radiation levels had been too high for children, who are more susceptible to the health risks of radiation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prince William evokes Diana memories in Japan tsunami trip", "title": "Prince William evokes Diana memories in Japan tsunami trip", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Prince William evokes Diana memories in Japan tsunami trip", "title": "Prince William evokes Diana memories in Japan tsunami trip", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/28/prince_william_evokes_diana_memories_in_japan_tsunami_trip/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/japan-britain-royal-visit.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Prince William evokes Diana memories in Japan tsunami trip", "title": "Prince William evokes Diana memories in Japan tsunami trip", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/japan-britain-royal-visit.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Yuri Kageyama", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "___BRAVING RADIATIONOn Saturday, William visited with children in a playground in Fukushima, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of the meltdown-stricken nuclear reactors.\nThe March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 19,000 people, left swaths of the northeastern Japanese coastline destroyed.\nPreviously, radiation levels had been too high for children, who are more susceptible to the health risks of radiation.\nAfter William on Friday laid a wreath at a grave for Commonwealth servicemen who died while prisoners of war in Japan, he signed a visitors\u2019 book.\nDuring his stay in Tokyo, which began Thursday, William visited with the cast of a samurai TV show, performed a good-luck sake-barrel-breaking ceremony at a shopping mall and had tea with Japan\u2019s crown prince."}
