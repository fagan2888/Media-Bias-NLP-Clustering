From The Heritage Foundation, Rob Bluey explains how Sen. Mike Lee and Gov.-elect Matt Bevin kept a bill to gut Obamacare alive.

Conservatives have waited more than five years to deliver an Obamacare repeal bill to President Barack Obama’s desk. And until this week, it appeared that Republicans were about to squander what many conservatives believed was their best shot since the law’s passage.

That changed Monday night. In a closed-door meeting with his Republican colleagues, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scrapped a House-passed bill and conceded to conservative demands to make the repeal package stronger.

Sources on Capitol Hill and in the conservative movement credited the change to two factors: Sen. Mike Lee’s persistence on using the budget reconciliation process and Kentucky Gov.-elect Matt Bevin’s victory last month after campaigning against his state’s Medicaid expansion.
