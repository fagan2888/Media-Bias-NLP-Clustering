Salon is expecting losses to continue for fiscal year 2014, causing the media group's accountant Burr Pilger Mayer Inc. to doubt Salon\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern, or without the threat of liquidation, in the company's latest annual report.\n\nAlthough Salon expects operating losses to continue through 2015, the group anticipates they will decrease. The company has been running on cash from related parties, including John Warnock, the co-founder of Adobe and Salon's chairman, and William Hambrecht, a director and the father of former CEO and interim financial officer Elizabeth Hambrecht, to meet working capital requirements.\n\nThe company said in a September SEC filing that it is seeking to raise additional capital, either through public or private offerings of debt or equity securities, but that there is no guarantee financing will be available.\n\nOn Oct. 31, Salon filed with the SEC to register 10 million shares of common stock that would be offered to employees through a benefit or incentive plan.\n\nSalon's revenue for the 12 months ended June 30 was $6 million, a 65 percent increase from the 12 months ended March 31, primarily due to an increase in advertising sales. The company's main revenue source is advertising, which made up 92 percent of its revenues in fiscal 2014.\n\nThe company has also reduced losses \u0096 experiencing a $2.2 million loss for the 12 months ended March 31-- down 48 percent from the previous 12 months.\n\nIn Salon's Aug. 14 quarterly report, the company says that traffic to the website has been increasing. The company has experienced two years of audience growth \u0096 citing 290 percent overall traffic growth, 549 percent mobile browser growth, 733 percent social media growth\n\nFor more on Salon, see Struggling Salon Tries to Increase Revenue.\n\nFor the previous edition of Turnaround Tuesday, see Struggling Bio-Threat Detection Group PositiveID Raises Working Capital.\n\nFor more struggling companies, see Mergers & Acquisitions Distressed Company Watch List.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/restructurings/turnaround-tuesday-struggling-salon-media-looks-to-raise-capital-253353-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/salon.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Turnaround Tuesday: Struggling Salon Media Looks to Raise Capital"}}, "article_summary": "Turnaround Tuesday: Struggling Salon Media Looks to Raise CapitalThe media company's accountant raised doubts about Salon's ability to stay in business because of recurring lossesSalon Media Group Inc. is looking to raise additional capital, either through debt or equity securities.\nThe company has experienced two years of audience growth \u0096 citing 290 percent overall traffic growth, 549 percent mobile browser growth, 733 percent social media growthFor more on Salon, see Struggling Salon Tries to Increase Revenue.\nThe company has also reduced losses \u0096 experiencing a $2.2 million loss for the 12 months ended March 31-- down 48 percent from the previous 12 months.\nFor the previous edition of Turnaround Tuesday, see Struggling Bio-Threat Detection Group PositiveID Raises Working Capital.\nSalon's revenue for the 12 months ended June 30 was $6 million, a 65 percent increase from the 12 months ended March 31, primarily due to an increase in advertising sales."}
