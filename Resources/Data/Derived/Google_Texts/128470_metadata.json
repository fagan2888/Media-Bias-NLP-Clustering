The 1991 graduate of Notre Dame was a star player for the Fighting Irish.\n\nI\u2019m anything but an expert when it comes to watching lacrosse on television. But from my vantage point, McAnaney didn\u2019t burst a green blood vessel when his alma mater lost the overtime thriller. His coverage didn\u2019t favor either team.\n\nMcAnaney provides reporting and other play-by-play duties for ESPN, but lacrosse is his main focus. He will be joined again Monday by analyst Quint Kessenich, a respected East Coast sports talent who writes \u201cInside Lacrosse\u201d in a regular online column.\n\nESPN used 10 cameras Saturday to cover the action. Three officials were equipped with microphones, which allowed them to further educate viewers not familiar with the sport. Expect the same coverage Monday.\n\nHooping it up.\n\nNBA fans like to talk about the Michael era, the Kobe era and the LeBron era.\n\nThe league\u2019s Steve era doesn\u2019t generate as much hype.\n\nSteve Kerr, a major TV sports broadcasting talent and former NBA guard, was analyzing the Spurs-Thunder playoff battle for TNT a year ago.\n\nNow he is analyzing the Warriors-Rockets playoff battle on ESPN as Golden State\u2019s coach.\n\nKerr\u2019s coaching and the performance of league MVP Stephen Curry have helped the Warriors build a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The series resumes Monday in Houston.\n\nTV trademark.\n\nNearly every time Curry scores for the Warriors in the West finals, ESPN cameras follow the all-star guard down the court \u2014 his mouthpiece sticking out on his face.\n\nLook for a poster or a TV promotional spot of Curry and his mouthpiece.\n\nLongtime Denver journalist Dusty Saunders writes about sports media each Monday in The Denver Post. Contact him at tvtime @comcast.net.\n\nRadio report: Mile High Sports Radio have been silenced for now\n\nMile High Sports radio (94.1 FM, 1550 AM) has been off the air since Thursday.\n\nAs part of a complicated broadcasting ownership deal, the two frequencies are now the properties of Marco Broadcasting. Marco has switched both stations to \u201coldies\u201d music formats.\n\nMile High Sports president James Merilatt says his company\u2019s sports format will return to new dial slots \u201cin the near future.\u201d\n\nIrv Brown and Joe Williams, longtime talk show hosts who had been doing the 1-2 p.m. weekday show, were called Thursday morning and told not to come in.\n\nMile High operates differently from most sports radio outlets. Talk show hosts buy air time from Mile High and sell advertising spots to sponsors.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dusty Saunders: Notre Dame alum calling Denver lacrosse action", "title": "Dusty Saunders: Notre Dame alum calling Denver lacrosse action", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/24/dusty-saunders-notre-dame-alum-calling-denver-lacrosse-action/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523_012200_denver-lacrosse-1.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523_012200_denver-lacrosse-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-24T22:14:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T11:23:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Denver"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa9c\"", "article_summary": "McAnaney provided play-by-play during the Pioneers\u2019 11-10 overtime victory over Notre Dame at the Final Four in Philadelphia on Saturday.\nRadio report: Mile High Sports Radio have been silenced for nowMile High Sports radio (94.1 FM, 1550 AM) has been off the air since Thursday.\nBut for avid DU men\u2019s lacrosse fans \u2014 and curious viewers \u2014 Eamon McAnaney has moved quickly into the TV spotlight.\nMcAnaney provides reporting and other play-by-play duties for ESPN, but lacrosse is his main focus.\nNBA fans like to talk about the Michael era, the Kobe era and the LeBron era."}
