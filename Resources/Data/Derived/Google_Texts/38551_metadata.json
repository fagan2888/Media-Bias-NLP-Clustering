With her fair skin, beautiful body and bee-stung lips, Sunshine was a shoo-in for stardom. But before that happened in a big way, she got married and had children and family life became her priority.\n\nIn 2012, Sunshine started appearing in soaps and variety shows again. In 2013, her marriage fell apart and Sunshine's career went into full blast.\n\nShe and her three daughters\u2014Angelina Isabelle, Samantha Angeline and Angel Francesca\u2014moved to another house in another part of Metro Manila.\n\nBecause she is now a single parent, Sunshine's priorities have shifted.\n\n\"I am now more health-conscious. If I am not busy, I sleep longer, more than eight hours. Sleep is really important for me because it keeps me alert, fresh-looking, and beautiful,\u201d says Sunshine.\n\nShe believes good sleeping habits can be helped by lying on a quality bed. Sunshine uses a queen-size Uratex premium bed (Sleep Comfort Memory Mattress).\n\n\"It\u2019s so comfy, not too soft and not too hard. It\u2019s just perfect, so when you wake up, you don\u2019t feel any ache or pain in your back and neck.\u201d\n\nSunshine and her family have always relied on Uratex when it comes to beds.\n\n\"Our beds in our ancestral home are made by Uratex. When I got married, our bed was also Uratex. Now that I\u2019m a single parent, it\u2019s still Uratex,\" she says.\n\nThe actress' three daughters use the Uratex Perfect Serenity Anti-Mosquito Mattress.\n\nAs Angelina Isabelle puts it, \"We bond all the time in bed. We like watching scary films.\"\n\n\"We like watching TV before bedtime. Then we pray and go to sleep,\" says Samantha Angeline.\n\n\"I read and surf the Internet,\" shares Angel Francesca.\n\nThe girls, according to Sunshine, even have a schedule on who gets to sleep with their mom on a certain day.\n\nSunshine also memorizes her scripts and goes on Instagram and Twitter. She describes herself as an \"introvert who can stay in my room all day.\"\n\n\"When I was single, I would just stay in my room the whole day and lie on my bed. Sometimes, I would just go out to watch the shows of my dad in hotels and then go home.\u201d\n\nUratex recently kicked off its \u201cMobile Sleep Solutions,\u201d a campaign that aims to educate Filipinos in Metro Manila and nearby provinces on how to get the best of sleep health.\n\nUratex sleep experts go around in a customized, air-conditioned van transformed to mimic a cozy bedroom environment and tell the public about the 10 commandments of sleep hygiene for adults, the benefits of good sleep and the many exciting products that best suit the needs of customers when it comes to their sleeping needs.", "article_metadata": {"default-url": "http://manilastandardtoday.com", "description": "Sunshine Cruzs destiny was inevitable.", "og": {"site_name": "The Standard", "description": "Sunshine Cruzs destiny was inevitable.", "title": "Bedtime stories  with Sunshine", "url": "http://manilastandardtoday.com/lifestyle/151585/bedtime-stories-with-sunshine.html", "image": "http://manilastandardtoday.com/panel/_files/image/2014_july06_arts9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "disqus-shortname": "thestandardph", "csrf-token": "C8KFfaWJaWzj3yBxuGwnJNnbAS5atXkaXJidEiEG", "keywords": "philippines, news, elections, politics, government, tech, gadgets, lifestyle, sports", "google-site-verification": "c_-ZX443ZwQrn-QuMalGA5USLXBQirYD3IZpJxuzurw", "thumbnail": "http://manilastandardtoday.com/panel/_files/image/2014_july06_arts9.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3138\"", "article_summary": "Sunshine uses a queen-size Uratex premium bed (Sleep Comfort Memory Mattress).\nThe girls, according to Sunshine, even have a schedule on who gets to sleep with their mom on a certain day.\nSleep is really important for me because it keeps me alert, fresh-looking, and beautiful,\u201d says Sunshine.\nWith her fair skin, beautiful body and bee-stung lips, Sunshine was a shoo-in for stardom.\nIn 2012, Sunshine started appearing in soaps and variety shows again."}
