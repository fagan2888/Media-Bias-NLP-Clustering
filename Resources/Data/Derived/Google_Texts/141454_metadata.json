Law enforcement says she had minor injuries, but she was okay.\n\nVerbie Watkins was taken into custody after holding two people hostage. The situation began on County Road 672 near East Pleasant Grove Baptist Church about 5 p.m. Clarke County Sheriff Todd Kemp says a man called the sheriff's department and said he had been kidnapped inside a house, but had escaped. The person told police a woman was still being held at gunpoint in the house.\n\nKemp says when Clarke County deputies arrived, Watkins was outside firing weapons. Deputies withdrew, and then the Mississippi Highway Patrol's SWAT team was called in. The SWAT team went into the residence to take Watkins into custody about five hours later. Sheriff Kemp says this began as a domestic disturbance.\n\n\"It was reported to us earlier that she had been beaten up by this individual. She had been stripped of her clothes. She was nude. He threw her out in the yard. He then drug her back into the house, so it was a very volatile situation here, and I'm glad now that we have got him in custody,\" said Sheriff Kemp.\n\nKemp says Watkins had been living at the residence for several months, and that he was in some type of relationship with the woman.\n\nWe'll update you with more information as law enforcement continues to search for the female.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "UPDATE: Law enforcement in Clarke County has found the last of the two people that were taken hostage in an incident Thursday night.
