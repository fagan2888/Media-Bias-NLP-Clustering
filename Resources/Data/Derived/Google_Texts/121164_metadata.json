She sheltered animals, collected avocadoes from the property\u2019s heritage trees to feed the local homeless, and gave them a place to shower and launder their clothes.\n\nGonzalez, 49, has made it her home for 35 years, and also the site of her pet care service Petz Palz & Pawz. But Gonzalez, once homeless herself, was given 90 days notice at the beginning of the year to vacate and make way for a new development that will displace dozens of people. It\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll be able to stay in Mountain View. Silicon Valley\u2019s rising housing prices are outpacing increases in income and are widening the region\u2019s inequality gap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m moving a business and a community base,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big issue that we\u2019re getting kicked out. It\u2019s not just me. There\u2019s a whole community of us.\u201d\n\nHer home is one of six at 111-123 Fairchild Drive that the Mountain View City Council has approved for redevelopment into 18 row houses. They will be for-sale for ownership in accordance with the city\u2019s plans for its Evandale area, which is adjacent to Highway 101 between North Whisman Road and Moffett Boulevard. The MV Fairchild Investors LLC development will also replace five industrial buildings that have sat on the one-acre project site since the 1940s.\n\nThe new development is part of a local trend. At least 19 other projects for new housing will be completed by 2016 and many more are up for consideration. City officials don\u2019t know how many people could be displaced by the new construction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a boom in the city,\u201d city senior planner Scott Plambaeck said in an interview. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of demand for office space and a lot of demand for housing.\u201d\n\nMountain View has experienced only moderate growth since 1990, slower than some other cities in Santa Clara County or the Bay Area at large \u2014 in part because there aren\u2019t enough vacant parcels where people can live. Space is tight and competition is fierce in the real estate market, as people flock to some of the city\u2019s largest employers including Google, Symantec and LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cTech is doing really well. A lot of this new talent is coming into the area, but no one leaves unless they are relocating out of the area or dying,\u201d said Alex Wang, a local real estate agent. \u201cYou can\u2019t build new land, so we\u2019ve got to use the buildings we have and pre-existing properties.\u201d\n\nMedian rent list prices climbed nearly 27 percent in the last year, from $2,040 in December 2012 to $2,590 in December 2013.\n\nCommunity Development Director Randy Tsuda said the developments that displace residents are relatively rare. But the challenges facing those displaced persist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a nightmare,\u201d said Diane Elizabeth Jones, who has lived on and off with Gonzalez since becoming homeless in 2008. \u201cThe truth of the matter is, we\u2019re going to be homeless again. Coming back was nice, but now it\u2019s like a tornado \u2026 We don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d\n\nAffordable housing initiatives have been struggling to keep up with the pricier developments, especially following the dissolution of redevelopment agencies across the state in 2012 that resulted in harsh funding cuts.\n\nIn 2008, Santa Clara County had $126 million for affordable housing, compared to only $47.3 million today, according to the nonprofit Housing Trust Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be casualties of this upward movement,\u201d said Tuan Tran, a real estate agent. \u201cIs it fair or not fair? I don\u2019t know, but I think they\u2019re going to be priced out.\u201d\n\nQualifying tenants who are being displaced will get some assistance to find a new place. This includes the return of their security deposits, two months rent based on the unit\u2019s current monthly cost and a 60-day subscription to a rental agency.\n\nFor people living on social security like Gonzalez, even if she does get help, it\u2019s going to be tough \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to find an affordable place to live in Mountain View. Gonzalez\u2019s monthly social security check is $800, all of which goes to her rent. People that live with her help with the cost of food and utilities.\n\n\u201cI feel bad for them. I want to help them. I don\u2019t know how we can,\u201d Council Member Ronit Bryant said about the tenants to be displaced, during a city council meeting in January.\n\nNow, Gonzalez and her neighbors are preparing to find their next home. They have until early April. \u201cI left home at 15, so I understand homelessness. I was homeless,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s the roof first and everything else will follow.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "affordable housing,development,Housing,Mountain View,Mountain View City Council,MV Fairchild Investors LLC,real estate,Sara Hayden,Silicon Valley real estate,Business & Money,Frontpage Featured,Politics & Gov,Real Estate", "description": "The Mountain View City Council has approved six homes on Fairchild Drive for redevelopment into 18 row houses.
