Well, he said \u201cvery, very, very\u201d several times, \u201cdisgusting\u201d a few times, and \u201cme,\u201d \u201cmy\u201d and \u201cI\u201d lots of times.\n\nI had my fingers crossed that FAMU would go a month without a dispute between the president and members of the board. Oh well. So much for wishful thinking.\n\nA happy Zing! for my mother\u2019s Democrat carrier, who leaves her newspaper where it\u2019s safe and easy for her to retrieve. Thank you!\n\nThe final proof that Donald Trump cares nothing for America is the fact that he is running for president.\n\nI choose honesty, integrity and intelligence in a candidate. I haven\u2019t had a viable candidate for eight years, and still have none now.\n\nTaxation without representation? Our government is based on the two-party system. If you choose to opt out, that\u2019s your business, but you still have to ante-up like the rest of us.\n\nTo all politicians: In the immortal words of Pat Paulson, \u201cI have upped my standards. Now up yours.\u201d\n\nThe most disappointed Jeb supporter had to be Dick Cheney because he lost his chance to be president again.\n\nIf Harry Truman hadn\u2019t used the atomic bomb to end the war with Japan he would have been impeached.\n\nOn the up side, a Trump presidency would certainly make Obama look a hundred times better.\n\nAu contraire, the people who tell you Donald Trump would be a bad president are the people who told you George W. Bush would be a good one.\n\nTo those in power who won\u2019t support the people\u2019s choice for the GOP: We will remember when your re-election comes up!\n\nInterest rates of 300-700 percent on payday loans. Whatever happened to usury laws?\n\nThe Feds should make Zika aid contingent on Scott supporting expanded Medicaid under Obamacare in this state.\n\nIn the book \u201c1984,\u201d politicians controlled the masses by giving them their \u201c15 minutes of hate\u201d on their view screens each morning. Sound familiar?\n\nWell, it was two minutes, but point taken.
