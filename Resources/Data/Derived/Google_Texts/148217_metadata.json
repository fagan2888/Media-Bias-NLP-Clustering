He\u2019s offering Lobster Boy a chance at getting a solid lawyer to spring him from the joint, but the price will be one of his hands.\n\nJimmy eventually gets on board with Stanley\u2019s plan, drinks the magical pukey-juice, and the guards put him on a stretcher that goes directly into an ambulance under Stanley\u2019s control.\n\nThe next thing Lobster Boy sees is a nurse inside of a hospital as he wakes up chained to the bed. She informs him that the cops will be returning to take him back to jail soon. Jimmy looks over to his hands and sees that Stanley wasn\u2019t exactly true to his word. Both of his lobster claws are now gone and he\u2019s left with two bloody stumps.\n\nBack at the freak show, the Tattler twins are writing in their diary again as we see all the various freaks having fun around camp. At least the girls seem to be on the same page again now.\n\n\u201cThis place. These people are our world,\u201d they say in voiceover.\n\nIt seems Bette and Dot\u2019s new plan is to find someone to hook up with. Why not, right?\n\nThey toss their diary in a garbage can fire and we move inside of the big tent where a travelling salesman named Chester (played by Neil Patrick Harris) is showing some of the freaks one of his adorable chameleons.\n\nWe quickly jump into Chester\u2019s point of view and realize that he doesn\u2019t quite see things very clearly. He\u2019s quick and witty and the freaks seem to like him. This is Neil Patrick Harris in his element.\n\nAfter a few minutes, he shows the crowd his act: magic. Bette and Dot are totally enamored and set their sights on poor Chester to be their man.\n\nWe cut to Jimmy\u2019s hospital room where Dell Toledo has barged in to see his son lying in bed with two hand-less arms. For some weird reason, Jimmy still believes in what Stanley is selling.\n\nDell helps Jimmy eat his food while trying to comfort the kid with stories of other people with no hands. It doesn\u2019t really work, but Lobster Boy is in surprisingly good spirits for a guy that just lost his hands.\n\nHe asks his father why he doesn\u2019t have the family\u2019s lobster claws and Dell tells him that he is the freak of the family \u201cfor being normal.\u201d Weird how things work out, huh?\n\nIn Elsa\u2019s tent, Chester is doing his best to entertain Ms. Mars, but she\u2019s not very impressed.\n\n\u201cWe are a freak show,\u201d she says, \u201cNot a magic show.\u201d\n\nFX\n\nHe pulls out a creepy ventriloquist dummy, which Elsa seems to enjoy, but she\u2019s still not interesting in bringing Chester into the fold. She tells him that he can do a little bit of his act if he helps out with the freak show\u2019s bookkeeping. He\u2019s extremely thankful, but we feel a bit bad for him because this can\u2019t possibly end well for Chester.\n\nWe slide over to Chester\u2019s prep area where he\u2019s getting his makeup on and talking to his ventriloquist dummy. Looks like Chester has a few more screws loose than we already thought.\n\nAfter the break, we catch up with Amazon Eve and Legless Suzi in Elsa\u2019s tent. In walks Dell who is looking for Stanley. Elsa tells him that he has to get him out of there and Dell takes off. Amazon Eve follows and offers to help bust him out.\n\nMeanwhile, Chester pays a visit to the Tattler sisters to give them a special gift. They open the cute little music box and then he tells them that he\u2019s found a genuine sawbox in Elsa\u2019s storage area. He wants them to be his assistant so he can pull off one of his tricks.\n\nChester sweet-talks the girls as we head into a flashback that shows Chester watching two ladies making love while he sits in the corner in his uniform with his ventriloquist dummy on his lap.\n\nWe cut to Chester\u2019s act in progress on the stage with the Tattler twins on his side assisting. He performs the sawbox act and everything goes off basically without a hitch. Chester and the Tattlers make a pretty good team.\n\nBack at the hospital, the cops have arrived and toss Jimmy in the back of their car to haul him back to jail. Amazon Eve and Dell, however, have other plans. They stop the car and take out of the cops in a rather bloody sequence that ends with one cop\u2019s face completely smashed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tattlers get their very sexiest garb on and head over to Chester\u2019s tent. They start in with the smooching and make a grab at Chester\u2019s nether region, but he pushes them away. They give him a massage to relieve some tension, but he can\u2019t stop the crazy voice coming out of his dummy\u2019s little wooden body.\n\nWe see more of Chester\u2019s flashback where the two ladies pretty much humiliate him. Yeah, he\u2019s clearly got problems.\n\nHe\u2019s reluctant, but Bette and Dot continue to push forward with their plan to have Chester deflower them. He finally starts to go along, but first decides to grab his dummy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cShe relaxes me.\u201d\n\nBette and Dot don\u2019t seem to mind and the three of them get down to business.\n\nCut to Dandy Mott\u2019s bedroom where his hired gun comes back with the sad news that his beloved Tattler sisters are likely making the move towards a new man.\n\n\u201cThey were supposed to be mine,\u201d Dandy says, choking back tears.\n\nIt\u2019s nighttime at the freak show now and Chester is stuffing his dummy back in her crate. She\u2019s pretty angry about it, so he has to push himself to make it happen. It triggers a flashback to his wife\u2019s lover giving him the business again, and we actually get to see Marjorie come to life (played by the awesome Jamie Brewer).\n\nBack in the present, Chester is once again in Elsa\u2019s tent where they\u2019re talking business. She\u2019s trying to put her affairs in order before she heads off to Hollywood and she needs Chester to help her do that.\n\nHe, however, is really only concerned with what happens to Marjorie so he rushes back to his tent to get her, but she\u2019s nowhere to be seen. Looks like Chester is about to lose it.\n\nNot only that, but it seems the cops are on the prowl at the freak show now. After the death of two cops at the hands of Amazon Eve and Dell Toledo, the place is swarming with police. They\u2019re looking for Jimmy Darling, but Chester comes out and starts yelling at the cops to look for Marjorie.\n\nThe cops begin searching the camp and Chester goes off on his own to try to find Marjorie. He wanders through the freak show and stumbles upon Dandy Mott, who has clearly stolen Marjorie. It brings us to a flashback of Dandy learning that Chester killed both his wife and her lover, and then decided to blame the crime on Marjorie (which we also get to see in flashback).\n\nChester just wants his dummy back, so Dandy tells him to head over to the big tent. There, he finds Marjorie (in life size form) on the stage. Not only does she want top billing in the show, but she also tells Chester that he has to saw the Tattler twins in half.\n\nWe cut quickly to Elsa\u2019s tent where Esmerelda has come to pay a visit. She has something to show Ms. Mars.\n\nThey head off and we follow Dell as he stumbles into his trailer where Desiree is waiting with a loaded gun. She grills him about what he\u2019s been up to. He gives her a line about being a good guy, but she\u2019s not buying it.\n\n\u201cYou killed one of your own,\u201d she tells him.\n\nMeanwhile, we see Esmerelda leading Elsa into a tent where Ma Petite is floating in formaldehyde. Elsa screams and the sound echoes in Dell\u2019s head as he finally admits to Desiree that he killed the diminutive freak.\n\nAs soon as the words \u201cI killed Ma Petite\u201d exit his lips, we hear a bang and he falls as we see Elsa holding that smoking gun that has ended his life.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I needed to hear,\u201d she says as this week\u2019s episode, and Dell\u2019s life, both come to a close.\n\nA Few Stray Observations:\n\nNeil Patrick Harris is one of this season\u2019s most highly anticipated guest stars, so it\u2019s great to see him get a pretty substantial part to play, even if it\u2019s late in the season.\n\nJamie Brewer! It\u2019s so awesome to see Jamie Brewer back and causing trouble on this season of \u201cAmerican Horror Story.\u201d\n\nWith only two more episodes left this season, I assume we\u2019ll probably see quite a few more major deaths, but it was still pretty shocking to see Dell go down this week.\n\nDespite the great batch of actors that have graced \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d this season, it really does feel like there have been too many characters for the stories to work as well as they might have otherwise. Story wise, at least, a slightly more intimate \u201cFreak Show\u201d might have worked better. Then again, we still have two more episodes for this season to redeem itself.\n\n\u2018American Horror Story: Freak Show\u2019 airs on FX on Wednesdays at 10 PM ET. Follow our recaps all season long.
