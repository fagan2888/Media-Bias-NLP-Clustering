So, I decided to open an active-wear store called Haiku,'\" she told me.\n\nWarmerdam is certainly in a position to see the sedentary lives people lead, along with the ill effects: obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression to name a few.\n\n\"I see it at my work every day! Studies show that mild routine exercise can be just as effective as an anti-depressant for mild to moderate depression ... and that is just one example of the ways exercise improves our lives,\" she says.\n\nHaiku carries clothes that you would wear for yoga, running, walking, hiking, or just going to the dog park, and then off to lunch afterward with your friends.\n\n\"I call it transitional clothing,' she says. She carries 0-18; petite and tall too. She has a small Men's section that will be expanding. And, you don't have to be an athlete to find clothes at Haiku.\n\nThe business name \"Haiku\" is Ukiah spelled backward. The logo for the store is the Koi fish.\n\n\"Koi fish are symbolic of good fortune, personal strength, and perseverance. What better symbol for an active-wear store?\" Warmerdam says.\n\nShe adds, \"My big dream is to organize a local run/walk benefit for the Reveil Matinal Orphanage in Haiti. I am a board member and the secretary for the local non-profit Hearthstone Village.' One of our current projects is constructing a new permanent building for the orphanage. We have already purchased the land and there are 23 girls that we currently help support, and are determined to educate all the way through college. I'm thinking of a Haiku for Haiti' theme for my store. My business is in its infancy, we are building our brands, and different ways to reach out to the community ... I feel Haiku' can be so much more than just our clothing, and that is important to me.\"\n\nHaiku is located at 180 W. Church St. Call them at 467-9719.\n\nI was a judge at the recent Miss Mendocino pageant, a task I thoroughly enjoy . I wanted to give some kudos today to some local businesses which went over and above to help make the pageant a success. While \"Ever-Pleasant\" Jim Mulheren and I were the two local judges, there are four \"professional\" Miss America program judges that come in from out of town to help.\n\nThanks and kudos to :\n\n? North State Caf? for furnishing the judges' dinner.\n\n? Applebee's Restaurant for furnishing the judges' lunch.\n\n? Hampton Inn for furnishing Sunday brunch and all hotel rooms for out of town judges.\n\n? Parducci Winery, Parducci Road for the judges gifts of wine.\n\nWith spring coming our way and the inherit need for water control in the upcoming season, there's a new business in town of interest.\n\nThe new company is The Bulk Soil Outlet, and according to a press release they sent me, they produce soil and nutrient from the raw components. They will manufacture soil to your specific needs.\n\n\"We have the farmer fill out a form that asks questions regarding their specific needs; how often would you like to water? (everyday, 3-5 days, 1 per week), how long would you like a release of nutrient (all season, only through the vegetative process), and what other issues do you face in your garden that we could help combat; (pest control, viruses, mold, water issues, cold, etc.),\" says general manager Albee Wilder.\n\nYou can contact Wilder at 3-D Organic Solutions, LLC., 3450 North State St. Ukiah, 463-2339.\n\nEmployees at Mendocino Community Health Clinic (MCHC) wore red to celebrate Go Red For Women, raising awareness about women's heart disease.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, heart disease is the top cause of death in American women; it is more deadly than all forms of cancer combined. Because the symptoms for men and women are different, many women who suffer from heart disease do not realize they are at risk until it is too late. Sweating, lightheadedness, chest pressure, nausea, and jaw pain are all symptoms of a heart attack in women.\n\nMCHC employees decorated all three health centers: Hillside Health Center in Ukiah, Little Lake Health Center in Willits, and Lakeside Health Center in Lakeport. They handed out educational material in English and Spanish about risk factors and ways to stay healthy.\n\nMCHC CEO Linnea Hunter said, \"I'm really proud of our employees for getting behind this. We had more than 160 employees at multiple sites really get involved to raise awareness, and that's what it takes: people getting involved.\"\n\nTo learn more, visit mchcinc.org or call (707) 468-1010.\n\nThe North Bay Association of Realtors has joined the Mendocino County Agriculture and Business Coalition. Founded in 2010, the Agriculture and Business Coalition (ABC) is composed of the Mendocino County Farm Bureau, the Employer's Council of Mendocino County, and the North Coast Builders Exchange. By joining, NorBAR supports ABC's efforts to strengthen the business climate of Mendocino County.\n\n\"By joining we will be able to be collaborative on broader community and economic development issues that impact residents and the business community.\" stated Howard Egan, NorBAR Director for Mendocino County. \"We look forward to greater participation in discussions affecting the county. NorBAR has represented the Mendocino REALTOR community for over 15 years and supports a healthy business and agricultural environment for the area.\"\n\nCongressman Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael), joined by Congressman Gerry Connolly (D-VA), has introduced a bill to help modernize the United States Postal Service's inefficient and outdated vehicle fleet, according to a press release from Huffman's office.\n\nThe Federal Leadership in Energy Efficient Transportation (FLEET) Act of 2014 (H.R. 3963) would require the USPS to reduce their petroleum consumption by 2 percent each year over the next 10 years.\n\n\"This Act will increase cost savings by reducing expenditures on petroleum fuel and maintenance and sets benchmarks to make the USPS fleet a global leader in efficiency and innovation,\" Huffman notes. \"According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, implementation of the FLEET Act would save the Postal Service an estimated 150 million gallons of fuel over the next 10 years?about $400 million.\"\n\nThe Postal Service owns and operates the world's largest civilian vehicle fleet: 192,000 mail delivery vehicles that are driven 4.3 million miles per day. More than 141,000 are aging Grumman LLVs, which average only 10 miles per gallon. This vehicle first entered service in 1987, and the majority have reached the end of their 24-year operational lifespan. Fueling these vehicles comes at a high cost: in FY 2010, the petroleum fuel bill for all postal transportation totaled $1.7 billion. And, since 2005, the Postal Service has marked a 6.4 percent increase in petroleum use .\n\nThe FLEET Act has been endorsed by the following organizations: The California State Association of Letter Carriers, Union of Concerned Scientists, National Resource Defense Council (NRDC), the Sierra Club, and the Federal Performance Contracting Coalition (FPCC)\n\nDebra DeGraw, CEO of the Mendocino Coast Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement in the response to President Obama's State of the Union address urging presidential action to protect the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands, a scenic area along the Mendocino coastline in Mendocino County.\n\n\"During the State of the Union, President Obama made a strong commitment to protecting America's public lands, saying, I'll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations.' This significant statement was the first time President Obama has directly referenced land conservation in a State of the Union address,\" DeGraw said in a press release.\n\nDeGraw says preserving the Point Arena-Stornetta lands \"would help boost our local tourism economy, which already supports 5,000 jobs. Our community, including many local businesses, overwhelmingly supports protecting the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands.\"\n\nCongress has yet to provide permanent protection for these BLM-managed public lands (some of which were protected with Land and Water Conservation Fund grants) despite the support of the California congressional delegation, which has repeatedly introduced legislation to do so. Most recently, Rep. Jared Huffman introduced legislation to expand the California Coastal National Monument; it passed out of the U.S. House in July 2013. A companion bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein and awaits action.\n\nCovered California, and the California Department of Health Care Services says that from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 19,732 consumers in mostly rural Northern California counties enrolled in subsidized and non-subsidized Covered California health insurance plans.\n\nThe Northern California counties of Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, Colusa, Del Norte, Glenn, Humboldt, Lake, Lassen, Mendocino, Modoc, Nevada, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Tuolumne and Yuba represent about 4 percent of the statewide enrollment. The local total includes 17,723 consumers eligible for financial subsidies.\n\nFor the three-month period, which is half of the open-enrollment period for 2014 coverage, 500,108 consumers enrolled in plans statewide.\n\nCovered California is the state's marketplace for the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nFollowing a successful initial campaign in 2013, Tractor Supply Company has announced the second annual Growing Scholars program in partnership with the National FFA Foundation. Last year, Tractor Supply customers donated $362,324, resulting in 284 scholarships awarded to FFA members in their pursuit of a college degree.\n\nThe Growing Scholars program will be supported nationally by each of the more than 1,245 Tractor Supply and Del's Feed & Farm Supply stores Feb. 14-23, which includes National FFA Week. Tractor Supply customers can donate $1 or more at store registers during the checkout process to support local FFA chapters and their members. Ninety percent of funds raised through Tractor Supply's Growing Scholars program will be utilized to fund scholarships for FFA members. The remaining 10 percent of donations will benefit state FFA organizations.\n\nTo be eligible for the scholarship program, students must be current FFA members and either high school seniors or a freshman, sophomore or junior college student seeking a two- or four-year degree or other specialized training program. Major areas of study will also be considered when determining scholarship recipients.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amy Warmerdam, a local intensive care unit nurse has a new business.
