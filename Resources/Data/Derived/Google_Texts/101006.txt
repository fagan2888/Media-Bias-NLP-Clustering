Rubio spoke at Globe Manufacturing in Pittsfield, where a personalized fire suit was on display.

"Hopefully I can get my own jacket because it's going to get hot in the campaign pretty soon, if you know what I mean," Rubio said. "I already feel the flames."

Shifting between lighthearted and serious, the senator took on familiar themes, such as reducing government regulation and growing the economy.

"Our taxes on companies are the most expensive in the world," he said. "That is why companies leave America."

He said the military needs rebuilding.

"We are still asking our service men and women to go out there and risk their lives, but we're asking them to do it with less and older airplanes, with older and less effective equipment and with less people alongside them," Rubio said. "We are not doing that when I am president."

At a town hall in Laconia, Rubio introduced his wife and four children to a standing-room-only crowd packed into the Belknap Mill. He warmed them up with talk of uniting conservatives and the Republican Party by including more families and young people who live paycheck to paycheck.

"Just three years ago, I still had a student loan," Rubio said. "I was only able to pay it off because I wrote a book. It's called 'American Son.'"

He got fired up when talking about immigration, the national debt, getting rid of the Affordable Care Act, the nuclear deal with Iran and about what he would do on his first day in office.

"When I get there, I am going to repeal every one of Barack Obama's executive orders," Rubio said.
