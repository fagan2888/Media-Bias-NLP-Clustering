I can remember mine like it was yesterday, playing outside in the snow, getting chilled to the bone,\" she said on stage. \"Running indoors, stripping off our snowshoes and our boots, hanging our socks and mittens over the register to dry, burning our tongues on steaming hot cocoa ... and all the while in the background was the sound of the radio.\"\n\nThe band played clips of a radio show where the broadcaster asked everyone to put their hands over their hearts for the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\nOf course, the orchestra took this challenge on and everyone in the auditorium rose for the national anthem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLt.

Krista Joyce and Airman 1st Class Jamie Teachenor.\n\nThe Air Force Academy Band also invited children on stage near the end of the concert for a sensory storytime experience where Margaret Rose read \"The Polar Express.\" Children listened in rapt excitement as the children as the screen behind Rose showed the pictures of the book and the band accompanied the story with its own score to add suspense and dramatic moments.\n\nVocalist Krista Joyce leads the band in song at the United States Air Force Academy Band presents Holly & Ivy show at Thompson Valley High on Sunday.
