Clinton and Sanders have been exchanging shots at one another for weeks on end, with Bernie calling out Hillary\u2019s sources for her campaign funding and Clinton attacking Sanders\u2019 track record in politics. Among those likely to vote Democrat, former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton has a 45-48 percent lead over Senator Bernie Sanders in Iowa, with Bernie Sanders taking the lead in New Hampshire by 46-50 percent, the Wall Street Journal discovered.\n\nThus far, Clinton has been the main target of attacks from across the aisle, and she has dealt some shade herself. Several weeks ago, Clinton called Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump \u201cISIS\u2019 biggest recruiter,\u201d referring to Trump\u2019s proposed policy of banning all Syrian immigrants to the U.S. Meanwhile, Clinton and Sanders have been fighting among themselves.\n\nNew NBC/WSJ/Marist poll shows the Democratic race tightening in Iowa with likely caucusgoers: Clinton 48, Sanders 45, O\u2019Malley 5. #CNNSotu \u2014 State of the Union (@CNNSotu) January 10, 2016\n\nSanders and Clinton have also been duking it out over the issues, including their proposed economic policies. Both Sanders and Clinton view Wall Street as the main source of the financial crisis that has plagued the country, but Sanders alleges that Clinton has been a friend to big bankers and corporate interests. Sanders and Hilary also have differing views on how to deal with the \u201cplague\u201d they consider Wall Street to be. Sanders claims his campaign money is raised from the public, thus pushing special interest groups out of the Bernie Sanders campaign.\n\nDifferences aside, one thing is clear: both Sanders and Clinton are anti-Trump. As Inquisitr previously reported, Bernie has vowed to \u201cdestroy\u201d Trump. Clinton has attacked Trump for making speeches she feels are misogynistic in nature. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, has been there to defend Trump against Sanders and Clinton\u2019s attacks, and says he\u2019d make a \u201cgreat\u201d president.\n\n\u201cI want to build on and make improvements in the Affordable Care Act, and I will stand against any Republican effort to repeal\u2026 because you know what the alternative is? We\u2019ll go back to the insurance companies making all the decisions. If you\u2019ve got a preexisting condition, you\u2019ll be lucky if you can afford health insurance. If you\u2019re a woman, you\u2019re going to pay more, because that\u2019s what used to happen before we had the Affordable Care Act. If you\u2019re a young person up to the age of 26, you\u2019re out of luck; you can\u2019t be on your parents\u2019 plan anymore.\u201d \u2014Hillary in South Carolina A photo posted by Hillary Clinton (@hillaryclinton) on Nov 23, 2015 at 12:43pm PST\n\nHillary has also supported President Obama on major issues such as gun control and healthcare reform. Sanders hasn\u2019t taken many official positions on divisive issues, but did promise that he would \u201creinstate Glass-Steagall,\u201d a 1930s banking act that outlawed banks from making investments. Sanders was silent on healthcare and abstained from a vote during which certain portions of the Affordable Care Act were up for possible repealing. Bernie has consistently voted for new gun control laws, however, including an act that would restrict terrorists\u2019 access to dangerous explosives and firearms.\n\nAs ABC News discovered, former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley (Clinton and Sanders\u2019 competition in the Democratic Caucus) received just 1 percent of the vote amongst likely Democratic voters compared to Clinton and Sanders\u2019 much higher numbers (48 percent going to Clinton and 45 percent to Sanders).\n\nWith Sanders and Hilary Clinton controlling a combined 93 percent of the vote, it\u2019s likely Martin O\u2019Malley will be squeezed out without being given a chance to get a Democratic Presidential nod. There is still almost a year left until the Presidential election; Clinton and Sanders\u2019 numbers could change over time.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that both Hillary and Sanders are focused on protecting the younger generation of 20-somethings who feel let down by issues like student loans and a still-recouping economy with poor job prospects. Sanders\u2019 plan to alleviate this generation\u2019s pain is to make college tuition free to all students, while Clinton is proposing reforms of the Affordable Care Act that could extend the age children can remain on their parents\u2019 healthcare plans.\n\nLet us know your predictions for the 2016 Presidential nominations. Do you think Sanders, Clinton, or O\u2019Malley will get the Democratic Presidential nomination?\n\n[Image via Ida Mae Astute, ABC News/Flickr/CC BY-ND 2.0]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic nominees Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are tied in the race for the Democratic Party's Presidential nomination, an NBC News/Marist poll found.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Democratic nominees Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are tied in the race for the Democratic Party\u2019s Presidential nomination, an NBC News/Marist poll found.", "title": "Bernie Sanders, Hilary Clinton Tied In Early Presidential Races, According To Poll", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2695914/bernie-sanders-hilary-clinton-tied-in-early-presidential-races-according-to-poll/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bernie-Sanders-Hilary-Clinton-3-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-10T11:34:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-10T16:39:26+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bernie-Sanders-Hilary-Clinton-3-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2016-01-10T11:34:25+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "bernie sanders,hilary clinton,democratic caucus,donald trump,martin omalley,ted cruz,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bernie-Sanders-Hilary-Clinton-3-900x440.jpg", "height": 440, "width": 900}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Democratic nominees Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are tied in the race for the Democratic Party\u2019s Presidential nomination, an NBC News/Marist poll found."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Democratic nominees Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are tied in the race for the Democratic Party\u2019s Presidential nomination, an NBC News/Marist poll found.\nSanders claims his campaign money is raised from the public, thus pushing special interest groups out of the Bernie Sanders campaign.\nDo you think Sanders, Clinton, or O\u2019Malley will get the Democratic Presidential nomination?\nAmong those likely to vote Democrat, former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton has a 45-48 percent lead over Senator Bernie Sanders in Iowa, with Bernie Sanders taking the lead in New Hampshire by 46-50 percent, the Wall Street Journal discovered.\nNew NBC/WSJ/Marist poll shows the Democratic race tightening in Iowa with likely caucusgoers: Clinton 48, Sanders 45, O\u2019Malley 5."}
