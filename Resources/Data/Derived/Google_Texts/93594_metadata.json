And once again, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was the guy scraping at them with a scalpel.\n\nHe didn\u2019t shut down the government, or talk himself hoarse on the Senate floor. But he did spoil his leadership\u2019s plan to let Senate Democrats increase the debt limit on their own without implicating any individual Republicans \u2014 including the highest-ranking Republican, who just happens to be in the midst of an unexpectedly tough election.\n\nThis can get a little technical. But suffice it to say that Republicans \u2014 for once! \u2014 wanted to not filibuster a bill. To avoid the whole 60-vote requirement they\u2019ve made so routine, and just get on to the up-or-down final passage vote. Let 50 Dems and Vice President Biden do all the dirty work.\n\nBut ending debate on a bill and going directly to final passage requires consent from everyone in the Senate, and Cruz refused to provide his. Now several Republicans, including Mitch McConnell himself, must wear scarlet letters whenever they face conservative activists, all because Cruz wanted to court another damaging confrontation with Obama and wants the people denying it to him to suffer for their actions.\n\nThe bad blood has grown redolent.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., one of the Republicans who helped end Cruz\u2019s filibuster, sent his 1.86 million Twitter followers to a \u201cmust read\u201d Wall Street Journal editorial titled \u201cThe Minority Maker: Ted Cruz hurts his party by forcing a meaningless debt-ceiling vote.\u201d\n\nMust-read @WSJ: \"The Minority Maker\" http://t.co/BxyNKMTrOG \u2014 John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) February 13, 2014\n\nCruz fired back with an extraordinarily blunt attack on his colleagues on Mark Levin\u2019s conservative radio show.\n\n\u201cIn the 13 months that I\u2019ve been in the Senate, it has become apparent to me the single thing that Republican politicians hate and fear the most, and that is when they\u2019re forced to tell the truth. It makes their heads explode,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cA lot of Republicans wanted exactly what Barack Obama wanted, exactly what Nancy Pelosi wanted, exactly want Harry Reid wanted, which is to raise the debt ceiling, but they wanted to be able to tell what they view as their foolish, gullible constituents back home that they didn\u2019t do it. And they\u2019re mad because, by refusing to consent to that, they had to come out in the open, they had to admit what they\u2019re doing. And nothing upsets them more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He won a small battle with his debt limit gambit, but also made the GOP's extortion tactics much harder.
