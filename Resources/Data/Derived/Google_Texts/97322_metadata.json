To sell a skeptical public on the promised wonders of Obamacare, the then-Democrat-controlled Congress made a big show of forcing members onto Obamacare-created plans.\n\nThat was four years ago. Once members realized how harmful Obamacare actually was, Senate Democrats started to panic and went running to President Obama for relief.\n\nRelief came in the form of a special tax treatment available only to them, granted in a manner that exceeded the president\u2019s legal and constitutional authority. Under a rule issued by the president\u2019s Office of Personnel Management, unlike millions of their countrymen who have lost coverage and must now purchase insurance through an exchange, members and their staffs will now receive an employer contribution to help pay for their new plans.\n\nOn Jan. 6, I filed a lawsuit to uphold the rule of law and overturn this special treatment for members of Congress and their staffs.\n\nThe Obama administration is working hard to make sure this case does not see its day in court. On March 17, the administration filed its initial response to my lawsuit: a motion to dismiss for lack of standing. Very little was said refuting the substance of my lawsuit.\n\nThat is because it is very difficult for the administration to defend this highly political executive action when millions of ordinary Americans are suffering under the full, harsh realities of Obamacare.\n\nTo establish standing, I have to demonstrate a specific harm. The challenge is that the real harm is Obamacare itself, and any delay in implementing Obamacare generally reduces that harm. The president must recognize this, since instead of implementing Obamacare in accordance with the statute, the executive branch has treated the act as an open-ended grant of authority to unilaterally alter an unworkable, partisan law.\n\nAccording to the administration, Obamacare has five major pillars: a set of insurance regulations, the employer mandate, the individual mandate, the use of subsidies to encourage the purchase of insurance through state-run exchanges, and an expansion of state obligations under Medicaid.\n\nThrough the more than 21 changes to Obamacare by presidential fiat, these pillars have been significantly undermined: Insurance companies can continue selling insurance policies that by the Department of Health and Human Resource\u2019s own admission violate the plain terms of the law, the employer mandate has been extended, the individual mandate does not apply to those who consider Obamacare policies unaffordable, subsidies are available for federal exchanges and private policies rather than just state exchanges, and the Medicaid maintenance-of-effort provision has expired for all states.\n\nOf course, our health care system isn\u2019t the only part of our economy to fall victim to executive overreach. Prior to his State of the Union address in January, the president reminded us all that if Congress fails to bend to his regal will, \u201cI\u2019ve got a pen, and I\u2019ve got a phone.\u201d That same month a federal court ruled that the president\u2019s attempt to fill vacancies in the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during a so-called congressional recess violated the Constitution.\n\nThe president\u2019s executive and administrative agencies across the board have drastically increased the size and scope of the executive branch. The National Labor Relations Board\u2019s ambush-election rules dramatically change the process for union-representation elections, shortening election time frames. The Internal Revenue Service has been caught targeting ordinary Americans. The Environmental Protection Agency is pushing regulations against coal, after the president was unable to pass a national energy tax. The Federal Communications Commission is currently crafting rules to treat Internet-service providers as regulated monopolists despite having similar efforts struck down in court twice.\n\nMy lawsuit against the Office of Personnel Management is about far more than overturning the unfair special treatment for Congress. Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that the president \u201cshall take care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d That duty is mandatory, not optional. As Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the Supreme Court in Clinton v. City of New York, \u201c[t]here is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the president to enact, to amend or to repeal statutes.\u201d Rather, he must faithfully execute the laws that Congress enacts.\n\nAmericans do not wish to be ruled by a king or a House of Lords. We expect and deserve to be treated equally under the law. That is the primary principle this case is designed to affirm.\n\nI hope all of my colleagues in both the House and Senate will join me in this effort to push back against this lawless administration. There is currently an amicus brief circulating for members of Congress to sign that makes a strong case on how Mr. Obama himself has dismantled his own signature piece of legislation through presidential decree.\n\nA united front will surely help my case for standing so that we can proceed to a full trial, demonstrating the president\u2019s unconstitutional overreach.\n\nRon Johnson is a Republican member of the U.S. Senate from Wisconsin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Basic fairness dictates that members of Congress should be fully subject to the laws they impose on the rest of America.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Basic fairness dictates that members of Congress should be fully subject to the laws they impose on the rest of America.", "title": "JOHNSON: Congress should stand for equal treatment under Obamacare law", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/14/johnson-standing-for-equal-treatment-under-the-law/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/14/4_142014_b3-johns-caduceus-b8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/14/4_142014_b3-johns-caduceus-b8201.jpg", "description": "Basic fairness dictates that members of Congress should be fully subject to the laws they impose on the rest of America.", "card": "summary", "title": "JOHNSON: Congress should stand for equal treatment under Obamacare law"}, "Author": "Ron Johnson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Politics, Congress, Senate, Barack Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc9f\"", "article_summary": "The president\u2019s executive and administrative agencies across the board have drastically increased the size and scope of the executive branch.\nOn Jan. 6, I filed a lawsuit to uphold the rule of law and overturn this special treatment for members of Congress and their staffs.\nThe challenge is that the real harm is Obamacare itself, and any delay in implementing Obamacare generally reduces that harm.\nANALYSIS/OPINION:Basic fairness dictates that members of Congress should be fully subject to the laws they impose on the rest of America.\nTo sell a skeptical public on the promised wonders of Obamacare, the then-Democrat-controlled Congress made a big show of forcing members onto Obamacare-created plans."}
