As a result, plenty of frantic Google searches are in order. The domain of Ebola.com \u2014 and who owns it \u2014 has become a hot topic in itself.\n\nThe website, which was originally owned by two Las Vegas entrepreneurs \u2014 Chris Hood and Jon Schultz \u2014 has been sold to a company called Weed Growth Fund, after the pair put it up for sale and asked for about $50,000. During the Ebola outbreak, the site saw a quick increase in hits. The owners \u2014 who own other disease-related URLs, including Birdflu.com \u2014 saw an opportunity to make some cash.\n\nWeed Growth Fund bought the domain from Blue String Ventures for $50,000 in cash, in addition to 19,192 shares of another weed company known as Cannabis Sativa, Inc. The shares are estimated to be valued at about $164,000, making the sale amount to over $200,000.\n\nCurrently, Ebola.com doesn\u2019t appear to have anything on the site aside from some basic news and information dating from October 17, 2014. It\u2019s unclear what the new ownership aims to do with the website, but bizarrely enough, it might have something to do with weed\u2019s relationship to Ebola. Why else would a weed company want to own Ebola.com?\n\nOn Cannabis Sativa\u2019s website, the company states that \u201c[w]e believe cannabis is destined to become the next gold rush and we\u2019re prepared to shape its future in a legal environment. We\u2019ve assembled the team, the talent and the experience necessary to make high-quality cannabis product a mainstream reality.\u201d The CEO of Cannabis Sativa, meanwhile, who is none other than former New Mexico governor and Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson, believes that weed may have \u201cefficacy with regard to treating Ebola,\u201d according to an interview with FOX News, \u201cpotentially as an actual cure.\u201d\n\nThe statement is pretty strong, and not backed up by scientific evidence at all. It may simply be the over-zealous words of a businessman pushing marijuana, but Johnson claims he\u2019s not selling a faux product; merely pointing out that there may be \u201cpotential\u201d in weed to treat \u2014 or even cure \u2014 Ebola. \u201cI am not a snake oil salesman,\u201d Johnson said during the interview. \u201cI\u2019m not. You know, I\u2019m the former governor of New Mexico. I\u2019m not going to sell snake oil.\u201d\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s a rather strange situation, and we\u2019ve yet to see what happens to the domain. In the meantime, it's probably safe to say that marijuana won't come near to treating or curing Ebola (at least until more research is completed).", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ebola and marijuana, ebola.com, ebola", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Not only has Ebola.com been sold to a Russian weed company, but the owners believe that marijuana can actually be used to treat the deadly virus.", "title": "Ebola.com Sold For $200K In Bizarre Acquisition By Marijuana Company [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ebolacom-sells-over-200k-bought-marijuana-company-believes-pot-can-treat-ebola-307938", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/ebola.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Not only has Ebola.com been sold to a Russian weed company, but the owners believe that marijuana can actually be used to treat the deadly virus.", "title": "Ebola.com Sold For $200K In Bizarre Acquisition By Marijuana Company [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ebolacom-sells-over-200k-bought-marijuana-company-believes-pot-can-treat-ebola-307938", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/ebola.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/ebola.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-24T17:56:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-24T18:02:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Not only has Ebola.com been sold to a Russian weed company, but the owners believe that marijuana can actually be used to treat the deadly virus."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2bc\"", "article_summary": "Why else would a weed company want to own Ebola.com?\nWeed Growth Fund bought the domain from Blue String Ventures for $50,000 in cash, in addition to 19,192 shares of another weed company known as Cannabis Sativa, Inc.\nIn the meantime, it's probably safe to say that marijuana won't come near to treating or curing Ebola (at least until more research is completed).\nThe domain of Ebola.com \u2014 and who owns it \u2014 has become a hot topic in itself.\nOn Cannabis Sativa\u2019s website, the company states that \u201c[w]e believe cannabis is destined to become the next gold rush and we\u2019re prepared to shape its future in a legal environment."}
