With the Sue and Bill Gross School of Nursing, the university is expected to nearly double its number of nursing students, he adds.\n\nThe new school will train undergraduate students and expand the school's graduate- and doctorate-level nursing programs, Federoff says. Nurses with advanced degrees can play an important role in filling the growing need for primary care providers as the population ages and more people gain access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, he says.\n\nUCI will be the fourth school in the University of California system to have a nursing school. Federoff could not say when the school will open.\n\nSue and Bill Gross also gave UCI $10 million in 2006 to help create a state-of-the-art stem cell research center. Bill Gross was co-founder of bond management colossus Pacific Investment Management Company.\n\nThe nursing school is the first of three new health care-related schools that UCI plans to launch, Federoff says, noting the university also intends to open schools of pharmacy and public health. Eventually, he says, students from the three schools will learn, work and practice together.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "UC Irvine will the fourth institution in the UC system to launch a nursing school.
