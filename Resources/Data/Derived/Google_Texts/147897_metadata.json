(AP) \u2014 It takes a strict routine and a lot of help to raise a family of special-needs children. Few know this better than Eric and Dennis Volz-Benoit, who have five.\n\nTypical days involve feeding tubes, breathing treatments, medications and assembly-line showers, not to mention taking kids to school, making dinner and washing clothes.\n\n\"It's just kind of like a well-oiled machine,\" said Eric Volz-Benoit. \"The key for us is routine. Everything is routine.\"\n\nBut routine only goes so far for the Springfield couple and their children, Zachary, 8, who has epilepsy and cerebral palsy; Tyler, 7, who has brain damage and autism; Jayden, 5, who has post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline behavior problems; and biological siblings Ryan and Mandie, 7 and 6, who both have PTSD.\n\nThat's where the Collaborative Consultative Care Coordinator Program \u2014 known as 4C, and where Eric Volz-Benoit works as a nurse \u2014 comes in.\n\nThe program helps parents and pediatricians manage medically complex children. Families are paired with a team of helpers, including a nurse care coordinator and a social worker who can make home visits. A child's medical information is loaded into a central site, or \"cloud,\" so any specialists needed to check or treat any given condition can get what they need quickly and easily.\n\nThe program is a partnership between Boston Medical Center and Baystate Medical Center, funded in September 2014 by a three-year, $6 million federal grant under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nZachary is the only one who qualifies for the coordinated care at 4C. He uses a wheelchair and requires a feeding tube and oxygen; early on after coming to live with the couple in 2008, he was frequently in and out of the hospital.\n\nVolz-Benoit credits Zachary with helping him \"grow up a lot\" and become a father to his brood of special children.\n\n\"No matter how cruddy of a day I've had, all I have to do is come home and get a kiss and see that child,\" he said. \"He balances my life. I can't imagine not having him around.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Associated Press photographers and photo editors on Twitter: http://apne.ws/15Oo6jo\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the name of one of the hospitals involved in the partnership to Baystate Medical Center, instead of Bay State Medical Center.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "AP > News > Nation  |", "og": {"site_name": "Reading Eagle", "description": "AP PHOTOS: Couple with 5 special-needs children get help through medical partnership", "title": "AP PHOTOS: For family of special-needs kids, special help | Reading Eagle - AP", "url": "http://readingeagle.com/ap/article/ap-photos-for-family-of-special-needs-kids-special-help", "image": "http://www.readingeagle.com/storyimage/RE/20151223/AP/312239617/AR/0/AR-312239617.jpg&q=80&MaxW=250&MaxH=250&RCRadius=5", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://readingeagle.com/ap/article/ap-photos-for-family-of-special-needs-kids-special-help", "image": {"src": "http://www.readingeagle.com/storyimage/RE/20151223/AP/312239617/AR/0/AR-312239617.jpg&q=80&MaxW=250&MaxH=250&RCRadius=5"}, "site": "@ReadingEagle", "card": "summary", "title": "AP PHOTOS: For family of special-needs kids, special help | Reading Eagle - AP"}, "robots": "index,follow", "fb": {"app_id": 177057515645359}, "keywords": "AP > News > Nation  |", "article": {"section": "AP"}, "description": "AP PHOTOS: Couple with 5 special-needs children get help through medical partnership"}, "article_summary": "___Follow Associated Press photographers and photo editors on Twitter: http://apne.ws/15Oo6joThis story has been updated to correct the name of one of the hospitals involved in the partnership to Baystate Medical Center, instead of Bay State Medical Center.\n(AP) \u2014 It takes a strict routine and a lot of help to raise a family of special-needs children.\n\"It's just kind of like a well-oiled machine,\" said Eric Volz-Benoit.\nThat's where the Collaborative Consultative Care Coordinator Program \u2014 known as 4C, and where Eric Volz-Benoit works as a nurse \u2014 comes in.\nThe program is a partnership between Boston Medical Center and Baystate Medical Center, funded in September 2014 by a three-year, $6 million federal grant under the Affordable Care Act."}
