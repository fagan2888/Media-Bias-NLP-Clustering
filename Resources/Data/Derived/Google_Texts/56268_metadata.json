This is only the beginning. More and more companies will do this to escape taxes, which means that costs for the average citizen for health care will skyrocket. Thank you, President Obama. I wonder what the tax is on a set of golf clubs. William J. Griggs\n\n\n\nOrange, N.J.: With the news that Burger King might be moving its corporate headquarters to Canada, does that mean its burgers will now be Calgary Flame-broiled, the Big King will be renamed the \u201cBig McKenzie King,\u201d and that it\u2019s signature sandwich will now be spelled \u201cW-h-o-p-p-r-e\u201d? Have it your \u201ceh\u201d? Derek Tague\n\n\n\nHallandale Beach, Fla.: Tim Hortons operates over 4,250 restaurants across Canada, several U.S. states and \u201ca few other outposts,\u201d as well as the Cold Stone Creamery icecream shop chain. Once Burger King\u2019s acquisition of Tim Hortons is completed, I think Tim Hortons will expand throughout the rest of the U.S. \u2014 which will make it a big competitor to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Krispy Kreme and even Starbucks. Paul Bacon\n\nShot in the heart\n\nCentereach, L.I.: To Arizona child protective services: The parents of the 9-year-old girl who accidentally killed her shooting instructor with an Uzi should be investigated for endangering the life of their daughter. This has nothing to do with the Second Amendment or gun rights. The only question that needs to be answered is why was this child there in the first place. I will pray for the girl as well as the family of the instructor. Unfortunately, this is just another story that speaks to the epic failure of our government to enact better gun laws. Jordan Tarazi\n\nPatience?\n\nBronx: Voicer Joan Kinneary says justice has to be allowed to take its course regarding the death of Eric Garner. She says the courts, not a protest march, will decide the outcome. Really? Justice took its course at the O.J. Simpson trial almost 20 years ago, yet many white people are still livid at the outcome. I wonder if Kinneary will readily accept the outcome if it isn\u2019t to her liking. Jonathan Solomon\n\nExcess at Succes\n\nSilver Spring, Md.: Juan Gonzalez\u2019s piece on Eva Moskowitz was spot on. It is obscene that this operator of a handful of charter schools is paid more than double what the head of the city\u2019s 1.1-million-student public school system is paid. When will Americans wake up to the fact that charter schools are part of a campaign to privatize education, turn students into widgets and transform teachers into assembly-line robots? Enough already. Edd Doerr\n\nYou\u2019re not it\n\nBrooklyn: I noticed the other morning that the F train stop at Ft. Hamilton Pkwy now has a huge red graffiti tag at the entrance to the station. What is wrong with people today? Most of us work hard to support our families and do the right thing. Who raised you, tagger? Whoever you are, you are a total punk in my book. Madeline Paniagua\n\nSolidarity never\n\nJamaica: Shame on you, police sergeants\u2019 union! You are supposed to protect and serve \u2014 and now you\u2019re telling us you can\u2019t protect us. You sound like a bunch of spoiled children. Do you know that having the Democratic National Convention in New York would bring in a lot of revenue for the city? Small businesses would profit. The police in all boroughs could get a lot of overtime. I thought the union was supposed to help people, not hurt them. Charlene Black\n\nIt tolls for thee\n\nManhattan: To recent transplant Zephyr Teachout (\u201cCuomo enabled Christie\u2019s Tunnelgate,\u201d Op-Ed, Aug. 27), who wrote about \u201cfunds that come in large part from revenue collected in New York State\u201d: Last time I crossed the Hudson at a Port Authority crossing, I paid my toll on the Jersey side. Anthony Russomano\n\nHunger for the past\n\nForest Hills: I\u2019ve read the many nostalgic letters about A&S custard and other long-gone foods and enjoyed them all. Strangely, as a Brooklyn native, I do not remember the snack counter under the escalator in the store\u2019s basement, and neither do any Brooklyn-born and -raised friends I asked about it. I do remember the wonderful coffee soda at Macy\u2019s called Sparkoffee (I think that\u2019s the right spelling) and the wonderful roasted nuts at Macy\u2019s. My mother and I always got a bag of cashews, which were always long gone before we got to the Utica Ave. station. Elaine Wohl\n\nFumble\n\nBardonia, N.Y.: Last Monday night, my wife and I sat for 31/2 hours watching the 2014 Emmy Awards. The show was enjoyable enough, but I walked away with one nagging question: What in the world ever possessed ABC to stop broadcasting Monday Night Football? Dick Mills\n\nBetter assimilate than never\n\nBronx: The fact that somebody can live here for 50 years and not speak the official language supports my position that New York City is practicing the same apartheid, also known as multiculturalism, as Amsterdam, the city I left. This debauching of culture in the civilized Western world is a very sad state of affairs! Lisette Muntslag\n\nA little respect\n\nHamilton, N.J.: It\u2019s not that the President takes vacations. He is certainly entitled. But to give James Foley the short amount of time that he did and then go off to the golf course showed insensitivity. When Obama \u201cgot back\u201d Bo Bergdhal, so much was made of it that there was an announcement with his parents in the Rose Garden. Foley\u2019s parents\u2019 press conference, on the other hand, was stepped on by his announcement. How about standing with them, Mr. President? Jeanette Nichols\n\nBe afraid, very afraid\n\nBrooklyn: I get most of my information from watching Fox News, listening to radio talk shows and reading newspapers, and what I see scares the hell out of me. Yet I\u2019m constantly hearing from many on both sides of the aisle lately that our President has no set plan to protect us from ISIS and other terrorist groups. Many of the terrorists are homegrown with legitimate passports, and the southern border, as we all know, is porous. I fear for all of us. Emma Stellabotte\n\nAre we lost?\n\nWashingtonville, N.Y.: Is it that Americans are inclined towards faith, or are we just so self-absorbed we are able to block out all that is around us and concentrate only on what affects us personally? Honestly, for many, it is probably a mixture of both. America has faced very difficult moments in its history, yet now truly seems worse than ever. \u201cDo unto others what you want done unto you\u201d: If those words still rang true in America, it would still be the beacon of light other countries look to for guidance and help. We must see the suffering not just in this country but throughout the world. Where there is no love, there is no peace. Kim Brady\n\nBooo-ber\n\nManhattan: How is it that the behemoth car service company Uber is allowed to conduct business in New York City without there being a contact phone number available so that consumers can speak with a live person? They are demanding that sensitive credit card and personal ID information be exchanged only via an app. Sounds like a very unsafe and sketchy practice for such a large and successful company: a ticking time-bomb of Target proportions. Craig Lowther\n\nWorst of West\n\nPhiladelphia: So, Cornel West has a problem with \u201cJewish men who consider themselves very smart.\u201d Pity. I respect anyone who impresses me as intelligent, including black men and women. Unfortunately, West\u2019s statement leaves me with a problem with one man who does no credit to either the black race or the human race. I understand his concerns about President Obama\u2019s policies. However, Obama does not only serve liberals like West \u2014 and, for that matter, me \u2014 but must maneuver among other powerful people. I wish Prof. West would at least reconsider some of his crude language. Bruce S.
