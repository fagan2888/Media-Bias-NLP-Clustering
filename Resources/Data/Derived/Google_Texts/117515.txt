NBTY Puts On Skin Cream, As Beauty Companies Attract Buyers

The Carlyle-backed Vitamin World parent buys skin care product retailer Dr Organic to continue expanding in the personal care space

NBTY Inc., a Carlyle Group (Nasdaq: CG) portfolio company, is buying skin care treatment maker Dr Organic for undisclosed terms.

Swansea, Wales-based Dr. Organic, founded in 2008, makes all natural body washes and moisturizers.

The purchase will expand NBTYs presence in the personal care and beauty categories, while it gives Dr Organic additional growth opportunities in the U.S.

Dr Organic is sold in NBTYs Holland & Barrett chain in the United Kingdom and in Vitamin World stores in the U.S. NBTY is known for the Natures Bounty and Sundown Naturals supplement brands.

We believe the acquisition will allow us to accelerate NBTY's entry into the mass-market beauty and skincare category particularly in the U.S., says NBTY CEO Steve Cahillane. Carlyle acquired Ronkonkoma, New York-based NBTY in September 2010 for about $4 billion.

Beauty targets have been attracting buyer interest. Coty (NYSE: COTY) agreed in July to acquire 43 beauty brands from Proctor & Gamble (NYSE: PG), including Hugo Boss and Gucci fragrances along with Max Factor and CoverGirl. Unilever (NYSE: UL) is buying skin care company Dermalogica, announced in June.

Latham & Watkins LLP is NBTYs legal advisor and Dorsey & Whitney LLP is representing Dr Organic.
