The Kansas Supreme Court has ruled that the state is not liable for the death of an 83-year-old woman who died months after being assaulted in her home by an escaped prisoner.

Christopher Zorn, an inmate at Norton Correctional Facility, walked away from the prison in 2008. Authorities say he went to the home of Helen Keiswetter and assaulted her. Authorities also say injuries she sustained in the assault led to her death months later.

Zorn was later arrested in Denver and pleaded guilty to several charges.

The Topeka Capital Journal reports that lower courts ruled the state wasn't liable for Zorn's escape.

In a unanimous ruling Friday, the Kansas Supreme Court agreed and said prison employees are considered police and are granted similar protection from liability.
