They also help protect people with disabilities from losing social security benefits when they cross income thresholds. However, policy makers need to redefine disability and revisit restrictions that existing laws place on people with disabilities from taking employment and becoming independent, experts from Wharton and the University of Texas said.\n\nThe 529 ABLE plan is \u201can important statement and a great opportunity for people with disabilities,\u201d said Lex Frieden, professor of biomedical informatics and physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Texas. \u201cPhilosophically, the approach is at least equally as important as the potential impact.\u201d Frieden also directs the Independent Living Research Utilization program at The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research at Memorial Hermann hospital in Houston, Texas. He is best known for his contributions to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n\nHowever, according to Wharton professor of business economics and public policy Kent Smetters, the ABLE plans have limited impact. For one, he noted that 15 states do not offer the plan. Also, they form a \u201csmall fraction\u201d of the 529 education plans, which in turn are a tenth the size of 401(k) retirement savings plans, he said. Total savings under 401(k) plans were $4.49 trillion at the end of the third quarter of 2015, according to the Investment Company Institute of Washington, D.C.\n\nFrieden and Smetters took stock of the ABLE program and identified aspects of disability programs that need remedial action on the Knowledge@Wharton show on Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM channel 111. (Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.)\n\nChief Benefits\n\nThe ABLE Act, passed in December 2014, amends Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986 to create tax-free savings accounts for individuals with disabilities. For many years, 529 plans have helped families save money for college education for their children. The new law allows people to select a plan sponsored by any state, and not just the one in which they live.\n\n\u201cDisability doesn\u2019t necessarily need to mean that someone cannot work, doesn\u2019t work and may not work.\u201d \u2013Lex Frieden\n\nAlso, anybody \u2014 such as a family member, friend or neighbor \u2014 could invest in the ABLE plans to benefit a person with disability. The tax benefits and income growth would accrue to that investor, who also has the option to change the beneficiary over time. Smetters noted that the $14,000 annual contribution limit is exactly equal to the threshold for tax exemption on gifts.\n\nSmetters said the principal benefit of the ABLE plan is the federal tax break, since some states do not offer relief from state taxes. For example, Pennsylvania offers state tax relief for ABLE plan investors, while California does not, he explained. However, the value of that tax relief for many people will be quite small, he added.\n\nFrieden pointed out that the ABLE program helps people with disabilities get around restrictions they face if they are also beneficiaries of social security benefits. Such people must report any income they receive in excess of $2,000 annually, which puts them at risk of becoming ineligible for both social security payments and health care benefits such as Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThis has been a restriction and a disincentive that has prevented many people with disabilities from even trying to be productive and to be in the workforce,\u201d said Frieden. The ABLE plan will help people with disabilities to put money aside \u2014 up to $14,000 a year \u2014 into savings, and that money will not be counted towards the $2,000 ceiling with the social security program, he explained.\n\nDisability a \u2018Murky Concept\u2019\n\nIn order to be eligible for the plan, a person must have had the onset of a disability before the age of 26, and be able to prove that he or she has that disability. According to Frieden, of the 58 million Americans with disabilities, only an estimated 5.8 million people will qualify for the ABLE plans. He noted that the major proponents of the ABLE plan were advocates of people with mostly intellectual disabilities, otherwise termed as developmental disabilities.\n\n\u201cMany parents of children who were born with disabilities were concerned about being able to have a savings account for their children,\u201d said Frieden. The threshold of 26 years of age \u201cis correlated to some degree with the notion that people who are disabled at birth or acquired a disability when they were younger may have greater needs than those [who were] older,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThe more we try to simplify [social security rules], the more people seem to be afraid that it is a ruse and they won\u2019t take the risk to go to work.\u201d \u2013Lex Frieden\n\nThe threshold of 26 years is significant because \u201cdisability is a murky concept,\u201d according to Smetters. \u201cDisability rates increase dramatically once you hit older ages, [and] many disabilities are hard to verify,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IRS has \u201cfairly generous\u201d rules governing proof of disability, noted Frieden. \u201cThis is one of the few such programs where a person doesn\u2019t have to go through a long process and be examined by multiple physicians in order to prove their eligibility for the program,\u201d he added.\n\nProblems Persist\n\nFrieden called for a fresh definition for disability, explaining that its meaning has changed over the years. \u201cPeople with disabilities should be able to be independent and productive,\u201d he said. \u201cDisability doesn\u2019t necessarily need to mean that someone cannot work, doesn\u2019t work and may not work. We have to change the definition there and modernize our approach to income support.\u201d He added that people with disabilities \u201cshould be encouraged to continue working and be incentivized for living independently in the community.\u201d\n\nFrieden advocated \u201ca comprehensive approach\u201d from the Social Security Administration to rectify those disincentives. \u201cThe more we try to simplify it, the more people seem to be afraid that it is a ruse and they won\u2019t take the risk to go to work,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, a very low proportion of people who are eligible for social security disability payments ever return to work.\u201d He noted that technology today offers many opportunities for people with disabilities to work and earn money, \u201cbut they don\u2019t want to jeopardize those benefits.\u201d\n\nSmetters said there is good reason for the income and asset tests for these programs. \u201cThe evidence from other countries is that if you make eligibility too easy, such as in the Netherlands, lots of people are disabled,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the idea was to deal with this moral hazard problem.\u201d He added that experts at Wharton are studying the various disability programs and suggesting improvements.\n\n\u201cEverything we do about disability is completely off the mark.\u201d \u2013Kent Smetters\n\nGaps in Risk-pooling\n\nAccording to Smetters, the bigger issue is that \u201cthese plans reflect a continued fragmentation of how we treat health care, because we are not doing it correctly.\u201d He called for the entire approach to risk-pooling to be revisited. \u201cEverything we do about disability is completely off the mark,\u201d he said.\n\nSmetters referred to the finding of the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention that about 75% of all health care spending in the U.S. is for chronic metabolic diseases. He said that while those conditions are largely preventable through diet and exercise, health care in the U.S. is delivered mostly through group insurance plans or programs under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSmetters argued against risk-pooling for people with those chronic metabolic diseases. \u201cWhat we should be pooling on are things that are beyond our control, [such as] genetic issues and disabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re pooling exactly on the wrong things in society and then we try to make up with these different little programs [such as the ABLE program].\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 529 ABLE program that encourages people with disabilities to save money with tax breaks is helpful, but disincentives need to be changed.", "og": {"site_name": "Knowledge@Wharton", "description": "The 529 ABLE program that encourages people with disabilities to save money with tax breaks is helpful, but disincentives need to be changed.", "title": "Taking Stock of the ABLE Program: More Measures Needed?", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ABLE.jpg", "height": 440}, "url": "http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/frieden-smetters-529-able/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 529 ABLE program that encourages people with disabilities to save money with tax breaks is helpful, but disincentives need to be changed.", "title": "Taking Stock of the ABLE Program: More Measures Needed?", "image": "http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ABLE.jpg", "creator": "@WhartonKnows", "site": "@WhartonKnows", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "robots": "noodp", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"admins": 1653092227}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/knowledgeatwharton", "section": "Business Radio"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "business, education"}, "article_summary": "However, according to Wharton professor of business economics and public policy Kent Smetters, the ABLE plans have limited impact.\nFor example, Pennsylvania offers state tax relief for ABLE plan investors, while California does not, he explained.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pooling exactly on the wrong things in society and then we try to make up with these different little programs [such as the ABLE program].\u201d\nFrieden pointed out that the ABLE program helps people with disabilities get around restrictions they face if they are also beneficiaries of social security benefits.\nSmetters said the principal benefit of the ABLE plan is the federal tax break, since some states do not offer relief from state taxes."}
