Two top deputies of Mayor de Blasio, who campaigned on creating a new era of government openness, commonly use their personal Gmail accounts to discuss city-related issues, the Daily News has learned. First Deputy Mayor Anthony Shorris and director of intergovernmental affairs Emma Wolfe routinely communicate via their private email addresses, according to multiple government insiders. Good-government groups contend that\u2019s a behind-the-scenes way to dodge oversight and contrary to the open government de Blasio vowed to run as he campaigned for mayor.\n\nEmbattled City Hall aide Rachel Noerdlinger stood by her ex-con man Sunday, appearing in public with him and her son \u2014 on their way to church. While Noerdlinger, 43, chief of staff for First Lady Chirlane McCray, and her cop-hating beau, Hassaun McFarlan, 36, remained silent on the controversy they\u2019ve caused at City Hall, she did share some words of solace. \u201cI pray for you,\u201d Noerdlinger told a Daily News crew who photographed her, her son, Khari, 17, and McFarlan together outside their Edgewater, N.J., home.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Donald Trump, whose casinos crapped out in Atlantic City, says New York State is likely to roll snake eyes in its bet on four upstate gaming parlors. The former casino magnate told the Daily News that the planned casinos will generate excitement and revenue in the short term \u2014 but he predicted the state will take a loss on the risky gamble in the not-too-distant future. \u201cUltimately, there\u2019s too much competition and they\u2019ll all go down the tubes,\u201d he said.\n\nOur Ken Lovett's column: A Manhattan woman who last week admitted to committing fraud as part of the effort to get two Republican candidates on a new anti-Common Core ballot line may have done the same thing in at least two other races. Jenise Jett told the Daily News last week that she never witnessed people signing petitions to get gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino and state Senate candidate Joe Dillon in Westchester County on the Astorino-created Stop Common Core ballot line this November.\n\nIt\u2019s the noncampaign campaign. While underdog Republican Rob Astorino criss-crosses the state in a desperate hunt for votes, Gov. Cuomo is running out the clock until Election Day \u2014 a Rose Garden strategy on steroids.\n\nTUCapCon: \"Don\u2019t expect the Astorinos to become the new neighbors in Albany\u2019s Mansion Neighborhood. The Westchester County Executive told the crowd gathered at a town hall meeting at Ellms Family Farm in Ballston Spa Sunday that he, his wife and three children would remain in Mount Pleasant, Westchester County, if he is elected, instead of moving to the governor\u2019s mansion.\"\n\nWSJ: \"In two well-financed statewide political campaigns, in 2006 for attorney general and in 2010 for governor, Andrew Cuomo emerged victorious virtually everywhere except for one place: western New York.\"\n\nNYT: \"Cuomo defended a New York State law that has made it easier to take guns away from people who have been deemed mentally unstable, saying on Sunday that the number of people banned from owning firearms since the law took effect over 18 months ago could be too low.\"\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Some say this Rose smells like an ethical violation. Critics are ripping a technology contract the city handed to a former Education Department official\u2019s nonprofit group in September. New Classrooms, started by Joel Rose, was granted a one-year contract for $420,750 in federal grant money to operate a learning program Rose created while working for the city. Critics charge the arrangement violates the ethics rules prohibiting workers from cashing in on their public service. They also say Rose promised the services for free in a previous deal.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: City Hall is launching a major new ad campaign urging New Yorkers to roll up their sleeves and volunteer. The agency spearheading the campaign, NYC Service, wants to up the proportion of people who lend a hand with free labor to 50% from a paltry 18%. The ads, which start appearing on 1,000 subway cars Monday, target people who don\u2019t do volunteer work by stressing that service has some selfish benefits, too.\n\nDrivers may soon be able to feed pesky muni-meters up to an hour before parking restrictions set in each day, according to state Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who pushed for the change. \u201cThe current situation has been very frustrating for New Yorkers because the muni-meters are not currently set up to accept payments until they become active,\u201d the Brooklyn lawmaker said.\n\njIM YOUNG/REUTERS\n\nPresident Obama hit the campaign trail for two Democratic candidates Sunday \u2014 defying the notion that he\u2019s political kryptonite. Obama stumped for Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn and Maryland gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown as part of a belated push before upcoming elections in November. In Maryland, some voters walked out on Obama\u2019s pitch, but in Chicago, the President was poised to speak as a returning favorite son.\n\nCap NY: \"New York City's uninsured rate fell to historic lows during the past year thanks, in part, to the resources provided by the Affordable Care Act, and an unprecedented surge in Medicaid rolls in immigrant neighborhoods, based on an analysis of recently released state data.\"\n\nPols rip President Obama\u2019s choice for Ebola \u2018czar\u2019 http://t.co/JP48YYzqZf \u2014 NYDN Politics (@NYDNPolitics) October 19, 2014\n\nSen.
