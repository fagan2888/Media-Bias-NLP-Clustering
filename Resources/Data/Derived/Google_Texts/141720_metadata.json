This week, we learned of a 9 year-old cancer patient who was denied treatment because of the transition. Thousands of others are being forced to switch providers or travel greater distances for care. Medicaid recipients in north Iowa will no longer receive care from the nearby Mayo clinic which did not accept the private management agreement. Governor Branstad\u2019s ill-advised, fast-track methods are shameful, inexcusable and not in the best interest of Iowans.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2014, Governor Branstad campaigned on a promise to make Iowa the healthiest state in the country. Since re-election, Branstad has failed to live up to his promise by shutting down three Iowa mental hospitals in 2015 and spearheading Medicaid privatization with little legislative input or oversight in 2016. This week, Branstad went one step further by promising to veto a voter-approved tax plan that would improve Iowa\u2019s water quality issues. It\u2019s clear that Governor Branstad doesn\u2019t want to address water pollution unless it\u2019s at the expense of our schools. Unsafe drinking water and polluted rivers and streams are nearing emergency crisis levels in Iowa while Branstad stubbornly allows his ego to outweigh any benefits to Iowans\u2019 health and well-being.\u201d\n\n\u201cIowa\u2019s drinking water, mental health institutes, and health care for our most vulnerable citizens are all under attack by Governor Branstad. If he truly wants to make Iowa the healthiest state in the nation, he has a funny way of showing it.\u201d\n\nProgress Iowa is a nonpartisan multi-issue advocacy organization with a network of nearly 70,000. Year-round, Progress Iowa advocates for a stronger middle class, first-class public education, and fairness for all Iowans under the law.
