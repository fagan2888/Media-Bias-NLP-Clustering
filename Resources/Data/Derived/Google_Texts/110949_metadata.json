Democrats have long said Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress could put nuclear negotiations with Iran in jeopardy, while Republicans and Netanyahu believe the U.S. should increase sanctions on Iran and refrain from engaging in peace talks.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a rather arrogant statement,\u201d Feinstein said on State of the Union. \u201cI think the Jewish community is like any other community \u2014 there are different points of view. So I think that arrogance does not befit Israel, candidly.\u201d\n\nFeinstein did not go as far as to say the timing of Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress (just a few weeks before he faces re-election in Israel) is \u201carrogant,\u201d but rather a \u201csign of a political move.\u201d\n\nFeinstein and her Democratic Senate colleagues invited Netanyahu to meet with them during his visit to Washington, but he declined.\n\nWatch the video below, via CNN:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>>Follow Andrew Desiderio (@forza_desiderio) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
