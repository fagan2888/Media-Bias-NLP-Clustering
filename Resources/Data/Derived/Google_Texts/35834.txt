About 58 percent of the enrollees have incomes under 250 percent of the federal poverty level.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) public exchange system ended up with 10.2 million paid individual enrollees as of March 31.

The HealthCare.gov exchanges operated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the state-based exchanges came out with about as many enrollees as HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell had predicted before open enrollment started, but fewer than some exchange program backers had hoped, according to data posted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the HHS division in charge of the exchange program.
