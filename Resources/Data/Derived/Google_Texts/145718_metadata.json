But what he said about the minimum wage should make progressives\u2019 ears perk up.\n\nGATES: When people say we should raise the minimum wage, I think\u2026 I know some economists would disagree, but I think boy, I worry about what that does to job creation. The idea that through the Earned Income Tax Credit, you\u2019d end up with a minimum wage that you\u2019d receive \u2013 that, I understand better than potentially damping demand in the part of the labor spectrum that I\u2019m most worried about.\n\nGates is a darling of progressives when he talks about raising tax rates on the rich, but they\u2019re listening to the wrong part of his message. He\u2019s a billionaire, and mostly unconnected from the tax brackets that actually feel the effects of tax hikes. But what he is also is an entrepreneur \u2013 unlike a lot of pro-minimum-wage-hike progressives, he actually built a business. He knows what it\u2019s like to calculate the cost of adding a new worker and how much it will take to compensate them. Adding to the marginal cost of hiring a new worker \u2013 especially one at the low end of the income scale \u2013 would be disastrous for those workers who are marginally attached to the labor force and have fewer skills to fall back on if they\u2019re priced out of the work force.\n\nThis comes on the heels of a letter from 500 economists, including five Nobel laureates, that excoriated Democrats for threatening to raise the minimum wage in this economy. If Democrats were smart, they\u2019d listen. Unfortunately, Bill Gates\u2019 political views only matter when they\u2019re convenient to liberals \u2013 and economists are only useful when they agree with Democrats.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Bill Gates, billionaire co-founder of Microsoft and political liberal, appeared at the American Enterprise Institute last week for a wide-ranging discussion with Arthur Brookson the economy, market\u2026", "title": "Bill Gates on minimum wage hike: \u201cI worry about what that does to job creation.\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/job-creators/2014/03/17/bill-gates-on-minimum-wage-hike-i-worry-about-what-that-does-to-job-creation/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-17T16:41:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-17T14:20:16+00:00"}, "keywords": "American Enterprise Institute, bill gates, minimum wage,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "GATES: When people say we should raise the minimum wage, I think\u2026 I know some economists would disagree, but I think boy, I worry about what that does to job creation.\nBut what he said about the minimum wage should make progressives\u2019 ears perk up.\nThis comes on the heels of a letter from 500 economists, including five Nobel laureates, that excoriated Democrats for threatening to raise the minimum wage in this economy.\nUnfortunately, Bill Gates\u2019 political views only matter when they\u2019re convenient to liberals \u2013 and economists are only useful when they agree with Democrats.\nHe\u2019s a billionaire, and mostly unconnected from the tax brackets that actually feel the effects of tax hikes."}
