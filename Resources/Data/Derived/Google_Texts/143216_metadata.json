The funding had previously gone toward the state department\u2019s Division of Immunizations.\n\nAlthough people with medical insurance or Medicare may be able to get the flu shot for little or no cost from their doctor, Jones said she is still concerned that some people will fall through the cracks and not receive the preventative vaccine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about people who will not have access, whether through finances or lack of insurance. We don\u2019t know how big of an issue it\u2019s going to be,\u201d she said.\n\nLast year, about 2,600 people received free flu shots through various clinics in the county. In 2011, Schuylkill VISION distributed the first flu shots. And Jones said that VISION is working to find organizations that can provide the vaccine again for the 2014 flu season.\n\n\u201cThe immunization coalition will try to get some free vaccines, but we don\u2019t know if we will be able to,\u201d Jones said.\n\nThe coalition is comprised of those involved in public health in the county, which includes the local department of health and Diakon Community Services for Seniors.\n\nHolli Senior, deputy press secretary with the state Department of Health, said Wednesday the department will no longer provide free flu shots.\n\n\u201cDue to the decrease in funding, the department is no longer in the position to provide free influenza vaccine to adults. The funding I am referencing is 317 funding, which is federal funding that was decreased by 54 percent for 2014. The 317 program has evolved over time to fill gaps and address priorities in our vaccine programs. As the Affordable Care Act is implemented, more individuals will have coverage for vaccines through both public and private insurance,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nAccording to www.cdc.gov, Section 317-funded vaccines are for people who \u201care under-insured or their parents cannot afford the out-of-pocket costs required to fully vaccinate their children.\u201d\n\nKathy Leahy, program manager for the senior community centers managed by Diakon, also said Diakon was informed earlier this year is not receiving any flu vaccines. Attempts are being made to obtain vaccines elsewhere, she said.\n\nA lot of seniors took advantage of the vaccines, Leahy said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend getting the vaccine as soon as it is available. The vaccines available will contain the same strains as those found in the 2013-14 flu season, the CDC said. Those ages 6 months and older should get the vaccine, and people with certain medical conditions should contact their doctor about the vaccination. An estimated 154 to 160 million doses will be distributed for the current flu season. This year, the CDC recommended that children ages 2 to 8 receive the more effective nasal spray vaccine.\n\nJustyn Fair, 32, of Pottsville, said he didn\u2019t want to wait to get his flu shot, which he got Aug. 21 at Rite Aid, 10 Centre St., Pottsville. He said he gets a flu shot every year to \u201cprevent me from getting the flu. I had it one time when I was younger, and it\u2019s not something you want to have.\u201d He was planning on getting vaccinated at his doctor\u2019s office but decided earlier was better and asked to get the vaccine at Rite Aid when an employee told him his insurance would cover the cost.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even feel it,\u201d he said of the needle.\n\nColleen Brennan, pharmacy manager at Rite Aid, said now is the time to get the flu shot to protect yourself, family and others before the flu season starts. It takes about two weeks for the shot to be effective.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that everyone get the flu shot,\u201d she said.\n\nEarlier this month, the pharmacy started administering the vaccine, which most insurance companies pay for. Brennan said she has personally given 50 flu shots. No appointment is needed. High doses are available for seniors too, she said.\n\nSome people think they get sick from getting the vaccine, but Brennan said this is a common misconception. More likely is they already have the flu and do not know it.\n\nSome people do experience soreness in their arm, though, because \u201cthe needle is actually penetrating the muscle,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nFlu shots are available at most Rite Aid pharmacies from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"author": "By Amy Marchiano", "title": "Funding for free flu clinics ends", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "By Amy Marchiano", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1743134"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "DC.title": "Funding for free flu clinics ends"}, "article_summary": "Last year, about 2,600 people received free flu shots through various clinics in the county.\nFree flu shot clinics might be a thing of the past.\nHe said he gets a flu shot every year to \u201cprevent me from getting the flu.\nHolli Senior, deputy press secretary with the state Department of Health, said Wednesday the department will no longer provide free flu shots.\n\u201cThe immunization coalition will try to get some free vaccines, but we don\u2019t know if we will be able to,\u201d Jones said."}
