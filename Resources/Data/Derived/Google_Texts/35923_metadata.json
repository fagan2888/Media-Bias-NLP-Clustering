The first baseman was left off the NL team that was unveiled Sunday. Now his only chance to make the roster is to be voted in by fans as the \u201c34th man.\u201d\n\nThe 85th All-Star Game will be played July 15 at Target Field in Minneapolis.\n\nThe selection of Tulowitzki was simply confirmation that he\u2019s one of baseball\u2019s very best players, but Blackmon\u2019s selection came as bit of a surprise. After making the Rockies\u2019 opening-day roster despite having a difficult spring training, he hit a sizzling .389 in April with five home runs, but has since cooled considerably. Blackmon, 28, now is hitting .291 with 12 home runs and leads the Rockies with 16 stolen bases.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I made the big-league team out of camp,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cI thought I was on the bubble the whole time. I could have easily not made the team, and now here we are talking about the All-Star Game. It\u2019s a blessing, and I\u2019m really amazed about what\u2019s happened. I\u2019m happy to represent the Rockies there.\u201d\n\nSaid manager Walt Weiss: \u201cI\u2019m ecstatic for Charlie. He was a pitcher until late in college, then he had to fight through some injuries early in his pro career. Now he\u2019s gotten up here and he\u2019s made the most of it. Now he\u2019s playing in an All-Star Game. It\u2019s a great story.\u201d\n\nThere was never any question that Tulowitzki would become an all-star for the fourth time, tying him with Larry Walker and leaving him one shy of Todd Helton for the franchise record. Tulo led fan voting from the very beginning and finished with 5,349,456 votes \u2014 the most for any NL player, despite the slumping Rockies\u2019 37-52 record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, during my rookie year, I remember talking to (Matt) Holliday and (Garrett) Atkins, and those guys saying that playing for the Rockies, you\u2019ll never be high in voting,\u201d Tulo said. \u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019ll have to get the player voting or the coaches will have to pick you.\u2019 And I remember holding on to that thought, and thinking that one day I wanted to change that about this place.\n\n\u201cSo hopefully, now I can tell guys that come in here that it\u2019s possible to get a start and get the fans behind you.\u201d\n\nTulo is having an MVP-type season and leads the National League in hitting (.350), slugging percentage (.605) and on-base percentage (.442). He previously made all-star teams in 2010, 2011 and 2013.\n\n\u201cThis is Tulo\u2019s fourth one, and every one of them is really special,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe\u2019s the leading vote-getter, and rightfully so, for the first half he\u2019s put together.\u201d\n\nTulo also is the captain of the National League\u2019s home run derby squad and will participate in the event the night before the All-Star Game at Target Field. He said he will announce his five-man home run derby squad Tuesday.\n\nMorneau\u2019s triumphant return to Minnesota, where he was the American League MVP in 2006, is now on hold. Arizona first baseman Paul Goldschmidt won the fans\u2019 vote and the Atlanta Braves\u2019 Freddie Freeman was named the reserve first baseman.\n\nMorneau made the American League squad for four consecutive years with the Minnesota Twins from 2007-10 before injuries \u2014 most especially a devastating concussion \u2014 derailed his career. He\u2019s still hoping to return to Minneapolis and bask in the fans\u2019 cheers.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s a little disappointing, because it\u2019s something you are looking forward to,\u201d he said of Sunday\u2019s announcement. \u201cThe guys that are there are deserving, but hopefully we get some people rallying behind us and get that vote in there.\u201d\n\nMorneau\u2019s numbers certainly support his consideration. He has 59 RBIs, trailing only Miami slugger Giancarlo Stanton in the National League. His .316 batting average trails only the Cardinals\u2019 Adams among first basemen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not much of a self-promoter, but it\u2019s one of those things that at this point I feel like I have played well enough to be there,\u201d said Morneau, a native of British Columbia. \u201cYou hope that maybe you can get Canada and Colorado rallying behind us, and get a few of my hockey buddies on the Twitter and all of that kind of stuff and get a little bit of momentum going.\u201d\n\nFans will determine the final all-star player for each league\u2019s 34-man roster via MLB.com. Fans can cast their votes from a list of five players in each league until the balloting period ends Thursday at 2 p.m. MDT.\n\nMorneau is one of the five players on the final NL ballot. The others are Miami\u2019s Casey McGehee, Washington\u2019s Anthony Rendon, the Chicago Cubs\u2019 Anthony Rizzo and Atlanta\u2019s Justin Upton.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nNational League All-Stars\n\nSTARTERS\n\nC: Yadier Molina, Cardinals\n\n1B: Paul Goldschmidt, Diamondbacks\n\n2B: Chase Utley, Phillies\n\nSS: Troy Tulowitzki, Rockies\n\n3B: Aramis Ramirez, Brewers\n\nOF: Andrew McCutchen, Pirates\n\nOF: Carlos Gomez, Brewers\n\nOF: Yasiel Puig, Dodgers\n\nPITCHERS\n\nLHP: Madison Bumgarner, Giants\n\nLHP: Aroldis Chapman, Reds\n\nRHP: Johnny Cueto, Reds\n\nRHP: Zack Greinke, Dodgers\n\nLHP: Clayton Kershaw, Dodgers\n\nRHP: Craig Kimbrel, Braves\n\nRHP: Pat Neshek, Cardinals\n\nRHP: Francisco Rodriguez, Brewers\n\nRHP: Tyson Ross, Padres\n\nRHP: Jeff Samardzija, Athletics (receives All-Star honors but will be inactive after trade)\n\nRHP: Julio Teheran, Braves (replacement for Jeff Samardzija)\n\nRHP: Adam Wainwright, Cardinals\n\nLHP: Tony Watson, Pirates\n\nRHP: Jordan Zimmermann, Nationals\n\nRESERVES\n\nC: Jonathan Lucroy, Brewers\n\nC: Devin Mesoraco, Reds\n\n1B: Freddie Freeman, Braves\n\n2B: Dee Gordon, Dodgers\n\n2B: Daniel Murphy, Mets\n\nSS: Starlin Castro, Cubs\n\n3B: Matt Carpenter, Cardinals\n\n3B: Todd Frazier, Reds\n\nOF: Charlie Blackmon, Rockies\n\nOF: Josh Harrison, Pirates\n\nOF: Hunter Pence, Giants\n\nOF: Giancarlo Stanton, Marlins\n\nNL FINAL VOTE CANDIDATES\n\n1B: Justin Morneau, Rockies\n\n2B: Anthony Rendon, Nationals\n\n1B: Anthony Rizzo, Cubs\n\n3B: Casey McGehee, Marlins\n\nOF: Justin Upton, Braves\n\n***\n\nAmerican League All-Stars\n\nSTARTERS\n\nC: Salvador Perez, Royals (starting in place of Matt Wieters)\n\n1B: Miguel Cabrera, Tigers\n\n2B: Robinson Cano, Mariners\n\nSS: Derek Jeter, Yankees\n\n3B: Josh Donaldson, Athletics\n\nOF: Jose Bautista, Blue Jays\n\nOF: Mike Trout, Angels\n\nOF: Adam Jones, Orioles\n\nDH: Nelson Cruz, Orioles\n\nPITCHERS\n\nRHP: Dellin Betances, Yankees\n\nLHP: Mark Buehrle, Blue Jays\n\nRHP: Yu Darvish, Rangers\n\nLHP: Sean Doolittle, Athletics\n\nRHP: Felix Hernandez, Mariners\n\nRHP: Greg Holland, Royals\n\nLHP: Scott Kazmir, Athletics\n\nLHP: Jon Lester, Red Sox\n\nLHP: Glen Perkins, Twins\n\nLHP: David Price, Rays\n\nRHP: Max Scherzer, Tigers\n\nRHP: Masahiro Tanaka, Yankees\n\nRESERVES\n\nC: Derek Norris, Athletics\n\nC: Kurt Suzuki, Twins\n\n1B: Jose Abreu, White Sox\n\n1B: Brandon Moss, Athletics\n\n2B: Jose Altuve, Astros\n\n3B: Adrian Beltre, Rangers\n\nSS: Alexei Ramirez, White Sox\n\nOF: Michael Brantley, Indians\n\nOF: Yoenis Cespedes, Athletics\n\nOF: Alex Gordon, Royals\n\nDH: Edwin Encarnacion, Blue Jays\n\nDH: Victor Martinez, Tigers\n\nAL FINAL VOTE CANDIDATES\n\nLHP: Dallas Keuchel, Astros\n\nRHP: Corey Kluber, Indians\n\nRHP: Rick Porcello, Tigers\n\nRHP: Garrett Richards, Angels\n\nLHP: Chris Sale, White Sox", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Troy Tulowitzki named NL All-Star starter; Charlie Blackmon selected as reserve", "title": "Troy Tulowitzki named NL All-Star starter; Charlie Blackmon selected as reserve", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/06/troy-tulowitzki-named-nl-all-star-starter-charlie-blackmon-selected-as-reserve/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140706__tulowitzki-allstarp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140706__tulowitzki-allstarp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-06T17:52:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:25:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Troy Tulowitzki"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda991\"", "article_summary": "Arizona first baseman Paul Goldschmidt won the fans\u2019 vote and the Atlanta Braves\u2019 Freddie Freeman was named the reserve first baseman.\nA sure thing and a fan favorite with a storybook tale will represent the Rockies in the 2014 All-Star Game.\nI could have easily not made the team, and now here we are talking about the All-Star Game.\nHe has 59 RBIs, trailing only Miami slugger Giancarlo Stanton in the National League.\nNow he\u2019s playing in an All-Star Game."}
