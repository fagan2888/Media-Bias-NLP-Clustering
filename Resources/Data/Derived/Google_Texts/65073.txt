Today, March 24, is World Tuberculosis (TB) Day. This annual observance provides an opportunity to raise awareness about TB-related problems and solutions, and to support worldwide TB-control efforts. While great strides have been made to control and cure TB, people still get sick and die from this disease in our country. Much more needs to be done to eliminate this disease.

World TB Day also calls us to remember that the global burden of TB remains enormous, particularly among people with HIV/AIDS, for whom TB is the leading cause of death, worldwide.
