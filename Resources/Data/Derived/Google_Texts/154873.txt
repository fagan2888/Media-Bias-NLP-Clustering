BRUSSELS — Belgian authorities say a number of arrests have been made following raids conducted in a Brussels suburb connected to the Paris attacks.

The raids took place in Molenbeek, on the outskirts of Brussels, said justice ministry spokeswoman Sieghild Lacoere.

She also told CNN that a car rented in Brussels was found near one of the sites of the attacks in France and “that’s what triggered the raids”.
