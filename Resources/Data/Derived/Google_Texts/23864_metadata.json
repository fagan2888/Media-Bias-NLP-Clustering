This is especially important when caring for older adults.\"\n\nA Sri Lankan-born Harvard-trained internist and medical instructor who dabbled in business, Fernandopulle has been working in designing primary care for high-risk patients for around a decade, including in Atlantic City. He co-founded Iora Health in 2010, along with Christopher McKown, the co-founder of Health Dialog.\n\nIora's clinical models are similar to direct primary care companies like Qliance or Zoom Health, and similar to the kind of high-touch primary care some medical practices pursue unbranded.\n\n[Also: CVS says MinuteClinics hit 25 million visits as walk-in service takes hold]\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nIora patients are treated by a team of a doctor, health coach (often a nurse) and behavioral health specialist. \"The team works closely with each patient, and spends more time to better understand each patient's life, motivations, hopes, and fears,\" Iora said in a press release. \"Together, the patients and care team create goals to empower the person in setting the course of their own healthcare.\"\n\nSimilar to managed care capitation, Iora's financial model is based on streamlining administrative and billing costs, thus devoting the resources to serving patients and helping them avoid unnecessary acute interventions.\n\nIora's clinics do not accept patients outside of select health plans, although if more deals like the Tufts Health Plan collaboration happen, more patients, particularly seniors on Medicare Advantage, could have a choice of a health plan with a narrow network featuring Iora or other clinic networks. Across the country in Washington State, Iora has three clinics in greater Seattle serving Humana Medicare Advantage patients.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/tufts-health-plan-iora-team-run-two-new-primary-clinics", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Mass-General-Hospital-feature_0.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Tufts Health Plan is working with Iora to open two new Iora Primary Care practices, in Medford and Hyde Park, exclusively for customers on Tufts' Medicare Preferred and Senior Care Options plans, the latter a dual eligibles plan.", "title": "Tufts Health Plan, Iora team up to run two new primary clinics"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Mass-General-Hospital-feature_0.gif"}, "description": "Tufts Health Plan is working with Iora to open two new Iora Primary Care practices, in Medford and Hyde Park, exclusively for customers on Tufts' Medicare Preferred and Senior Care Options plans, the latter a dual eligibles plan.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tufts Health Plan, Iora team up to run two new primary clinics"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Massachusetts-based Tufts Health Plan is contracting with Iora Health to run two new primary care clinics specifically for senior members on Medicare and Medicaid.&#13; Iora, headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts consults remotely over-the-phone or via video-chat.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd97c4\"", "article_summary": "Massachusetts General HospitalMassachusetts-based Tufts Health Plan is contracting with Iora Health to run two new primary care clinics specifically for senior members on Medicare and Medicaid.\nTufts Health Plan is working with Iora to open two new Iora Primary Care practices, in Medford and Hyde Park, exclusively for customers on Tufts' Medicare Preferred and Senior Care Options plans, the latter a dual eligibles plan.\n\"We believe better healthcare starts with better primary care,\" said Rushika Fernandopulle, MD, co-founder and CEO of Iora Health.\nHe co-founded Iora Health in 2010, along with Christopher McKown, the co-founder of Health Dialog.\nIora's clinical models are similar to direct primary care companies like Qliance or Zoom Health, and similar to the kind of high-touch primary care some medical practices pursue unbranded."}
