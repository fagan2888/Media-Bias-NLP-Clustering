Vinsanity lives in Toronto. At least for one more night.

Memphis Grizzlies forward Vince Carter was moved to tears Wednesday during a video tribute in the first quarter by Toronto Raptors to its former star. The clip featured highlights from Carter’s six years playing with the team where he was dubbed “Air Canada.”

The crowd gave Carter a standing ovation.

“I hate that it ended that way,” Carter said in the video. “Just because of so many memories here and we had great times here.”

Carter averaged 23.4 points with Toronto during his tenure.
