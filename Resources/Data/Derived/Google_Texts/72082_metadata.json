In addition, adults with annual household incomes below $25,000 are 2.3 times more likely to have diagnosed diabetes compared with adults with household incomes over $75,000, according to the CDC.\n\nHealth experts cite multiple barriers to comprehensive diabetes care, including inadequate prescription coverage for costly medications and testing supplies; a shortage of Spanish-speaking medical specialists and community health workers; insensitivity among health care providers to cultural food preferences; a lack of neighborhood markets offering healthy foods; and a dearth of safe recreational opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe need a more comprehensive set of solutions that happen at the neighborhood level to get at the root causes of diabetes,\u201d said Dr. Mehul Dalal, chronic disease director for the state Department of Public Health. He said the data show \u201cshocking disparities.\"\n\nThe \u201cSilent Killer\u201d\n\nDiabetes occurs when blood sugar -- also known as glucose -- levels remain abnormally high because the body doesn\u2019t produce insulin (Type 1 diabetes), or doesn\u2019t use insulin properly (Type 2 diabetes). About 95 percent of people with the disease have Type 2 diabetes, reports the American Diabetes Association.\n\nHealth experts often call diabetes the \u201csilent killer\u201d because people do not experience symptoms during the early years of the disease. But the long-term complications of diabetes can be deadly and costly. Diabetes can lead to serious health issues such as blindness, kidney failure, lower extremity amputations, stroke and heart disease. One report estimates the total cost of diabetes in Connecticut at $2.43 billion annually, reports the ADA.\n\nResearch shows some ethnic and racial groups are genetically predisposed to developing diabetes, including Hispanics, African-Americans, Asians and Native Americans.\n\nIn Connecticut, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to die from diabetes and experience higher rates of diabetes-related hospitalizations and amputations than whites, according to data from DPH.\n\nBlack adults had 4.2 times the rate of hospitalizations for diabetes and four times the rate of diabetes-related lower extremity amputations compared with white adults.\n\nHispanic adults had 2.2 times the rate of hospitalizations for diabetes and nearly twice the rate of diabetes-related lower extremity amputations compared with white adults.\n\nBlack adults had the highest diabetes and diabetes-related mortality rates, followed by Hispanic residents.\n\n\u201cDiabetes is one of the most serious health problems that African-Americans and Hispanics face today,\u201d said Lindsay Scheinblum, manager for fundraising and special events with the Connecticut chapter of the American Diabetes Association. The ADA offers outreach programs to increase awareness among Hispanics and blacks.\n\nWhile genetics play a role in the onset of diabetes, lifestyle issues such as obesity and physical inactivity are the main culprits behind the increased prevalence of Type 2 diabetes among people of all ages, said Dr. Raul Arguello, chairman of the Pediatric Department at Danbury Hospital and chief of the Pediatric Endocrine and Diabetes Program.\n\n\u201cThere has been an explosion of Type 2 diabetes in teenagers nationwide,\u201d said Arguello, a pediatric endocrinologist who noted that diabetes in children was \u201cpractically nonexistent\u201d two decades ago. \u201cNow it is a fact of life for many families.\u201d\n\nExpensive Medications\n\nDr. Bismruta Misra, an endocrinologist at Stamford Hospital, sees some \u201cpositive trends\u201d in her medical practice, where up to 60 percent of all patients have diabetes. More people are seeking medical care after gaining health insurance with passage of the Affordable Care Act. Primary care physicians are actively working to identify patients with pre-diabetes \u2014 those with high blood sugar levels at risk of becoming diabetic.\n\nBut many patients can\u2019t afford the expensive medications and blood sugar testing supplies that are crucial for managing the disease. People with diabetes spend an estimated $7,900 a year on medication and supplies, reports the ADA.\n\n\u201cPeople living on a fixed income may have to choose between paying for their insulin or paying their rent,\u201d Misra said. \u201cThey have health insurance to see a doctor. But their prescription coverage is terrible or they don\u2019t have any at all.\u201d\n\nOther challenges include \u201cstructural barriers\u201d that make it difficult for urban and rural residents to manage diabetes, Dalal said. These hurdles include a shortage of neighborhood markets that carry fresh produce and few recreational options in communities that lack sidewalks or aren\u2019t safe.\n\n\u201cFor a while, we thought we weren\u2019t getting the right messages across,\u201d he said. \u201cBut telling people to eat healthy food and stay active only goes so far. Many patients at higher risk for diabetes live in neighborhoods where that simply is not an option.\u201d\n\nCultural Barriers\n\nA shortage of medical providers who understand the cultural and language preferences of their patients can create barriers to care, said Arguello, a native of El Salvador who speaks English with his pediatric patients and Spanish with their parents. \u201cPeople feel more comfortable when they can communicate in their own language,\u201d he said.\n\nUnderstanding cultural food preferences is also key. For example, white rice \u2014 which the body metabolizes as sugar \u2014 is the basis of many meals for Hispanics and Asians. Fried foods enjoyed by African-Americans and other ethnic groups increase the risk for obesity. Even Sunday dinners that bring Italian families together can pose a health threat because pasta is a carbohydrate that acts like sugar in the body.\n\n\u201cCertain cultural food staples are not always ideal,\u201d Misra said. \u201cBut asking people to stop eating a food that has been a part of their family traditions for years doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Educating patients about portion control, nutrition labels and ways they can limit \u2014 not eliminate \u2014 certain foods from their diets are more effective strategies, she said.\n\nHome-Based Interventions\n\nHome-based interventions with specially trained bilingual community health workers can help low-income residents achieve their Type 2 diabetes goals, said Sofia Segura-Perez, associate director of the Center for Community Nutrition at the Hispanic Health Council in Hartford.\n\nIn a recent study, patients who were linked to community health workers successfully attained better blood glucose control. The workers provided education about nutrition, grocery shopping, medications, exercise and diabetes medical management, in addition to assisting with translation services and transportation to doctor visits. The HHC study was conducted in conjunction with the University of Connecticut and Hartford Hospital.\n\n\u201cCommunity workers can identify things at home that make it difficult for people to adhere to a regimen,\u201d said Segura-Perez. These include \u201csocial stressors\u201d such as lacking money to buy food, worrying about eviction, or raising grandchildren because the parents are absent. \u201cThese are things that the doctor doesn\u2019t see during an office visit.\u201d\n\nOther studies show that Hispanics who immigrated to the United States are at a greater risk of developing diabetes the longer they live in America. \u201cAcculturation seems to be another factor among Latinos that may impact their risk for diabetes,\u201d she said.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nExperts point to prevention and self-management initiatives underway to help stem the prevalence of diabetes. State health officials are working with the state Department on Aging to increase the use of diabetes self-management programs in community settings and to offer programs in Spanish and English.\n\nLocal organizations, such as YMCAs, are offering evidence-based intervention programs to reach at-risk residents. More health care systems are using health information technology to identify and track patients who would benefit from diabetes prevention and self-management education programs.\n\nSegura-Perez looks forward to a time when insurers cover home-based strategies that help diabetics avoid more costly complications such as hospitalizations and amputations.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that people will recognize the value of home-based interventions to the individual and society,\u201d she said.\n\nListen below to WNPR's Diane Orson talking with reporter Magaly Olivero about the disproportionate toll diabetes is taking on Hispanics and blacks in Connecticut:\n\nInformation on diabetes is available at these websites:\n\nConnecticut Department of Public Health (diabetes prevention and control program)\n\nAmerican Diabetes Association\n\nAmerican Diabetes Association, Connecticut Chapter\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (Diabetes Home page)\n\nThis story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team (c-hit.org).", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Connecticut\u2019s diabetes rate ranks lower than the national average, but Hispanics and African-Americans are more than twice as likely to have the disease", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/diabetes-takes-disproportionate-toll-hispanics-and-blacks-connecticut", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201501/6347508912_70eb94ea1c_o.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Connecticut\u2019s diabetes rate ranks lower than the national average, but Hispanics and African-Americans are more than twice as likely to have the disease", "title": "Diabetes Takes Disproportionate Toll on Hispanics and Blacks in Connecticut"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Magaly Olivero", "wordCount": 1767, "dc": {"title": "Diabetes Takes Disproportionate Toll on Hispanics and Blacks in Connecticut"}, "nid": 34660, "datePublished": "2015-01-20", "story_id": 378569066, "keywords": "Department of Public Health, health care, Connecticut, The Daily, disease", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Listen below to WNPR's Diane Orson talking with reporter Magaly Olivero about the disproportionate toll diabetes is taking on Hispanics and blacks in Connecticut:Information on diabetes is available at these websites:Connecticut Department of Public Health (diabetes prevention and control program)American Diabetes AssociationAmerican Diabetes Association, Connecticut ChapterCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (Diabetes Home page)This story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team (c-hit.org).\nAbout 95 percent of people with the disease have Type 2 diabetes, reports the American Diabetes Association.\nResearch shows some ethnic and racial groups are genetically predisposed to developing diabetes, including Hispanics, African-Americans, Asians and Native Americans.\nIn Connecticut, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to die from diabetes and experience higher rates of diabetes-related hospitalizations and amputations than whites, according to data from DPH.\nMore health care systems are using health information technology to identify and track patients who would benefit from diabetes prevention and self-management education programs."}
