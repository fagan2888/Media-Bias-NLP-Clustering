The Australian government warns of an ongoing threat of terrorism in Malaysia.

Australia has cautioned against visitors travelling to Malaysia's capital city amid speculation terrorists may be planning attacks in and around Kuala Lumpur.

In an online travel advisory posted on Sunday, the Australian government said there is an ongoing threat of terrorism in Malaysia, especially in major cities, with attacks likely to be indiscriminate and affecting locations frequented by Westerners.

Kuala Lumpur has not faced any prominent terror acts in recent years, but the country is on high alert after a Malay-speaking combat unit called Katibah Nusantara was linked to a series of explosions in Indonesia's capital Jakarta last month.

Formed in 2014, the extremist group covers the Malay Archipelago and has been actively connecting extremist networks across Malaysia and Indonesia—countries with massive Muslim populations—in an effort to help the Islamic State further its ideological goals.

Malaysian authorities have arrested several people allegedly involved in planning attacks, including against entertainment venues in Kuala Lumpur, the Australian government noted on Sunday's advisory.

Since 2013, the Malaysian police have arrested more than 150 suspected Islamic State followers, according to media reports.
