General Mills is recalling a couple of batches of its Pillsbury Cinnamon Rolls With Icing for safety reasons, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and company announced Saturday.

A company spokesman said the limited product recall was taken as a “precaution because the dough may contain fragments from a broken piece of plastic on the production line. These products are sold in grocery stores nationally. No other Pillsbury dough products are being recalled.”

The recall pertains to 8-count single and double packages of Pillsbury Cinnamon Rolls With Icing with the following date codes: Pillsbury Cinnamon Rolls with Icing (30OCT2013 and 31OCT2013) and Pillsbury Cinnamon Rolls with Icing 2-pack (18OCT2013, 26OCT2013 and 31OCT2013). The recall affects only 168 cases of the product.

The company notes, however, that Pillsbury Flaky Cinnamon Rolls and Pillsbury Grands! Cinnamon Rolls are not part of the recall. Consumers may receive a free replacement for any items returned under the recall and may contact the company toll-free at 1-800-775-4777.

Although the product recall applies to the U.S. only, international business accounts for approximately one-third of the company’s business, an increse over recent years. General Mills plans to introduce more than 200 new food products this year, including Hershey’s Cookies & Creme cereal, in addition to two flavors of its Nature Valley granola cereal. General Mills is one of the world's leading food manufacturers, operating in more than 100 countries and headquartered in Minneapolis, Minn.

No injuries have been reported due to the recalled products.
