It\u2019s had a real impact on people\u2019s lives to stay working and productive,\u201d Thompson said in a Friday interview.\n\nThe federal government will pay all costs of the program for the first three years, provided the program stays within a budget cap.\n\n\u201cIf we are over the estimated cap, we can renegotiate with the federal government the proposed growth in the program,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bailout. It was intended in the waiver of the contract.\u201d\n\nA waiver from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services allows an estimated 225,000 Arkansans earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level to use Medicaid money to buy private insurance. Arkansas is the first state to use the approach. More than 155,000 Arkansans have applied and been found eligible.\n\nAfter three years, the state will begin paying a portion of the cost of the program that will increase gradually to 10 percent in 2020.\n\nOpponents such as State Sen. Bryan King-R, Green Forest, have said that taxpayers are paying for the private option in any case, and that the total cost of the program is on track to run $100 million or more over budget by the end of the program\u2019s first year.\n\n\u201cThe waiver renegotiation is a misleading term for a bailout from the federal government,\u201d King said Monday.\n\nKing said the $100 million figure was drawn using the initial actuarial cost estimate of $437 per month per person from the state-hired actuarial firm Optumus. Largely because of a higher average age of those enrolled, 39 instead of the projected 37, that figure has since risen $24 per person. King and several other state legislators have called for a new cost analysis.\n\nMax Greenwood, spokeswoman for Arkansas BlueCross BlueShield, said Monday it was difficult to come up with an actuarial estimate because \u201cit was a new population that hasn\u2019t been insured and there was no data.\u201d\n\nCraig Wilson, director of Access to Quality Care for the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement, says the waiver anticipates demographic differences to adjust the waiver cap from $477.63 per member per month, \u201cwhich protects the state from cost differences from estimated versus actual.\u201d\n\nInitial estimates of the program\u2019s price tag were made with three variables in mind \u201cfor which there was no good source of information,\u201d Thompson said, including the inability to work pre-existing conditions into the formula. The Affordable Care Act required \u201ccomplete essential health benefit plans,\u201d the surgeon general added.\n\nKing said he felt that Optumus \u201cpurposefully low-balled the figures\u201d to get the private option passed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s misleading, and they\u2019re wanting to spend federal money that the federal government doesn\u2019t have,\u201d King said.\n\nThe Arkansas Insurance Department eliminated dental care benefits from the private option for adults next year in an effort to control spending. However, dental will continue to be a benefit option on the Arkansas HealthConnector insurance exchange, said Heather Haywood, state Insurance Department spokeswoman.\n\nA medical loss ratio report from health insurance carriers will be done at the end of the calendar year and will better inform legislators of any overage that could be experienced.\n\n\u201cIf they owe the state money back, there is no override whatsoever and we actually are well underneath the cap,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThis is the first time this has been done in the United States. We\u2019re in a transition period.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wilson, the baseline number for any projection of state risk for any overages not associated with demographic differences would be from the $477 waiver cap, not the $436 projection from early 2013.\n\n\u201cThere is no other alternative to the Private Option that has been offered by anyone,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nSlashing the private option and not expanding Medicaid would void any insurance policies obtained.\n\nAccording to an April report from the Department of Human Services, expenditures associated with the private option slightly exceed budget targets but will fall within the targets when allowable adjustments are made. Rep. John Burris, R-Harrison, is one of the architects of the private option. He has said he is confident that insurance premiums will continue to drop and that Arkansas will not have to pay any of the costs for the program\u2019s first three years.\n\nAlthough initial reports from an Arkansas Hospital Association survey indicate uninsured hospital visits are down 24 percent over last year, only about half of the state\u2019s 83 acute-care hospitals responded.\n\nFort Smith\u2019s two acute-care hospitals, Sparks Health System and Mercy Fort Smith, did not take part in the state survey. Donna Bragg, director of communications for Sparks, said the survey was sent to the Sparks CEO during a transition period and was not directed to the correct department.\n\nAvailable data from Sparks\u2019 parent company, Community Health Systems, however, indicate the survey is representative among the 29 states it serves that expanded Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though an Arkansas Hospital Association survey shows a marked decrease in emergency room visits and hospitalizations by uninsured patients, it is too early to tell exactly how much the state will owe, if anything, for the early years of the state\u2019s politicized \u201cprivate option.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lovett Times Record &#8226; jlovett@swtimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "Times Record", "description": "Though an Arkansas Hospital Association survey shows a marked decrease in emergency room visits and hospitalizations by uninsured patients, it is too early to tell exactly how much the state will owe, if anything, for the early years of the state\u2019s politicized \u201cprivate option.\u201d", "title": "Arkansas Surgeon General: Private Option \u2018Critical Lifeline\u2019 For Health Care Providers", "url": "http://swtimes.com/news/state-news/arkansas-surgeon-general-private-option-critical-lifeline-health-care-providers", "image": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_joe-thompson2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/news/state-news/arkansas-surgeon-general-private-option-critical-lifeline-health-care-providers", "image": {"src": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_joe-thompson2.jpg, http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_King_b_0.jpg, http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_copy_CraigWilsonFF_0.jpg"}, "creator": "@timesrecord", "description": "Though an Arkansas Hospital Association survey shows a marked decrease in emergency room visits and hospitalizations by uninsured patients, it is too early to tell exactly how much the state will owe, if anything, for the early years of the state\u2019s politicized \u201cprivate option.\u201d", "title": "Arkansas Surgeon General: Private Option \u2018Critical Lifeline\u2019 For Health Care Providers"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1038006", "app_name": "swtimes", "package": "com.stephensmedia.timesrecord"}, "ios": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1038006", "app_store_id": 964468128, "app_name": "swtimes"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964468128", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.timesrecord", "keywords": "State News,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-21T04:35:07-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "The Arkansas Insurance Department eliminated dental care benefits from the private option for adults next year in an effort to control spending.\n\u201cThere is no other alternative to the Private Option that has been offered by anyone,\u201d Wilson said.\nKing said he felt that Optumus \u201cpurposefully low-balled the figures\u201d to get the private option passed.\nRep.
