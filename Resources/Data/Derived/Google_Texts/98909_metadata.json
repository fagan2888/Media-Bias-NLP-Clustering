The hospital waited more than the required amount of time before suing the county, it stated.\n\n\"Despite repeated reassurances from the county that AVH would receive its fair share of funding, our hospital has been all but forgotten by the county \u2013 in favor of those hospitals that are closer to the county seat,\" Petrik said in a statement. \"Litigation is not our first choice, but all other avenues have been exhausted.\"\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nMeasure B generates an estimated $256 million in revenue a year.\n\nThe hospital should be receiving at least $12 million of those funds, according to the hospital. It is currently being reimbursed slightly over $1 million a year, it stated.\n\nThe 420-bed Antelope Valley Hospital, in northern Los Angeles County, is a Level II trauma center. The shortage of trauma funds leaves AV Hospital underfunded, hospital officials said earlier this year.\n\nTwitter: @HenryPowderly", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/antelope-valley-hospital-sues-los-angeles-county-over-measure-b-trauma-funds", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/antelope-valley-hospital-facebook-feature.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Antelope Valley Hospital has the second highest volume of emergency patients in the county, yet receives less than one-half of 1 percent of Measure B property tax funds meant for trauma centers and emergency medical services.", "title": "Antelope Valley Hospital sues Los Angeles County over Measure B trauma funds"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/antelope-valley-hospital-facebook-feature.png"}, "description": "Antelope Valley Hospital has the second highest volume of emergency patients in the county, yet receives less than one-half of 1 percent of Measure B property tax funds meant for trauma centers and emergency medical services.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Antelope Valley Hospital sues Los Angeles County over Measure B trauma funds"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, California has followed through on a threat and has sued Los Angeles County and its board of supervisors for misallocation of Measure B trauma funds, according to a statement from the hospital.&#13; Antelope Valley Hospital has the second highest volume of emergency patients in the county, yet receives less than one-half of 1 percent of Measure B property tax funds meant for trauma centers and emergency medical services, it stated.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd151a\"", "article_summary": "Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, California has followed through on a threat and has sued Los Angeles County and its board of supervisors for misallocation of Measure B trauma funds, according to a statement from the hospital.\nThe shortage of trauma funds leaves AV Hospital underfunded, hospital officials said earlier this year.\nThe 420-bed Antelope Valley Hospital, in northern Los Angeles County, is a Level II trauma center.\n[Also: Tracking 2015 mergers and acquisitions]In the lawsuit filed Sept. 15, Antelope Valley Hospital claims Los Angeles County has failed to properly administer and allocate billions of dollars in Measure B revenue.\nThe hospital should be receiving at least $12 million of those funds, according to the hospital."}
