Researchers at Emory University believe there is a connection between the size of a man’s testicles and how actively he participates in his child’s life.

The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, looked at the relationship between testicle size and fatherhood in 70 men who had young children.

Researchers performed brain scans while the men were shown pictures of their children, and found that men with smaller testicles tended to have a more positive response to images of their children than men with larger testicles. According to the study, men with small testicles registered three times the response in the “reward” area of the brain than other men.
