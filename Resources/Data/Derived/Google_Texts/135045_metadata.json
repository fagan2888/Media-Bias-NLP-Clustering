Sunderland\u2019s Lee Cattermole tried pushing the United captain out of the way, but the ball struck Rooney\u2019s knee and went in.\n\nThe strike ended Rooney\u2019s 11-match goal drought for the club in the league, and also took him level with Denis Law as United\u2019s joint-third leading league scorer with 171 goals.\n\nUnited kept looking for a third and Depay wasted a clear chance in a one-on-one with Costel Pantilimon, with the 21-year-old winger sending his shot straight at the Sunderland keeper.\n\nMata fared a lot better, though, driving home Ashley Young\u2019s cross in the final minute to spark chants of \u201cWe are top of the league\u201d from the Stretford End.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Memphis Depay scored his first ever Premier League goal and Wayne Rooney added his first of the season as Manchester United beat Sunderland 3-0 to go top of the standings on Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Memphis Depay scored his first ever Premier League goal and Wayne Rooney added his first of the season as Manchester United beat Sunderland 3-0 to go top of the standings on Saturday.", "title": "Rooney on target as Manchester United beats Sunderland 3-0", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/26/rooney-on-target-as-manchester-united-beats-sunder/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/504118314dbe1f2b830f6a706700752b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/504118314dbe1f2b830f6a706700752b.jpg", "description": "Memphis Depay scored his first ever Premier League goal and Wayne Rooney added his first of the season as Manchester United beat Sunderland 3-0 to go top of the standings on Saturday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Rooney on target as Manchester United beats Sunderland 3-0"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "MANCHESTER, England (AP) - Memphis Depay scored his first ever Premier League goal and Wayne Rooney added his first of the season as Manchester United beat Sunderland 3-0 to go top of the standings on Saturday.\nSunderland\u2019s Lee Cattermole tried pushing the United captain out of the way, but the ball struck Rooney\u2019s knee and went in.\nUnited applied plenty of early pressure and eventually found a way through in the fourth minute of first-half stoppage time.\nThe result left United top and Sunderland still bottom of the table.\nUnited kept looking for a third and Depay wasted a clear chance in a one-on-one with Costel Pantilimon, with the 21-year-old winger sending his shot straight at the Sunderland keeper."}
