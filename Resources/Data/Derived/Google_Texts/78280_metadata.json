Goodell\u2019s report included an interview with the President. The interview provides a window into central features of Barack Obama\u2019s politics and policies.\n\nStyle Over Substance\n\nThe thin stuff of the trip was evident from the outset. Sum total of new initiatives announced during the visit: we now get to call Mt. McKinley Denali again (what the indigenous locals always called it, and already the name of the national park over which it towers); construction of a new icebreaker for the Coast Guard (aimed at narrowing the hysterical icebreaker gap with the Russians), and some Native Alaskan villages received the promise of a few million dollars in federal assistance to relocate away from the rising Arctic Ocean.\n\nAs Obama \u2014 the first sitting president to visit the Arctic \u2014 admitted, the trip was primarily about the symbolism of presidential witness to melting glaciers and warming permafrost. \u201cPart of the reason why I wanted to take this trip was to start making it a little more visceral and to highlight for people that this is not a distant problem that we can keep putting off,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that we have to tackle right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cClimate change is no longer some far-off problem; it is happening here, it is happening now,\u201d Obama said on the trip\u2019s first day. In \u201cperhaps the starkest language he has ever used in public,\u201d thinks Goodell, Obama warned that without urgent action, \u201cwe will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair: submerged countries, abandoned cities, fields no longer growing.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not moving fast enough,\u201d was the president\u2019s mantra (cited four times in a 24-minute speech; an aide told Goodell the repetition was off script).\n\nWho today doesn\u2019t get climate change in their guts, bones and sinews? Doesn\u2019t see it as mere real and present danger but as rapidly emerging catastrophe? Forest fires burning up vast expanses of the West and Alaska, simultaneous droughts and deluges from California to the Southeast, hurricanes and blizzards barreling up and down the Atlantic Seaboard, the strongest storm ever hitting the Mexican Pacific coast. Springs arriving ever earlier, summers growing ever hotter, winters swinging wildly back and forth between historically mild and record-breaking cold and snow. The most timid \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist\u201d politicians, climate skeptics, even deniers understand this, regardless of their public statements. Twenty years ago it was fair to say there\u2019d be no serious action on climate change until the threats moved from remote to people\u2019s doorsteps. Put out the welcome mat.\n\nObama\u2019s crew pointed to an additional reason for the trip: to \u201cbuild momentum for a meaningful deal at the international climate talks in Paris.\u201d \u201cThe president is entirely focused on this goal,\u201d one of his aides told Goodell. \u201cIf you think about who has been in the forefront of pushing global climate action forward, nobody is in Obama\u2019s league,\u201d declared John Podesta, former special adviser to the president now chair of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Goodell quotes another informant as having heard Obama claim recently: \u201cI\u2019m dragging the world behind me to Paris.\u201d\n\nGoodell left Podesta and Obama\u2019s claims unchallenged. There are literally millions of activists around the world far out in front of the president on climate change. While realizing that it\u2019s reckless to burn every last nugget of coal and barrel of oil, the president does not, for example, demand that the world leave 80% of the remaining fossil fuels in the ground. Not a fair comparison? What of prior presidents? It doesn\u2019t take much to best the energy and climate policies of Ronald Reagan, the two George Bushes or Bill Clinton, the other guys in charge during the Age of Climate Change. What of other heads of state? Most Western European executives are bolder than Obama (to say nothing of the leaders of small island states).\n\nThis is not to deny the president some climate credit. He intervened at Copenhagen (bursting into a meeting of BRICS leaders to which he had not been invited) to some (problematic) effect, used the bailout of the automakers to leverage an increase in fuel efficiency, and directed considerable sums \u2014 by historical standards \u2014 of Recovery Act monies toward clean energy investments. But following the modest start, as admitted by one of his aides, Obama put climate change on the back burner during the rest of his first term to focus on health care reform.\n\nHe came roaring back, we\u2019re told by the aide, in his 2013 inaugural address: \u201cWe, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity. We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.\u201d By June of that year, Obama introduced a decent if unremarkable Climate Action Plan. He took some modest steps on HFCs and methane. With the help of Podesta, the president (finally) launched a series of executive actions in 2014 designed to circumvent the climate deniers and Obama haters in Congress. There\u2019s last year\u2019s unprecedented (if underwhelming and uncertain) deal with China\u2014which addressed the \u2018why take action if the Chinese won\u2019t\u2019 question and made progress at the global climate talks in Paris in December more likely. Then there\u2019s the Clean Power Plan \u2014 challenged by Red State governors \u2014 that relies on the EPA\u2019s authority under the Clean Air Act to reduce power plant C0 2 emissions thirty two percent by 2030 (essentially foreclosing construction of new coal-fired plants).\n\nBut dragging the world to Paris? Obama committed the US to 26-28% reductions in greenhouse gases from 2005 levels by 2025 \u2014 with no consideration for how the cuts affect global mean temperature increases, the real measure of seriousness. Compare that to the European Union\u2019s promise for 40% cuts from 1990 levels by 2050 (also surely not enough to prevent further catastrophe).\n\n\u201cThe science keeps on telling us,\u201d admits Obama, \u201cwe\u2019re just not acting fast enough.\u201d A primary obstacle to acting faster is Obama\u2019s own \u201call of the above\u201d energy policy. The president opened new areas of the Gulf of Mexico to drilling (after most of the anger and some of the hurt over BP\u2019s blowout disaster subsided). Obama subsidized the fraud that is \u201cclean coal,\u201d leased vast expanses of the West for further coal mining at fire sale prices, and failed to ban mountain top removal mining. He kept the nuclear reactor industry on life support with approval of and massive financial support for a new plant, and left it to \u201cthe market\u201d to shutter several old nukes.\n\nHis administration bolstered fracking for oil and gas in shale formations across the country, and in a stunning failure of responsibility overlooked the legal exemptions engineered by Bush and Cheney that make the practice possible. He finally killed the Keystone XL pipeline after TransCanada withdrew its permit application, and Hillary Clinton came out against it. Obama permitted Shell to drill in the frigid depths of the Chukchi Sea seventy-five miles off the Alaskan coast (a decision Al Gore called \u201cinsane;\u201d Shell called it quits for now after failing to find much oil). To top it off, the president visited the oil patch when gasoline prices soared in 2012 to boast about the vast increases in fossil fuel production his policies stimulated (an eight year high to that point).\n\nObama in New Mexico, March 21, 2012. Source: Jason Reed/Reuters\n\nReady for Action\n\nGoodell\u2019s interview with the president lays bare what\u2019s fundamentally flawed about the Obama approach to politics, and to his climate change politics in particular. The president wisely does not toot his own horn: \u201cwe have made modest progress, but nowhere near what we need to do.\u201d He lamented his early failure to pass cap-and-trade, a system that turns pollution into a commodity, and that has been limited thus far in the US to slowly reducing carbon emissions in a couple of multi-state electricity-generating sectors. The president takes credit for reducing the carbon intensity of the economy (a measure of carbon emissions per unit of economic activity), and for \u201cdoubling the production of clean energy\u201d (although in the race for green power, UN climate chief Christiana Figueres says the US \u201cis actually playing catch-up to China\u201d).\n\n\u201cMy attitude,\u201d Obama claims, \u201cis that if we get the structure right, then we can turn the dials as there\u2019s additional public education, not just in the United States but across the world, and people feel a greater urgency about it and there\u2019s more political will to act.\u201d This ignores the twenty years of growing public concern in the US, based on increased understanding of the science and politics of climate change, reflected in public opinion polls and other data. See, for example, the work of political psychologist Jon Krosnick (Figure 1). Publics around the world were ready for action already in 2007, prior to Obama\u2019s presidency (see Figure 2). \u201cGreater urgency\u201d and \u201cpolitical will\u201d are generated by social movements not by presidents on junkets hobbled by obstructionists and by lack of imagination and fortitude (about which more below).\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nSource: National survey of American public opinion on global warming via Jon Krosnick, Stanford University. Copied from http://grist.org/\n\nFIGURE 2\n\nSource: Poll Finds Worldwide Agreement That Climate Change is a Threat (2007)\n\nDrill Baby Drill\n\nWhen challenged about his strenuous efforts to boost dirty energy production \u2014 indistinguishable from earlier occupants of the White House \u2014 the president said:\n\n\u201cThis has been an ongoing conversation that I\u2019ve had with the environmental community. One of the things about being president is you\u2019re never starting from scratch, you\u2019ve got all these legacies that you wrestle with. And obviously, the fossil-fuel economy is deeply entrenched in the structure of everybody\u2019s lives around the world. And so from the start, I\u2019ve always talked about a transition that is not going to happen overnight.\u201d\n\nOf course there are \u201clegacies,\u201d and transitions do not \u201chappen overnight.\u201d No one claims otherwise. No one doubts that the fossil fuel economy is \u201cdeeply entrenched:\u201d all the more reason to place it on a very strict, steadily shrinking diet as quickly as possible. Increasing dirty energy supplies such that the industry is now looking to overturn crude oil export restrictions and to build liquefied natural gas export terminals \u2014 as we\u2019ve seen during the Obama years \u2014 only makes the transition longer and more difficult.\n\n\u201cAnd regardless of how urgent I think the science is, if I howl at the moon without being able to build a political consensus behind me, it\u2019s not going to get done. And in fact, we end up potentially marginalizing supporters or people who recognize there\u2019s a need to act but also have some real interests at stake.\u201d\n\nThe president \u2018s fear of failure \u2014 lone \u201chowl[ing] at the moon\u201d and \u201cmarginalizing supporters\u201d \u2014 got in the way of a full bore campaign to confront the urgency of climate change. His fear of failure led to actual failure to mobilize the public.\n\nObama\u2019s belief that he needs \u201cconsensus\u201d to succeed (a claim he returns to repeatedly throughout the interview), and the nature of that consensus, is critical on several levels. He sees climate policy through a politics-as-usual lens. The president thinks he can build political consensus for climate action in the way he built a \u201cconsensus\u201d for Obamacare: by dropping the optimal approach (Medicare for all) in advance of negotiations, and then buying off the remaining opposition. Avoid directly confronting the major players (the fossil fuel industry in this case). Then give them what they need to sign on (access to coal, oil and gas). On climate, however, there\u2019s nothing to agree to. The oil and gas industry gets what it wants without paying any price whatsoever.\n\nThen there\u2019s political arithmetic. By \u201cpolitical consensus\u201d Obama also means congressional majorities sufficient to overcome opposition to strong action. Obstruction-proof political majorities are relatively rare quantities that don\u2019t build themselves. Decisive majorities only occur amidst powerful social movements (think New Deal coalition or Great Society bloc). They are a fragile legacy of significant sociopolitical change forged by masses in the streets.\n\nHis concern for potential supporters who might be turned off by howling at the moon misses the fact that global consensus already existed in December 2005 over three years prior to Obama\u2019s presidency (see Figure 3). As to the \u201creal interests at stake:\u201d Every living thing on the planet has real interests at stake, not just those who make livings from fossil fuels (about which more below).\n\nFigure 3\n\nSource: 30-Country Poll Finds Worldwide Consensus that Climate Change is a Serious Problem\n\nGoodell too pushed back on the question of consensus: \u201cthe warming of the planet is not waiting for consensus building.\u201d Obama responded that to \u201cget our arms around this problem,\u201d\n\n\u201c[W]e are going to have to take into account the fact that the average American right now, even if they\u2019ve gotten past climate denial, is still much more concerned about gas prices, getting back and forth from work, than they are about the climate changing. And if we are not strategic about how we talk about the issue and work with all the various stakeholders on this issue, then what will happen is that this will be demagogued and we will find ourselves in a place where we actually have slower progress rather than faster progress.\u201d\n\nPeople are today not worried about gasoline prices, at their lowest since 2009. They\u2019re back to buying gas-guzzlers. Part of the problem is with surveys of the sort that give Obama this impression. Unless pollsters ask these questions on days with a climate chaos-inspired fire out back or deluge overhead, or ask questions about specific mitigation or resilience actions to take, respondents will have other priorities. Of course people are worried about declining standards of living, about making it to their next paycheck having gone years without raises that keep pace with inflation. How could it be otherwise given corporate and government policies of recent decades?\n\nA more serious part of the problem is with the president\u2019s thinking. There have always been and will always be demagogues trying to derail progress of any kind, climate included. There\u2019s a whole denial industry supporting them. The Merchants of Doubt have been peddling their wares for a long time. Obama is pusillanimous is his \u201cstrategic\u201d responses to them. An overabundance of concern for \u201call the various stakeholders,\u201d stinginess with his political capital, and the president\u2019s spotty climate leadership also stand in the way of faster progress.\n\n\u201cSo the science doesn\u2019t change. The urgency doesn\u2019t change. But part of my job is to figure out what\u2019s my fastest way . . . to get to a point where we\u2019ve got a clean-energy economy. And somebody who is not involved in politics may say, \u201cWell, the shortest line between two points is just a straight line; let\u2019s just go straight to it.\u201d Well, unfortunately, in a democracy, I may have to zig and zag occasionally, and take into account very real concerns and interests. I think one of the failures that we had in the cap-and-trade legislation that came up early in my first term . . . was that we hadn\u2019t built enough of the consensus that was required to get that done.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s own weak leadership and the arrogance of his counselors increased the need for compromise with \u201cvery real concerns and interests,\u201d especially after squandering two years of Democratic majorities in Congress. Obama and his team stepped into the Oval Office in January 2009 thinking they could work with Republicans despite all evidence to the contrary, a strategic blunder of gargantuan proportions.\n\nNo Guts No Glory\n\nGoodell pressed him about the failure of cap-and-trade: \u201cit passed the House, and many people think that with a little more muscle, you could have gotten it through the Senate.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I think that our democratic process is painfully slow \u2014 even when you\u2019ve got Democratic majorities. And this is an issue that, although overwhelmingly Democrats are on the right side of, it\u2019s not easy for every Democrat, and it\u2019s not uniform. And when you\u2019ve got a filibuster in the Senate, you\u2019ve got challenges. I think the biggest problem we had was folks like John McCain, who had come out in favor of a cap-and-trade system, getting caught up in a feverish opposition to anything I proposed and reversing themselves \u2014 which meant that getting the numbers that we needed was going to be too difficult. And we probably should have moved faster to a nonlegislative strategy, but I don\u2019t think that there was some magic recipe whereby we could have gotten cap-and-trade through the Senate without some Republican support. We needed 60 votes. That\u2019s the way the filibuster operates there. This is similar to the discussions I have with progressives sometimes when they say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you have a trillion-dollar stimulus instead of an $800 billion stimulus?\u201d And you try to explain, well, this was significantly larger than the New Deal; it was the largest stimulus ever, but I had to get the votes of a couple of Republicans in order to get it done. Or folks who want single-payer health care instead of Obamacare. We had political constraints. Now, what this tells us, generally, is that those who, rightly, see this as the issue of our time have to take politics into account and have to be strategic in terms of how we frame the issues, and we have to make sure that we\u2019re bringing the public along with us. There\u2019s been good work done in terms of public education over the last several years. I think surveys show that the American people understand this is an urgent problem. But it isn\u2019t yet at the point where they consider it the most important problem, and it\u2019s not even close.\u201d\n\nObama sounds realistic and reasonable when explaining his failures. What\u2019s missing from the simplistic vote counting is an analysis of what might have been, the accomplishments possible were he a fighter worthy of his opponents. What if Obama had gone all in on an ambitious legislative strategy, some package considerably more comprehensive and far-reaching than cap-and-trade? Had he lost (a distinct possibility), the discussion still would\u2019ve advanced further, better policy options would\u2019ve emerged that could later re-emerge, the movement would\u2019ve been energized.\n\nObama should\u2019ve moved to a non-legislative strategy even before his inauguration, rather than wait until his signature bill unraveled and his wrongheaded attempts to work with Republicans collapsed several years later. (I was party to the writing of several environmental executive orders for Eliot Spitzer in New York in the autumn of 2006 immediately after his election; one became part of his first budget \u2014 showing the interaction of legislative and executive strategies \u2014 and another was adopted by his successor, David Paterson). Despite admitting single payer was superior to the alternatives, the president never put forward Medicare for All. He couldn\u2019t even be bothered to fight for the frequently promised \u201cpublic option\u201d in Obamacare. On these issues as on so many others, the administration negotiated with itself based on analyses of \u201cconstraints\u201d that precluded in advance proposals worthy of struggle.\n\nThe president had more to say about the \u201cinterests at stake:\u201d\n\n\u201cAlaska, I think, is a fascinating example of that. We\u2019ve been having conversations with Alaska Natives who are seeing their way of life impacted adversely because of climate change, but also have a real interest in generating jobs and economic development in depressed areas. And so they\u2019ll talk to me about climate change and in the same breath say, \u201cBy the way, we really are looking to use our natural resources in a way that can spur on economic development.\u201d And that\u2019s just a microcosm of what\u2019s true across America and what\u2019s true around the world.\u201d\n\nThere is no single Alaska Native (or any other) voice on \u201ceconomic development\u201d \u201cacross America\u201d or \u201caround the world.\u201d At the same time, people dependent on extractive industries with no alternatives will naturally prefer further resource exploitation to unemployment, hunger, and homelessness. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to replace the declining number of jobs in fossil fuels and minerals with well-paying green jobs. The shift was imperative even before the adverse impacts of climate change became evident.\n\n\u201cSo my strategy has been to use every lever that we have available to move the clean-energy agenda forward faster, which then reduces the costs of transition for everybody \u2014 in fact, in many cases, saves people money and saves businesses money \u2014 so that we\u2019re reducing what is perceived as a contradiction between economic development and saving the planet . . .\u201d\n\nLater in the interview he said, \u201call of this makes me feel that I have to tackle this every way that I can,\u201d and \u201cI do what I can do and as much as I can do.\u201d This is clearly not so. The lack of imagination lurking behind these statements is stunning. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for the now unavoidable consequences of carbon pollution ought to have been a component of darned near every policy, pretty much every speech. The list of climate friendly executive actions not taken (both formal and informal) is very long. The president\u2019s failure to see climate policy as unique, unprecedented, all encompassing is one of the greatest tragedies of the Obama era.\n\nThe potentially most powerful lever didn\u2019t even follow him to the White House. His first campaign mobilized hundreds of thousands of eager and excited (if naive) supporters who were dropped after November 2008 as if they had communicable diseases. Obama intentionally failed to keep his campaign running, to use the energy and smarts of young people and other fired up Democratic voters (especially African-Americans and single women) to push a progressive agenda in DC.\n\nObama voters got instead White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel calling progressive activists \u201cfucking retards\u201d and Press Secretary Robert Gibbs\u2019 jab at \u201cthe professional left.\u201d They held these attitudes while managing a years-long, astonishingly misguided attempt to work with Republicans in Congress who had sworn an oath to Obama\u2019s political destruction. Republicans like Mitch McConnell whose top priority for the 2010 midterms was to limit Obama to a single term, and like those in the House with its fifty some votes to repeal Obamacare. The president and his men were so arrogant, so confident of their ability to get their way with Congress without a strong movement behind them, that they stumbled from one political defeat to the next during the first term. The proposal for and collapse of a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with John Boehner (for which the 99% should feel deeply grateful) was the ultimate symbol of the president\u2019s failed politics and vision.\n\nThere was no guarantee of course that even with a red hot movement behind him that Obama could\u2019ve moved climate mountains during his first term. But he didn\u2019t even try. The president got bogged down instead trying to placate overblown conservative concerns about deficits in the wake of the Great Recession. \u201cThe science keeps telling us we\u2019re just not acting fast enough.\u201d The missed opportunities were monumental. The country got \u201cno drama Obama\u201d when the historical moment demanded a transformational figure.\n\nWhy Movements Matter\n\nThe president\u2019s disingenuous \u201crealism\u201d about the world\u2019s continued dependence on fossil fuels is coupled here to his confusion regarding the need for and nature of political consensus.\n\n\u201c[Since] there\u2019s still going to be some energy production taking place, let\u2019s find those areas that are going to be least likely to disturb precious ecosystems, and let\u2019s raise the standards \u2014 meaning making them more costly \u2014 but not shut them off completely, and that allows me then to have a conversation not with folks who are climate deniers, and not with folks who are adamant about their right to drill, explore and extract anywhere, anytime, but with those folks who are of two minds about the issue. And I think that process is something that we have to take into account even when something is really important. Even when something threatens us all, we have to bring everybody along. We had the same discussion around something like fracking. The science tells us that if done properly, fracking risks can be minimized. And natural gas is a fossil fuel, but the reason we\u2019re not seeing coal-fired plants being built in the United States is not just because of the clean-power-plant rule \u2014 because we just put that in place. The reason is it wasn\u2019t economical because natural gas was so cheap. And we have to make those choices.\u201d\n\nNo one disputes the need for continued use of some fossil fuels. The disputes arise over which fuels to burn, how much to burn, and for how long to burn. Obama slyness about the need for \u201csome energy production\u201d obscures his administration\u2019s generosity towards the dirty energy industry, and his failure to design a transition with strict timetables away from carbon.\n\nContrary to the president\u2019s claim, the science tells us fracking is inherently dangerous to human and ecosystem health. \u201cThose choices\u201d between coal and natural gas are false. Natural gas would be the bridge fuel to further climate destabilization even without the problem of methane leaks. Most fossil fuels reserves, the \u201cscience tells us,\u201d must be left in the ground (a fact acknowledged elsewhere by the president). Cheap natural gas (which really isn\u2019t that cheap for residential customers) only postpones the transition to a carbon free future. Where\u2019s the \u201cmoon shot\u201d mentality? What happened to the \u201cfierce urgency of now\u201d?\n\nContrary to the president\u2019s other claim, we don\u2019t ever \u201chave to bring everybody along,\u201d especially not when that \u201csomething is really important,\u201d when that \u201csomething threatens us all.\u201d Obama finally understands he can\u2019t convert climate deniers but he fails to understand he doesn\u2019t need to convert all that many if any \u201cfolks who are of two minds about the issue.\u201d The misunderstanding, if that\u2019s what it is (it could instead be an excuse for achievements far short of what\u2019s needed), is incomprehensible for a president who wrote his senior thesis about the Nuclear Freeze movement, and who says elsewhere in the interview: \u201cHistorically, politics catch up when the public cares deeply.\u201d The Freeze movement pulled off the largest demonstration in American history in New York\u2019s Central Park in 1982. The Freeze movement and allied movements overseas, whose activists never made up more than a few percent of their populations, changed public opinion, political party programs, political institutions, political culture, and arms control negotiating strategies. They helped bring about the world\u2019s first nuclear disarmament agreement. The women\u2019s movement, the civil rights movement, the environmental movement and a host of others have similar records.\n\nReal change is possible despite the ongoing, powerful opposition of warmongers, misogynists, racists, and planet despoilers. Major reforms require sometimes decades long campaigns by relatively few citizens (with no assurance of success) to move the levers of power. The more the merrier, to be sure. Positive change would come faster. But that\u2019s not the way politics work. Someone should send the president a poster with the Margaret Mead quote for an Oval Office wall. Public opinion is already on the side of those who would rapidly phase out fossil fuels for renewables. Climate justice movements grow rapidly in the US and around the world. Obama need only embrace them, and follow their lead.\n\nPresidents are held responsible for job creation and loss during their tenure. This partly explains their readiness to embrace new ventures like fracking, and to rescue drowning white elephants like nuclear power.\n\n\u201c[W]e approved a nuclear plant down South. And there are some environmentalists who don\u2019t like that either. But while acknowledging the risks that we saw in Fukushima, we also have to acknowledge that if we\u2019re going to solve climate change, energy is going to have to come from somewhere for a lot of these countries.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what underwriting a new nuke in Georgia has to do with energy provision \u201cfor a lot of these countries.\u201d The new reactors would not be possible without a $6.5 billion loan guarantee from the federal government; Wall Street won\u2019t go near the nuclear power industry on its own. Energy poverty \u2014 a serious problem in the Global South \u2014 is most acute in those countries with the greatest solar potential. If Obama\u2019s \u201call of the above\u201d approach is really about creating jobs, those are to be had more abundantly in clean energy sectors than in dirty.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s always this balance. And I see this even in other issues. When I came into office, I was clear about wanting to end \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d A lot of people said, \u201cWell, why not just end it right away?\u201d And I took two years to build a consensus within the Pentagon so that by the time we actually ended it, it was something that had the support of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and that made it a lot easier to get done.\u201d\n\nThe gays-in-the-military analogy is inapt. As important as ending legal anti-gay bigotry in the armed services was, it\u2019s not the same as pushing a strong climate agenda. There was no \u201cconsensus\u201d in the Pentagon at the time (most officers and enlisted personnel were against gays serving openly, and likely still are), though of course it helped to have the chairman on board. If there\u2019s any place where authoritarianism is appropriate it\u2019s the military, and yet the president moved cautiously. Obama sees social change as slow and incremental, even when it doesn\u2019t have to be. Indeed, that is the only pace possible when failing to ally with the power of the people. The president\u2019s perspective ignores critical episodes in American (and world) history when change came more quickly.\n\nCapitalism and Contentment\n\nGoodell asked Obama about the pope\u2019s climate change encyclical, and whether \u201cthe basic tenets of capitalism . . . require rethinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at human history, it is indisputable that market-based systems have produced more wealth than any other system in human history by a factor of \u2014 you choose the number. And that has been, net, a force for good. In our own lives, you think about the changes in the standard of living that have taken place here in the United States. Then you think about hundreds of millions of people who have been lifted out of poverty in China or in India \u2014 and you can\u2019t scoff at that. If a child has enough food to eat, if they have medicine that prevents deadly diseases, if people have a roof over their heads and can afford to send their kids to school, that is part of justice and part of my ethics. And so I think a broadside against the entire market-based system would be a mistake. What I do think is true is that mindless free-market ideologies that ignore the externalities that any capitalist system produces can cause massive problems. And it\u2019s the job of governments and societies to round the edges and to address big system failures. That, by the way, is not controversial among market economists . . . And pollution has always been the classic market failure, where externalities are not captured and the system doesn\u2019t deal with them . . . So our goal here has to be to say that climate change is a major market failure, just like smog in Los Angeles was back in the Sixties and Seventies, just like the problems with polluted waters were in the Cuyahoga River. And just as we were able to use the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act to clean up those waters and to clean up that air, just as we were able to solve the acid-rain problem and the growing problem with ozone with some smart regulations, we can do that with climate change. The difference is that those previous pollution problems were more or less localized, and you weren\u2019t seeing the possibility of a global feedback loop that tips us over the edge. So there is a race against time here that we haven\u2019t seen before, but the nature of the problem is not that different. And I think that the way we solve any big market failure is to have a broad-based conversation and to come to a collective agreement that this is something we\u2019re going to take into account in our day-to-day doing business. And when we do that, businesses will find ways to profit from it, jobs will be created. We\u2019re already seeing that when it comes to the solar industry. We\u2019re seeing that when it comes to the wind industry. And we\u2019re seeing that consumers are interested in saving money and using less electricity. So I am optimistic about us being able to solve this problem. But it is going to require that our politics catches [sic] up with the facts. And right now, in this country, our politics is going through a particularly broken period \u2014 Congress has trouble passing a transportation bill, much less solving big problems like this. That\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019re having to do so much action, administratively. And that\u2019s part of the reason why I took this trip.\u201d\n\nObama and Marx (and everyone else) are in agreement about the productive power of capitalism. But the narrow focus on \u201cexternalities\u201d obscures some of the most vicious inherent qualities of American corporate capitalism: exploitation, wage slavery, monopolistic pressures, business cycles\u2019 waste of human talent, commodification of everything, and all the rest of the necessary evils.\n\nIt\u2019s a serious mistake to equate tackling climate change with reducing acid rain (the effects of which are still felt) and stabilizing atmospheric ozone (more or less). While there are similarities in the \u201cnature of the problem[s],\u201d the scale and stakes of the greenhouse effect, not just the race against the clock, set it apart from every other threat with the single (still unresolved) problem of nuclear war. Negotiating, ratifying and policing the Montreal Protocol (the ozone treaty) was orders of magnitude easier than implementing and enforcing an adequate climate treaty. The former phased out a handful of chemicals and barely challenged a handful of firms. The latter will affect many countries and most corporations on the planet.\n\n\u201cRound[ing] the edges\u201d of American capitalism never really worked, even in the classic case of the welfare state. Merely greening up business as usual will not cut it for climate change. The Solutions Project models shifts to 100% clean energy systems for the US, its individual states and the world by 2030-2050. The studies focus on the technical aspects of the transition using mostly current technology. They do not address the sociopolitical means necessary to get there. The hope is that apparent technical feasibility can spur sufficient citizen action to generate the political will without which the transition will not happen. Obama\u2019s vision for a climate safe capitalism (profits and jobs), if not a contradiction in terms, is also dependent on political will. With the broken politics he cites, and his inability to connect with climate justice movements, the means to his ends are missing.\n\nClimate Justice in Paris?\n\nGoodell asked the president how he\u2019d define success for the Paris climate talks.\n\n\u201cFor us to be able to get the basic architecture in place with aggressive-enough targets from the major emitters that the smaller countries say, \u201cThis is serious\u201d \u2014 that will be a success. I\u2019m less concerned about the precise number, because let\u2019s stipulate right now, whatever various country targets are, it\u2019s still going to fall short of what the science requires . . . But making sure everybody is making serious efforts and that we are making a joint international commitment that is well-defined and can be measured will create the basis for us each year, then, to evaluate, \u201cHow are we doing?\u201d and will allow us, five years from now, to say the science is new, we need to ratchet it up, and by the way, because of the research and development that we\u2019ve put in, we can achieve more ambitious goals. . . . And . . . there will be a momentum that is built, and I\u2019m confident that we will then be in a position to listen more carefully to the science \u2014 partly because people, I think, will be not as fearful of the consequences or as cynical about what can be achieved. Hope builds on itself. Success breeds success.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a dodge to avoid any quantification of \u201caggressive enough targets\u201d and \u201cserious efforts.\u201d Also missing in this seemingly reasonable perspective is what the president referred to earlier as \u201cstrategic framing.\u201d His perspective lacks the most powerful frame of all: climate justice. It\u2019s not that Obama isn\u2019t aware of the principle, or is ignorant of the related principle of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities\u201d (he avers to it in a passage below). The latter emerged from the earlier notion of the \u201ccommon heritage of mankind.\u201d It appeared in the Rio Declaration (1992) and the Framework Convention on Climate Change (1992) from which sprang the Kyoto Protocol (1997).\n\nSource: IICAT Climate Justice Project.\n\nClimate justice as concept has been around since at least 2000 (when the first Climate Justice Summit took place in the Hague), and was born out of environmental justice struggles of the eighties and nineties. Climate justice campaigners rightly assign historical responsibility for climate disruption to the Global North. It follows that early industrializers must make the deepest cuts in emissions. Rich countries must also provide the resources and technology for the Global South to adapt to present and future effects of climate chaos, and to leapfrog dirty energy systems. Climate justice means avoiding false solutions (geo-engineering, carbon offsets, mega-dams, biofuels, etc.). And it demands transparency and real participation for the poorest and most vulnerable.\n\nCentral to climate justice is the need for a just transition. Obama has a partial handle on this but his actions do not follow his understanding.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for us not to pretend that there are no difficult trade-offs at all. The transition will require some tough choices to be made. There are going to be localized impacts for folks who have more of a legacy system of dirty energy. We can accommodate helping those communities transition, but it requires us to feel like we\u2019re all in this together . . . We\u2019ve got to be in there talking to folks about how do we solve some of the technical problems involved; how do we make sure that everybody is benefiting from this transition; and if there are costs involved in this transition, how do we all pull together to make sure that it\u2019s not just being borne by one group of people. And that\u2019s true internationally as well. I can\u2019t have a conversation with the prime minister of India and ignore the fact that they still have hundreds of millions of people in poverty and not enough electricity. So if I\u2019m going to get him to have an aggressive plan to keep emissions down, then I\u2019ve got to be willing to pony up strategies for power that aren\u2019t polluting. And some of that may require technology transfers or help to modernize their systems to make them more efficient.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s all of the above energy policy consciously avoided precisely those \u201ctough choices\u201d and \u201clocalized impacts\u201d he tells us are unavoidable. Where was his muscular push \u2014 no doubt resisted at every step \u2014 for community assistance? \u201cIf there are costs involved in this transition\u201d? The International Energy Agency estimated recently that the world must spend $1 trillion annually for the next thirty years to keep the global average temperature increase at two degrees Celsius (see Figure 4). Current spending is nowhere near that level. The leading edge of the climate justice movement now calls for a temperature increase no greater than 1.5 degrees C. Meeting that goal requires spending even more funds over an even shorter time period. The Green Climate Fund \u2014 the global vehicle for climate financing \u2014 finally authorized its first eight projects in November of this year. Slated to grow to $100 billion per year by 2020, it currently has but $1.5 billion in annual capacity.\n\nFigure 4\n\nThe world needs a low-carbon, climate justice version of Schumpeter\u2019s \u201cgales of creative destruction\u201d (the tendency of capitalism to crush and replace previous economic formations with new ones regardless of the consequences). We need the \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d promised by a green economy not by the growing \u201cgig economy\u201d. We need programs and policies to ensure the most vulnerable among us do not pay disproportionate costs of the transition to a clean energy future. The point is to make the Koch brothers the losers not coal miners or nuclear plant workers.\n\nConclusion\n\nBetter than any of his predecessors, and a relatively strong international voice, Barack Obama has not been close to equal to the challenge of climate change. His years in power were to a significant extent squandered at precisely that point in history when robust action is most urgent, might still make a difference. His failed politics of conciliation and consensus, felt acutely across the full range of issues during his presidency, was especially misguided as temperatures, droughts and storms set new records. The missed opportunity to combine efforts with social movements, the only chance he had to even partially overcome rabid right wing resistance, will haunt the country for years to come.\n\nThe unwillingness and inability to ally with climate justice and other movements (think women\u2019s movement battles over abortion and contraception, immigration, Occupy, efforts for criminal justice reform, Black Lives Matter, peace groups\u2019 struggle against the War on Terror, and all the rest) is the great tragedy of the Obama era. To view the tragedy as unavoidable, to see Obama as simply a prettified spokesperson for the 1% \u2014 and there is much to support this perspective \u2014 ignores reasonable inquiries into missed opportunities, and surrenders demands for a better president next time. His remaining defenders still claim he did the best he could with a gerrymandered Congress and an ascendant Tea Party. This overlooks the arrogance, the timidity, self-satisfaction, and lack of conviction of the administration. Team Obama\u2019s hubris and lack of courage led to countless offers to split differences with reactionaries out for blood. The failure to mobilize with people at home prevents the president from mobilizing with the world\u2019s people for Paris.\n\nObama is hazily cognizant of the power of the people to move policymakers.\n\n\u201c[T]hat\u2019s why I continually go back to the notion that the American people have to feel the same urgency that I do. And it\u2019s understandable that they don\u2019t, because the science right now feels abstract to people. It will feel less abstract with each successive year.\u201d\n\nHe remains wed, however, to the outdated and partial view that the effects of climate change remain remote for most people. The science felt less abstract each of his eight years in office. Even if he\u2019s right about this, what has the president done to help people feel the same urgency? Precious little. How vigorously has he done battle with Fox News and the rest of the denier industrial complex?\n\nObama passes off his petroleum-supply politics as usual as savvy even-handedness and realism rather than incoherence and conflict avoidance. Seeing climate change as just another issue to manage, albeit against a racing clock, contradicts his understanding of the ever more urgent science. The president betrays a fateful misconception of the politics and essence of growing climate instability. Climate change cannot be compartmentalized from other political problems and possible solutions because of its scale and stakes. These are not normal politics.\n\nThe challenge of climate change is anything but easy. It touches everything, ever more urgently. In this light, President Obama\u2019s efforts have fallen far short of what Americans and the rest of the world needs now. One final example: cuts to the Pentagon budget would help reduce US carbon emissions, save money for climate programs, and shrink the flow of refugees. We get instead growing military spending and an endless War on Terror. The eco-socialists are probably right: capitalism is incapable of sufficient greening to forestall catastrophe. The current system requires replacement not by Bernie Sanders\u2019 anemic version of democratic socialism but by a participatory, just, ecological, system prioritizing people and planet over profits. You\u2019d think presidents who identify as \u201cprogressive\u201d might fight harder to prove the eco-socialists wrong.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "www.counterpunch.org", "description": "Rolling Stone reporter Jeff Goodell tagged along on President Obama\u2019s recent climate-change themed trip to Alaska.
