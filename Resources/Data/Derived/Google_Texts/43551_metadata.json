Later, she immigrated to the U.S. in 1995 and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2004.\n\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern Division in Michigan said in October that when she filed her immigration papers, \u201cOdeh omitted her arrest, conviction, and imprisonment overseas, which were material facts for the United States government in determining whether to grant her citizenship.\u201d\n\nIf convicted, Odeh could be stripped of her citizenship and face a maximum sentence of 10 years.\n\nNational Review reported that the Department of Insurance discovered Odeh\u2019s history only after the U.S. attorney\u2019s announcement about her indictment. She has reportedly used as many as nine aliases.\n\nA hearing is scheduled this Wednesday in court, according to the AP.\n\n\u2014", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "A former Illinois Obamacare navigator discovered to have been a convicted terrorist may now plead guilty over failing to tell immigration officers about her conviction when she moved to the U.S.  Rasmieh Yousef Odeh was sentenced to life in prison by an Israeli court in 1970 after she...", "title": "The Group That Is Speaking Out in Defense of a Convicted Terrorist Who Might Plead Guilty to Immigration Fraud", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/05/18/the-group-that-is-speaking-out-in-defense-of-a-convicted-terrorist-who-might-plead-guilty-to-immigration-fraud/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Rasmieh-Yousef-Odeh-AP.jpg", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "former, obamacare, navigator, uncovered, past, terrorism, convict, may, plead, guilty, immigration, fraud, cair, accuses, government, criminalizing, immigrants", "sailthru.tags": "israel, palestinians, world, author-sharona-schwartz, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 197, "gplus-count": 2, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/810864", "categories": "israel,palestinians,world", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 65, "description": "A former Illinois Obamacare navigator discovered to have been a convicted terrorist may now plead guilty over failing to tell immigration officers about her conviction when she moved to the U.S.  Rasmieh Yousef Odeh was sentenced to life in prison by an Israeli court in 1970 after she...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 1, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "A former Illinois Obamacare navigator discovered to have been a convicted terrorist may now plead guilty over failing to tell immigration officers about her conviction when she moved to the U.S.  Rasmieh Yousef Odeh was sentenced to life in prison by an Israeli court in 1970 after she...", "title": "The Group That Is Speaking Out in Defense of a Convicted Terrorist Who Might Plead Guilty to Immigration Fraud", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/05/18/the-group-that-is-speaking-out-in-defense-of-a-convicted-terrorist-who-might-plead-guilty-to-immigration-fraud/", "image": {"width": 583, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Rasmieh-Yousef-Odeh-AP.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 481}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-05-18T10:45:14+00:00", "twitter-count": 86}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccbc0\"", "article_summary": "National Review reported that the Department of Insurance discovered Odeh\u2019s history only after the U.S. attorney\u2019s announcement about her indictment.\nMuslim and Arab American advocacy groups have spoken out strongly in Odeh\u2019s defense, accusing the government of selectively prosecuting Palestinian activists and of \u201ccriminalizing\u201d immigrants.\nLater, she immigrated to the U.S. in 1995 and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2004.\nA hearing is scheduled this Wednesday in court, according to the AP.\nShe has reportedly used as many as nine aliases."}
