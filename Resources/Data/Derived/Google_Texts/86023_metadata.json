He and Germany's Severin Freund both leapt 104 meters.\n\nSchlierenzauer - who has a record 52 World Cup wins - looked relieved afterwards.\n\n\"It's getting better and better. (I'm reaching) the top level of my jumping and I think for tomorrow everything is clear for me,\" the 24-year-old Austrian told Reuters.\n\nSchlierenzauer had been tipped to win both individual Olympic golds in 2010 but ended up with two bronzes, losing both titles to Ammann.\n\nThe qualification round was won by Austrian Michael Hayboeck, who leapt 101 meters to continue a fine run of performances on the hill in recent training sessions.\n\n\"I think the hill and I are a good team ... I'm happy the Olympics are on this hill and so everything is going very easily,\" the 22-year-old told reporters. \"I am sure I can fight for the medals.\n\nAndreas Wank of Austria and Reruhi Shimizu both jumped slightly further but Hayboeck's superior style marks made the difference.\n\nThe top two jumpers in the world - Kamil Stoch of Poland and Peter Prevc of Slovenia - jumped 100 and 101.5 meters.\n\n(Editing by Peter Rutherford)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David Ljunggren", "Author": "David Ljunggren", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The honor of
