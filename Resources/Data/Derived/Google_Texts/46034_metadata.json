What\u2019s that about? How dare you! How dare you create a world in which there is such misery that is not our fault? It\u2019s not right. It\u2019s utterly, utterly evil,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fry responded. \u201cWhy should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think you\u2019re going to get in like that?\u201d Mr. Byrne asked.\n\n\u201cNo, but I wouldn\u2019t want to. I wouldn\u2019t want to get in on his terms. They\u2019re wrong,\u201d Mr. Fry said. \u201cNow, if I died and it was Pluto, Hades, and if it was the 12 Greek gods, then I would have more truck with it. Because the Greeks were \u2026 they didn\u2019t pretend not to be human in their appetites, and in their capriciousness and in their unreasonableness. They didn\u2019t present themselves as being all-seeing, all-wise, all-kind, all-beneficent.\n\n\u201cThe [Christian] God who created this universe \u2014 if it was created by God \u2014 is quite clearly a maniac. An utter maniac,\u201d he continued. \u201cTotally selfish. We have to spend our life on our knees thanking him? What kind of God would do that?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly apparent that he is monstrous \u2014 utterly monstrous and deserves no respect whatsoever. The moment you banish him, your life becomes simpler, purer, cleaner and more worth living, in my opinion,\u201d Mr. Fry concluded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Actor Stephen Fry has some choice words for God if he ever finds himself at the pearly gates.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Actor Stephen Fry has some choice words for God if he ever finds himself at the pearly gates.", "title": "Stephen Fry, \u2018Hobbit\u2019 actor, calls God \u2018stupid, selfish, utterly evil\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/1/stephen-fry-hobbit-actor-calls-god-stupid-selfish-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/09/7d21a0e374beb9016a0f6a706700c43c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/09/7d21a0e374beb9016a0f6a706700c43c.jpg", "description": "Actor Stephen Fry has some choice words for God if he ever finds himself at the pearly gates.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Stephen Fry, \u2018Hobbit\u2019 actor, calls God \u2018stupid, self"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Religion Belief, Stephen Fry, Gay Byrne"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfaf\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s utterly, utterly evil,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fry responded.\nThe moment you banish him, your life becomes simpler, purer, cleaner and more worth living, in my opinion,\u201d Mr. Fry concluded.\n\u201cThe Meaning of Life\u201d host Gay Byrne asked Mr. Fry what he would say if he was confronted by God upon his death.\nActor Stephen Fry has some choice words for God if he ever finds himself at the pearly gates.\nThey\u2019re wrong,\u201d Mr. Fry said."}
