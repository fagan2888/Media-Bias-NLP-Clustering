Mr. Trump believes the Chinese (and others) have been playing us for fools; using cheap labor, currency manipulation and trade barriers to favor their exports and limit our imports.\n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s mind (although not in the minds of serious economists), that\u2019s why we\u2019ve lost five million manufacturing jobs since 2000.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Chinese are certainly protectionists, but a shift in manufacturing jobs was inevitable. For centuries, as countries have developed, the locus of jobs has shifted based on comparative advantage.\n\nMoreover, many of those manufacturing jobs weren\u2019t lost to other countries but to growing efficiency, just as employment in agriculture in the United States has fallen even as output has risen.\n\nNo policies could reverse tectonic forces of this magnitude, and in suggesting that there are remedies, Mr. Trump is cynically misleading the American public.\n\nStill worse are his notions for how to bring jobs home, particularly his call for huge tariffs. At various times, he has proposed levies of 25 percent on imports from China and 35 percent on Ford vehicles assembled in Mexico. That would significantly raise prices for Americans and unleash retaliatory moves.\n\nAnother tenet of his trade policy would be a weaker dollar, which would discourage imports by making them more expensive and increase the competitiveness of American exports.\n\nBut a weaker dollar depends on low American interest rates, and Mr. Trump has separately decried the expansionary monetary policy of the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn that criticism, Mr. Trump has been aligned with a flotilla of staunch conservatives who have argued for years that maintaining interest rates near zero is certain to unleash asset bubbles and rampant inflation.\n\nTo date, that view has proved utterly wrong. Low interest rates have helped our economic recovery. And not only is inflation nowhere to be seen, but the prices of key barometers, like commodities and energy, are falling.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe list of Mr. Trump\u2019s wrongheaded ideas goes on and on: We shouldn\u2019t increase the minimum wage, which is well below historic levels, after adjustment for inflation. Corporate taxes should be eliminated. Global warming is a fantasy.\n\nBy some estimates, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border would cost billions and his plan to deport 11.5 million undocumented immigrants could cost at least $400 billion over 20 years, while losing the services of millions of workers would significantly dent economic growth.\n\nWhen challenged on his more outlandish ideas, Mr. Trump retreats into chest thumping, with comments like \u201cyou have to let me handle that, O.K.?\u201d\n\nAt times, Mr. Trump goes on the attack without actually disagreeing. The Affordable Care Act should be abolished, but his suggested replacement bears considerable resemblance to President Obama\u2019s plan. He has pushed for even greater involvement by government in health care, praising the single-payer models of Canada and Scotland.\n\nI guess a foolish inconsistency can also be the hobgoblin of a big mind.\n\nWhen it comes to budgets, Mr. Trump\u2019s numbers (were he ever to release any) couldn\u2019t possibly add up.\n\nHe wants to build infrastructure, bolster defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, cut taxes and protect Social Security and Medicare from any trims, all while proclaiming that he\u2019s a fiscal conservative.\n\nIn 1999, to address the problem of too much federal debt, Mr. Trump proposed a one-time, 14.25 percent wealth tax on the very rich. Fortunately, the idea never gained traction; a $5.7 trillion tax increase would have plunged the economy into recession, if not depression.\n\nIn the Republican debate, Mr. Trump, who has watched four of his companies slide into bankruptcy, said of the nation\u2019s debt mountain: \u201cThey need somebody like me to straighten out that mess.\u201d\n\nConfronted recently by one journalist about his policy prescriptions, Mr. Trump replied: \u201cYou\u2019ll be happy, believe me. You\u2019ll be happy.\u201d I\u2019ll be happy when he is off the stage.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150814032103, "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s odd that a successful
