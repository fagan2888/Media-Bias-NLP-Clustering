The issue is health care, and so far, neither Democrat Martha Coakley nor Republican Charlie Baker has taken the lead on this topic with voters in the gubernatorial race.\n\n\u201cCoakley has perhaps a slight edge on the general health care issue, as well as the affordability issue, but neither campaign has really broken away\u201d on health care, said Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling Group. \u201cIt\u2019s not like taxes, which go big for Baker. It\u2019s not like education, which tends to go a bit bigger Coakley. It\u2019s an issue that is still very closely fought.\u201d\n\nSo where do the gubernatorial candidates stand on some of the key concerns in health care? Below is a summary of the candidates\u2019 proposals for how to treat the health of the state.\n\n\n\nOn Making Health Care More Affordable:\n\nBAKER: He argues that giving patients information about how much tests and procedures cost, in advance, will help us become informed consumers of care. We\u2019ll spend less money, because we\u2019ll choose to have a baby, for example, at the hospital with the lowest cost and best quality scores. As of Oct. 1, health plans in Massachusetts are required to post what they pay each hospital and doctor.\n\nBaker would take a next step. \u201cI\u2019d like to get to the point where hospitals just post prices and people can see them plain as day,\u201d Baker said. \u201cAs governor, I\u2019m going to lean really hard on this.\u201d\n\nSome health care analysts say Baker\u2019s strategy for reducing health care costs could backfire. Patients may assume that the most expensive hospital is the best even though that\u2019s generally not true. And letting Brockton Hospital, for example, know that it is paid about half of what Massachusetts General Hospital receives for a C-section may mean Brockton Hospital demands more money, instead of MGH saying, \u201cOK, I\u2019m going to lower my prices to compete.\u201d In addition, some of the expensive hospitals say their higher prices subsidize teaching and research.\n\nCOAKLEY: She argues she is uniquely positioned to tackle health care spending. She created a health care division in the attorney general\u2019s office, issued the first detailed reports on health care costs and used her leverage to negotiate a deal that would limit the price increases Partners HealthCare could demand in the near future.\n\n\u201cThe agreement that we have reached, to be approved by the court, caps costs and lowers costs as opposed to maintaining the status quo, which we all agree is too expensive,\u201d Coakley said during a campaign debate on WBZ-TV.\n\nBut Coakley\u2019s deal has been widely criticized, because it lets Partners add doctors and hospitals and expand the market power Coakley\u2019s reports say have driven up costs.\n\nCoakley suggests the state\u2019s attorney general needs more power to effectively block harmful health care mergers. She would file legislation giving the attorney general authority to file suit based on a recommendation from the state\u2019s Health Policy Commission.\n\n\u201cIt would allow us to work more quickly and with a different and lower threshold [than the anti-trust statute] to address cost containment in mergers, acquisitions, other transactions in the health care field, that we think negatively would affect cost containment,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd Coakley would consider setting price limits for tests and procedures if the state does not meet its health care spending goal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always said if the market can\u2019t correct, there\u2019s always the opportunity to look at price convergence and have the state more involved,\u201d she said.\n\nIndependent Candidates In 2014 Governor\u2019s Race Health Care Goals In Summary:\n\nEVAN FALCHUK: He would try to break hospital monopolies whose prices \u201clead to skyrocketing premiums for consumers.\u201d And Falchuk would \u201ccreate a fee schedule that will apply equally to all hospitals.\u201d JEFFREY MCCORMICK: His approach includes a focus on primary care, especially community-based and home care options. SCOTT LIVELY: He says the state can lower health care spending by creating \u201cnonprofit risk pools that are much less costly, where people are not restricted to the doctors and hospitals they can go to and where the members are stakeholders in the billing process which has a substantial downward pressure on costs.\u201d\n\nOn Improving Health Care:\n\nCOAKLEY: She says the state has to build up mental health services and merge care for the body and mind.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to coordinate care, and it\u2019s put costs way up on the physical health side,\u201d Coakley said.\n\nThis is personal for Coakley, who has told the story of her brother Edward\u2019s suicide throughout the campaign to explain her commitment to mental health care. She\u2019d push for more screening to catch problems early on and expand access to programs and therapists.\n\nCoakley would keep Taunton State Hospital open. She would require that mental health evaluations be done in a civil facility, not at Bridgewater State Hospital, and be conducted by staff from the Department of Mental Health, not Corrections.\n\nBAKER: He would boost primary care as a whole, beginning with a Medicaid waiver that would increase pay for primary care doctors.\n\n\u201cIf we simply invested in primary care,\u201d Baker said, \u201cwe would spend less on health care overall, and we\u2019d have healthier happier people. I really believe that.\u201d\n\nOn The Move From Fee For Service And Toward Global Budgets Or Payments:\n\nBAKER:\n\nHow you get paid doesn\u2019t really seem to relate all that much to how expensive you are or how high quality you are. What seems to drive that more than anything is the culture of your group, and my view has been for a while that if a group wants to be compensated under a global budget and is willing to do the work that\u2019s associated with being compensated that way\u2026then I\u2019m like, \u2018Sure, go for it!\u2019 But I think we need to be careful about pushing people into that type of arrangement, because I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be very effective participants. There\u2019s evidence out there that as long as you have the right incentives and the right culture in place, you can make a fee for service model work too.\n\nCOAKLEY:\n\nAs we move away from fee for service and try to get into our communities more affordable and integrated health care, it is the one way where you\u2019re going to be able to address mental health care and behavioral health care.\n\nOn The Affordable Care Act And The Connector:\n\nOne big unknown for the next governor is whether the Connector website will be working, and if enrolling the roughly 450,000 residents who\u2019ve been in limbo this year will be going smoothly when the new governor takes office.\n\nCOAKLEY: \u201cThe roll out of the Connector website was unacceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve also said that it\u2019s very important that Massachusetts maintain control over what we are doing here. I\u2019m glad that we are not going down the federal path [merging with the federal site, Healthcare.gov]. I have advocated with my colleagues around the country to say, we need a \u2018not one size fits all program.\u2019 We\u2019ve done well here in Massachusetts, we need to keep moving forward on that.\u201d\n\nBAKER: He says \u201cjob number one has to be to get the website to work.\u201d\n\nThere is some confusion about what Baker means when he says he would ask for a waiver or waivers from the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be in a situation where the commonwealth can actually advocate for its own interests and if there are things we think we can do and make the case to the federal government that they\u2019re the right things to do for the people of Massachusetts and fit within some framework that relates to the goals and objectives of the Affordable Care Act (ACA),\u201d he explained. \u201cI think we should be able to do that. That\u2019s what I mean when I talk about a waiver.\u201d\n\nBaker has not outlined items in the ACA for which he would seek a Massachusetts waiver.\n\nOn Opening Medical Marijuana Dispensaries, Would The Candidates Continue The Current Process Or Stop And Start Over?\n\nCOAKLEY:\n\nI\u2019d want to take a look at where we are. No licenses have been issued yet. I think that the vetting that is supposed to take place is taking place. If it isn\u2019t where it should be, I\u2019m happy to start over. I\u2019m not saying we need to do that. I want to make sure that we move as quickly as possible, but we have the regulatory piece in place.\n\nBaker:\n\nWe have huge process credibility issues here; we have pending lawsuits. I think it might be best to just redo this. I mean, compress the time frame, but get some real experts involved in it and do something that I think would have more integrity. I also worry about the fact that as far as I can tell we\u2019re going to come nowhere near meeting the requirement that these dispensaries be available to the people within a certain geography. If you look at a map of Massachusetts and you point these things on that map, there are huge gaps in access and coverage.\n\nOn Legalizing Marijuana (An Issue Likely To Come Up During First Four Years):\n\nBAKER: \u201cI am against legalization. I\u2019ve talked to too many people in the addiction community and too many people in law enforcement community. The addiction community, their stories and their concerns are particularly telling.\u201d\n\nCOAKLEY: \u201cWe would like to see where Washington and Colorado go \u2014 states that are ahead of us on medical marijuana dispensaries and have legalized it.\u201d\n\nOn Opiate Abuse:\n\nBAKER: \u201cI\u2019ve had some friends who\u2019ve either lost or come very close to losing children over the heroin problem. We need to have a real heart-to-heart about the way the health care community prescribes opiates.\u201d\n\nBaker would require all doctors to consult the state\u2019s Prescription Monitoring Program before writing or renewing a patient\u2019s prescription for pain medication.\n\nCOAKLEY: \u201cOne out of the three people is at risk for becoming addicted to something like Oxycontin. We have seen too many drugs prescribed, not monitored by doctors and pharmacists. We also need to find better ways for people who are addicted to get them off that and provide for rehabilitation. It is a burning issue for me. Sixty to 80 percent of people sitting in a house of correction have some kind of a mental health or substance abuse issue.\u201d\n\nCoakley has not released a plan to address opiate abuse.\n\nElection Day is Tuesday, Nov. 4.\n\nRelated Coverage:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Where do the gubernatorial candidates stand on some of the key concerns in health care?\u00a0Here's a summary of Democrat Martha Coakley and Republican Charlie Baker's plans.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Where do the gubernatorial candidates stand on some of the key concerns in health care?\u00a0Here's a summary of Democrat Martha Coakley and Republican Charlie Baker's plans.", "title": "Where Baker, Coakley Stand On Health Care", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/10/coakley-baker-health-care", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/10/1022_coakley-baker-debate-620x408.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/10/coakley-baker-health-care", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/10/1022_coakley-baker-debate-620x408.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Where Baker, Coakley Stand On Health Care"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-27", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Mon, 27 Oct 2014 06:12:27 -0400"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0858\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAs governor, I\u2019m going to lean really hard on this.\u201dSome health care analysts say Baker\u2019s strategy for reducing health care costs could backfire.\nCOAKLEY:As we move away from fee for service and try to get into our communities more affordable and integrated health care, it is the one way where you\u2019re going to be able to address mental health care and behavioral health care.\n\u201cIf we simply invested in primary care,\u201d Baker said, \u201cwe would spend less on health care overall, and we\u2019d have healthier happier people.\nShe created a health care division in the attorney general\u2019s office, issued the first detailed reports on health care costs and used her leverage to negotiate a deal that would limit the price increases Partners HealthCare could demand in the near future.\n\u201cCoakley has perhaps a slight edge on the general health care issue, as well as the affordability issue, but neither campaign has really broken away\u201d on health care, said Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling Group."}
