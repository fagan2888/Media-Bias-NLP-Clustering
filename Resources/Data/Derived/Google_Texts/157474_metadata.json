That's revolutionary,\" he said Monday.\n\nThat idea \u2014 to switch from the current retirement system, which only benefits those who serve for at least 20 years, to a 401(k)-style plan for troops who serve at least two years \u2014 was largely adopted by the House Armed Services Committee in its version of the bill last week, with a few changes.\n\nThe Senate panel will begin considering its bill next week. The personnel subcommittee, which would draft any reforms, will mark up their portion in an open session on May 12.\n\n\"Eighty-five percent of the people who join the military never get anything out of it, as far as retirement is concerned. Now 85 percent will,\" McCain said.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the panel's personnel subcommittee, added retirement reform would be a \"good accomplishment.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think it's necessary, and the way we're looking at doing it I think could be a win-win for everybody,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
