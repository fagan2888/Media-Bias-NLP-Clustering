In the ideal world, if everyone had a medical home where their primary care provider helped navigate care, then we wouldn\u2019t have to worry as much about transition and how these patients with complicated problems are going to be taken care of \u2014 but, we are not there yet.\u201d\n\nInfectious Diseases in Children spoke with several experts about the obstacles and challenges of transitioning from pediatric to adult care among patients with developmental disabilities, as well as the changes being made to bridge the gap in transitional care for these patients.\n\nTypes of developmental disabilities\n\nThe CDC defines developmental disabilities as a group of conditions due to impairment in physical, learning, language or behavior areas. These disabilities most often last throughout a person\u2019s lifetime, impacting day-to-day functioning.\n\nAll racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups are affected, according to the CDC. The most recent U.S estimates suggest one in six children aged 3 to 17 years has one or more developmental disabilities. These may include autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, ADHD, hearing loss or vision impairment.\n\nOscar M. Taube, MD, of Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, said that pediatricians need to inform families early on that there is an office policy on transition.

However, it is imperative for someone with a developmental disability to see a health care provider regularly, as they are more likely to have gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, eczema and skin allergies when compared with the general population, according to the CDC.\n\nSome patients with developmental disabilities also have complex medical conditions.\n\n\u201cI think this is the area that becomes even more challenging,\u201d Levey said. \u201cFor example, the vast majority of patients with spina bifida are unemployed as adults and often have great difficulty finding adult health care providers. There are also problems associated with patients with developmental disabilities who also have other chronic conditions that adult specialists are not knowledgeable in.\u201d\n\nAmong developmentally disabled patients, especially those with a condition such as spina bifida, the transition from pediatric to adult care can be difficult because while the pediatric world has clinics across the U.S. set up specifically for children with spina bifida, there are only five clinics that are truly adult spina bifida clinics.\n\n\u201cEven when the specialist exists, there is still a gap in training,\u201d Levey said. \u201cChildren with certain conditions did not live past childhood 50 years ago, but now, because of advancements in care, are living well into adulthood.\u201d\n\nDifferences in care\n\nLynn F. Davidson, MD, attending pediatrician in the division of general pediatrics at the Children\u2019s Hospital at Montefiore, said that it is difficult for the patient/guardian/pediatrician to let go of pediatric care and move on to the adult medical world.\n\n\u201cThe patient and their family have been with their pediatric provider for 21 years, most times, and it is hard to move on, but it is an important and major step to take,\u201d Davidson said during an interview with Infectious Diseases in Children.\n\nThere are significant differences between pediatric and adult care, which may impact adherence to follow-up visits by young adults with developmental disabilities. While pediatric care is family oriented and relies on significant parental involvement in decision-making, adult care is patient-specific and requires autonomous, independent skills of patients, without many interdisciplinary resources.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of obstacles and challenges that occur \u2014 the culture and style of care that is delivered in most pediatric vs. adult settings is quite different,\u201d Christopher Hanks, MD, pediatric and internal medicine specialist at The Ohio State University, said during an interview. \u201cIn pediatric settings, there is generally additional support in every step of the process. Pediatricians are likely to help the patient and the family set up appointments with specialists and help them navigate through the challenges. If something falls through, they are more likely to follow-up and figure out why.\u201d\n\nHanks said for adult care, a physician will make recommendations and provide the patient with referrals, but adults are expected to follow through on their own and self advocate.\n\nAnother difference is that there are developmental pediatricians for the pediatric population who often help with coordination of care and referral to other specialists. In the adult world, there is no equivalent to the developmental pediatrician.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are some developmental pediatricians who do see adults \u2014 I have seen a lot of adults in my practice,\u201d Levey said. \u201cThere are other pediatricians who see adults because we know that the services are not available elsewhere. It depends on whether or not there is a pediatric counterpart for the pediatric specialty and, for certain conditions, this is still a major obstacle even when there is an adult counterpart.\u201d\n\nTransitional program\n\nTransitioning the patient from pediatric to adult care is a lengthy process, and most experts agree that the process should begin early.\n\nIn a study published in Clinical Pediatrics in February, Davidson and colleagues sought to assess current practices for the transition of youth with special health care needs to adult medical care among New York pediatricians.\n\nThe researchers found that only 11% of the 181 respondents had a transitional policy and only 3% begin the process at the recommended age. Moreover, none of the respondents was compliant with all six critical steps from the 2002 consensus statement. Subspecialists were more likely to report compliance with only four of the steps.\n\nConversely, 92% of respondents identified an adult provider for their patients, and 57% created a portable medical summary.\n\n\u201cSomewhere between 11% and 13% of pediatric practices have a transition policy in place, as reported in various studies,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cI am very proud to say that at Montefiore, we have a transition guideline that has been accepted by pediatrics, family medicine and internal medicine as a guide of how we should think about the transition process.\u201d\n\nTo help with the process, the website www.gottransition.org provides various links for resources and ideas about transition, including information about health insurance, sexuality, housing and transportation.\n\n\u201cWe need to directly teach the patient about their condition when they are of age to understand,\u201d Levey said. \u201cTeach the adolescent why certain things are being done to them \u2014 surgeries, procedures, etc. \u2014 so they can organize their own medical history in a \u2018care notebook\u2019 so that they have been thinking about the transition several years before it even happens.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hanks, a lot of pediatricians are not speaking about transitional care and not providing appropriate preparation for their patients.\n\n\u201cThe primary problem is that pediatricians are not even discussing it \u2014 the conversation is not even happening. When the conversation does happen, it is rushed. Nationally, data suggest that only half of families of children with developmental disabilities are receiving the support they need with the transition process. I suspect that this is because the bar is set too low.\u201d\n\nHanks conducted a survey in which he asked pediatricians at The Ohio State University, \u201cAt what age do you start speaking about transitioning to adult doctors with your patients?\u201d\n\nHe found that 20% of those surveyed said they never discuss it, 15% said it was discussed after the patient is 20 years old and only one-third of pediatricians reported that they even mention it before the patient reaches age 18.\n\n\u201cIn the pediatric primary care office, we want to avoid the situation in which a 21-year-old patient is surprised when the pediatrician says \u2018goodbye\u2019 and sends the patient on their way.\u201d Oscar M. Taube, MD, of Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, said during an interview. \u201cPediatricians need to inform families early on at the age of 13 and 14 \u2014 long before they are going to transition out of the pediatric office \u2014 that there is an office policy on transition. There are terrific questionnaires that pediatricians can administer to their teen patients and their parents that ask how ready they are to complete all the tasks they need to transition to adult care successfully.\u201d\n\nTaube said the next step for the pediatrician in the transitional process is to produce a useable workable summary that can move along to the new adult physician so that he or she knows what is going on with the patient.\n\n\u201cA good pediatric office should keep a registry of their patients who are heading to adulthood,\u201d he said. \u201cThen within a couple of months after the transfer takes place, there should be follow-up to ensure things went smoothly.\u201d\n\n\u2018It takes a village\u2019\n\nAlice Kuo, MD, associate director of the UCLA center for Healthier Children, Families & Communities, and associate professor of internal medicine and pediatrics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said that reorganization is needed among communities around adults with developmental disabilities.\n\n\u201cThe phrase \u2018it takes a village\u2019 to raise a child continues with regard to an intellectually disabled adult \u2014 they act like a child throughout their entire lifespan,\u201d she said during an interview. \u201cOrganizing our services and programs around these families to help support them is really what needs to happen. When speaking about autism in particular, I think preparing our communities and organizing them in such a way to support the diversity of abilities in adults would greatly help families with the transition into adulthood.\u201d\n\nAt Ohio State University, Hanks and his team use transition readiness assessment scales that have been developed by other groups to engage the skills the patient has and identify their deficiencies so they can be supported.\n\n\u201cWe have a social worker that helps with identifying additional services or navigating systems to get them to other providers and other needed support systems,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are still in school, we coordinate with their schools. If they are trying to find work, we try to coordinate with agencies that provide those types of services. We are trying to create a network of medical specialists that have an increased interest and comfort in providing care for these patients so that when other medical needs arise, we have people to care for what can be a more challenging population to support.\u201d\n\nLynn F. Davidson\n\nTaube said proper support takes significant manpower, and a lack of office personnel is another challenging issue.\n\n\u201cIn an ideal pediatric office, there would be somebody designated as the transition care coordinator,\u201d he said. \u201cAt my hospital, I am looking into grant support to hire a family nurse practitioner who knows enough about pediatric and adult diseases so that they can help with the transition. I would love to have more therapists who are comfortable with adults with disabilities. I recently conducted a focus group of parents of autistic children, and they were very vocal about this \u2014 there is a shortage of adult therapists who are comfortable with the mental health needs of children with developmental disabilities. We need people in our offices who can shepherd this through.\u201d\n\nSocial issues\n\nOnce the pediatric patient ages out of the school system, they are faced with social issues and can sometimes become isolated due to a lack of social relationships.\n\n\u201cSpecifically speaking about families of children with autism, at least in my experience, most will not say that health care is their number one priority,\u201d Levey said. \u201cThey will say it is making sure that the patient has appropriate placement after leaving high school and what support systems are available in order for them to get there, such as a day program, work program or a community college experience. I think there is a role for us as health care providers, helping families shape and facilitate this and provide them with resources available in the geographic area.\u201d\n\nKuo agreed that it is easier for families to access services and get support from the school system. \u201cAlso, as a community, we are more tolerant of the child with developmental disabilities,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is more sympathy or empathy for the parents of the child, but when [they are] an adult, it is a little bit different. I think our society is a little less tolerant of adults, especially of those who have behaviors that are perceived to be disruptive. This is not any fault of their own.\u201d\n\nHanks said that in many cases, once these patients graduate from high school, they lose the support and are left in a void where they end up spending most of their time at home.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges these adults face is not the disability itself, but that this disability led them to a situation where they are socially isolated, which may lead to social anxiety, obesity, diabetes and depression.\u201d\n\nAlice Kuo\n\nThese social issues surrounding the transition from pediatric to adult care for patients with developmental disabilities recently gained attention in Congress. In April, Paul T. Shattuck, MD, head of the Life Course Outcomes program at A.J. Drexel Autism Institute, was invited to testify in Congress on the \u201caging out crisis\u201d of youth with autism.\n\nShattuck and colleagues recently conducted a study that found that adults with autism have limited opportunities in terms of continued education and careers \u2014 life beyond high school. \u201cThey are not in school, they are not working and they are not receiving any job training or government-funded services,\u201d Shattuck said in a press release. \u201cSomething is pretty broken.\u201d\n\nOn the horizon\n\nKuo said that policywise, the transition from pediatric to adult care has been identified as an important health indicator by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau for more than 20 years.\n\n\u201cI think the challenge is the age group. Policies that are focused on children are focused on children,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen politicians are advocating for adults, there are so many competing special interests and this population of adults with developmental disabilities get lost in the system. While there has been recognition that is important with policies and procedures, the programs supporting these policies have not kept up with the need or demand.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, the Maternal Child and Health Bureau supplied funding to create a national research network focused on autism transitions.\n\n\u201cIt was created to draw attention to the issue and to encourage researchers to conduct more research in this area,\u201d Kuo said. \u201cHopefully this will trickle down to patients and their families. We are very focused on action research \u2014 meaning research that can be easily translated into communities and programs that benefit patients and their families.\u201d\n\nRegarding health insurance, Levey said a lot of adults with developmental disabilities have Medicaid as their primary insurance, but most primary care adult providers do not accept Medicaid.\n\nHowever, according to Taube, the Affordable Care Act should begin to address the \u201cinsurance cliff\u201d these patients face. This is one of the reasons why the act was created and as it gathers steam and moves forward, he hopes this problem will be solved, he said. \u2013 by Jennifer Southall\n\nReferences:\n\nDavidson LF, et al.
