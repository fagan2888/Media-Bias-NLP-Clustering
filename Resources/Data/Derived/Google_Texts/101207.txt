A project to help low-income families in the Wichita area is in its seventh year. The American Red Cross is offering "care packages," and Monday is the day to pick one up.

The packages contain items such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste and toilet paper for people living from paycheck to paycheck. This care package giveaway begins at 1900 East Douglas at 8:30 a.m., and continues until about 350 packages are gone.

There are rules for this giveaway. Your family income must be no higher than 110 percent of the poverty level. You'll need to bring a photo ID to the Red Cross office, along with proof of a current address. That could be something like a utility bill; it must be from the past 30 days.
