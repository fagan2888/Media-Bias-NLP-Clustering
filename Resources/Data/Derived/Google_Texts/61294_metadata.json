Feeling desparate, this Catholic shop worker from Arrezo, Italy decided to write a letter to the pope for advice.\n\nLittle did she know that Pope Francis would personally call her a few weeks later with words of encouragement.\n\n\u201cI was petrified,\u201d Romano told Il Messaggero, a Rome newspaper. \u201cI recognized his voice and I knew right away that it really was the pope.\u201d\n\nIn her letter, she had described her poor luck with men, having been through a divorce a few years before this episode. She also had no idea that the father of her child was already married with children of his own.\n\n\u201cHello, Anna,\u201d the voice on the other end of the line said. \u201cThis is Pope Francis\u201d was the simple introduction that continued a string of personal phone calls made by the new papal chief as he tries to establish his reputation as a \u201cman of the people.\" Earlier this month, the head pontiff called a 19-year-old Italian student who was worried about finding a job after he concluded school, as well as a man whose brother was killed. In March, soon after claiming the post, the Vatican leader called his former newspaper kiosk to cancel his subscription.\n\n\"I know nothing of this [Ms. Romano\u2019s] telephone call but then again we knew nothing of the others. The Pope doesn't tell us when he makes these calls - he just does them and then we find out about them later,\" a Vatican spokesman told the Daily Mail.\n\nAnna Romano continued with how she wanted the child to be baptized but was worried about finding a consenting priest, but the Pope felt certain that she could find one.\n\n\u201cBut if not,\u201d Francis continued, \u201cyou know there\u2019s always me.\u201d\n\nThe expecting mother doesn\u2019t know if the child will be a boy or girl, but there\u2019s one guess as to the name she will use if it\u2019s a boy: \u201cFrancis,\u201d she announced.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pope francis, pregnant woman, baptize, anna romano, baby", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Pope Francis calls a single pregnant mom, Anna Romano, and offers to baptize her child.", "title": "Pope Francis Calls Single Pregnant Woman And Promises To Baptize Her \u2018Illegitimate\u2019 Child", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pope-francis-calls-pregnant-woman-anna-romano-and-promises-baptize-her-illegitimate-child-255847", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/francisromano.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pope Francis calls a single pregnant mom, Anna Romano, and offers to baptize her child.", "title": "Pope Francis Calls Single Pregnant Woman And Promises To Baptize Her \u2018Illegitimate\u2019 Child", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pope-francis-calls-pregnant-woman-anna-romano-and-promises-baptize-her-illegitimate-child-255847", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/francisromano.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/francisromano.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-06T13:15:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-06T15:39:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Pope Francis calls a single pregnant mom, Anna Romano, and offers to baptize her child."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf7d\"", "article_summary": "Little did she know that Pope Francis would personally call her a few weeks later with words of encouragement.\n\u201cI was petrified,\u201d Romano told Il Messaggero, a Rome newspaper.\nAnna Romano continued with how she wanted the child to be baptized but was worried about finding a consenting priest, but the Pope felt certain that she could find one.\nFeeling desparate, this Catholic shop worker from Arrezo, Italy decided to write a letter to the pope for advice.\n\u201cThis is Pope Francis\u201d was the simple introduction that continued a string of personal phone calls made by the new papal chief as he tries to establish his reputation as a \u201cman of the people.\""}
