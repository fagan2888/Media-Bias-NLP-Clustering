Rapid City, SD

Officials in Rapid City are preparing to show the City Council their final plans for a $180 million civic center expansion that would double the size of the Barnett Arena.



The Civic Center Board of Directors voted to approve the final design plans at a meeting Thursday. Organizers will go before the full City Council Monday night to formally present the plans. They will also lay out potential funding options.



The final design expands arena seating from 9,400 to 19,000. The arena would be large enough to house an indoor football field. The new multilevel parking garage would have room for 1,000 vehicles, though construction would eliminate 500 existing parking spaces.
