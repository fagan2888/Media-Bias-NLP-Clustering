Mayor Muriel E. Bowser opened an interview last week with a broad, almost relaxed smile, a noticeable change from the manner with which she greeted reporters during her first month in office nearly one year ago.\n\nThis time, she was about to sign into law an expansive police body-camera program, an initiative she said would help \u201ccreate an environment of trust between police officers and our community.\u201d And in less than 48 hours, she would start her second year in office with a community 5K run, an activity Bowser seems to view as both fun and, possibly, a metaphor for her job.\n\n\u201cMy approach to politics has just always been to go hard, go super hard, outwork everybody,\u201d she said.\n\nBowser (D) has made it through her first year as mayor, weathering a spike in homicides and drawing praise for her push to shut down the city\u2019s most troubled homeless shelter, and for injecting $100 million into an affordable-housing trust fund.\n\nShe has also encountered stumbling blocks.\n\nMayor Muriel E. Bowser speaks during a news conference in Washington. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nThe unlimited donations solicited by a political action committee closely affiliated with the mayor, and a shadowy series of negotiations between Bowser\u2019s office and corporate energy giant Exelon over its proposed massive merger with Pepco, drew allegations of cronyism and pay-to-play politics that her critics say could haunt her in the years ahead. She has struggled to present a cohesive public-safety plan, despite a spike in homicides that has pushed crime to the top of the list of citizens\u2019 concerns.\n\nBowser says she is entering 2016 determined to keep fighting, building on \u201cthe things that we\u2019ve laid the groundwork for already.\u201d She is much more aware than she was a year ago that, as the city\u2019s chief executive, she will be held accountable for whatever happens to its 670,000 residents.\n\n\u201cThere is a big difference with the attention that you get, and the enemies that you could get, when you\u2019re mayor, versus when you\u2019re a council member,\u201d she said. \u201cThings happen in cities. Anything can happen. . . . And so there is always a decision to be made.\u201d\n\nLearning on the job\n\nBowser\u2019s first year in office started hard and fast, when a smoke incident in a Metro rail tunnel killed one passenger and sickened others, drawing an onslaught of questions from a press corps she describes as \u201cvery aggressive.\u201d\n\nShe has shown herself to be steadfast in the face of criticism, and she says she has a \u201chigh tolerance\u201d for frustration. In articulating her vision for the city, Bowser has relied on slogans to represent her policies \u2014 catch phrases such as \u201cPathways to the Middle Class,\u201d \u201cSafer, Stronger\u201d and \u201cFresh Start.\u201d\n\nShe won praise for key appointments, including top aides assigned to reduce homelessness and improve city schools. She launched initiatives, including expanding the age range of the Summer Youth Employment Program and creating the LEAP Academy to train D.C. residents for government jobs, that \u2014 if successful \u2014 could help shape her legacy.\n\n\u201cIt takes time for any administration to leave an impact on the city. But one thing you can evaluate in the first year is the caliber of people brought in, and honestly I\u2019ve been impressed,\u201d said David Zipper, who was an aide to former D.C. mayors Adrian Fenty and Vincent C. Gray and now is managing director of 1776, a seed fund for start-ups that has partnered with the Bowser administration on some projects.\n\nBut crime could wind up being Bowser\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel. Bowser and D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier drew criticism last year for what some saw as shifting explanations for the city\u2019s homicide spike and a failure to articulate a clear plan of action. In the year ahead, the mayor and police chief will have to try to reduce crime with a police force that has shrunk to fewer than 3,800 officers for the first time in a decade, as well as mounting opposition from the local police union.\n\n\u201cI think overall, they have not done a good job either in anticipating what\u2019s going on, or dealing with it once it\u2019s happened,\u201d said Delroy Burton, the head of the District\u2019s police union, which has called for Lanier\u2019s ouster.\n\nCouncil member Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5) attributed part of the uncertainty to Bowser settling in to the job. \u201cI think that, as with any new administration, there was a period where they had to sort of rethink their approach,\u201d McDuffie said. \u201cResidents want answers. They want solutions. And I saw attempts by the chief and the mayor to address the causes of the homicides that I think presented even more challenges for MPD, quite frankly.\u201d\n\nBowser also has alienated some council members by appearing, in their eyes, stubborn and unwilling to compromise. Public criticism over the Pepco-Exelon merger and her political action committee \u2014 which led to the shuttering of the PAC \u2014 has also increased the mayor\u2019s defensiveness.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nShe maintains that there was nothing opaque about the merger, which she approved after private negotiations between her office and the companies, and after Bowser had initially rejected it. \u201cI don\u2019t know too many people that negotiate deals on the front steps,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd she insists that there was nothing unsavory about Fresh PAC, which exploited a legal loophole to solicit unlimited donations \u2014 including from developers and recent appointees \u2014 during a non-election year.\n\n\u201cPeople have PACs all over the place,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cSo when you all start criticizing the governors and Congress people for having PACs, then \u2014 I\u2019m still waiting for that article.\u201d\n\nCouncil member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), a sometime critic, says the mayor would do better to respond this year by pushing for campaign finance reforms that would prevent such fundraising efforts in the future.\n\n\u201cI think as mayor, she\u2019s worrying about her image in some ways, but not worrying about it in ways that are deeply and profoundly important and reflect on her integrity and ethics,\u201d said Mary Rowse, a community activist in Ward 3. Rowse said she is particularly disturbed by Bowser\u2019s support for the Pepco-Exelon deal, which she believes will harm consumers and the environment.\n\nIn the coming year, Bowser said she will focus on \u201ccontinued investment in affordable housing, ending homelessness, closing D.C. General, investing robustly in schools, and of course at the top of the list is working on safer, stronger initiatives in D.C. neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nDespite widespread support for shuttering the rundown former hospital that houses hundreds of homeless families, Bowser could find a new source of opposition among the residents of the affected neighborhoods when her administration announces the locations of six replacement facilities.\n\nShe told reporters last week that she is waiting for the D.C. Council to approve her Safer, Stronger legislation, which would put more police on the streets, increase the penalties for some crimes and allow warrantless searches of the homes of former offenders. But the proposal \u2014 particularly the suggestion of warrantless searches \u2014 met with such harsh criticism from residents, council members and community activists that it is unlikely to be adopted.\n\n\u201cIn this job, every day, there\u2019s a fight to be had,\u201d Bowser said of her agenda. \u201cIf you care about all the things that are important to our agenda, you have to fight for them every single day.\u201d\n\nBut where Bowser says she is determined, others also see stubbornness, and a mayor who has yet to leave behind the competitive, all-or-nothing outlook of a political campaign. At the Wilson Building, she has sometimes irked council members for taking credit where they said it wasn\u2019t due, or for picking fights over legislative details rather than working toward compromise.\n\n\u201cI think some of the bumps have been toning down the political operation,\u201d said D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D). \u201cI mean, even though we run for office, once elected, we have to shift gears to governing.\u201d\n\nAaron C.
