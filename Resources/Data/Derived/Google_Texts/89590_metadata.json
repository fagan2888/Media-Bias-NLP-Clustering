That\u2019s up from $1.90 per drink in 2006.\n\nThat total reflects the combined cost of reduced workplace productivity, crime and health problems caused by excessive drinking. The organization said that binge drinking (consuming five or more drinks on one occasion for men, four or more for women) accounted for more than three-quarters of those costs.\n\nRelated: 10 Best Cities for a Healthy Retirement\n\nTwo out of every five dollars were paid by governments, with states spending a median $3.5 billion on alcohol-related problems, ranging from $488 million in North Dakota to $35 billion in California.\n\nPer capita, alcohol-related problems cost states an average $807 per person, with Washington, D.C. having the highest per capita cost at $1,526.\n\n\u201cThe increase in the costs of excessive drinking from 2006 to 2010 is concerning, particularly given the severe economic recession that occurred during these years,\u201d Robert Brewer, CDC\u2019s Alcohol Program head said in a statement. \u201cEffective prevention strategies can reduce excessive drinking and related costs in states and communities, but they are under used.\u201d\n\nResearchers say that cost estimates may be low, since information on alcohol use is often underreported or unavailable. In addition to the financial toll, alcohol abuse leads to 88,000 deaths per year, including 1 in 10 deaths among working age Americans.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you thought prices for drinks at your local bar are getting too high, you won\u2019t bel", "title": "America Has a $249 Billion Drinking Problem", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/16/America-Has-249-Billion-Drinking-Problem", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05042015_Papy_Van_Winkle_Bourbon_Whiskey.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/16/America-Has-249-Billion-Drinking-Problem", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05042015_Papy_Van_Winkle_Bourbon_Whiskey.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If you thought prices for drinks at your local bar are getting too high, you won\u2019t bel", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Per capita, alcohol-related problems cost states an average $807 per person, with Washington, D.C. having the highest per capita cost at $1,526.\nExcessive alcohol use cost the country $249 billion in 2010, or $2.05 per drink, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThat total reflects the combined cost of reduced workplace productivity, crime and health problems caused by excessive drinking.\n\u201cThe increase in the costs of excessive drinking from 2006 to 2010 is concerning, particularly given the severe economic recession that occurred during these years,\u201d Robert Brewer, CDC\u2019s Alcohol Program head said in a statement.\nIn addition to the financial toll, alcohol abuse leads to 88,000 deaths per year, including 1 in 10 deaths among working age Americans."}
