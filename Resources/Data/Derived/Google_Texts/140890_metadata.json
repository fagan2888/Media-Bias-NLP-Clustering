Federal Election Commission was argued before the Court on Tuesday. Many believe the case presents an opportunity to loosen caps on individual contributions to federal candidates. While those passionate about the issue are debating caps, one largely unmentioned aspect \u2014 anonymity \u2014 presents a potential compromise that could rest both sides\u2019 concerns without undermining the Constitution.\n\nOn one side of the debate are those who believe money corrupts, and that caps and regulations are necessary in order to limit the influence of wealthy donors. The belief is that he who donates generously will gain the candidate\u2019s ear. The candidate will be indebted to him and his wishes, no matter how adverse. People viewing campaign finance through this lens seek to limit the amount of money given by big donors in politics.\n\nThe other side believes that limiting money one gives to a lawful purpose is an infringement of the First Amendment. Lawyers for Shaun McCutcheon argue that caps \u201cburden his First Amendment rights while doing little to protect public officials from corruption.\u201d Money still makes its way into politics, but often through PACs and Super PACs, which reduces accountability as candidates cannot be held responsible for actions of other organizations. These regulations also disenfranchise good candidates who are not rich, but seek funding from those who are.\n\nThis camp also argues the current system is illogical. In some cases, donating $48,600 to candidates would be legal, but donating $48,601 would be illegal. Some argue that one dollar is a poor determinant of ethics and arbitrary limits make no sense.\n\nLiberal justices largely fall into the former group. Justices Kagan, Ginsburg, and Breyer argued that eliminating caps on contributions will lead to increased influence of the wealthy, while smaller donors might feel as though their voices are irrelevant. Justice Scalia countered that, while smaller donors may potentially feel this way, capping contributions ensures suppression of wealthy donors\u2019 speech.\n\n\u201cI assume that a law that only prohibits the speech of 2 percent of the country is OK,\u201d Scalia said sarcastically during oral arguments on Tuesday.\n\nThe regulations\u2019 potential constitutional conflict is the crux of the case and the only issue with which the Court should be concerned. The duty of the Court is not to determine whether a law is beneficial, nor whether striking down a law will cause negative results. That is the definition of \u201clegislating from the bench.\u201d\n\nHowever, instead of increasing regulations on donors or making the system a free-for-all, a third alternative is to make all donations anonymous. In a Cato Institute publication \u201cShould Campaign Donors Be Identified?\u201d Ian Ayers compares a potential donation system to the current voting system.\n\n\u201cBallot secrecy was adopted toward the end of the nineteenth century to deter political corruption,\u201d Ayers wrote. Candidates could not easily buy votes, as they did not know who voted for them.\n\nSimilarly, imagine if donors had to make \u201ccontributions through blind trusts that would keep candidates from learning the identity of their supporters.\u201d Mandated anonymity would mean donors could no longer pay for influence. A donor may say he donated thousands to a campaign, but the recipient would not know the truth of that claim. This would also prevent politicians from \u201cextorting donations.\u201d\n\nWhile the opposite approach \u2014 mandated disclosure \u2014 holds donors accountable for their donations, mandated anonymity would discourage donations for hope of unethical return on investment, and encourage donations to the best candidates for the locality. On Tuesday, Justice Kagan repeatedly mentioned concern over candidates and other recipients of donations knowing from whom donations came, and the ethical implications. This could be solved by mandated anonymity.\n\nThe best part of this system is that it is absolutely constitutional and does not limit free speech. Unlike other approaches, it neither violates the First Amendment, nor does it allow for cronyism.\n\nIf the provisions in question violate the First Amendment, they must be stricken. The Supreme Court exists to ensure laws exist in accordance with, not in contrast to, the Constitution. However, this mandated anonymity can accomplish what donation caps could not \u2014 honest and ethical money in politics.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "McCutcheon v.
