The decision marks the first time that a juvenile sentenced to life without the option of parole has been released in the state.\n\nKristina Joy Fetters, now 33, has left the confines of the Iowa Correctional Institution for Women in Mitchellville for the first time since her imprisonment at age 15. She will now be transferred to hospice care for breast cancer treatment. Fetters spent Monday in an area hospital after she reportedly experienced pains all throughout last weekend, the Des Moines Register reports.\n\nThe dying inmate was just 14 at the time she brutally stabbed and killer her elderly aunt, Arlene Louise Klehm, 73, who was like a mother to her. Detective Neil Shultz from Polk County told the Register in October 1994, \"It was a grisly scene. Very brutal. Bloody.\" An autopsy showed that Klehm died of a combination of forceful blows and stab wounds.\n\nKlehm\u2019s brother, Winston Crandell, believed Fetters was a \u201cgood, kind of a typical kid in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nHer family continues to support her now that she has been left paralyzed, unable to walk by breast cancer. \u201cIt\u2019s now time for my family to have closure,\u201d said Fetters\u2019 aunt, Darcy Olson, the Daily News reports. \u201cKris\u2019 impending death cannot be denied, and while there has been negative comments, we believe, as the victims, that this family has suffered enough.\u201d\n\nFetters was diagnosed with inoperable stage IV breast cancer in September, and the disease has since then spread rapidly throughout her body.\n\nThe National Breast Cancer Foundation says in stage IV, the cancer has spread to other organs of the body, most often the bones, liver, or brain. Although this stage is thought to be considered incurable, advances in research and medical technology have allowed more and more women to live longer by treating the disease as a chronic condition. Typically, a stage IV breast cancer prognosis has a poor five-year overall survival rate of 15 percent.\n\nFetters\u2019 case remains rare since she is the first Iowa inmate serving a life term without the possibility of parole, to have her sentence changed. A U.S. Supreme Court 2012 ruling deems life without parole unconstitutional for juveniles. Following the major ruling, Fetters was re-sentenced with parole as an option in November of this year.\n\nThe decision to release Fetters on hospice-only parole has generated conflict among the Iowa Parole Board. Jason Carlstrom, the chair of the board, wanted to delay Fetters\u2019 release to see how her body would respond to the treatment. However, Doris Kelley, a board member, disagreed with Carlstrom and placed emphasis on the safety of Fetters. \u201cNot only are we worried about public safety, we\u2019re also concerned about her safety,\u201d she said. The dying inmate has been the subject of eight different disciplinary reports since 2007 and is considered to be far from a \u201cmodel inmate.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Fetters is helped by trained inmates in the the Iowa Correctional Institution for Women\u2019s hospice unit. She is expected to be transferred from the prison to Hospice Care of Central Iowa in the upcoming weeks. The cancer patient inmate will be under \"intense supervision, including regular contact from a parole officer,\u201d during her time in the hospice center.\n\nIf Fetters\u2019 condition improves to the point where she is discharged from the hospice, the board will be able to revisit her case and a make decision on her release. Until then, the dying inmate originally sentenced to life, will receive the support of her family during her battle with breast cancer outside bars.\n\n\u201cShe needs a momma\u2019s support and prayers, so that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to be,\u201d Fetters\u2019 mom, Denise told the Register.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kristina fetters, iowa dying inmate, terminal cancer, stage iv breast cancer, life sentence, parole, hospice", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Kristina Fetters, Iowa dying inmate sentenced to life, is granted parole after being diagnosed with inoperable stage IV breast cancer.", "title": "Iowa Inmate Granted Unprecedented Parole After Terminal Breast Cancer Diagnosis", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/iowa-inmate-kristina-fetters-granted-parole-after-terminal-breast-cancer-diagnosis-264463", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/05/hands-inmate-behind-bars.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kristina Fetters, Iowa dying inmate sentenced to life, is granted parole after being diagnosed with inoperable stage IV breast cancer.", "title": "Iowa Inmate Granted Unprecedented Parole After Terminal Breast Cancer Diagnosis", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/iowa-inmate-kristina-fetters-granted-parole-after-terminal-breast-cancer-diagnosis-264463", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/05/hands-inmate-behind-bars.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/05/hands-inmate-behind-bars.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2013-12-05T18:56:50-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-05T18:56:50-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Kristina Fetters, Iowa dying inmate sentenced to life, is granted parole after being diagnosed with inoperable stage IV breast cancer."}, "article_summary": "The decision to release Fetters on hospice-only parole has generated conflict among the Iowa Parole Board.\nA convicted murderer from Iowa, sentenced to life as a juvenile, has been granted unprecedented parole after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.\nTypically, a stage IV breast cancer prognosis has a poor five-year overall survival rate of 15 percent.\nThe National Breast Cancer Foundation says in stage IV, the cancer has spread to other organs of the body, most often the bones, liver, or brain.\nShe will now be transferred to hospice care for breast cancer treatment."}
