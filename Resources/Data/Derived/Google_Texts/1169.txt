The Colorado Department of Transportation reports traffic delays on both I-70 and I-25.

Heavy traffic is reported with 50 minute delays on eastbound Interstate 70 from Silverthorne to C-470, CDOT said.

An accident on westbound Interstate 70 west of Idaho Springs, at approximately mile marker 238, has caused the closure of the right lane.

“Folks are getting through. It’s just a little slower,” said Emily Wilfong, CDOT spokeswoman.

An accident north of Alameda Avenue has slowed traffic on northbound I-25, CDOT reports.
