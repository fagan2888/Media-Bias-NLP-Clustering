Panelists discussed innovations that have replaced traditional or established technologies and processes within the health system. Such advances are commonly referred to as \u201cdisruptive technology\u201d and have been known to improve efficiency and reduce costs.\n\nWith the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, national spending on health care as a percentage of gross domestic product has declined from 17.8% to 17.2%, a spending reduction of about $900 million per year, Clinton said. Still, the United States lags well behind Europe in reducing health spending, according to World Bank statistics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that closing the rest of the gap \u2026 is going to require really creative partnerships in every community in the country,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nIn conversation with Clinton, panelists speaking on disruptive technology stressed the importance of transparency and data sharing to ensure better access to care.\n\n\u201cAccess to health information is a basic human right,\u201d said Elizabeth Holmes, a young Silicon Valley entrepreneur who founded Theranos, a blood analytics and diagnostics company. Clinton, who applauded her work to provide low-cost testing to the general public, said the company is valued at $9 billion.\n\nHowever, early interventions, such as those offered by Theranos, generally are not covered by insurance. Holmes said about 80 million Americans are pre-diabetic, but 90% don\u2019t know it and would just need a simple glucose test to find out.\n\nJosh Kushner \u2014 co-founder of Oscar, a health insurance startup that markets itself directly to consumers \u2014 stressed that access to information is critical for reducing costs, and central to his business model.\n\n\u201cIf you think about health insurance, in reality, it\u2019s one of the most important relationships that we have from a human perspective and a cost perspective,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cWhat we say often is that health insurance companies have done everything they can to acquire customers, but shortly thereafter avoid them.\u201d\n\nHe said health care companies will need to transform into technology companies in the next decade or become obsolete.\n\n\u201cAmazon and Google know almost immediately when a woman is pregnant based on what she\u2019s searching for, but a health insurance company doesn\u2019t know until three months later when its claim is paid,\u201d he said.\n\nConnectivity, Integration Examined in Panel Discussions\n\nOther panel discussions centered on integrating disparate areas of the health system.\n\nOne session addressed the challenges in linking behavioral health services with primary care. That discussion turned to who will pick up the cost for increased behavioral health services. William Emmet, executive director of the Kennedy Forum, said employers\u2019 incentive to pay for preventive services is to avoid lost productivity and absenteeism when workers have mental health conditions.\n\nHe told California Healthline that the challenge of linking primary care and behavioral health hinges on undoing centuries of segregation.\n\n\u201cThe [ACA] pushes further along the lines of a system that is integrated because it incentivizes providers to look at the whole person,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is going to take time for primary care providers to realize if they don\u2019t treat behavioral health conditions, they\u2019re not going to be getting the outcomes they need.\u201d\n\nAnother panel took up the issue of connectivity and how to effectively interact with patient populations to improve services and health outcomes.\n\nVineet Singal, a young tech entrepreneur, said texting is \u201cthe equalizing force between the haves and have-nots of society.\u201d He is CEO of CareMessage, a not-for-profit organization that uses mobile technologies to improve health literacy and self-health management.\n\nTo connect patients with caregivers, he said his organization built a platform that relies on texting for chronic disease management used by 100 clinics, hospitals and health plans. To get providers to adopt the technology he had to prove that low-income patients would use text messaging. Contrary to provider assumptions, 95% of their members have a cell phone, and 85% have unlimited text messaging, he said.\n\n\u201cThey just did not understand how advanced their patient population was,\u201d he said.\n\nHealth Care Economics\n\nDuring the conference\u2019s last panel, Clinton returned to the topic of data sharing as a means to reduce health care spending and improve preventive care.\n\nBruce Broussard, Humana president and CEO, stressed the link between patient engagement and data sharing.\n\n\u201cWhen people know their numbers, they make more effective decisions,\u201d he said.\n\nMeredith Rosenthal, a Harvard University health economics and policy professor, said changing national agricultural policies that affect food content and access to healthy food would have the biggest impact on improving the nation\u2019s health system.\n\nClinton used diabetes, a preventable illness, as an example of the relationship between unhealthy eating and chronic disease. He said diabetes is consuming 25% of the Medicaid budget.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s staggering,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to turn the Titanic around before it hits the iceberg.\u201d\n\nClinton asked the panelists if any stakeholders would be willing to engage in a dialogue between the food industry and health care industry to improve wellness. Broussard pledged to participate.\n\nNew Initiatives Launched\n\nDuring the conference, the Clinton Foundation announced a partnership with Kal\u00e9o, a pharmaceutical company that manufactures a naloxone auto-injector for reversing heroin and prescription opioid overdoses. The device can be administered without medical training and is expected to now be more affordable for many municipalities. The company has pledged to offer the devices at a reduced rate to colleges and universities, police departments and other community organizations.\n\nAs part of its Health Matters initiative, the Clinton Foundation chose the Coachella Valley in Southern California in December 2012 and central Arkansas in May 2013 as regions to launch pilot projects to improve community health outcomes. The foundation has since expanded its projects to Adams County, Mississippi, northern Florida and Houston.\n\nEach region has developed a strategic plan to improve specific health outcomes in five years. According to the Coachella Valley\u2019s plan, those goals \u2014 such as more access to healthy foods and lower health care costs \u2014 will be reached by 2018. Clinton seemed optimistic that the pilot projects have been effective locally.\n\n\u201cThis is where we started this effort,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we can already see improvement in a lot of health indicators.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and technologists weighed in on how the nation's health care system can be improved with \"disruptive technology\" at the Clinton Foundation's Fourth Annual Health Matters Activation Summit last week in Riverside County.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and technologists weighed in on how the nation\u2019s health care system can be improved with \u201cdisruptive technology\u201d at the Clinton Foundation\u2019s Fou\u2026", "title": "Disruptive Technology Main Focus at Clinton Health Matters Conference", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/disruptive-technology-main-focus-at-clinton-foundations-health-matters-conference/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-02-05T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-05T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Health Care EconomicsDuring the conference\u2019s last panel, Clinton returned to the topic of data sharing as a means to reduce health care spending and improve preventive care.\nStill, the United States lags well behind Europe in reducing health spending, according to World Bank statistics.\nClinton led two panel discussions with leading health experts and Silicon Valley technologists at the conference, which focused on highlighting innovations and strategies for improving the nation\u2019s health care system.\nPanelists discussed innovations that have replaced traditional or established technologies and processes within the health system.\nAccording to the Coachella Valley\u2019s plan, those goals \u2014 such as more access to healthy foods and lower health care costs \u2014 will be reached by 2018."}
