Where is the ideal place to live in the United States? What factors go into choosing the best place for you and your family to settle long term? The AARP Public Policy Institute released their first results from a new “livability index” recently, naming the top cities and neighborhoods to live long into retirement. AARP looked at factors such as access to health care, community involvement, and affordable housing accessibility. Despite coming from AARP, the livability index is intended to inform people of all ages about the pros and cons of different communities.They also broke cities into size categories: large (500,000+ people), medium (100,000-500,000 people), and small (25,000-100,000 people). Throughout the categories, the upper Midwest seemed to meet most of the requirements set forth by AARP, but in the larger cities the geography is more diverse. AARP also introduced a new tool where you can see the livability index of your current town.The health scores we highlight are made up of several different categories, including the smoking and obesity rates, as well as patient satisfaction, access, and unnecessary hospitalization rates. We chose to highlight medium-sized cities, as not everyone wants to live in Seattle or Boston.Here are the top 10 middle-sized cities according to the livability index:
