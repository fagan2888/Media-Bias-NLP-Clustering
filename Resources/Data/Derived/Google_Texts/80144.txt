Rep. Vince McAllister missed another roll call vote in the House on Tuesday as fallout from his infidelity scandal continued to escalate, with the husband of the staffer involved in the caught-on-camera incident telling the media that he's leaving his wife and accusing the congressman of destroying his family.

Heath Peacock told "Inside Edition " that the conservative freshman lawmaker, who ran for the northeast Louisiana seat as a devoted Christian father of five, is to blame for the problems in his marriage.

“He’s had a hand in not only turning my life upside down, but my son’s also. He doesn’t care. He thinks he’s untouchable,” Peacock said, according to a press release from the syndicated tabloid-news program. Peacock's wife, Melissa Hixon Peacock, and McAllister were captured kissing in the congressman's district office by a surveillance camera and the footage was mysteriously leaked and posted online Monday.

Since then, McAllister has issued a short statement asking for "forgiveness" and given a more detailed explanation to his hometown newspaper , in which he said he won't resign, admitted to the infidelity and said he and his wife are working through the incident. But he hasn't been seen on Capitol Hill, where his office is locked and he missed two votes Monday and another Tuesday afternoon.
