The Miami Dolphins, NFL runners-up in 1971 and NFL champions in 1972.\n\nAnd after getting destroyed by the Dallas Cowboys 24-3 in Super Bowl VI \u2014 is Bob Lilly still chasing Bob Griese? \u2014 all the Dolphins had to do was post a 17-0 record to reach the 1972 summit.\n\nThat was five or six football fads ago. It was before the Steel Curtain, a decade before Bill Walsh\u2019s West Coast offense, before the Chicago Bears\u2019 46 defense, before quarterbacks all but made running backs such as Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick obsolete. A long, long time ago.\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy for the Broncos to win it all in the 2014 season.\n\n\u201cWe can get better,\u201d coach John Fox said at the NFL scouting combine. \u201cWe will get better.\u201d\n\nThe transient nature of the 21st- century NFL makes it difficult for any team to put together back-to-back super seasons. The New England Patriots were the last team to repeat as Super Bowl champions (2003 and 2004). The Broncos were NFL champions in the 1997 and 1998 seasons.\n\nA Super Bowl loser returning to merely play in the Super Bowl, though, requires a longer memory.\n\n\u201cHow far back you going with that?\u201d said Seattle coach Pete Carroll, whose Seahawks are three weeks removed from crushing the Broncos 43-8 in Super Bowl XLVIII at the Meadowlands.\n\nAll the way back to the 1993 Buffalo Bills, who finished a string of four consecutive Super Bowl losses that season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an awfully long season,\u201d said Bill Polian, the general manager of those four Super Bowl-losing Bills teams and the GM for Peyton Manning\u2019s Indianapolis Colts, who won the Super Bowl in the 2006 season and lost it in 2009. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be very careful about how you manage your team the following year. Recovery. Legs. The offseason goes very fast. That\u2019s an issue.\u201d\n\nCarroll said the Seahawks are aware of the \u201cSuper Bowl hangover,\u201d and he has a different theory about why it occurs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it that we\u2019re going to try to navigate so it doesn\u2019t happen to us,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has anything to do with the extended season. I think it has to do with roster changes.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens of the 2012 season. They lost Ray Lewis, Ed Reed, Anquan Boldin and Paul Kruger, among others, after becoming the champs.\n\n\u201cI would say No. 1 it\u2019s the parity,\u201d said Broncos GM John Elway.\n\nIt can\u2019t be a coincidence that NFL free agency began in 1993 \u2014 the last time a Super Bowl loser returned to the Big Game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised. I didn\u2019t realize the loser has had that much trouble as well,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cBut I do think it has to do with how you are prepared to handle whatever you deal with \u2014 the good, the bad, the hard stuff \u2014 and how solid is your mentality, so that you can recreate it.\u201d\n\nRich Gannon believes from personal experience that a negative mind-set is a huge reason the Super Bowl loser doesn\u2019t rebound well.\n\nThe similarities between Gannon\u2019s 2002 Oakland Raiders and Manning\u2019s 2013 Broncos are staggering. Gannon, like Manning, was the league\u2019s MVP. Gannon, like Manning, led his team to the league\u2019s No. 1 offensive ranking.\n\nThe Raiders, like the Broncos, faced a Super Bowl opponent that was below average on offense (the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ranked No. 24 in 2002 and Seattle was No. 17 in 2013), but ranked No. 1 on defense. And Gannon\u2019s Raiders, like Manning\u2019s Broncos, got destroyed by the defensive-oriented team in the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cIt can be such a negative thing, a major disappointment,\u201d Gannon said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen coaches who have actually been depressed into the following spring. Still talking about it, still dealing with it as a negative thing. Instead of moving past it and saying, \u2018Hey, look, we did a lot of good things to even get there, let\u2019s see if we can find a way to get back.\u201d\n\nThe tricky part for the Broncos this offseason: Don\u2019t chase Seattle at the expense of losing what got them the 15 victories to make it to the Super Bowl in the first place.\n\n\u201cI think everyone is going to look at Seattle and evaluate them, because everyone does that to every Super Bowl winner every year,\u201d Elway said. \u201cBut we\u2019re still going to have the same personnel for the most part that we\u2019ve had offensively and defensively and obviously try to get better on both sides. But our personality is not going to change because of Seattle and the way they played and won the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nA cure for Super Bowl hangover\n\nSeven positions the Broncos should address if they are to become the first NFL team since the 1971-72 Miami Dolphins to lose the Super Bowl one season and win it the next season:\n\nWIDE RECEIVER\n\nIf the Broncos don\u2019t re-sign Eric Decker and/or Andre Caldwell, free agents who might be available on one-year deals include Jeremy Maclin, Jacoby Jones and Hakeem Nicks.\n\nDEFENSIVE END\n\nThe Broncos hope to re-sign Shaun Phillips, but Robert Ayers might leave and there\u2019s still some unknown with Derek Wolfe\u2019s illness. Free agents would include Jared Allen and Lamarr Houston.\n\nMIDDLE LINEBACKER\n\nJon Beason and Jonathan Vilma are among the free agents, but it would be nice if the Broncos could draft a starter such as Wisconsin\u2019s Chris Borland.\n\nCORNERBACK\n\nDominique Rodgers-Cromartie is a free agent, Champ Bailey may or may not accept a pay cut and Chris Harris is coming off an ACL injury. Aqib Talib is the best of the physical corners on the market.\n\nSAFETY\n\nT.J. Ward is a terrific strong safety if his body can hold up. He was drafted in 2010 by Browns GM Tom Heckert, now the Broncos\u2019 director of pro personnel. Louis Delmas and Donte Whitner would also fit.\n\nGUARD-CENTER\n\nWith Ryan Clady returning to left tackle, Chris Clark could move to right tackle and Orlando Franklin could move inside to replace free-agent left guard Zane Beadles. Or the Broncos could sign free-agent guard Travelle Wharton or center Alex Mack.\n\nRUNNING BACK\n\nKnowshon Moreno might leave. Wouldn\u2019t Darren McFadden, who has had many of his best games against the Broncos, help alongside Montee Ball? James Starks, LeGarrette Blount, Maurice Jones-Drew and Donald Brown also are free agents.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NFL history says it will be tough for Denver Broncos to reach Super Bowl XLIX", "title": "NFL history says it will be tough for Denver Broncos to reach Super Bowl XLIX", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/22/nfl-history-says-it-will-be-tough-for-denver-broncos-to-reach-super-bowl-xlix/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140222__20140223_CC12_SP23FBNBRONXp1.jpg", "height": 482}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140222__20140223_CC12_SP23FBNBRONXp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-22T19:32:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T15:32:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A Super Bowl loser returning to merely play in the Super Bowl, though, requires a longer memory.\nAnd after getting destroyed by the Dallas Cowboys 24-3 in Super Bowl VI \u2014 is Bob Lilly still chasing Bob Griese?\nThat\u2019s an issue.\u201dCarroll said the Seahawks are aware of the \u201cSuper Bowl hangover,\u201d and he has a different theory about why it occurs.\nIt can\u2019t be a coincidence that NFL free agency began in 1993 \u2014 the last time a Super Bowl loser returned to the Big Game.\nAll the way back to the 1993 Buffalo Bills, who finished a string of four consecutive Super Bowl losses that season."}
