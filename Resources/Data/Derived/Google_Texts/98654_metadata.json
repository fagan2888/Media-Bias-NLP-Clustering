Andrew Cuomo insults the legacy of his late father, liberal icon Mario Cuomo, by claiming that businesses paying the minimum wage \u201csteal\u2019\u2019 $2 billion from taxpayers because their workers can get government subsidies, according to one of the state\u2019s best-known fiscal analysts.\n\nEmpire Center for Public Policy President E.J. McMahon, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow and former SUNY vice chancellor, said low-paid workers are, in fact, using the very same \u201csafety-net\u2019\u2019 programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) that Mario Cuomo \u2014 and President Bill Clinton \u2014 once championed.\n\nThe current Gov. Cuomo, conducting an aggressive, union-backed crusade in his father\u2019s name for a mandatory $15-an-hour minimum wage, unleashed a jaw-dropping attack on a portion of the private sector last week by claiming low-wage businesses are \u201cstealing from the taxpayers of this state\u2019\u2019 because their workers are entitled to state and federal benefits.\n\nCuomo, who is competing with Mayor Bill de Blasio for the title of New York\u2019s leading \u201cprogressive,\u2019\u2019 also called the long-standing state policy of providing assistance to the working poor \u201cthe mother of all loopholes\u2019\u2019 and a \u201cscam.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe claimed that $2 billion in unjustified government subsidies were flowing to low-income workers, contending, \u201cRaise the minimum wage, and I\u2019d rather take that $2 billion and do a tax cut for the people of the state.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe trouble for Cuomo, according to McMahon, is that the \u201cscam\u2019\u2019 of the government helping low-income workers was long championed by his father, as well as a generation of Democratic and Republican political leaders.\n\n\u201cThe largest direct cash benefit in a typical low-income worker\u2019s public-assistance package is the Earned Income Tax Credit \u2014 pioneered in New York state by the late former Gov. Mario Cuomo,\u2019\u2019 noted McMahon, whose conservative-oriented think tank has at times praised the current governor.\n\n\u201cThe logical implication of Cuomo\u2019s claim is that programs such as the EITC and food stamps for working people should be sharply curtailed, if not repealed.\n\n\u201cHis rhetoric also implies that New York should roll back benefits made available to working families . . . subsidized by the Medicaid expansion under President Obama\u2019s federal Affordable Care Act,\u2019\u2019 McMahon continued.\n\nMcMahon also noted that Mario Cuomo had once described Bill Clinton\u2019s role in expanding the EITC for the working poor as one of the former president\u2019s most important accomplishments.\n\nAnd he also cited a Mario Cuomo budget address in which the then-governor strongly supported the Earned Income Tax Credit as a way to \u201cenhance work incentives for poor families.\u2019\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, McMahon suggested that if Andrew Cuomo wanted to target business tax giveaways, he should look at his own programs, \u201csuch as the $420 million a year the state doles out to wealthy film and TV producers, or the state\u2019s $750 million speculative investment in billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s solar-panel factory in Buffalo, or the 100 percent tax exemptions that will flow to the handpicked corporate occupants of the \u2018Start-Up NY\u2019 zones.\u2019\u2019\n\nAn Empire Center analysis released earlier this month predicted that a $15-an-hour minimum wage \u2014 a nearly 70 percent hike over the current minimum \u2014 would cost New York at least 200,000 jobs, and perhaps as many as 588,800.\n\nFormer Republican US Sen.
