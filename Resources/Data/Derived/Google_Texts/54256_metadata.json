Unless you live in the northeast corridor or western Michigan (I just learned), most don\u2019t go over 79 miles per hour. Riding the train is expensive, sometimes more than flying. They zip-zag. Oy, do they zig-zag.\n\nPretend you want to go to Santa Fe, N.M. Your first leg on the Silver Meteor leaves Savannah at 7:30 p.m. and gets into Washington, D.C., at 7 a.m. Then you wait for the 3 p.m. Capitol Limited to Chicago. Crazy, I know. Completely the wrong direction. You\u2019re going north but you really want to go southwest. But you find something to do. If you\u2019re lucky, like I was the other day, you find a group of people who have business at the National Mall, a 20-minute walk away. I hooked up with a bunch of doctors who were carrying signs, heading to the Supreme Court, which was about to hear arguments in King v. Burwell over the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt\u2019s empowering to be around purpose. I had purpose, too. I had Flat Stanley, that mythical cutout child\u2019s figure that encourages letter writing around the world.\n\n\u201cWould you mind holding up Flat Stanley?\u201d I said to a protester squeezed next to me. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d\n\nBut he knew the story. He messed up last summer when his niece asked for the favor and he didn\u2019t mail it back on time. So he was glad to oblige. When it started to rain, I headed back to Union Station, a Daniel Burnham architectural wonder of vaulted spaces and gold leaf. Because it was early in the week, when the New York Times puzzle is easier, I managed to fill in a few more squares than usual.\n\nSometime later \u2014 it could have been a week, at that point; I had lost track \u2014 I boarded the Southwest Chief after waiting in Chicago\u2019s Great Room, a 110-foot-high hall of Romanesque columns, barrel-vaulted skylight and hard wooden railroad benches.\n\nTrain travel wasn\u2019t always so kaflooey. In the early 1930s, when my parents boarded a train in Detroit and headed out to Los Angeles for their honeymoon, they joined some 40,000 other people that night bedding down in Pullman \u201csleeper\u201d cars. That would have made the Pullman Company the largest hotel in the world. Alas, most of us sleep in coach. It\u2019s cheap. It\u2019s cozy.\n\nNot long after that, we Americans started trading in trains for cars. We decided we\u2019d rather fly. Trains in this country became pass\u00e9, old-fashioned. After that no one bothered keeping up the existing tracks. They rusted in the rain. They went kaput. So did the axiom that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. By the time Amtrak picked up the slack in 1971, the problems were monumental.\n\nNo matter. There are still perks to trains. This Capitol Limited is a double-decker. It has an observation car with swivel chairs and little tables, where you can watch the real America pass by. That\u2019s where I found the conductor, listening to his walkie-talkie, looking out at the scenery, at wind turbines, ball fields, graffiti, Redeemer Missionary Baptist churches, red barns, yellow tractors, blue shipping containers, slopes of limestone, patches of creamy white snow that looked like cotton and the winter woods, which rushed past us like they were grainy film on fast forward.\n\nWe started chatting because that\u2019s what you can do on trains. You can chat. One morning I had breakfast, boarding house style, with a city manager from suburban Chicago. In between bites of French toast, he said he liked the train so he can relax from his job. Earlier I talked to a teacher from Pittsburgh who was returning home after visiting her ailing father in South Bend.\n\nFirst I asked the conductor if I could take a picture of him with Flat Stanley. No problem. Then I asked why the toilet didn\u2019t flush in Cleveland. Good question, he said. The air hose broke and he didn\u2019t have a second pipe wrench to fix it. So he called ahead and when we pulled into Toledo someone brought him the second wrench. When the train stopped he and the assistant scooted under the car and using their legs for leverage replaced the faulty hose. It took 20 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt was a work of art,\u201d he said.\n\nI doubt trains will ever replace highway congestion (neither will more roads). But what a way to see the country. Just ask Flat Stanley.\n\nJane Fishman\u2019s columns appear weekly in Accent.
