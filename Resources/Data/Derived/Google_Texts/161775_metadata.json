Jim Pace, a political rookie and wealthy businessman from Peachtree City who is partially self-funding his campaign, used some of the money from his sizable war chest to unveil his first television ad in the lead-up to the May 24 primary.\n\nThe 30-second spot begins with images of Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama juxtaposed with pictures of children. Pace then highlights his stances on red meat issues such as border security, the 2010 healthcare law and fighting the Islamic State. The ad is currently running in the Atlanta and Columbus media markets on channels including Fox News.\n\nHere\u2019s a transcript:\n\n\u201cCareer politicians in Washington are putting their ambition first, jeopardizing the future of our children who hold the promise of tomorrow.

The winner of that contest will face one of two Democrats seeking their party\u2019s nod this May.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2016/05/12/jim-pace-unveils-first-tv-ad-ahead-of-open-third-district-congressional-primary/", "image": "http://www.ajc.com/ogimage.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It's crunch time for the bevy of Republican candidates looking to distinguish themselves in the crowded race to succeed Lynn Westmoreland in Georgia's Third Congressional District.
