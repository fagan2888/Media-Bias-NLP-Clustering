Boeing received a similar order for a manned flight back in May. The missions will take place on SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon and Boeing\u2019s CST-100 Starliner spacecrafts.\n\nThe space agency has not determined which company will deploy first, but the contracts specify launches in late 2017, provided they meet all the necessary certifications and Congress allocates enough funding for the missions.\n\nThis will represent the first time private space companies transport US astronauts into space\u2014the US has relied on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS after the discontinuation of its shuttle program in 2011. NASA said the SpaceX and Boeing flights will cost less per seat than Russia\u2019s Soyuz capsules, which cost $70 million per seat.\n\nBut if funding from Congress is not enough to cover the contracts, the flights will be delayed and the agency will have to continue hitching rides on Russian spacecrafts. NASA has not specified the cost of the SpaceX and Boeing contracts.\n\n\u201cWhen Crew Dragon takes NASA astronauts to the space station in 2017, they will be riding in one of the safest, most reliable spacecraft ever flown,\u201d Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX\u2019s president and chief operating office, said in a statement.\n\nSpaceX grounded its Falcon 9 rockets in June after an unmanned rocket exploded minutes after its launch. An initial assessment said the cause was a faulty steel strut.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alice Truong", "description": "A lot depends on Congressional funding.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "A lot depends on Congressional funding.", "title": "NASA has Given SpaceX the Order to Transport Astronauts in 2017", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/technology/2015/11/nasa-has-given-spacex-order-transport-astronauts-2017/123925/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/11/23/112315spacex.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/11/23/112315spacex/open-graph.jpg", "description": "A lot depends on Congressional funding.", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "NASA has Given SpaceX the Order to Transport Astronauts in 2017"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-23T14:32:36Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/11/23/112315spacex.jpg", "sailthru.title": "NASA has Given SpaceX the Order to Transport Astronauts in 2017", "keywords": "nasa, international space station, spacex", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/11/23/112315spacex/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "nasa,spacex,channel-technology,type-story,length-short,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "A lot depends on Congressional funding."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddcbb\"", "article_summary": "On Friday, NASA awarded a work order to Elon Musk\u2019s private space firm, SpaceX, to transport astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS).\nNASA said the SpaceX and Boeing flights will cost less per seat than Russia\u2019s Soyuz capsules, which cost $70 million per seat.\nThis will represent the first time private space companies transport US astronauts into space\u2014the US has relied on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS after the discontinuation of its shuttle program in 2011.\nNASA has not specified the cost of the SpaceX and Boeing contracts.\n\u201cWhen Crew Dragon takes NASA astronauts to the space station in 2017, they will be riding in one of the safest, most reliable spacecraft ever flown,\u201d Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX\u2019s president and chief operating office, said in a statement."}
