She was happy to reveal her age; people don\u2019t believe her anyway.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 53,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s my nonalcoholic, meditative, yogic, vegan lifestyle.\u201d\n\nEven their children seemed to be on board. Piatt put a mountainous platter of nachos at the center of the dining table, and the four of them, ages 8 to 20, ravenously dug in, with no grousing about the absence of sour cream and Monterey Jack.\n\n\u201cIs everyone good?\u201d Piatt asked. \u201cDoes anyone want more cashew cheese?\u201d\n\nThe scene looked exactly like a page out of \u201cThe Plantpower Way,\u201d with Pacific Coast light streaming through the windows of a modernist house so striking that Roll rents it out for movies and commercials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad tribe to be in,\u201d said Andrew Pasquella, an artist and friend who lives in an Airstream trailer on the property.\n\nAnd that\u2019s precisely the point: Roll and Piatt are vegans, and they\u2019re on a mission to let people know that enlisting with their tribe doesn\u2019t have to feel like being trapped in a fragrant tent with \u201cthe dreadlocked hippie who is kicking the Hacky Sack,\u201d as Roll put it.\n\nVeganism has been edging into the mainstream for years now, coaxed along by superstar believers like Bill Clinton and Beyonc\u00e9. But lately, as plant-based eating has blossomed and gained followers, influential vegans are laboring to supplant its dowdy, spartan image with a new look: glamorous, prosperous, sexy and epidermally beaming with health.\n\n\u201cBeing a vegan has crossed over into fashion territory,\u201d said Kerry Diamond, the editor of Yahoo Food and the editorial director of Cherry Bombe magazine. Decades back \u201cthere was nothing chic about it,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s become a thing.\u201d\n\nAspirational and modern\n\nRoll, who also wrote the best-selling \u201cFinding Ultra,\u201d about his midlife search for truth and health while switching to a vegan diet and pushing himself to compete in grueling athletic challenges, acknowledges that the dreamy visuals in \u201cThe Plantpower Way\u201d are meant to give vegan living a more vogue-ish spin.\n\n\u201cIt was a very conscious effort to kind of counterprogram,\u201d he said. \u201cOur whole idea was to present this lifestyle in an aspirational and modern way. We want to present it in a way that looks appealing, as opposed to deprivation-oriented.\u201d Or as Piatt described it, \u201cThere\u2019s no body odor coming off the pages.\u201d\n\nPeople have adopted veganism for virtuous reasons, but vanity plays an undeniable role as well. It\u2019s not uncommon to hear vegans mooning over \u201cthe glow,\u201d an incandescence that starts to emanate from within after a few weeks or months of eating only plants. (To cite one example: \u201cThe Oh She Glows Cookbook.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThere are definitely some really nice superficial benefits to the whole thing,\u201d said popular British blogger Ella Woodward, 24, whose book \u201cDeliciously Ella\u201d chronicles her success in conquering health problems with a plant-oriented (she eschews the V-word) regimen. \u201cMy skin is so much cleaner and clearer.\u201d\n\nVegan cooking itself has gone through a stark transformation, and so has the way it is sold: In some coastal pockets, at least, stern sermons have been replaced by the seductive allure of la dolce vita. Nonvegans are welcomed, not shunned.\n\n\u201cThe message has changed,\u201d said Kathy Freston, an author and vegan proponent. \u201cAnd we have moved away from that old dogma.\u201d\n\nThe embryonic incarnation of veganism usually came with a touch of puritanical renunciation. Vegan America remained a colorless, flavor-averse realm of microwaved bean burritos and tofu strips layered like paving stones over desiccated pebbles of brown rice, if not the \u201cmashed yeast\u201d choked down by Woody Allen in \u201cAnnie Hall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s still what people think of when they think of vegan food,\u201d said musician Moby, 50, who has been a vegan for 28 years. But lately he has been immersed in the writing of chefs like Thomas Keller and Alice Waters as he gears up for the November opening of Little Pine, a vegan restaurant he is opening in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. Moby wants it to be, he said, \u201ca wonderful restaurant even when judged by conventional standards.\u201d\n\nVegan glam is on full display at Crossroads, a restaurant on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, where this month servers grandly hauled to tables a gleaming \u201cseafood tower\u201d that looked like something Orson Welles would order at an Old Hollywood nightclub. Instead of lobster, it had lobster mushrooms; in place of calamari, sustainably harvested hearts of palm. And was that oysters Rockefeller? No, it was an artichoke leaf cradling a shiitake mushroom that had been poached in olive oil and covered with spinach and bread crumbs.\n\nThe extravagant tower, said Tal Ronnen, the chef and an owner of Crossroads, is an example of \u201ccreating things that people don\u2019t think you can have in the plant-based world.\u201d His latest cookbook, \u201cCrossroads: Extraordinary Recipes From the Restaurant That Is Reinventing Vegan Cuisine,\u201d contains blurbs from Clinton, Paul McCartney, chef Roy Choi and Jay Z.\n\nChad Sarno, a 39-year-old chef and culinary educator in Austin, Texas, remembers a time when you\u2019d step into a restaurant and \u201cyou would say the vegan word and the chef would look at you like you had three heads and just got off the commune.\u201d Now, with influential nonvegan chefs like David Kinch and Alain Passard rhapsodizing about the glory of vegetables, the dialogue has shifted. \u201cPlants are so sexy,\u201d Sarno said.\n\nIn New York, diners can easily opt to go fully vegan at Superiority Burger, Dimes and the Butcher\u2019s Daughter. There is a steady line out the door during lunchtime at By Chloe, where chef Chloe Coscarelli, at 27 already the author of several cookbooks, stresses that her veggie burgers and quinoa taco salads will not leave diners hungrily chomping on their own knuckles.\n\n\u201cI want to be normal,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do we have to make it a downer to be in here?\u201d\n\nA faith or a fad?\n\n\u201cThe Plantpower Way,\u201d \u201cDeliciously Ella,\u201d \u201cMy New Roots\u201d and \u201cLookbook Cookbook\u201d take arguments about maximizing health, saving the environment and protecting animals a step further, suggesting that veganism also happens to make you, well, incredibly hot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s subversive, in a sense,\u201d said Diamond, of Yahoo Food. \u201cBeing a vegan is still a political act in America. But having all these beautiful people rebelling in this way is really compelling.\u201d\n\nOr not.\n\nThat shiny happy vegan perfection has prompted a few jabs. Even Amanda Cohen, the New York chef whose Dirt Candy restaurant was way ahead of the curve in celebrating vegetables, worries about the potential faddishness of the movement. \u201cYou really want to hope it\u2019s not a trend,\u201d she said. \u201cIs vegan the new bone broth?\u201d\n\nAll that swooning over \u201cthe glow\u201d can lead to eye-rolls from those without the time and money to achieve it. Roll, of \u201cThe Plantpower Way,\u201d has felt the criticism himself.\n\n\u201cOne Amazon reviewer said, \u2018You\u2019ll never be as perfect as they are,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat broke my heart. Somebody drew that conclusion, which was the opposite of what I\u2019m trying to present.\u201d\n\nThese vegans may look as if they have everything figured out, but getting there can be a long process. As the Plantpower family gathered for lunch at the long table, Piatt marveled at recollections of her youth in Alaska, where her father used to drag home wild game.\n\n\u201cI remember eating bear once, as a child,\u201d she said.\n\nJaya, her youngest daughter, looked up with eyes wide. \u201cWait, Mommy, you ate a bear?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cIt was when I was a kid,\u201d Piatt replied. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand yet.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/10/vegan.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce19\"", "article_summary": "In New York, diners can easily opt to go fully vegan at Superiority Burger, Dimes and the Butcher\u2019s Daughter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my nonalcoholic, meditative, yogic, vegan lifestyle.\u201dEven their children seemed to be on board.\n\u201cBeing a vegan has crossed over into fashion territory,\u201d said Kerry Diamond, the editor of Yahoo Food and the editorial director of Cherry Bombe magazine.\nRoll, of \u201cThe Plantpower Way,\u201d has felt the criticism himself.\nBut lately he has been immersed in the writing of chefs like Thomas Keller and Alice Waters as he gears up for the November opening of Little Pine, a vegan restaurant he is opening in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles."}
