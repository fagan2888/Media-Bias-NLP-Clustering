Northern Californian coast has observed huge blue whale population gathering on the coast since last 15 years. Researchers say California coast is the busiest of the region, which is the main reason behind the collision between whales and shipping vessels.

Scientists of Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute observed 171 tagged blue whales for 15 years using radio and satellite. Various marine researchers have been working since years studying the migrating patterns followed by these whales. Information collected by keeping a track of these whales helped the researchers to know more about their migrating and feeding patterns.

Scientists recorded that around 2,500 whales migrate currently in the area, which comes within 200 miles of the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington. Whales get attracted to the tiny shrimps which are rich in protein. These shrimps are carried towards the surface by the California currents.

Researchers have suggested that change in shipping lanes can prevent further killing of the endangered marine mammal. Most of the shipping routes followed by vessels cross the major feeding areas of whales. This situation proves vulnerable both for ships and whales.

According to the scientists, the specific number of deaths is hard to determine, but they say slowly moving mammal is highly dangerous to ships and have more chances of strike. Scientists claim that the latest data about whales will prove helpful for the shipping industry and to various other associations linked with the lanes from San Francisco to Los Angeles.

US and International Agency declared this mammal as an endangered species when they found only 8,000 to 9,000 blue whales are left and about 36,000 whales were killed between 1900 and mid-1960s.
