Sanders has been highly critical of Israel\u2019s military action against the Palestinians and of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s heavy handed efforts to block U.S. approval of a nuclear non-proliferation agreement with Iran last year. Sanders complains that U.S. policy has for too long been to back up Israel with military aid and \u201clooked the other way when Israel did bad things\u201d to the Palestinians.\n\nBut Sanders vs. Clinton doesn\u2019t begin to compete with Trump vs. Clinton, especially before the crowd of roughly 18,000 people who gathered for the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the foremost pro-Israel lobbying organization in the country. Clinton and Trump seemingly tried to outdo themselves in vowing unflinching support for Israel. And in another preview of the bruising general election campaign battle awaiting them, Clinton and Trump exchanged insults and criticism during their separate appearances at AIPAC and later on CNN\u2019s \u201cFinal Five\u201d interviews of the five remaining presidential candidates.\n\nRelated: New Levels of Chutzpah from Trump in DC\n\nDuring her AIPAC speech yesterday, Clinton said \u2013 without specifically mentioning his name \u2013 that Trump lacked the temperament and \u201csteady hands\u201d to forge U.S. policy overseas. Israel could not trust him to protect their interests in Middle East talks, she insisted. She focused on Trump\u2019s conflicting statements as to whether he would be an unwavering ally of Israel or strike a \u201cneutral\u201d pose in an effort to negotiate a Middle East peace agreement.\n\n\u201cWe need steady hands, not a president who says he\u2019s neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday and who-knows what on Wednesday,\u201d Clinton said to the cheering crowd. \u201cEverything\u2019s negotiable [with Trump]. Well my friends, Israel\u2019s security is not negotiable.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Trump had nothing nasty to say about Clinton in his prepared remarks, although he ad-libbed this line: \u201cHillary Clinton, who is a total disaster by the way, she and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly.\u201d\n\nRelated: ISIS Attacks on Brussels Airport and Metro Kill at Least 26\n\nLater, during his appearance on CNN, Trump, a notorious counter-puncher, went after Clinton with more personal attacks. He touched on the FBI investigation of her mishandling of sensitive email during her four years at the State Department and the so-called Whitewater real estate business scandal that marred Bill Clinton\u2019s governorship of Arkansas decades ago.\n\n\u201cI think she doesn\u2019t have the stamina to be president,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe\u2019s always got problems, whether it\u2019s Whitewater or whether it\u2019s emails, there is always drama. It should end. It should end. Honestly, she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run based on the emails, to be totally honest with you. She\u2019s being protected.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As the two democratic candidates for president spar over foreign policy, it\u2019s clear th", "title": "Trump vs. Clinton\u2014Who Has the \u2018Steady Hands\u2019 to Manage the Mideast?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/22/Trump-vs-Clinton-Who-Has-Steady-Hands-Manage-Mideast", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/hilary_trump_split_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/22/Trump-vs-Clinton-Who-Has-Steady-Hands-Manage-Mideast", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/hilary_trump_split_2.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As the two democratic candidates for president spar over foreign policy, it\u2019s clear th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But Sanders vs. Clinton doesn\u2019t begin to compete with Trump vs. Clinton, especially before the crowd of roughly 18,000 people who gathered for the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the foremost pro-Israel lobbying organization in the country.\n\u201cI think she doesn\u2019t have the stamina to be president,\u201d Trump said.\nRelated: New Levels of Chutzpah from Trump in DCDuring her AIPAC speech yesterday, Clinton said \u2013 without specifically mentioning his name \u2013 that Trump lacked the temperament and \u201csteady hands\u201d to forge U.S. policy overseas.\nClinton and Trump seemingly tried to outdo themselves in vowing unflinching support for Israel.\n\u201cWe need steady hands, not a president who says he\u2019s neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday and who-knows what on Wednesday,\u201d Clinton said to the cheering crowd."}
