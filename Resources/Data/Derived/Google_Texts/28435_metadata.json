John Kasich\u2019s administration has requested SNAP work requirement waivers only for the counties where unemployment is worst \u2014 many of them rural counties in southeastern Ohio.\n\nLeft-wing groups say Kasich\u2019s SNAP waiver policies put an unfair burden on minorities in the state\u2019s big cities. In an August press release, Policy Matters warned of the possibility of legal action against the state.\n\nLast year, welfare spending advocacy groups filed a federal civil rights complaint with the U.S. Department of Agriculture because Kasich didn\u2019t waive SNAP work requirements statewide.\n\nThe complaint, Policy Matters senior project director Wendy Patton said in an email to Ohio Watchdog, \u201cargued that the decision to reject the waiver for counties containing urban areas disproportionately hurt minority Ohioans.\u201d\n\nAt leftist magazine Mother Jones, Patton was quoted extensively last week in a story titled, \u201cHow John Kasich Rewrote Welfare Laws and Is Keeping Food Off Family Dinner Tables.\u201d\n\nMother Jones blamed Kasich, a former congressman, for the fact SNAP work requirements exist at all, and suggested he might be intentionally \u201cturning a blind eye to the racial disparity\u201d caused by his SNAP waivers.\n\nThe Mother Jones story was picked up as proof of Republican racism by left-wing blogs including Daily Kos, where a post on the topic prompted thousands of social media interactions.\n\nRELATED: Ohio\u2019s reliance on food stamps remains near record high\n\nBenjamin Johnson, communications director for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, told Ohio Watchdog the state seeks to ensure \u201cthat able-bodied adults without dependent children receive both SNAP benefits and education, job training, or volunteer or work experience.\u201d\n\nSNAP work requirements only apply \u201cto adults between the ages of 18 and 50 who are mentally and physically fit for work, are not pregnant, and do not have dependent children,\u201d Johnson noted.\n\nJohnson said ODJFS has requested SNAP waivers for counties whose unemployment rates were greater than 120 percent of the national unemployment rate.\n\nOhio\u2019s SNAP enrollment has receded since Kasich ended the statewide work requirement waiver put in place by former Democratic governor Ted Strickland, but remains much higher than at any time before the recession that ended six years ago.\n\nOhio\u2019s average monthly SNAP enrollment for the 2015 fiscal year ending in June was 1,690,139, only slightly lower than in fiscal year 2011. Kasich took office in January 2011.\n\n\u201cWork requirements are an essential ingredient to helping those who are in need transition from dependency to financial stability,\u201d Josh Archambault, a senior fellow at the free-market Foundation for Government Accountability, told Ohio Watchdog.\n\nArchambault pointed to research from a Tufts University professor whose findings indicate \u201cthose on food stamps are more food insecure than those of similar income but not on the program.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter what community or background someone is from, work requirements are an effective mechanism to help people escape the cycle of dependency,\u201d Archambault said.\n\nInstead of expanding waivers to more counties and cities to appease critics who call Kasich a racist, Archambault said the governor should restore SNAP work requirements statewide.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Welfare spending advocates are up in arms over Ohio's use of food stamp work requirement waivers, calling the waivers unfair and even racist.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Welfare spending advocates are up in arms over Ohio's use of food stamp work requirement waivers, calling the waivers unfair and even racist.", "title": "Are Ohio's food stamp work requirements racist? - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/ohio-snap-directions-card.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-25T15:52:04+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/239908/ohio-food-stamps-racist/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Welfare spending advocates are up in arms over Ohio's use of food stamp work requirement waivers, calling the waivers unfair and even racist.", "title": "Are Ohio's food stamp work requirements racist? - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/ohio-snap-directions-card.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "published_time": "2015-09-28T04:00:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-25T15:52:04+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "ohio food stamps, ohio snap, supplemental nutrition assistance program, policy matters ohio, foundation for government accountability, food stamp waiver, food stamp work requirements, snap waiver"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e8f\"", "article_summary": "Welfare spending advocates are up in arms over Ohio\u2019s use of food stamp work requirement waivers, calling the waivers unfair and even racist.\nThe problem, according to progressive think tank Policy Matters Ohio, is state officials\u2019 refusal to waive food stamp work requirements for as many Ohioans as possible.\nInstead of expanding waivers to more counties and cities to appease critics who call Kasich a racist, Archambault said the governor should restore SNAP work requirements statewide.\nLast year, welfare spending advocacy groups filed a federal civil rights complaint with the U.S. Department of Agriculture because Kasich didn\u2019t waive SNAP work requirements statewide.\nJohn Kasich\u2019s administration has requested SNAP work requirement waivers only for the counties where unemployment is worst \u2014 many of them rural counties in southeastern Ohio."}
