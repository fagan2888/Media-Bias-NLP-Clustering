Smartphone-equipped workers interact with their office a whopping 72 hours per week (including weekends).\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world, the expectation is that when a question comes up, you\u2019ll answer it within 30 minutes, whether it\u2019s 8:00 at night, or 6 a.m.,\u201d says organizational consultant Ed Muzio, author of Make Work Great. \u201cThe expectation is that if you\u2019re awake, you\u2019re going to be checking in.\u201d\n\nRELATED: IS YOUR STAFF SLEEPING WITH THEIR SMARTPHONES?\n\nThe biggest driver of the constantly connected office culture is the proliferation of the technology that makes it possible such as smartphones and teleconferencing. But it also reflects lingering effects of the recession that has left fewer employees handling larger workloads. Such changes allowed companies to expand productivity and cut their expenses, fueling a surge in corporate profits. Globalization also plays a role, as more workers are interacting with colleagues across the world on what has become a 24-hour business cycle.\n\nExperts say that workers generally accept 24-7 connectivity as the norm in today\u2019s workplace\u2014it\u2019s rare to find a good-paying, full-time job that only requires a 40-hour workweek - but they warn that companies that take advantage of such policies generally have more turnover and lower job satisfaction rates.\n\nDIMINISHING RETURNS\n\n\u201cSome workers just feel like there never is an end to the day,\u201d says Peggy Klaus, author of Soft Skills: Workplace Lessons Smart People Wish They\u2019d Learned Sooner. \u201cIn addition to the stress and burnout from work, they feel like they don\u2019t have any down time with their friends or family, and they start to resent their employer.\u201d\n\nA separate study by the American Psychological Association found that more than a third of workers said communication technology increases their workload, and makes it more difficult to stop thinking about work or take a break from work.\n\nWhile smartphones and other technology are meant to increase our productivity, and experts admit that in many ways they enhance work-life balance \u2013 allowing a parent to duck out early to attend a school play, or to check on a big deal that\u2019s closing during a scheduled vacation. But when used regularly around the clock, such technology can lead to diminishing returns in worker output. \u201cThere\u2019s a fall off in productivity after a full day of work,\u201d Muzio says. \u201cAfter a certain point, you\u2019re just not as effective.\u201d\n\nThe CCL report found that connected workers generally had just three hours per day in which they weren\u2019t sleeping, working, or checking in with the office. (And sleep may not actually offer an escape \u2013 more than half of consumers say they check their phone while lying in bed, before they go to sleep, after they wake up, and even in the middle of the night.\n\nHIGHER STRESS AT HOME\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about work\u201d says report author Jennifer Deal. \u201cThis is about our lives, and it affects the people with interact with and the people we care about.\u201d\n\nTwelve percent of executives regularly step away from dinner and other family gatherings to deal with business calls and other work issues, and 41 percent of executives do so occasionally, according to a study released last year by Forbes Insights.\n\nRELATED: HOW WORK AFFECTS YOUR LOVE (AND SEX) LIFE\n\nMany workers think that they\u2019re multi-tasking when they\u2019re checking work emails while eating dinner or spending time with their family, but, in reality, they\u2019re not giving full attention to both activities, says Larry Rosen, author of iDisorder: Understanding our Obsession with Technology and Overcoming its Hold on Us.\n\nConstantly checking a smartphone actually causes neurological changes. Once your brain is in the habit of looking at a small screen for updates every few minutes, when it\u2019s unable to do so, it begins to activate neurotransmitters associated with anxiety and stress, Rosen says.\n\nIndeed, a study last December in Britain last December found that higher levels of stress correlated to how often people checked their smartphones, with the most stressed individuals actually experiencing \u2018phantom vibrations\u2019 when there were no new alerts.\n\n\u201cFor your own health, you need to set up boundaries and limits,\u201d Rosen says. \u201cThe more you check, you\u2019re just digging a hole for yourself. You\u2019re modeling the behavior up to your boss and down to your kids, and setting yourself up for a lifetime of anxiety.\u201d\n\nRosen recommends scheduling a certain time to check your phone, after dinner perhaps, and to plug it in\u2014out of sight\u2014at least an hour before you go to bed.\n\nStill worried about missing an important email from the boss?
