When she went to her doctor\u2019s office for a check-up after the birth and asked about going back on the Pill, since she hadn\u2019t gotten the sterilization she wanted, she got another shock: \u201cMy doctor told me that she couldn\u2019t prescribe birth control because she had sold her practice to a Catholic health system,\u201d said Angela. \u201cMy mouth dropped open. I was so confused to hear those words coming out of the mouth of an OB/GYN.\u201d\n\nAn OB/GYN who can\u2019t prescribe birth control? It\u2019s not some bad joke. It could be a reality if your doctor\u2019s practice is purchased by a Catholic health system that then imposes the Ethical & Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, a set of rules created by the U.S. Bishop\u2019s Conference that prohibits doctors from doing everything from prescribing the Pill to performing sterilizations or abortions.\n\nAnd Angela\u2019s experience may be just the tip of the iceberg. Driven by health-care economics and incentives in the Affordable Care Act, health systems, which are a collection of hospitals and ancillary services, are acquiring physician practices at an unprecedented rate. The percentage of doctors who were employees of health systems increased from 20 percent to 26 percent between 2012 and 2013 alone; more than 40 percent of primary care doctors like OB/GYNs are now employed by health systems directly, and experts don\u2019t see the trend slowing.\n\nAnd with Catholic hospital systems accounting for eight of the 10 of the largest nonprofit health systems in the U.S., these hospitals are poised to become major owners of doctors\u2019 offices, which could severely impede access to contraceptives if doctors are forced to follow the Directives. \u201cThe more we see these Catholic systems buying up these practices, the more we are going to see what Angela saw,\u201d predicted Lorie Chaiten, director of the Illinois ACLU\u2019s Reproductive Rights Project, who notes that such refusals are legal under Illinois\u2019 Health Care Right of Conscience Act.\n\n\u201cAngela went to the same provider for 15 years and all of the sudden she couldn\u2019t get birth control. This could have a huge impact on women,\u201d Chaiten said.\n\nLast year, Ascension Health system, a Catholic system, and the largest nonprofit health system in the country, attracted national attention when it reportedly told doctors at an Oklahoma hospital that they couldn\u2019t prescribe birth control. Ascension quickly backed down, deciding that it would \u201ctolerate,\u201d but not \u201capprove, condone or permit,\u201d the prescription of contraception by physician employees.\n\nNow it appears that the largest system in Illinois, Presence Health, is also prohibiting doctors from providing contraceptives. Presence was created by the merger of two smaller Catholic systems, Resurrection Health Care, which was the system that bought Angela\u2019s doctor\u2019s practice, and Provena Health. Today, Presence Health owns 11 hospitals and dozens of doctor\u2019s offices.\n\nThese health systems are merging, and gobbling up doctors\u2019 practices, because of incentives in the ACA for systems to coordinate care across the range of services that patients need, from doctor\u2019s visits to in-patient hospital procedures, and because of health care economics, that make it prohibitively expensive for doctors to maintain solo practices.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eight of the largest health systems in America are now Catholic-owned.
