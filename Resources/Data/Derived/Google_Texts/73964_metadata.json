That\u2019s up from 64 percent in 2011, which was up from 55 percent in 2009. In fact, it\u2019s the record high since Gallup started asking the question a half-century ago.\n\nWe suspect the ill-conceived Obama stimulus contributed to the rising tide of public antipathy to big government. We also imagine the more recent disquieting revelations of the government\u2019s secret surveillance of the American people were a factor.\n\nBut we have no doubt that implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which the Democratic-controlled Congress passed in 2010 over the objection of Republicans, has done much to turn Americans against big government. That wariness is tripartisan. It includes 92 percent of Republicans, but also 71 percent of independents, even 56 percent of Democrats.\n\nNow, the Gallup Poll may not be a referendum on Mr. Obama personally (although his overall approval rating currently is the lowest of his presidency). But it certainly is a referendum on his philosophy of governing.\n\nThe president reflexively bends toward statism, as evidenced by his extreme makeover of the nation\u2019s health care system. But the American people have long preferred limited government, free markets and individual liberty.\n\nWe believe Mr. Obama still can salvage the remaining three years of his presidency. That is, if he accepts the proposition, as Henry David Thoreau put it, \u201cThat government is best which governs least.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: Editorial: How Obama can halt his plunge | government, big, obama, percent, president, democratic, gallup, stimulus, american, spending", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "In January 2009, then president-elect Barack Obama gave what amounted to a preinaugural address at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., during which he made an impassioned case for economic stimulus legislation.", "title": "Editorial: How Obama can halt his plunge", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/government-594643-big-obama.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/mya7u1-b781238009z.120131223145535000gov1hm4vo.1.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/mya7u1-b781238009z.120131223145535000gov1hm4vo.1.jpg"}, "title": "Editorial: How Obama can halt his plunge", "description": "In January 2009, then president-elect Barack Obama gave what amounted to a preinaugural address at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., during which he made an impassioned case for economic stimul", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ocregister"}, "publication_date": "2013-12-23", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/mya7u1-b781238009z.120131223145535000gov1hm4vo.1.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "government, big, obama, percent, president, democratic, gallup, stimulus, american, spending", "geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "access-type": "free", "section": "commentary", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Editorial: How Obama can halt his plunge"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde0f\"", "article_summary": "We believe Mr. Obama still can salvage the remaining three years of his presidency.\nAlas, it turned out that the massive government spending yielded neither the economic growth nor the job creation Mr. Obama promised.\nWe suspect the ill-conceived Obama stimulus contributed to the rising tide of public antipathy to big government.\nNow, the Gallup Poll may not be a referendum on Mr. Obama personally (although his overall approval rating currently is the lowest of his presidency).\nThat is, if he accepts the proposition, as Henry David Thoreau put it, \u201cThat government is best which governs least.\u201d"}
