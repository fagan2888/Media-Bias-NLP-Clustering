There\u2019s a lot of blame to go around.\u201d\n\nSavage also declared that the shooter \u201cwas basically committing a hate crime,\u201d even though it will never be reported that way by the mainstream media (Free audio).\n\n\u201cIf you look at his victims,\u201d said Savage, \u201cit\u2019s strange that almost all of them were white. There was one Asian. Truthfully, my friends, none of them looked like the shooter.\u201d\n\nRush Limbaugh\n\nLimbaugh came to the defense of Sen. Ted Cruz this week, claiming his fellow Republicans are carrying out an \u201call-out assault\u201d on Texas senator.\n\nRush noted that New York Times columnist David Brooks, \u201ca supposed conservative,\u201d had accused Cruz of threatening \u201cthe traditional Republican Party\u201d (Free audio).\n\n\u201cWhat in the hell are they supposed to do, Mr. Brooks?\u201d Limbaugh asked rhetorically. \u201cThis is what every one of you ought to be doing. Why do you call yourself a Republican if you all you want to do is lay down and agree with Obama and the Democrats? Why don\u2019t you switch parties if it\u2019s so much better over there.\u201d\n\nAaron Klein\n\nBill De Blasio is now the frontrunner in the race to be the next mayor of New York City. Aaron Klein digs into De Blasio\u2019s ties to ACORN and other radical groups and explains why his past could negatively impact the \u201cBig Apple\u2019s\u201d future if he\u2019s elected. Speaking of New York City, Klein presents the \u201creal story\u201d about the NYPD\u2019s program of mosque surveillance.\n\nKlein also explains how Russia and Iran are the two countries benefiting the most from the president\u2019s dealings with Syria, and where the Syrians are now hiding their chemical weapons (Free audio).\n\nMark Levin\n\nLevin forcefully challenged \u201cphony pseudo-conservative\u201d Republicans and their reluctant fight to defund Obamacare (Free audio).\n\nAfter accusing the president of \u201craw, brazen tyranny,\u201d Levin made sure he slammed the GOP for surrendering \u201cfrom day one\u201d rather than fighting the White House\u2019s unconstitutional health-care reforms.\n\nLevin had on guest Congressman Tom Graves of Georgia, who has sponsored a bill designed to delay or defund Obamacare. As it stands, Graves\u2019 measures are winning increased support in the House (Free audio).\n\nLevin also appeared on Glenn Beck\u2019s show, to talk about his new bestselling book, \u201cThe Liberty Amendments,\u201d and how it can serve as a blueprint for lasting reform (Free audio).\n\nLaura Ingraham\n\nEarly reports on the Navy Yard massacre placed an AR-15 in the hands of the shooter. These reports later turned out to be false, but Charles C. W. Cooke of the National Review accuses the mainstream media of intentionally distorting such details.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s literally no way or thing that would have changed what happened,\u201d Cooke said when Ingraham asked him if gun-control laws might have prevented the crime.\n\nPartisan reaction to these incidents reflect, he said, \u201cthe different ways in which the left and right see human nature. I see human nature as imperfectable, and trying to stop people with ill intent through the force of law is almost impossible.\u201d\n\nIngraham also welcomed guest Rick Nelson, the former director of the CSIS Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Program. He talked about security (or the lack thereof) on America\u2019s military bases.\n\nHe maintained: \u201cIf you have an individual determined to commit an act of violence, he/she will find a way \u2013 whether it\u2019s a bomb, knife, or gun \u2013 to circumvent security procedures and commit that act. And it presents us with a very difficult challenge, one which we might never be able to fully eliminate\u201d (Free audio).\n\nGlenn Beck\n\nThe White House announced on Monday that it is waiving the Arms Export Control Act to allow \u201cnon-lethal assistance\u201d to Syrian \u201crebels.\u201d Glenn Beck calls this an impeachable act, and is calling for the impeachment of various members of Congress, not just the president.\n\n\u201cWe know some of the arms are going to fall into the hands of al-Qaida,\u201d Beck said. \u201cAnd how do we know that? Because the president just had to waive the law saying that we are going to arm known terrorists. If that\u2019s not an impeachable offense, for Lindsey Graham, for John McCain, for John Boehner, for the president of the United States, I don\u2019t know what an impeachable offense is\u201d (Free audio).", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Michael Savage \u201cThis is not your father\u2019s Navy.\u201d After the horrific shooting at the Washington Navy Yards, Michael Savage denounced the changes that have made U.S. military bases so vulnerable to these kinds of incidents (Free audio). \u201cWho disarmed these workers?\u201d Savage asked. \u201cWho disarmed the military?
