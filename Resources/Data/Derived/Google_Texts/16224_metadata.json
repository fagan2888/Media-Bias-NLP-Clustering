The full disclosure of the emails give further detail of the back-and-forth between the clerk, Mary Ann Twitty; Richard Henke, a police captain; and William J. Mudd, a sergeant, on government email accounts. The three have since left the government.\n\nIn one message sent from Ms. Twitty to the two police officials in December 2011, she forwarded a list of \u201cinsensitive one-liners.\u201d One of them spoke of a man being devastated to learn that his wife was having an affair.\n\n\u201cI converted to Islam, and we\u2019re stoning her in the morning!\u201d the email read.\n\nIn another message, Ms. Twitty forwarded a photo of former President Ronald Reagan feeding a chimpanzee with a baby bottle of milk.\n\n\u201cRare photo of Ronald Reagan babysitting Barack Obama in early 1962,\u201d the photo caption read.\n\nYet another sent from Mr. Mudd to Ms. Twitty showed a picture of two dogs lying on a floor. Beneath the photo, it told the story of a man who went to sign his dogs up for welfare, explaining to the person taking the application that they were \u201cmixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can\u2019t speak English and have no friggin clue who their Daddies are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe release of the full emails on Thursday comes as the city is still navigating the racial tensions that resulted from the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, by Darren Wilson, a white police officer.\n\nThe Justice Department report that revealed the emails detailed systematic bias in Ferguson\u2019s law enforcement system. City leaders are negotiating a settlement with federal officials to avoid facing a lawsuit.\n\nFor critics of Ferguson, the emails only confirmed their criticisms of the town.\n\nFerguson\u2019s mayor, James W. Knowles III, quickly denounced the emails once they were revealed. Ms. Twitty was fired and Mr. Henke and Mr. Mudd were forced from the department days later. None of them have spoken publicly since leaving the government.\n\nSeveral top officials including the city manager, municipal judge and police chief have also left their posts in the wake of the report.\n\nIn just days, the city will elect three new members to its seven-member council, with activists pushing to diversify Ferguson\u2019s leadership ranks.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150403203725, "twitter": {"description": "The full content of messages mentioned in a Justice Department report were disclosed after Freedom of Information requests.", "title": "Racist Emails by Ferguson Officials Released", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/04/us/racist-emails-by-ferguson-officials-released.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003611276"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "jeligon", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/04/us/racist-emails-by-ferguson-officials-released.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003611276", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/04/us/racist-emails-by-ferguson-officials-released.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 3, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Ferguson (Mo),Police Brutality  Misconduct and Shootings,Discrimination,E-Mail,Race and Ethnicity", "news_keywords": "Discrimination,Email", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "John Eligon", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By JOHN ELIGON", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The full content of messages mentioned in a Justice Department report were disclosed after Freedom of Information requests.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The full content of messages mentioned in a Justice Department report were disclosed after Freedom of Information requests.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 3, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/john_eligon/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2015-04-13", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Race and Ethnicity", "published": "2015-04-03", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "geo": "Ferguson (Mo)", "slug": "04emails", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150413101145, "hdl_p": "Racist Emails by Ferguson Officials Released", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/04/us/racist-emails-by-ferguson-officials-released.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The full content of messages mentioned in a Justice Department report were disclosed after Freedom of Information requests.", "title": "Racist Emails by Ferguson Officials Released"}, "pdate": 20150403, "des": "Race and Ethnicity", "articleid": 100000003611276, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Racist Emails by Ferguson Officials Released", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca31a\"", "article_summary": "The Justice Department report that revealed the emails detailed systematic bias in Ferguson\u2019s law enforcement system.\nYet another sent from Mr. Mudd to Ms. Twitty showed a picture of two dogs lying on a floor.\nIn another message, Ms. Twitty forwarded a photo of former President Ronald Reagan feeding a chimpanzee with a baby bottle of milk.\nMs. Twitty was fired and Mr. Henke and Mr. Mudd were forced from the department days later.\nThe City of Ferguson, Mo., responding to Freedom of Information requests, has released the full contents of racist emails circulated by the chief court clerk and two police supervisors that were disclosed by the Justice Department in a report last month."}
