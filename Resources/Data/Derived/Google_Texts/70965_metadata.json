Boehner has hinted at a lawsuit to stop President Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran, but legal analysts doubted such a move would work, saying it\u2019s exactly the kind of case judges will steer clear of.\n\nIt\u2019s not even clear who, exactly, would even be able to show they have standing to sue \u2014 and unless someone can prove an injury, Mr. Obama is likely to have a free hand to lift sanctions on his own timetable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see who would,\u201d said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law who specializes in national security law. \u201cThis is the exact kind of dispute that has historically been left to the political branches to work out between themselves.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: House GOP rejects Iran deal, votes to extend sanctions\n\nRepublicans are desperate to find a way to stop the Iran deal, but saw their legislative options narrowed last week after Senate Democrats mounted a filibuster to sustain the deal. That\u2019s led some Republicans to look hopefully to the courts.\n\n\u201cThat is an option that is very possible,\u201d Mr. Boehner, Ohio Republican, said last week.\n\nThere are two potential avenues of lawsuit. One, a constitutional challenge, would involve challenging the deal as a treaty, which would mean it would take a two-thirds affirmative vote of the Senate to ratify it, rather than the reverse two-thirds votes in both chambers to disapprove it \u2014 the system Congress laid out for the Iran deal.\n\nSEE ALSO: Iran will continue to support rogues, terrorists and criminals: House panel\n\nMr. Vladeck said, however, that the U.S. Supreme Court for decades has held that not all foreign policy deals are treaties, even if the Senate disagrees. And in this case, the Senate took a vote earlier this year that rejected the idea it was a treaty.\n\nAnother lawsuit possibility would stem from the law Congress passed and Mr. Obama signed earlier this year governing how the president could go about lifting sanctions on Iran. Under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, Mr. Obama is required to submit all of the deal\u2019s paperwork to Congress, starting a 60-day review period, and only then can he cancel economic sanctions.\n\nRepublicans argue the president has withheld some of the key agreements on monitoring between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency, asserting that means the 60-day review hasn\u2019t started and so the sanctions can\u2019t be lifted.\n\nThe House voted along party lines last week to declare the president broke the review act, sparking Mr. Boehner\u2019s intimating that a lawsuit is possible.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, has made no moves to follow the House\u2019s lead, undercutting the strategy\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nHouse Republicans may be feeling emboldened by last week\u2019s federal court ruling that the House had standing to sue over how Mr. Obama carried out the Affordable Care Act, spending money on something that Congress had specifically forbidden.\n\nBut the Obama administration has vowed to appeal, and legal analysts say the House will have a tough time proving its case.\n\nStill, the power of the purse remains a critical congressional weapon, and Congress could use it in the case of Iran.\n\nMr. Boehner raised that possibility last week, too.\n\nHouse Republicans have threatened to use the tactic over the last five years on everything from Obamacare to the president\u2019s immigration actions to taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood \u2014 all without success.\n\nSenate GOP aides said the issue hasn\u2019t been raised on their side of the Capitol.\n\nFor its part, the White House mocked the idea of a lawsuit, calling it \u201cthe Tortilla Coast gambit,\u201d in reference to a popular restaurant and drinking spot near the House office buildings and the Republican National Committee headquarters.\n\n\u201cLike many decisions that are made, probably, on Tuesday night at Tortilla Coast, they seem like a great idea after a couple of margaritas, but when faced with the scrutiny of the light of day, they don\u2019t seem quite as realistic,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker John A.
