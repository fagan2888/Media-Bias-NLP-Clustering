(View the opinion here.)\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment provides strong protections for reporting on public figures and matters of public concern, and libel claims should not be wielded as weapons to chill such speech,\u201d said Alison Schary, an attorney with Davis, Wright & Tremaine in Washington, D.C., who represented Main Justice, an independent website covering the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the court agreed with our legal arguments and dismissed this flawed case,\u201d Schary said.\n\nO\u2019Keefe, who specializes in often heavily edited undercover video stings mostly targeting liberal organizations and Democrats, did not respond to a request for comment through his attorneys, Matthew Major and Benjamin D. Light of Callagy Law in New Jersey.\n\nA campaign to sue journalists\n\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s complaint against Main Justice came after he vowed to sue news organizations that improperly characterized the circumstances of his 2010 arrest and misdemeanor conviction for entering the New Orleans offices of then-Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) under false pretenses.\n\nTwo activists who accompanied O\u2019Keefe were disguised as telephone repairmen. The goal: To surreptitiously record Landrieu\u2019s staff for a planned expos\u00e9 of how they handled calls about the Affordable Care Act. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s crew pretended to test the senator\u2019s phones and asked to be taken to the \u201ccentral box\u201d for repairs before they were confronted and the ruse discovered.\n\nO\u2019Keefe and his gang were initially charged in a federal felony criminal complaint with intent to commit \u201cmalicious interference\u201d with the senator\u2019s phones. Those charges were later downgraded to misdemeanors after federal prosecutors accepted the activists\u2019 explanation that they had never intended to tap the phones. O\u2019Keefe pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor and was sentenced to three years of probation, which confined him to his home state of New Jersey. The caper landed O\u2019Keefe\u2019s mugshot on the front page of The New York Times.\n\nAlthough O\u2019Keefe\u2019s own actions led to his initial felony arrest and subsequent news reports \u2013 and even though he would later pay $100,000 to settle a lawsuit stemming from other serious misrepresentations he himself had made \u2013 O\u2019Keefe aggressively challenged news organizations that he said were damaging his reputation by failing to correctly characterize the ultimate outcome of his Louisiana prosecution.\n\nIn 2012, O\u2019Keefe sued the New Jersey Star-Ledger newspaper after it wrote that O\u2019Keefe was \u201cstill on probation for trying to tap the phone of Sen. Mary Landrieu.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, he warned: \u201cIt is my experience that demanding retractions from dishonorable people only leads to dishonorable retraction. Therefore, today I started a campaign to combat media organizations that state or repeat malicious lies about my work.\u201d\n\nThe Star-Ledger later corrected its report.\n\nAbout a month later in 2012, O\u2019Keefe sued the now-defunct Current TV after hosts Keith Olbermann and David Shuster referred to O\u2019Keefe in separate broadcasts as a \u201cconvicted felon,\u201d which mischaracterized the level of offense to which O\u2019Keefe had pleaded guilty. Shuster had previously been disciplined for tweeting inappropriately about O\u2019Keefe.\n\n\u201cMSM will say, do anything to \u2026 stop a citizen journalist they cannot control. Understood. I\u2019m going to sue them for libel every time,\u201d O\u2019Keefe tweeted.\n\nBy 2013, it was Main Justice\u2019s turn to be sued. But this time, O\u201dKeefe didn\u2019t have a case.\n\nConfrontation with former New Orleans U.S. Attorney\n\nIn July 2013, shortly after being released from probation, O\u2019Keefe traveled to New Orleans to confront former U.S. Attorney Jim Letten with his grievances over what he considered his unfair prosecution by Letten\u2019s former office.\n\nO\u2019Keefe later released a video of the encounter. It showed Letten furious about an approach the activist videographer had made earlier in the day to Letten\u2019s wife at their home. It also appeared, from the vitriol of Letten\u2019s reaction, that O\u2019Keefe had gotten under his skin in other ways.\n\nLetten called O\u2019Keefe an \u201casshole,\u201d \u201cscum\u201d and a \u201csnail\u201d who does \u201cweird little political things.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Y]ou nasty little spud,\u201d Letten yelled, after O\u2019Keefe had ambushed him on the grounds of Tulane University with a video camera. \u201cIf you want to be a political \u2026 extremist nut job, that\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t break the law.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Keefe complained to Letten, \u201cYou took three years of my life from me,\u201d referring to his federal probation. He tried to give Letten a copy of his book, \u201cBreakthrough: Our Guerrilla War to Expose Fraud and Save Democracy,\u201d that detailed his complaints about the prosecution. Letten threw it back at him.\n\n\u201cYou were properly prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice because you improperly and under ruse \u2026 got into a U.S. senator\u2019s office under disguise,\u201d Letten told O\u2019Keefe at another point on the video.\n\nMain Justice was among numerous publications that wrote about the video. The article included a paragraph of background to the incident. It read, as originally published:\n\nIn May 2010, O\u2019Keefe and three other activists pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges that they entered the New Orleans offices of Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) under false pretenses. Wearing hard hats, tool belts and reflective vests, the activists had pretended to be telephone repairmen and were apparently trying to bug Landrieu\u2019s phones. Their felony charges were downgraded to misdemeanors. O\u2019Keefe was sentenced to three years probation, 100 hours of community service and a $1500 fine.\n\n\u2018Public retraction\u2019 demanded\n\nAfter the article was published, Daniel Francisco, then-executive director of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s non-profit organization Project Veritas, emailed Main Justice to complain that the phrase \u201capparently trying to bug Landrieu\u2019s phones\u201d was a \u201cslanderous statement.\u201d\n\nPointing to O\u2019Keefe\u2019s negotiated plea agreement, which stated he had not intended to commit any felony, Francisco demanded a \u201cpublic retraction\u201d of the article. (Francisco later had a falling out with O\u2019Keefe and filed his own complaint alleging O\u2019Keefe had defamed him.)\n\nIn response, Main Justice republished the article to say that when arrested, the group had been \u201ctrying to tamper\u201d with the phones.\n\nThat description, as Main Justice argued in briefings in support of its motion to dismiss, was based on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s own negotiated plea agreement in federal court.\n\nIn the plea agreement, O\u2019Keefe admitted that the disguised activists had claimed they were there to \u201cfollow up on reports of problems with the telephone system.\u201d While in Landrieu\u2019s office, one of the activists \u201cwalked behind the desk, lifted the phone handset from the cradle, questioned whether there was a dial tone, and handled the receiver,\u201d the plea agreement said.\n\nTwo of the activists \u201calso pretended to call the phone with cellular phones in their possession,\u201d and told a Landrieu staff member \u201cthey could not get through,\u201d according to the court record. The activists further told a member of Landrieu\u2019s staff and a General Services Administration manager that they required access to the telephone system\u2019s \u201ccentral box\u201d to perform repairs, the plea agreement said.\n\nAs Main Justice\u2019s briefings in federal court said, O\u2019Keefe never followed up to complain that he was still unhappy with the description. Instead, on Aug. 29, he tweeted: \u201cNothing brings me more joy and happiness than when the papers are drafted for another defamation lawsuit against journalists.\u201d\n\nThe next month, he sued Main Justice for libel.\n\nHis announcement of the lawsuit was coupled with an appeal for donations to Project Veritas.\n\nA bumbling felon who got lucky?\n\nO\u2019Keefe argued in his libel claim that Main Justice had implied he\u2019d committed a felony.\n\nThe article \u201cpaint[ed] him to be a bumbling felon who got lucky and pleaded to a misdemeanor,\u201d he alleged in a brief. He further alleged that Main Justice was \u201csharply and politically opposed to Plaintiff\u2019s activities as a journalist,\u201d allegedly showing malice.\n\n\u201cThis sort of manipulation does not warrant First Amendment protection, because it utilizes outright intentional falsehoods,\u201d O\u2019Keefe argued.\n\nFurther, the fair report privilege didn\u2019t apply to the article because it \u201csubstantially deviate[d] from the truth,\u201d O\u2019Keefe argued, and was \u201cbased on wholly inappropriate inferences that would mislead any reasonable person reading it.\u201d\n\nMain Justice argued in briefs that both the original article, saying the activists had appeared to be trying to bug Landrieu\u2019s phones when arrested, and the republished article, saying they had tried to tamper with the phones, were accurate and not libelous.\n\nMost fatal to O\u2019Keefe\u2019s claim, Main Justice argued, was that the article correctly and prominently reported the outcome of the 2010 prosecution \u2013 that O\u2019Keefe had pleaded guilty only to a misdemeanor.\n\n\u201cMr. O\u2019Keefe must not be permitted to use the high costs of modern litigation to bludgeon journalists into either following his script or shying away from the subject altogether,\u201d one brief said.\n\nMain Justice argued that the paragraph in question had to be read in the context of the entire article.\n\n\u201cNo reasonable reader could understand statements that a) O\u2019Keefe \u2018pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges \u2026 and b) his original \u201cfelony charges were downgraded to misdemeanors\u201d to mean that Mr. O\u2019Keefe was found guilty of a felony,\u201d Main Justice argued.\n\nMoreover, \u201calthough Plaintiff may have preferred an exact recitation of the language\u201d from his plea agreement, courts only require a \u201crough and ready\u2019 summary from journalists, not a \u2018technically precise\u2019 recounting of every minute detail in an official report,\u201d Main Justice argued.\n\n\u201cTamper\u201d was used in the colloquial sense of \u201cfiddled with,\u201d Main Justice argued. Such \u201cmincing\u201d of a publications words was specifically condemned by the New Jersey Supreme Court, Main Justice argued.\n\nLibel claim dismissed\n\nIn her order dismissing O\u2019Keefe\u2019s complaint, Judge Cecchi found that both versions of the article were accurate under New Jersey\u2019s \u201cfair report\u201d privilege protecting reporting based on public records.\n\nIt \u201cis undisputed that Plaintiff and his associates did in fact enter Senator Landrieu\u2019s office disguised as telephone repairmen, did handle the telephone, and did request access to the central phone system, all without proper authorization,\u201d the opinion said.\n\n\u201c[T]he ultimate exculpatory fact\u2014that Plaintiff\u2019s felony charges were reduced to a misdemeanor plea\u2014was accurately reported,\u201d Judge Cecchi wrote of the Main Justice article. \u201cThus, even though the words \u2018apparently trying to bug\u2019 and \u201ctrying to tamper\u2019 may have been imprecise, a reasonable person reading the whole article would not be misled as to the ultimate conclusion that Plaintiff was guilty only of a misdemeanor.\u201d\n\nIn a footnote, the judge noted that a dictionary definition of \u201ctamper\u201d includes \u201cto try foolish or dangerous experiments with\u201d and that Miriam Webster lists synonyms for tamper as \u201cfiddle (with),\u201d to \u201cfool (with)\u201d and to \u201cmess (with).\u201d\n\nThe judge concluded that neither the original article nor the revised article was defamatory to O\u2019Keefe.\n\nCecchi dismissed O\u2019Keefe\u2019s lawsuit \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d meaning that he may not refile the claim again in district court.\n\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s lawyers, Matthew Minor and Benjamin Light, did not respond to a request seeking comment.\n\nNo anti-SLAPP law in New Jersey\n\nNew Jersey does not have an anti-SLAPP law which would have entitled Main Justice and Jacoby to seek reimbursement of legal fees. So-called Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation are designed to suppress speech on matters of public interest.\n\n\u201cSLAPPS are intended to intimidate those who disagree with them or their activities by draining the target\u2019s financial resources,\u201d according to the Public Participation Project, an organization lobbying for a federal anti-SLAPP law.\n\nO\u2019Keefe had emailed Jacoby in August 2013 \u2013 an email that was overlooked at the time because it was sent to a personal account not used in her workday \u2013 with a threat. \u201cIf you don\u2019t print a retraction, you\u2019re acting in willful disregard for the truth. But hey, I could use your money to fund more investigations,\u201d the belatedly discovered email said.\n\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s non-profit organization, Project Veritas, reported $1.2 million in revenue in 2013, according to its public tax returns. A large chunk of that funding reportedly came from the Koch Brothers network and a Wisconsin activist allied with Gov. Scott Walker, a potential Republican presidential candidate.\n\nTo read more about O\u2019Keefe, click here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here.\n\nRELATED POSTS:", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "MainJustice, Main Justice", "og": {"site_name": "Main Justice", "description": "Main Justice accurately reported the outcome of the videographer-activist's 2010 prosecution in Louisiana, meaning O'Keefe had no claim, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled.", "title": "Judge Tosses Conservative Provocateur James O'Keefe's Libel Claim Against Main Justice", "url": "http://www.mainjustice.com/2015/04/06/judge-tosses-conservative-provocateur-james-okeefes-libel-claim-against-main-justice/", "image": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/b6BjgEdw3eE/mqdefault.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "video": {"identifier": "http://www.youtube.com/v/b6BjgEdw3eE?version=3&f=videos&app=youtube_gdata", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash"}, "type": "article"}, "description": "Main Justice accurately reported the outcome of the videographer-activist's 2010 prosecution in Louisiana, meaning O'Keefe had no claim, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled.", "generator": "WordPress 2.9.2"}, "article_summary": "Judge Tosses Conservative Provocateur James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Libel Claim Against Main JusticeBy Main Justice staff | April 6, 2015 1:48 pmA federal judge last week tossed out a libel lawsuit filed by conservative provocateur James O\u2019Keefe against this publication, Main Justice, and its founder, Mary Jacoby.\n\u201c[T]he ultimate exculpatory fact\u2014that Plaintiff\u2019s felony charges were reduced to a misdemeanor plea\u2014was accurately reported,\u201d Judge Cecchi wrote of the Main Justice article.\nHe further alleged that Main Justice was \u201csharply and politically opposed to Plaintiff\u2019s activities as a journalist,\u201d allegedly showing malice.\nSuch \u201cmincing\u201d of a publications words was specifically condemned by the New Jersey Supreme Court, Main Justice argued.\nO\u2019Keefe argued in his libel claim that Main Justice had implied he\u2019d committed a felony."}
