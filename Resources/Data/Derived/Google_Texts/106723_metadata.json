One test defines me as either a failure or a success through a numbered rubric. One test at the end of the year that the teacher or myself will not even see the grade until after the school year is already over. I do not feel that all this FSA testing is accurate to tell how successful I am. It doesn\u2019t take in account all of my knowledge and abilities, just a small percentage.\u201d\n\nSmoot even provided the board with suggestions for how to make the testing process \u2013 known as The Florida Standards Assessment Test \u2013 more productive, such as breaking the larger test up into smaller, more frequent tests throughout the year.\n\n\u201cWhy should we have so much stress about one test when we should be learning and having fun at school?\u201d she asked.\n\nIt took a lot of guts for Smoot to address the school board, but \u2013 as she told Upworthy via email \u2013 she couldn\u2019t have done it without her mom\u2019s encouragement.\n\n\u201cWhat inspired me to speak all started one day when I came home. My mom asked me how the testing went, and I told her I was told not to speak about the test to anyone. I had not felt comfortable signing something in the test. I had concerns about this test because there was a lot of stress put on students and myself. I was a little nervous before the speech, but when I was called up to the podium, I did not feel nervous because I knew this speech was going to help a lot of people.\u201d\n\nThank you, Sydney, for summing up what so many parents and schoolchildren are thinking about standardized tests.", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "description": "\"This testing looks at me as a number\"...", "published_at": "2015-03-28T11:33:07+00:00", "author": "Katie LaPotin", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "\"This testing looks at me as a number\"...", "title": "When a 4th Grader Shames School Board on Testing, the Only Reaction People Have is Standing Ovation.", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 840, "identifier": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-3_28_2015-11_31_35-AM.jpg", "height": 463}, "updated_time": "2015-03-28T13:39:12-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/03/282608-watch-fourth-grader-take-school-board-task-floridas-standardized-testing-guidelines/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "\"This testing looks at me as a number\"...", "creator": "@injo", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-3_28_2015-11_31_35-AM.jpg", "title": "When a 4th Grader Shames School Board on Testing, the Only Reaction People Have is Standing Ovation.", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "post_id": 282608, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-28T11:33:07-04:00", "wp-categories": 734, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "tags": "Education", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/03/282608-watch-fourth-grader-take-school-board-task-floridas-standardized-testing-guidelines/", "wp-category-slugs": "education", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Education", "published_time": "2015-03-28T11:33:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-28T13:39:12-04:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-3_28_2015-11_31_35-AM.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "is_https": 0}, "article_summary": "Sydney Smoot, a fourth grader at Brooksville Elementary in Florida, had some harsh words for the Hernando County School Board earlier this month on the state\u2019s restrictive standardized testing program.\nIt took a lot of guts for Smoot to address the school board, but \u2013 as she told Upworthy via email \u2013 she couldn\u2019t have done it without her mom\u2019s encouragement.\nI had concerns about this test because there was a lot of stress put on students and myself.\nMy mom asked me how the testing went, and I told her I was told not to speak about the test to anyone.\n\u201cWhy should we have so much stress about one test when we should be learning and having fun at school?\u201d she asked."}
