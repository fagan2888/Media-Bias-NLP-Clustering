She's also become a minor media celebrity in the past few weeks, repeatedly sharing her story of how the Affordable Care Act will raise her medical costs. Since October 23, Cavallaro has been interviewed on the NBC Nightly News, CNBC, the public radio show \u201cMarketplace,\u201d two local Los Angeles TV newscasts, and in Hiltzik\u2019s own newspaper.\n\nAs all the news reports have noted, Cavallaro\u2019s insurer informed her that it\u2019s canceling her policy and instead offering a new plan with a higher premium. \u201cHer only option is to be forced into a policy she doesn\u2019t want and can\u2019t afford,\u201d reported KCBS-TV. \u201cFor the first time in my whole life, I will be without insurance,\u201d she lamented on KNBC-TV.\n\n\u201cThere were just a lot of gaps in her story,\u201d Hiltzik told me in a phone conversation this week. \u201cIt just seemed to me that all the people who were going on the air and telling her story were leaving critical things out.\u201d\n\nSo Hiltzik \u2013 a Pulitzer Prize winner who regularly writes about health care -- did something relatively uncommon for mainstream newspaper writers. He called Cavallaro, conducted his own interview, and used his blog to poke holes in the other news organizations\u2019 stories.\n\nBrowsing on Covered California, the state\u2019s new online insurance exchange, Hiltzik found little basis for Cavallaro\u2019s fear \u2013 unchallenged in most of the news stories -- that she\u2019ll be forced to pay sharply higher premiums or be left without insurance at all. In fact, Hiltzik found that Cavallaro can choose among several health plans, including at least one with similar benefits and lower premiums than her current policy.\n\n\u201c[T]he reporters who interviewed her without getting all the facts produced inexcusably shoddy work,\u201d Hiltzik wrote in an Oct. 30 blog post.\n\nMedia fact-checking the media\n\nHiltzik is one of several journalists and bloggers who\u2019ve taken it upon themselves to debunk \u201chorror stories\u201d about Obamacare, including Erik Wemple in The Washington Post, Eric Stern in Salon, and Paul Waldman in The American Prospect (where Hiltzik first learned about Cavallaro). They and other writers identified gaps in media reports about disgruntled consumers who appeared on \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d Fox News\u2019s \u201cHannity,\u201d and other outlets.\n\n\u201cThe whole concept of the media checking the media is a new phenomenon,\u201d said Duke University professor Bill Adair, a Poynter adjunct faculty member who created the Politifact website.\n\n\u201cPeople in the media are realizing that they need to hold everybody accountable, including their colleagues,\u201d Adair said in a phone interview.\n\nIn the not-so-distant past, mainstream news organizations generally avoided direct criticism of their competitors\u2019 journalism. While it wasn\u2019t unusual for newspapers and broadcasters to follow up on other organizations\u2019 reporting \u2013 and sometimes find errors in those earlier stories -- such matters traditionally were handled relatively politely.\n\n\u201cSometimes we would say, \u2018Contrary to reports published elsewhere,\u2019 \u201d recalled Hiltzik, a 40-year newspaper veteran.\n\nBut Hiltzik no longer sees the need for such restraint when calling out competing news organizations. As he sees it, the media now promote their stories more loudly, and some organizations tinge them with partisan politics.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an invitation for the gloves to come off,\u201d he said. \u201cIf CNBC is crowing about discovering something and we know they haven\u2019t discovered anything, we should say so.\u201d\n\nMainstream news organizations\u2019 newfound aggression in fact-checking their fellow journalists may also be a reaction to the rise of websites that offer critiques of the media\u2019s political coverage. Sites such as the liberal Media Matters for America and the conservative Newsbusters helped carve out a new type of media analysis that\u2019s constantly rebutting and fact-checking individual news stories, talk-show interviews, and other political-related content.\n\nTraditional news organizations that delve into media commentary often find it's popular with readers. Hiltzik said his blog posts about Deborah Cavallaro generated some 32,000 \u201clikes,\u201d far more than anything else he\u2019s written lately, while Wemple\u2019s two-year-old media-criticism blog at The Washington Post attracts a consistent audience.\n\n\u201cPeople care about what\u2019s on TV,\u201d Wemple said in a phone interview. \u201cWhen you write about cable and when you write about broadcast news, you tend to get a lot of traffic and comment.\u201d For example, Wemple\u2019s recent debunking of reports about a Florida woman\u2019s Obamacare woes was referenced by dozens of other sites.\n\nCriticizing the critics, debunking the debunkers\n\nNot surprisingly, columns and blog posts that criticize specific news stories sometimes themselves become fodder for a second round of critiques. After Hiltzik\u2019s pointed attack of the Cavallaro coverage, Conn Carroll at the conservative website Townhall responded with his own analysis, headlined \u201cDebunking the Debunkers.\u201d\n\nOne of the news organizations that broadcast Cavallaro's story also defended its work in an interview with Poynter.\n\n\u201cI think people like Michael Hiltzik are kind of overlooking the context,\u201d said \u201cMarketplace\u201d editor George Judson, who noted that Cavallaro was one of several voices in a broader radio report about consumers who are receiving insurance-cancellation notices.\n\n\u201cWe were simply telling people that this was going on, and here was somebody who was angry,\u201d Judson said in a phone interview. \u201cWhat we published was accurate.\u201d\n\nCavallaro herself also responded to Hiltzik during her most recent interview, an appearance on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s national radio show. She praised Hiltzik for \u201cdoing a good reporting job\u201d and confirmed that she hadn\u2019t shopped on the Covered California exchange to see what insurance plans are available to her.\n\nBut she also brought up two issues that were omitted or glossed over in most of the media stories. She said she\u2019s reluctant to enroll in the less expensive plans because they may not include her current doctors, and she\u2019s avoiding the California exchange website, apparently because she\u2019s heard news reports about privacy concerns with the federal exchange.\n\nIn that interview Cavallaro wasn\u2019t confined to a short sound bite or two and came across as more enlightening and likely more representative of people on the individual insurance market who are struggling to navigate Obamacare\u2019s rollout -- which is indeed plagued with problems, notwithstanding the sometimes misguided media coverage.\n\nNo, Cavallaro\u2019s not being forced to go uninsured, as some journalists trumpeted without question. But the new law may require her to make compromises as she chooses a new health plan. And she -- like several of the other Americans portrayed in the media horror stories \u2013 is getting little information about her options from her insurance company or the government.\n\n\u201cIt appeared as if [the media] decided the story was people getting kicked off their plans and being bummed out, so that\u2019s the story they told,\u201d said Wemple, who argues that more-nuanced reporting would be both more informative and more compelling. \u201cThe straight-up simplistic story that they told wasn\u2019t nearly as interesting.\u201d\n\nAdam Hochberg is a contributor to \u201cThe New Ethics of Journalism: Principles for the 21st Century.\u201d The new book is a compilation of essays and case studies edited by Kelly McBride and Tom Rosenstiel, with a foreword by Bob Steele, for use in newsrooms, classrooms and other settings dedicated to a marketplace of ideas that serves democracy.
