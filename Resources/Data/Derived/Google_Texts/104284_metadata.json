( Ben Margot / Associated Press )\n\nTwo-minute drill Turning point \u2014 Colorado failed to score in the second overtime when quarterback Sefo Liufau and running back Tony Jones had a miscommunication about which way the play was going and Liufau was thrown for a loss. Notable number \u2014 The game time of 4 hours, 1 minute was the longest in CU history, topping the previous by 1 minute. That game was played between CU and Missouri in Boulder in 1999. Difference-maker \u2014 Cal receiver Stephen Anderson caught seven passes for 136 yards including a 75-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter. He replaced usual starter Darius Powe in the starting lineup. Injuries \u2014 Tedric Thompson (sternum) is day-to-day.\n\nBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 Colorado fans will debate the play calling at the end of this one for years. What could have been a magical victory became a record-setting dud for the Buffs.\n\nThe Colorado football team not only played competitive football into the fourth quarter on the road in a Pac-12 Conference game Saturday, it pushed the Cal Bears into double overtime before falling 59-56 when James Langford made a 34-yard field goal to give the Bears a come-from-behind win a week after they surrendered a lead and lost to Arizona on a Hail Mary.\n\n\"If you're a fan, that was a fun one to watch,\" CU coach Mike MacIntyre said. \"If you're the losing team, that was absolutely gut-wrenching. Our players played their hearts out.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Buffs had two opportunities to score from the 1-yard line in the second overtime and could not punch it in with fullback George Frazier stuffed on a run up the middle and quarterback Sefo Liufau thrown for a loss on fourth down on what looked like a busted play.\n\nMacIntyre described it as a miscommunication. It appeared senior running back Tony Jones believed the play was called to one side and ran that way but Liufau went the other way.\n\n\"That was a mess up at a tough time,\" MacIntyre said. \"That play did not lose the football game though. We could have made a bunch of others during the regular game.\"\n\nIt was a frustrating end to a crazy game in which the Buffs surrendered 45 points after halftime, playing without starting safety and leading tackler Tedric Thompson, who left with a bruised sternum. Thompson nabbed his third interception of the season in the first half. The two starting quarterbacks each threw seven touchdown passes and finished with 449 yards passing.\n\nIt was the first game in Football Bowl Subdivision history in which both teams threw seven touchdown passes.\n\nIt was just one of numerous records set on both sides in a game in which the teams combined for 1,205 yards of total offense. The Buffs lost despite running 110 plays compared to 71 for Cal.\n\nLiufau made plays running the ball Saturday like never before in his CU career, including a 39-yard run in the first half that set up a touchdown. He set four single-game CU records for attempts (67), completions (46), touchdown passes (7) and total offense (521).\n\nLiufau said it was the first overtime game he has played since eighth grade and it almost didn't get to overtime because of an interception he threw with less than 3 minutes remaining in regulation. While running from pressure he threw into coverage and Cal linebacker Jake Kearney made the interception.\n\nCal scored three plays later to take a 49-42 lead but left the Buffs more than 2 minutes. Liufau led CU down the field on a clutch eight-play, 75-yard drive to tie the game on a 30-yard pass to Bryce Bobo with 21 seconds remaining.\n\nThe teams combined to score four touchdowns in the final 3 minutes, 23 seconds.\n\n\"You just give your playmakers a opportunity to go up and get it and I gave Bobo and chance and he came down with it,\" Liufau said.\n\nOne week after setting a new single-game record for receptions in a game, CU wide receiver Nelson Spruce smashed his week-old mark with 19 catches for 176 yards and three touchdowns.\n\n\"We've had our fair share of losses, but I think since I've been here this is probably the toughest one I've been a part of,\" said Spruce, a fourth-year junior.\n\nCU place-kicker Will Oliver blamed himself for the loss after missing three field goals from 39, 39 and 45 yards. Oliver sat teary eyed in the interview room afterward saying he wanted to take responsibility.\n\n\"They gave me the option not to come in here, but I think it's important to be responsible,\" he said.\n\nOliver said he missed the kicks because he was compensating for wind. He said his teammates said they completely support him.\n\n\"That hurts more,\" he said. \"...This is a real first where you feel completely responsible. It's the beauty and the terrible part about being a kicker.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA 59, COLORADO 56, 2OT\n\nColorado\n\n21\n\n7\n\n7\n\n14\n\n7\n\n0\n\n\u2014\n\n56\n\nCalifornia\n\n7\n\n7\n\n21\n\n14\n\n7\n\n3\n\n\u2014\n\n59\n\nFirst quarter:\n\nCol \u2014 S.Irwin 22 pass from Liufau (Oliver kick), 10:52.
