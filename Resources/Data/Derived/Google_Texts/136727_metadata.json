The survey revealed that manufacturers expect to expand, yet they also expressed concern about the looming shortage of skilled employees (especially fueled by retirements), the costs of health care, and government policies.\n\nThe survey is produced by Enterprise Minnesota (www.enterpriseminnesota.org) and is the most comprehensive survey of Minnesota's manufacturers.\n\nA whopping 89 percent of manufacturing executives say they are confident about the future of their firms, which is the highest recorded mark in the survey\u2019s seven-year history and a five point increase over the 2014 mark.\n\nThe cost of providing health insurance to employees again tops of the list of manufacturers\u2019 concerns (56 percent), down 15 points from its high of 71 percent in 2011 following the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s business climate was again ranked by manufacturers as the biggest potential impediment to growth at 43 percent, though this number is down five points from 2014.\n\n\u201cMinnesota\u2019s manufacturers are undoubtedly bullish about their prospects for 2015,\u201d said Enterprise Minnesota president and CEO Bob Kill. \u201cThe chronic shortage of qualified workers, however, has manufacturers increasingly concerned that they will not be able to take full advantage of the improving economy.\u201d\n\nThe results of the survey will be presented at a series of briefings throughout Minnesota from May 13 to September 10 in Minneapolis, Mankato, Eagan, Duluth, Moorhead, Brainerd, St. Cloud, Alexandria, Willmar, Albert Lea, Owatonna, Elk River, Red Wing, Winona, Hibbing, Rochester, and Litchfield.
