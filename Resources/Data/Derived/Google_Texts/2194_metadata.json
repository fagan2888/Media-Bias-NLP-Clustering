One of the IOM\u2019s recommendations is that CMS and other payers should design and evaluate innovative payment models to improve care delivery.\n\nAlthough only a step in the payment and delivery reform process, the OCM holds significant promise of boosting patient satisfaction and improving the overall quality of care. Participation in the Oncology Care Model, or OCM, is voluntary for oncology practices. Those volunteering practices will be required to refine their care processes to focus on the needs of patients who are undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nOn Feb. 12, the CMS Innovation Center announced a \u201cnew multi-payer payment and care delivery model to support better care coordination for cancer care.\u201d The OCM is the second specialty care model the Innovation Center has developed and launched. The Innovation Center was established by the Affordable Care Act and given the charge of testing innovative health care payment and delivery models that will improve care quality and reduce CMS spending.\n\nThe National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship immediately applauded the Innovation Center announcement of the OCM, which detailed the Medicare payment streams that physicians participating in the demonstration project will receive. What did we see in the announcement of a new payment system that holds promise for changing patient care?\n\nFor NCCS, the most important elements of the OCM are structuring care into six-month episodes, reimbursing physicians through a per beneficiary per month payment of $160 (for each month of the six-month episode) to help them address the complex needs of patients receiving chemotherapy, and defining with specificity several patient-centered changes that practices must undertake.\n\n\u2022 Physician practices that choose to participate in the OCM must do these things to change their procedures and processes:\n\n\u2022 Provide patient navigation services;\n\n\u2022 Document a care plan that meets the standards outlined by the Institute of Medicine;\n\n\u2022 Provide 24/7 patient access to a clinician with access to the patient\u2019s medical records;\n\n\u2022 Treat patients according to nationally recognized clinical guidelines;\n\n\u2022 Engage in continuous quality improvement; and\n\n\u2022 Use electronic health records and meet certain meaningful use standards by the third year of the demonstration.\n\nNCCS has, for a decade, sought a modest reform of the traditional fee-for-service Medicare payment system: the establishment of a reimbursable cancer care planning and coordination service. We endorsed and championed legislation to establish the Medicare cancer care planning and coordination service, which was defined in legislative language in a manner consistent with the standards of the Institute of Medicine definition. We believed that a written care plan would trigger a shared decision-making process and foster better coordination of cancer care.\n\nWe are pleased to see the cancer care planning and coordination service among those services that a physician practice must provide to patients in order to participate in the OCM. Just as we saw the discrete cancer care planning service/code as a first step in reform of fee-for-service payment and promotion of quality care, so we see it as one of the core practice reforms in the OCM.\n\nIn addition to paying those practices that participate in the OCM a per beneficiary per month fee, the demonstration project would reimburse all Part A, Part B, and certain Part D services that a chemotherapy patient receives on a fee-for-service basis. The demonstration project would also hold the potential for performance-based payments, which are intended to incentivize practices to improve care and lower the total cost of care provided in the six-month period. CMS has indicated that reductions in cost of care will result from avoiding hospitalizations and emergency department visits.\n\nThese two elements of the demonstration project\u2014the continuation of fee-for-service payments and the potential for performance-based payments\u2014have stimulated criticism. Some have criticized the OCM for relying on the fee-for-service payment system, which they say is broken. Others say that performance-based payments hold the potential to encourage \u201cstinting\u201d on care.\n\nNCCS believes that the keys to the success of the OCM and to delivery of patient-centered care are: 1) achieving cancer care practice transformation by successful adoption of the six core practice standards of the OCM, and 2) performance according to the quality measures identified in the OCM. We have heard it suggested that oncology practices may choose to participate in the demonstration in order to receive the per beneficiary per month payments and that the practice transformation outlined in the OCM will be easily achieved.\n\nWe are gratified that the CMS Innovation Center has included in the OCM implementation plan several reporting and monitoring efforts such as tracking of claims to detect possible systematic stinting on care, patient surveys, reporting of the use of model funds (through the per beneficiary per month payments) for infrastructure enhancements to achieve practice transformation, and time-and-motion studies to document practice staff time dedicated to such activities as care coordination.\n\nThrough our work as patient advocate advisors to practices that are developing and implementing patient-centered oncology medical homes, we have had the pleasure of collaborating with oncology practices that have a keen interest in transforming their practices and honoring principles of patient-centeredness.\n\nThese oncologists are truly committed to the delivery of the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. We believe that these practices, which are admittedly leaders in the transformation process, are also representative of practices in general. There is strong interest in patient-centered practice, and we do not anticipate that practices will enroll in the demonstration simply to receive per beneficiary per month payments. However, the Innovation Center monitoring plan will protect against such enrollments.\n\nReform of Medicare delivery and payment often occurs in incremental fashion, and the OCM is consistent with that tradition. However, the standards for reform that are articulated in the OCM are decidedly patient-focused.\n\nWe encourage additional payers to join Medicare in the OCM, and we encourage oncology practices to participate. The OCM will provide practices important resources to improve the processes and procedures they employ to care for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Patients are relying on their physicians to embrace this opportunity for change and for ongoing quality improvement.\n\nThe author is the CEO of the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "2015-02-27 19:35:56", "description": "NCCS CEO Applauds Oncology Care Model\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Shelley Fuld Nasso\r\nThe recent announcement by the Innovation Center at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding the launch of an Oncology Care Model is an important step toward patient-centered cancer care.\r\nIn 2013, the Institute of Medicine released its report, &ldquo;Delivering High-Quality Cancer Care: Charting a New Course for a System in Crisis.&rdquo; According to the IOM, the American cancer care system is in crisis due to three failings: it is often not patient-centered, does not provide well-coordinated care, and does not always encourage evidence-based treatment decisions.
