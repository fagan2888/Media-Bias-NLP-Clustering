Now here\u2019s Pew confirming the topline finding: Yes indeed, youngsters are a bit more likely than older adults to say that parents, not the state, should have the final say over vaccinations. Not a result you\u2019d expect from the age demographic which has the fewest percentage of parents in it, right?\n\nBut look more closely at the numbers. In YouGov\u2019s poll, the split in support among young adults for state-imposed vaccine mandates and parental choice was 42/43. Every other age group saw at least 50 percent support for mandates. Contrast that with what Pew found:\n\nBiiiiig difference among young adults, from -1 net opposition to mandates in YouGov\u2019s poll to +18 net support here. Maybe YouGov had a bum result due to the comparatively small sample size. Or maybe young adults have shifted away from supporting mandates and towards letting parents decide over the past six months. Read the fine print above and you\u2019ll see that Pew\u2019s poll was taken last August while YouGov\u2019s was taken this month. I \u2026 would not have predicted that young adults would become more pro-choice on vaccines with headlines blaring news about a measles outbreak at Disneyland gradually leaching into other states.\n\nMore from Pew:\n\nIn the Pew survey, strong majorities of Republicans (65%), Democrats (76%) and independents (65%) are in favor of requiring vaccinations. But when it comes to parental discretion, about one-third of Republicans and independents say parents should make the decision about immunizations, compared with 22% of Democrats. In 2009, there was no such divide between Democrats and Republicans, according to Pew\u2019s report.\n\nNot surprising. Republicans have become more suspicious of big government, particularly health-care mandates, since Obama took office and hatched ObamaCare. Apparently that\u2019s pushed a small but significant percentage of righties away from vaccine mandates and towards parental choice. What\u2019s interesting is that being anti-mandate doesn\u2019t seem to have made Republicans anti-vaccine: The hottest hotbeds of vaccine opposition are liberal communities. Anti-mandate Republicans are, it seems, still making sure their own kids get their shots. Anti-mandate liberals, not as much.\n\nAs for why young adults are more anti-mandate than the rest of the population, read Friday\u2019s post for a few half-assed theories. YouGov has a new poll out today showing that the \u201cchoice\u201d ethic that seems to guide youngsters on vaccines applies to other medical procedures too:\n\nMeanwhile, Fusion has a poll of millennials out today in which it asked, \u201cIn general, do you see government as helpful or harmful?\u201d Young adults split 57/18 in favor of helpful. Yay, government \u2014 except when it comes to guaranteeing herd immunity to protect immuno-compromised kids, I guess.\n\nVia the Free Beacon, here\u2019s Matt Lauer with Chuck Todd performing an unlikely reality check for the GOP\u2019s benefit on the \u201cToday\u201d show this morning.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Hmmm.", "title": "Another poll shows group most likely to oppose vaccine mandates is \u2026 young adults", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/02/03/another-poll-shows-group-most-likely-to-oppose-vaccine-mandates-is-young-adults/", "image": {"width": 247, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/p.jpg", "height": 525}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "adults, age, measles, party, pew, poll, vaccinations, vaccines, young,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-03T22:21:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-03T19:49:55+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5ac\"", "article_summary": "In YouGov\u2019s poll, the split in support among young adults for state-imposed vaccine mandates and parental choice was 42/43.\nAnother poll shows group most likely to oppose vaccine mandates is \u2026 young adultsposted at 5:21 pm on February 3, 2015 by AllahpunditYouGov made waves with their poll on this subject last Friday.\nContrast that with what Pew found:Biiiiig difference among young adults, from -1 net opposition to mandates in YouGov\u2019s poll to +18 net support here.\nApparently that\u2019s pushed a small but significant percentage of righties away from vaccine mandates and towards parental choice.\nOr maybe young adults have shifted away from supporting mandates and towards letting parents decide over the past six months."}
