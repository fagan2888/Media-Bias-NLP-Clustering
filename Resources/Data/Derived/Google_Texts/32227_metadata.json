I think its a mistake for Germany, I think Europe is feeling the pain of it now, and I think it will be a mistake for the United States.\u201d\n\nBolton told Breitbart that President Obama is ignoring the Settled Refugee Doctrine, and that resettlement should be a last resort in only the most extreme cases.\n\n\u201cThe Settled Refugee Doctrine, the preferred course is to repatriate the refugees at the earliest opportunity to the places that they came from and then in the meantime you provide, through the UN high commissioner for refugees and other agencies, protection and assistance for them in refugee camps.\u201d\n\nBolton acknowledged that a life in a refugee camp isn\u2019t a \u201chappy existence, but it\u2019s what you do for a period of time until the reason that they fled is taken care of.\u201d\n\nBolton is concerned that, by telling Syrian refugees that they are all welcomed into the United States, that you\u2019re telling other refugees that America doesn\u2019t have enough space for them.\n\n\u201cWhen you just say, we\u2019re gonna take people from a given area in, without even seeking to decide whether they qualify as refugees, you\u2019re telling people who may be legitimate refugees elsewhere in the world that we don\u2019t have room for you. I just think that\u2019s unfair and discriminatory against people who really do suffer from a well founded fear of persecution.\u201d\n\nHe also blasted President Obama\u2019s handling of ISIS and believes our enemies are going to do as much as possible while Obama is still in office.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the next year, the pace and scope of the challenges we\u2019re going to face is actually going to increase, because our adversaries don\u2019t know any more than you and I do who is going to win the 2016 election, but they know they\u2019ve got another year of Obama, so this is the time to take advantage of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama has turned his attention away from America\u2019s position in the world and protecting our friends and allies,\u201d Bolton told Breitbart News. \u201cIt has resulted in a perception of American weakness and therefore given rise to our adversaries, given rise to the opportunity to take advantage of it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former United Nations Ambassador, John Bolton, criticized President Obama's handling of the refugee crisis.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Former United Nations Ambassador, John Bolton, criticized President Obama's handling of the refugee crisis.", "title": "Bolton: President Obama Ignoring Framework on Refugees", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Bolton-John-AP-Photo-Dennis-Cook.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/01/exclusive-ambassador-bolton-president-obama-ignoring-international-framework-dealing-refugees/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former United Nations Ambassador, John Bolton, criticized President Obama's handling of the refugee crisis.", "title": "Bolton: President Obama Ignoring Framework on Refugees", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Bolton-John-AP-Photo-Dennis-Cook.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ambassador Bolton, refugees, Syria,Big Government, Immigration,Bolton", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Syria", "published_time": "2015-12-01T09:56:22-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Bolton said that following in the steps of other European countries and accepting Syrian refugees is a recipe for disaster.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cObama is just ignoring the settled knowledge and experience of, tragically, decades of dealing with refugees whether from war zones or natural disasters.\u201dDespite opposition from lawmakers, President Obama is planning to brin in 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of next year.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFormer United Nations Ambassador, John Bolton, criticized President Obama\u2019s handling of the refugee crisis and said that the president is ignoring the processes in place for dealing with refugees.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just say, \u2018ok well we have a war in Syria, let\u2019s open our border to 800,000 people\u2019 as Germany has done.\n\u201cWhat Obama has done is just junk the entire international framework that has been established for over 70 years really, since the end of WWII on how to handle refugee problems, this from the president who purports to be Mr. International Law,\u201d Bolton told Breitbart News exclusively."}
