Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., pastor of Chicago's Trinity United Church of Christ and former pastor of Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., addresses a breakfast gathering at the National Press Club in Washington, Monday, April 28, 2008. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\n3850933\n\nIllinois state workers with ties to President Obama and the Rev. Jeremiah Wright have been charged with fraud involving grants from state health and commerce departments, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nIn total, 13 state workers have been charged after a multi-year investigation found fraudulent state grant and contract activity adding up to more than $16 million, including embezzlement from an AIDS benefit organization.\n\nThe numerous cases \u2014 some of which stretch back to 2011 \u2014 were investigated by the U.S. Postal Service, the Internal Revenue Service and the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s office, according to the Sun-Times.\n\nJeri L. Wright, whose father was Obama\u2019s controversial pastor, is charged with money laundering and making false statements to a grand jury.\n\nWright said she is a \u201cclose associate and friend\u201d with Regina and Ronald Evans. Mrs. Evans is the former police chief of Country Club Hills, Ill.\n\nThe Evanses will soon be sentenced for embezzling nearly half of a $1.25 million commerce grant. The couple admitted that they spent the loot on personal debt and gifts for friends.\n\nQuinshaunta Golden is the former chief of staff to long-time Obama friend Eric E. Whitaker, the former head of the Illinois Department of Public Health. Jones is accused of skimming $433,000 in kickbacks on health department grants and contracts, according to the Sun-Times.\n\nThe Sun-Times reported that Whitaker is cooperating with the investigation and had no knowledge of Golden\u2019s scheme.\n\nRetired south side Chicago state Rep. Connie Howard, a Democrat, admitted to embezzling tens of thousands of dollars for personal and political use, according to the Sun-Times.\n\nHoward co-founded Let\u2019s Talk, Let\u2019s Test, which was devoted to ending the scourge of AIDS in Chicago\u2019s black community. The former executive director of the group is accused of embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars in grant money for personal use.\n\nOther examples of fraud include two members of the National Black Nurses Association. Margaret Davis admitted to spending half a million dollars on personal mortgage and credit card payments. Her associate, Tonja Cook, admitted to helping in the scheme.\n\nAlso set for trial is Chicago businessman Leon Dingle Jr. and his wife Karin. They are accused of using $3 million in health grants for various personal investments.\n\nJacqueline Kilpatrick and Edward Clemons, associates of the Dingles, are accused of using $700,000 in embezzled funds to pay for a vacation home in South Carolina as well as luxury cars and a fur coat.\n\nBrian Costin, director of government reform at the Illinois Policy Institute, said that the large investigation is evidence of widespread systemic issues.\n\n\u201cGrant fraud has been a problem in Illinois for many years,\u201d Costin told The Daily Caller News Foundation in a phone interview. \u201cThere\u2019s virtually no transparency or accountability measures built into the system.\u201d\n\nCostin said that bills proposing increased transparency are routinely shot down by the state legislature.\n\n\u201cSome people had connections in one way or another to the President, and maybe they felt \u2018hey, we can get away with this,\u2019\u201d said Costin who said that he is very worried about the potential for widespread fraud with the implementation of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of grants being given out to various local agencies to make this push to register people for Obamacare or Medicaid,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there going to be transparency over this process?\u201d\n\nOver $190 million worth of no-bid contracts will be issued to help track track, store, and process the state\u2019s cases under Obamacare, according to a recent Fox News report. The massive program will require many states to upgrade their information technology systems.\n\nIllinois was able to circumvent the contract bidding process by partnering with the state of Michigan which uses the Maryland-based company Client Network Services Incorporated to process its Medicaid claims.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal cancelled a contract with CNSI after the company was targeted in an investigation into possible criminal activity over the procurement of a $200 million contract.\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
