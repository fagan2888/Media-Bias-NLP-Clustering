The presentation infuriated one main in particular, Norman Seabrook, the powerful president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association, who believed the incidents should be handled internally. For the next two years he did everything in his power to get rid of the investigator, Florence Finkle. He helped scuttle some of her investigations, got one of her top people transferred, called for her resignation and denounced her on his weekly radio show. In August, he finally got his wish: Ms. Finkle was forced out, replaced by a former senior Police Department official-a childhood friend of Mr. Seabrook's.\n\nRead the whole New York Times profile of Seabrook's power here.\n\nBill de Blasio says he won't let this stand. LOL J/K. For guys like de Blasio social justice means backing the unions and not something like making sure scoundrels aren't tolerated in the prison system. It's such an uphill battle sometimes.\n\nMy exposure to Norman Seabrook comes from hearing corrections officers union commercials on WABC during the Mets broadcasts. They're pretty loathesome, I can't find any online but the copy of the one I heard claims corrections officers are what keeps criminals from raping and killing your relatives. The spots end with the line \"Without us, how safe would you really be?\" It's a disturbing question if the listener is an inmate of the New York City corrections system. And even for law-abiding residents of New York City the answer to Seabrook's question isn't so clear cut. Depending how widespread the abuse Seabrook is covering up is, it could be leading to increased recidivism and hardened ex-cons.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Another piece of anecdotal evidence of how law enforcement unions stymie reforms aimed at reducing official violence, this one via New York City's Correction", "title": "Oh Look, NYC Corrections Officers Union Blocking Reforms, Investigations at Rikers Island", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/12/15/oh-look-nyc-corrections-officers-union-b", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14186810689915.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Another piece of anecdotal evidence of how law\nenforcement unions stymie reforms aimed at reducing official\nviolence, this one via New York City's Correction Officers'\nBenevolent Association and \nThe New York Times:\n\nWith brutality by guards at the Rikers Island jail complex\nrising at an alarming rate, the chief investigator for the New York\nCity Correction Department stood before a roo", "creator": "@edkrayewski", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14186810689915.jpg", "title": "Oh Look, NYC Corrections Officers Union Blocking Reforms, Investigations at Rikers Island", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "New York City", "published_time": "2014-12-15T22:09:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ed-krayewski"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd096d\"", "article_summary": "My exposure to Norman Seabrook comes from hearing corrections officers union commercials on WABC during the Mets broadcasts.\nIt's a disturbing question if the listener is an inmate of the New York City corrections system.\nAnd even for law-abiding residents of New York City the answer to Seabrook's question isn't so clear cut.\nThey're pretty loathesome, I can't find any online but the copy of the one I heard claims corrections officers are what keeps criminals from raping and killing your relatives.\nThe presentation infuriated one main in particular, Norman Seabrook, the powerful president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association, who believed the incidents should be handled internally."}
