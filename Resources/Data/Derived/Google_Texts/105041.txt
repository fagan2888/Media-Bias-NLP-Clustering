US Airways has apologized after a flight attendant reportedly refused to let a U.S. Army soldier hang his uniform in the aircraft’s closet.

First Sgt. Albert Marle was boarding a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Charlotte, North Carolina, Thursday when he asked an attendant if she could hang up his military jacket to keep it from wrinkling, Fox News reported.

The flight attendant reportedly refused, telling him the closet was reserved for first-class passengers only.

An airline spokesman initially claimed that the closet was full, but passengers disagreed, Fox News reported.

“She kept saying it was against company policy … it wasn’t against company policy,” first-class passenger Cliff Autrey told “Fox & Friends” Saturday.

Brian Kirby, another first-class passenger, told an ABC affiliate in Charlotte: “I was really appalled at not only the way she looked at him but the way she spoke to him in an angry type of attitude.”

US Airways has apologized and said it was reviewing the incident.

“We have a long and proud history of serving our military members and hold the men and women who serve our country in the highest regard,” the airline said in a statement, Fox News reported.

A spokesman said the airline was trying to get in touch with Sgt. Marle to thank him for his service.
