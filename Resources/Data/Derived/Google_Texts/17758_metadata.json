Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, citing her work to advance women's equality and his conspicuous lack thereof.\n\n\"While we wish we could support the man who once posed nude in our pages, his policy positions just aren't as solid as his abs were in the '80s,\" the magazine's editors explained. \"We support Jeanne Shaheen for Senate.\"\n\nCosmopolitan praised Shaheen as \"one of country's most vocal and active leaders on reproductive freedom and other women's rights issues,\" acknowledging her work to expand equal pay protections and abortion rights.\n\n\"Her opponent, Scott Brown, is less clear about his views on reproductive rights,\" the editors added, criticizing Brown for voting to defund Planned Parenthood and reportedly dodging reporters' questions about contraception.\n\n\"Scott Brown may have been Cosmopolitan's 'sexiest man' in 1982, but in 2014, we're picking brains over brawn -- and that's Jeanne Shaheen,\" the editors wrote.\n\nBrown has said he decided to pose nude to help pay for law school. At the time of the photo shoot, he was a law student in his third year at Boston College.\n\nBrown and Shaheen are currently locked in a tight race, with most surveys reflecting a small lead for the Democrat. A CBS News/New York Times analysis released earlier this month found Shaheen ahead, 47 to 41 percent.\n\nThe race has been targeted by national GOP groups as a potential pick-up opportunity for the party. Republicans need a net gain of six seats in November to seize the Senate majority.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brown, a Republican running for Senate in New Hampshire, once shed his clothes for a photo shoot in the magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cosmopolitan-endorses-opponent-of-former-nude-centerfold-scott-brown/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/09/25/2375d118-f5d3-4481-b1f0-31ff3cec6e1c/thumbnail/1200x630/32cb13f2386a57fc552acfc7f25eadd4/2014-09-10t132230z825850279tm3ea9a0pxe01rtrmadp3usa-election-new-hampshire.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Brown, a Republican running for Senate in New Hampshire, once shed his clothes for a photo shoot in the magazine", "title": "\u200bCosmopolitan endorses opponent of former nude centerfold Scott Brown"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brown, a Republican running for Senate in New Hampshire, once shed his clothes for a photo shoot in the magazine", "title": "\u200bCosmopolitan endorses opponent of former nude centerfold Scott Brown", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/cosmopolitan-endorses-opponent-of-former-nude-centerfold-scott-brown/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/cosmopolitan-endorses-opponent-of-former-nude-centerfold-scott-brown/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cosmopolitan-endorses-opponent-of-former-nude-centerfold-scott-brown/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/09/25/2375d118-f5d3-4481-b1f0-31ff3cec6e1c/thumbnail/1200x630/32cb13f2386a57fc552acfc7f25eadd4/2014-09-10t132230z825850279tm3ea9a0pxe01rtrmadp3usa-election-new-hampshire.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cosmopolitan-endorses-opponent-of-former-nude-centerfold-scott-brown/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/cosmopolitan-endorses-opponent-of-former-nude-centerfold-scott-brown/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e18\"", "article_summary": "\"Her opponent, Scott Brown, is less clear about his views on reproductive rights,\" the editors added, criticizing Brown for voting to defund Planned Parenthood and reportedly dodging reporters' questions about contraception.\nIt's a fair bet that Scott Brown, once a member of the world's greatest deliberative body, won't be doing any more nude photo shoots for Cosmopolitan magazine -- not after a betrayal like this.\n\"Scott Brown may have been Cosmopolitan's 'sexiest man' in 1982, but in 2014, we're picking brains over brawn -- and that's Jeanne Shaheen,\" the editors wrote.\nOn Wednesday, though, Cosmopolitan endorsed Brown's opponent, Sen.
