That\u2019s right, falling off of ladders while putting up Christmas lights or even falling off roofs. And then there\u2019s the few who are hospitalized from injuries caused by \u201cDUI\u201d \u2014 decorating under the influence.\n\n\u201cThey try to decorate when they\u2019re drunk,\u201d Dr. Carlos Roldan, a Texas ER doctor who has seen plenty of holiday injury cases, told NBC News. \u201cAnd the next thing you know, we seem them [in the ER].\u201d\n\nDr. Roldan also told NBC News the story of a man who fell off a ladder in September while putting up Christmas lights. \u201cHe lost his balance as his wife was on the ladder trying to hand him his walker,\u201d Roldan, who works at Memorial Hermann-Hospital in Houston, said. \u201cWho told him he should be on the roof?\u201d\n\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) found that the number of U.S. ER cases that have to do with holiday decorating has risen significantly in the past several years \u2014 from 12,000 cases in 2009 to 15,000 last year. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a bump each year since [2009],\u201d Kim Dulic, a CPSC spokeswoman, told NBC News. This averages out to about 250 people per day who are injured between the months of November and January. The typical injuries include lacerations, falls, and back strains, but Roldan mentions that there are more serious injuries: \u201cFrom broken necks to broken hips, the consequences can be catastrophic,\u201d he told NBC.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all \u2014 of course, how could we forget Christmas tree fires? Between 2009 and 2011, 200 inflamed trees accounted for some 10 deaths and $16 million lost in property, the CPSC reports.\n\nLadder Safety 101\n\nLadders seem to be a big problem. So many people have fallen off ladders while decorating the house or the tree that the CPSC posted several guidelines on how to use one safely. For example, you should always put your ladder on stable ground. Double check the maximum load rating to make sure it can withstand both your weight and the load you are carrying. Have someone stand at the bottom of the ladder to hold it from tipping, and make sure you stay grounded in the center of each ladder rung to prevent it from leaning too far in one direction.\n\nThe CPSC also provides some tips for safe trees, candles, lights, and fireplaces. Set up your Christmas trees away from any heat source, including heaters or radiators. Make sure you water the tree daily to keep it from drying out too soon. CPSC Acting Chairman Robert Adler says, \u201cKeep Christmas trees watered well, don\u2019t leave candles unattended, and use caution whenever you are on a ladder \u2026 Adding safety to your checklist can keep a holiday tradition from becoming a holiday tragedy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "holiday, decorating injuries, christmas lights, holidays, consumer product safety commission", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Follow these tips on how to prevent your holiday traditions from being dangerous.", "title": "Holiday Decorating Injuries: When Stringing Christmas Lights Lands You In ER", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/holiday-decorating-injuries-rise-when-stringing-christmas-lights-lands-you-er-264564", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/07/christmas.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Follow these tips on how to prevent your holiday traditions from being dangerous.", "title": "Holiday Decorating Injuries: When Stringing Christmas Lights Lands You In ER", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/holiday-decorating-injuries-rise-when-stringing-christmas-lights-lands-you-er-264564", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/07/christmas.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/07/christmas.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-12-07T17:08:36-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-10T17:22:25-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Follow these tips on how to prevent your holiday traditions from being dangerous."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00da\"", "article_summary": "Set up your Christmas trees away from any heat source, including heaters or radiators.\nBut that\u2019s not all \u2014 of course, how could we forget Christmas tree fires?\nDoctors are seeing a surge in ER cases that have to do with holiday decorating.\n\u201cThey try to decorate when they\u2019re drunk,\u201d Dr. Carlos Roldan, a Texas ER doctor who has seen plenty of holiday injury cases, told NBC News.\nThat\u2019s right, falling off of ladders while putting up Christmas lights or even falling off roofs."}
