Add in the thousands of Environmental Protection Agency regulations affecting our manufacturing, business and agricultural sectors and the price we are paying is huge.\n\nAt its heart, environmentalism hates capitalism.\n\nOne of the worst parts of this scam to take from the rich and give to the poor\u2014otherwise known as \u201credistribution\u201d\u2014is the way the world\u2019s media have played along since 1992 when the first Earth Summit was held in Rio. The perpetrators are headquartered in the United Nations, home to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that sets the agenda.\n\nWhile the 20th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2019s Conference of Parties meets in Lima, Peru this week, perhaps the most egregious and outrageous example of journalism was the December 2nd Associated Press article, \u201cHotter, Weirder: How Climate Change and Changed the Earth.\u201d It is not attributed to a specific reporter; perhaps because it is filled with lies from start to finish.\n\nIt starts with the biggest lie of all: \u201cWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In the more than two decades since world leaders first got together to try to solve global warming, life on Earth has changed, not just the climate. It\u2019s gotten hotter, more polluted with heat-trapping gases, more crowded and just downright wilder.\u201d\n\nThe Earth is in the 19th year of a natural cooling cycle, the result of a comparable cycle on the Sun which is producing less radiation to warm the planet. What astounds anyone who knows this is the article\u2019s assertion that \u201cIt\u2019s almost a sure thing that 2014 will go down as the hottest year in 135 years of record keeping, meteorologists at NOAA\u2019s National Climatic Data Center say. If so, this will be the sixth time since 1992 that the world set or tied a new annual record for the warmest year.\u201d\n\nWould government agencies that are beholden to the existing administration for their budgets lie to the public? Yes, they would. While all fifty states experienced freezing weather within the past month, we are still being told that 2014 set new records for warmth. To borrow a phrase from Jonathan Gruber, the architect of ObamaCare, the government can tell \u201cstupid\u201d voters and others anything it wants in order to achieve its goals.\n\nFor the record, in 2013 and much of 2014, there have been record low numbers of tornadoes and hurricanes. There was a record gain in Arctic and Antarctic ice. There was no change in the rate of sea level rise; something measured in millimeters. The weather is the weather and that includes dramatic events such as blizzards or droughts, but it is hardly uniform. Depending on where you live on planet Earth, you will experience it differently on any given day.\n\nAs representatives of 190 climate mafia meet in Peru, you will be given data about carbon dioxide (CO2). The AP article cites increases of \u201c60 percent.\u201d If that were true, it would be good news. All vegetation on Earth depends on CO2, just as humans and other living creatures depend on oxygen. More CO2 means healthier forests and greater crop yields, an agricultural bonus in a world that needs to feed seven billion people. But it\u2019s not true. Nor is the claim that the mere 0.04% of CO2 in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere traps so much heat we\u2019re all going to die. It doesn\u2019t and most of us will die of old age.\n\nAs Amy Ridenour of the National Center for Public Policy Research reported in June, \u201cThe U.S. already leads the world in CO2 reductions and is a great role model. U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions fell 12.6 percent between 2005 and 2012, thanks to technology and conservation. Worldwide, CO2 emissions increased by 17.7 percent during the same period.\u201d That\u2019s a far cry from the AP claim of 60 percent.\n\nThe Peru conference is another effort to impose a global tax on \u201ccarbon\u201d and to increase the UN\u2019s \u201cClimate Fund\u201d to which some nations have pledged $9.3 billion. To put this in perspective, the United States just set a new record of $18 TRILLION in debt and cannot afford to be pledging money to that fund or any other fund. Most of that debt has been incurred during the one and a half terms of Barack Obama who just happens to be telling everyone that \u201cclimate change\u201d is the greatest threat to all life on Earth.\n\n\u201cClimate change\u201d is what the 4.5 billion-year-old Earth has been doing during all that time and will continue to do. Humans experience it as the \u201cweather\u201d which is measured in days and weeks while climate is measured in units not less than thirty years and more often in centuries. Today\u2019s weather prediction is good for, at best, five days and is subject to change at any time.\n\nAs for all those claims about \u201cglobal warming\u201d it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that not one of the computer models cited to prove it has been accurate. There isn\u2019t a model or a computer big enough to take in all the many elements that compose the weather anywhere and everywhere on Earth. The weather is always in a state of flux and change, just as the temperatures during any hour of the day are in a stage of change.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit of advice. Do not believe anything that comes out of the UN conference because, scientifically speaking, it will be a lie. And don\u2019t believe anything the Associated Press reports on \u201cclimate change\u201d because that too must automatically be regarded as a lie as well.\n\nWhatever Barack Obama has to say about \u201cclimate change\u201d (formerly known as \u201cglobal warming\u201d) is a lie. It would be nice to have a President and a government we could trust.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/12/the-worlds-climate-change-mafia-meet-in-peru/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cartoon-Media-and-GW.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "The World\u2019s Climate Change Mafia Meet in Peru"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c95\"", "article_summary": "The perpetrators are headquartered in the United Nations, home to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that sets the agenda.\n\u201cClimate change\u201d is what the 4.5 billion-year-old Earth has been doing during all that time and will continue to do.\nAnd don\u2019t believe anything the Associated Press reports on \u201cclimate change\u201d because that too must automatically be regarded as a lie as well.\nWhatever Barack Obama has to say about \u201cclimate change\u201d (formerly known as \u201cglobal warming\u201d) is a lie.\nAs representatives of 190 climate mafia meet in Peru, you will be given data about carbon dioxide (CO2)."}
