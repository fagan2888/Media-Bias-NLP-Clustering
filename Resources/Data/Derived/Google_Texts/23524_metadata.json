After listing a lot of positive changes including cutting our deficits by 2/3s, Obama proceeded to bust Republicans on their denial of reality. Saying of the Bush years, \u201cTo hear them tell it, those were the good old days. The golden years.\u201d The President grinned as the audience laughed. \u201cAnd then me and Patty, we messed it up.\u201d\n\nThe audience went wild as that line settled in.\n\nThis is a must-watch if you like watching President Obama bust Republicans:\n\n\u201cWhich makes you wonder\u2013 why are all these Republican politicians so down on America?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, I know it\u2019s political season, but listening to them is really depressing. And it kind of doesn\u2019t match up with the truth. In the reality that they create, everything was terrific in 2008 \u2014 in the middle of the worst recession in our lifetimes,\u201d Obama said. The President reminded everyone of the reality, \u201cUnemployment, uninsured rates going up; we were in two wars, hopelessly addicted to foreign oil, bin Laden still at large. To hear them tell it, those were the good old days. The golden years. And then me and Patty, we messed it up.\u201d\n\nThe President acknowledged that people are still struggling, \u201cBut this is important because folks are \u2014 look, folks are struggling in communities around the country sometimes; they are trying to figure out how they can see their wages go up, and they\u2019re still struggling to afford a college education. So there are reasons why people want to see more improvement.\u201d\n\nBut then brought it back to the historical reality, \u201cBut they don\u2019t remember where we were.\u201d\n\nObama busted Republicans for trolling despair, \u201cAnd sometimes they may feel like there\u2019s no hope. And that\u2019s what the other side is counting on \u2014 is folks forgetting what happened the last time they were in charge.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to give them credit for chutzpah,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel bad for the fact-checkers who just cannot keep up with some of the stuff they say.\u201d (The audience loved this.)\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying, wait, wait, wait, what he just said about climate change \u2014 that\u2019s not true. But before that\u2019s happened, suddenly they\u2019re saying something else about immigration that\u2019s not true. Or they\u2019re saying something about the deficit that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nWhy are they denying reality? Because, as I write often in these pages, they have nothing else \u2013 or as the President put it, \u201cNow, part of the reason that they have to do this is because they keep running on the so many policies that caused so many problems in the first place.\u201d\n\nThis is what happens when a party refuses to admit its mistakes and adapt its policies according to historical realities. They are left denying reality and selling lies.\n\nA gander at the list of failed policies Republicans continue to run on, courtesy of the President, \u201cMore tax breaks for folks at the very top. Cutting investments in things like education. Repealing the Affordable Care Act and kicking millions off health insurance. Gutting Wall Street reform, risking another crisis by letting the biggest banks run wild. Denying that our planet is getting warmer, and thereby unraveling new rules on power plants to protect the air our kids breathe.\u201d\n\nYep. Nothing to see here.\n\nAnd on a sobering note, the President said, \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got to do something to prevent the kind of massacres we saw last week, and two months before that and two months before that, \u2014 and two months before that\u2026It\u2019s not normal. It is not inevitable. It doesn\u2019t just happen.\u201d This got a passionate round of applause that continued through the next paragraph.\n\n\u201cIt is a choice that we make, and it is a choice that we can change,\u201d Obama said, calling out the \u201cpolitics of fear\u201d used by politicians who refuse to do anything to pass reasonable gun safety laws. \u201cThere are ways to protect our children and protect our rights. Don\u2019t pretend that they\u2019re aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, look, it\u2019s comfortable to just say Washington doesn\u2019t work anymore, everything is dysfunctional, just to turn away. Or to start looking for false prophets who spout things that, under examination, don\u2019t really make any sense, but feed your biases and your fears. But we can\u2019t afford that. We\u2019ve got too much work to do,\u201d Obama said, reminding Democrats that our government is part of us and that all citizens need to be engaged in order to enact change.\n\nThe fundraising event drew a crowd of about 1,450 people and raised more than $500,000 for Murray\u2019s campaign according to a pool report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama proceeded to bust Republicans on their denial of reality, saying of the Bush years, \"To hear them tell it, those were the good old days.
