When Cheers, set in a Boston bar \u201cwhere everybody knows your name,\u201d debuted in September 1982, the critics loved it, but ordinary viewers were not so enamored. The show sank to the bottom of TV ratings. An undeterred NBC stuck with it, and the network\u2019s faith paid dividends. Cheers became a mainstay of NBC\u2019s blockbuster Thursday-night programming, along with The Cosby Show and Family Ties. Cheers stayed on prime-time television for eleven seasons, and forty million viewers watched its final episode.\n\nWriting is a crucial bottleneck to quality television and was essential for Cheers\u2019s success. Witty repartee among the show\u2019s memorable characters kept viewers tuning in. Bar owner Sam Malone was an unapologetic Lothario who constantly was wooing not-so-bright women. Sam\u2019s foil was a waitress named Diane Chambers, an intellectual snob stranded at the bar by a flyaway fianc\u00e9. Sam and Diane\u2019s unlikely chemistry provided one of the comedy\u2019s prime romantic tensions and left the audience wondering week after week: will they or won\u2019t they become a couple? The colorful ensemble cast members, including Carla, the sharp-tongued waitress, Norm, the stout everyman, and Cliff, the garrulous postal worker, changed remarkably little over the show\u2019s lengthy run.\n\nCheers writers used several simple how-to rules for writing. One was to develop characters with very distinct personality traits. The idea was to give the audience a sense of predictability and familiarity with each character. The writers often created particular situations, and then explored how each character would respond. In later seasons the writers purposefully surprised the audience by occasionally having the characters behave in the opposite way to what was expected. This rule let the writers develop characters\u2019 richness without diminishing their distinctiveness. A more challenging rule further distinguished each character. Each character had a unique way of speaking, and this rule was termed \u201cwrite for radio\u201d \u2014 meaning that the audience could know who was talking just by hearing the dialogue. Another rule was that every episode had to stand alone such that viewers could watch any episode at any time in any sequence and its story line would stand alone. This meant that writers had to create a complete story with a beginning, middle, and end for each episode.\n\nWhen Cheers writers converged in the writers\u2019 room to share their own experiences, they wanted episode themes that aroused universal emotions like being embarrassed, amused, or scared. The rule was that anything with friction that resonates for lots of people was fair game for an episode. The writers were pragmatic and fast, and they often zoomed through creating rough drafts so they could take time detailing polished drafts. Within the rules, however, Cheers writers had extensive flexibility to explore all sorts of issues, including controversial ones. Despite being a light comedy, Cheers was among the first TV shows to address feminism, homosexuality, and addiction.\n\nWhen the bar closed in May 1993, Cheers was one of the longest-running network series ever. The simple rules helped the writers to create the vivid characters, smart dialogue, and creative storylines that made the show such a hit. During its long run, Cheers was nominated for 117 Emmys, winning 26. In 2013 TV Guide named Cheers the eleventh-greatest show of all time, beating competition like Star Trek, Saturday Night Live, and Mad Men.\n\nCheers is a remarkably successful example of a show where viewers could tune in at almost any time and feel at home, even if they had missed a few episodes. Its simple rules for writing were geared around this promise: the stable cast of sympathetic (and predictable) characters did not change from episode to episode, each episode had a self-contained story, and shows were written with a brisk rhythm because episodes did not need to fit into a complex storyline. This instant familiarity was critical in a time before DVR, when viewers could not catch up on episodes they missed. Episodic simple rules are not limited to sitcoms like Cheers (or the vast number of comedies it has influenced, like Friends and How I Met Your Mother). They span television genres, notably procedural dramas in which familiar characters do the same thing in every episode, like solving a case in CSI or diagnosing an illness in House.\n\nIn March 2011 Netflix executives were surveying the new television landscape they had helped create. TV in the 2010s looked radically different from the heyday of Cheers, and Netflix was at the forefront of redefining television. With the sizable capital it had accumulated after destroying Blockbuster, Netflix was about to dive into original programming, offering television without a channel. It was a historic step, and a big risk. Netflix needed a hit to stand out from the crowd. The question was: How to create one?\n\nWriting was an obvious place to start. After the advent of DVR and non-network channels like HBO, television entered what TV critic Brett Martin calls its \u201cThird Golden Age.\u201d The Sopranos ushered in this era with serialized, not episodic, shows. While viewers could watch any episode of Cheers and know roughly what was going on, if they walked into a midseason episode of The Sopranos they would be constantly asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Who is that guy?\u201d Shows like The Sopranos darkened the tone with edgy storylines and took more risks than network shows, with their mass-market audiences. After The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and similar hits, audiences were primed for serialized shows that explored serious themes. Like Cheers, these shows relied on excellent writing, but to be successful, they had to redefine the rules.\n\nNetflix, of course, could have followed the Cheers-style simple rules that were still driving some of the most popular entertainment on television. Procedural dramas like NCIS and sitcoms like Two and a Half Men and The Big Bang Theory, which follow the simple rules of episodic writing so faithfully that critics accuse them of being formulaic, dominated television. But Netflix executives realized that employing the same old rules would not be enough to break out of the pack. Revolutionary times call for revolutionary measures. In order to change how television worked and skyrocket a non-channel show to stardom, Netflix would have to change the game. It would have to join the revolution of the Third Golden Age of television, and then push that revolution one step further.\n\nIn February 2013, Netflix\u2019s longshot debuted. House of Cards stars two-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey as Francis \u201cFrank\u201d Underwood, a conniving politician from rural South Carolina. In the series premiere, Frank is passed over for secretary of state and embarks on a path of power and revenge. To tell Frank\u2019s story, House of Cards\u2019s writers embraced the serialized format. They used event foreshadowing and wove characters in and out of the story. A character could appear in episode two and then disappear until episode eight (something that Sam\u2019s character in Cheers would never do). Instead of stable character development, as expressed through the characters\u2019 predictable reactions to common situations, House of Cards\u2019s characters develop in lengthy side-segments, like when a vice-prone congressman is portrayed hanging out with his kids.\n\nWhile excellent writing is part of the House of Cards story, the bigger story is Netflix and its re-envisioning of television. In earlier chapters, we defined bottlenecks as decisions or activities that hinder value creation. In essence, Netflix attacked critical bottlenecks that others had accepted as the status quo. For example, rather than focusing primarily on writing as the key bottleneck, Netflix and its partner, Media Rights Capital, made the strategic bet that world-class directing could help House of Cards stand out among the vast array of choices available to viewers. To stand out, House of Cards did something very rare in television: the show recruited an A-list Hollywood director. That director was David Fincher, a two-time Oscar nominee who had directed top films like The Social Network, The Curious Life of Benjamin Button, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. As the story goes, Fincher was on the prowl for new projects when a remake of the British political thriller House of Cards crossed his path. Media Rights Capital owned the rights to the show and wanted Fincher at the helm of a U.S. remake. Fincher loved the BBC version, stating, \u201cThe way it was structured was so smart. Meeting him [the lead character, played by Ian Richardson] at his lowest point and watching him gain traction as he begins to move all the pieces on the chess board.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"House of Cards\" broke all the rules, even for prestige TV.
