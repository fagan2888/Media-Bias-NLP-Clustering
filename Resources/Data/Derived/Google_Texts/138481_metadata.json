They are not eligible for Medicaid (called Medi-Cal in California), and they are not allowed to purchase a health plan from the federal marketplace or any of the state exchanges.\n\nWithout that provision, Congress would not have approved the health reform law to begin with.\n\nNow, however, some California families and advocates are pinning their hopes on a bill by state Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) that would open the door for undocumented immigrants to buy health plans from the Covered California exchange. Unlike most exchange customers, however, they would get no federal dollars to help them do so.\n\nThat, many observers say, makes the proposal a largely symbolic gesture, since most undocumented immigrants would not be able to afford the premiums without financial assistance.\n\nUse Our Content This story can be republished for free ( details ).\n\nLara\u2019s bill was approved by the Senate last year, and it will be taken up Tuesday by the Assembly\u2019s Committee on Health.\n\nThe bill faces a number of hurdles.\n\nIt would not actually allow immigrants without papers to buy insurance through the state exchange. It would only request that the federal government exempt California from the rule that forbids such purchases. It\u2019s the feds who make the call.\n\nIf the feds were to greenlight the plan, Covered California would be the first exchange in the country to sell insurance to undocumented immigrants \u2014 a prospect that is not welcomed by critics of illegal immigration.\n\nThere\u2019s no apparent legal reason why the feds wouldn\u2019t sign off on such a request, said Tim Jost, a professor emeritus of law at the Washington and Lee University in Virginia. But it could generate some significant political fireworks, especially in a presidential election year, he said.\n\n\u201cI can almost guarantee in the right wing media, this would play a pretty big role,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would become a case of \u2018we told you so\u2019 that Obamacare would help undocumented workers.\u201d\n\nBut Katherine Hempstead, a senior advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said the fact that no federal dollars would be involved makes it less of a hot button issue. \u201cIt\u2019s just another distribution channel,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore Lara\u2019s proposal even makes it to the federal level, it must first get through the legislature and past the desk of Gov. Jerry Brown.\n\nSome health policy experts believe the bill has a decent shot of getting through California\u2019s political hierarchy.\n\nShannon McConville, a research associate at the Public Policy Institute of California noted that while Gov. Brown has been fiscally conservative for the most part, he did sign a law \u2014 scheduled to take effect next month \u2014 that allows undocumented children to get full Medi-Cal benefits.\n\n\u201cThe [Lara] bill, at least in its current state, doesn\u2019t have a large price tag, so it seems possible he\u2019d approve it,\u201d McConville said. \u201cBut you can never know for sure.\u201d\n\nAt the federal level, the Affordable Care Act provides for an \u201cinnovation waiver,\u201d which allows states \u2014 with federal approval \u2014 to modify certain sections of the health reform law in order to expand coverage. Such changes must have no net impact on the U.S. budget, which is why federal subsidies are excluded from Lara\u2019s bill.\n\nAn analysis of the waiver proposal, presented by Covered California staff members to the exchange\u2019s board earlier this month, estimated that enrollment would increase by about 50,000 if immigrants without papers could buy coverage through the exchange.\n\nCovered California\u2019s executive director, Peter V. Lee, did not stake out a position on the plan, but he said exchange officials stood ready to assist the legislature in pursuing this option.\n\n\u201cThe ball is in their court,\u201d Lee said.\n\nAlthough undocumented immigrants would not qualify for financial help under the proposal, they would still benefit from the considerable investment Covered California has made in infrastructure to inform and enroll consumers, McConville said.\n\nSome opponents of the plan think selling to immigrants without papers should not be a high priority for Covered California. \u201cThe state has failed on its commitment to health care providers and their patients, and my budget priority is to take care of them first before expanding the pool,\u201d said Sen. Joel Anderson (R-Alpine), who voted against the bill in the Senate last year.\n\nOthers simply believe that neither the state nor the federal government should confer any benefits on people who are in the country illegally.\n\nIra Mehlman, a spokesman with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said that providing coverage to undocumented immigrants under the Affordable Care Act is tantamount to accepting their unlawful presence in the country.\n\nHe predicted that if California is allowed to do it, states like Illinois and New York might follow.\n\nAnd, he argued, this is just the first step in eventually getting subsidized coverage.\n\nWithout subsidies, it is uncertain whether many undocumented immigrants would actually buy Covered California plans.\n\nAfter all, they can already buy private plans through brokers or directly from insurers, but they are not rushing to do it, said Alex Hernandez, an insurance agent in Merced. \u201cCost is always what drives them away,\u201d he said.\n\nThe plans sold by Covered California carry very similar price tags.\n\nLeer Este Art\u00edculo En Espa\u00f1ol \u201c\u00bfVender\u00e1 Covered California cobertura de salud a indocumentados?\u201d\n\nHernandez calculated that a person in her mid-20s, making around $45,000 a year, would pay $304 per month for a standard Anthem-Blue Cross plan through Covered California. That same plan purchased directly from Anthem by the same person would cost $303.30, he said.\n\nAdvocates for expanding health coverage concede that allowing people without papers to purchase it on the exchange won\u2019t necessarily make it more affordable for them, but they say it would open the door to broader access and a sense of inclusion.\n\nPeople in mixed-status families \u2014 ones with some members who are in the country illegally and others who are legal residents or U.S. citizens \u2014 would benefit most, consumer advocates say. Data discussed at a Covered California meeting in February showed that 74 percent of households headed by undocumented immigrants have family members who are citizens.\n\nProponents of the plan believe that if some family members already interact with Covered California or Medi-Cal, it could encourage others in their household to seek coverage.\n\nOpening the exchange to the undocumented, they say, would simplify enrollment for the entire family by creating a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for all household members.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a modest step forward, but important for the goal of health care for all,\u201d said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access, a consumer advocacy group. He said supporters of the bill are fully aware that people will continue to face affordability issues, but there also thousands who may be able to afford it.\n\nMaria Galvan, an undocumented resident in San Fernando, California is not one of them. She does not think she would purchase coverage without subsidies. She knows how expensive it can be, even for small business owners like herself and her husband.\n\nGalvan, said she does not seek much preventive care. When she gets sick, she usually weathers it with home remedies. If it gets serious, she goes straight to the emergency room at Olive View- UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar, her nearest hospital.\n\n\u201cMaybe one day the system will improve for us,\u201d Galvan said. \u201cMaybe one day we will receive financial assistance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "California is inching closer to a first-in-the-nation request for a federal ruling that would allow the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange to sell health plans to immigrants who are living in the country illegally.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "California is inching closer to a first-in-the-nation request for a federal ruling that would allow the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange to sell health plans to immigrants who are living in the country i\u2026", "title": "Will Covered California Sell Health Coverage To The Undocumented?", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/will-covered-california-sell-health-coverage-to-the-undocumented/", "image": {"width": 570, "identifier": "https://californiahealthline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/covered_california_570.jpg", "height": 380}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://californiahealthline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/covered_california_570.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-04-26T09:00:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-12T22:39:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Without subsidies, it is uncertain whether many undocumented immigrants would actually buy Covered California plans.\nData discussed at a Covered California meeting in February showed that 74 percent of households headed by undocumented immigrants have family members who are citizens.\nLeer Este Art\u00edculo En Espa\u00f1ol \u201c\u00bfVender\u00e1 Covered California cobertura de salud a indocumentados?\u201dHernandez calculated that a person in her mid-20s, making around $45,000 a year, would pay $304 per month for a standard Anthem-Blue Cross plan through Covered California.\nNow, however, some California families and advocates are pinning their hopes on a bill by state Sen.
