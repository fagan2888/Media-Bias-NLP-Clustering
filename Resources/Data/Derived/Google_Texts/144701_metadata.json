A new study suggests it might be.\n\nAllen Downey, a computer scientist at Olin College of Engineering in Massachusetts, set out to understand the national uptick in those who claim no religious affiliation. These are the \u201cnones,\u201d which the Pew Research Center considers the fastest-growing \u201creligious\u201d group in America.\n\n\n\nSince 1985, Downey says, the number of first-year college students who say they're religiously unaffiliated has grown from 8% to 25%, according to the CIRP Freshman Survey.\n\nAnd, he adds, stats from the General Social Survey, which has been tracking American opinions and social change since 1972, show unaffiliated Americans in the general population ballooned from 8% to 18% between 1990 and 2010.\n\nThese trends jibe with what the Pew Research Center\u2019s Religion & Public Life Project reported in 2012. It said one in five American adults, and a third of those under 30, are unaffiliated.\n\nDowney says he stepped into the ongoing debate about the rise of the \"nones\" not because he has a vested interest one way or the other, but because the topic fascinates him. He says it\u2019s good fodder for study and appeals to students who are learning to crunch real data.\n\nIn his paper \u201cReligious affiliation, education and Internet use,\u201d which published in March on arXiv \u2013 an electronic collection of scientific papers \u2013 Downey analyzed data from GSS and discovered a correlation between increased Internet use and religious disaffiliation.\n\nInternet use among adults was essentially at zero in 1990; 20 years later, it jumped to 80%, he said. In that same two-decade period, we saw a 25 million-person spike in those who are religiously unaffiliated.\n\nPeople who use the Internet a few hours a week, GSS numbers showed Downey, were less likely to have a religious affiliation by about 2%. Those online more than seven hours a week were even more likely \u2013 an additional 3% more likely \u2013 to disaffiliate, he said.\n\nNow, Downey is the first to point out that correlation doesn\u2019t necessarily mean causation.\n\nBut he was able to control for other factors including education, religious upbringing, rural/urban environments and income, to find a link that allowed him to \u201cconclude, tentatively, that Internet use causes disaffiliation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut a reasonable person could disagree.\u201d\n\nThe Internet, he posited, opens up new ways of thinking to those living in homogeneous environments. It also allows those with doubts to find like-minded individuals around the world.\n\nHe believes decreases in religious upbringing have had the largest effect, accounting for 25% of reduced affiliation; college education covers about 5% and Internet use may account for another 20%.\n\nThat leaves 50% which he attributes to \u201cgenerational replacement,\u201d meaning those born more recently are less likely to be religiously affiliated \u2013 though he doesn\u2019t attempt to explain why that is.\n\nThe Pew Research Center has offered its own theories.\n\nOne explanation Pew gives is that our nation is experiencing political backlash \u2013 \"that young adults, in particular, have turned away from organized religion because they perceive it as deeply entangled with conservative politics and do not want to have any association with it.\"\n\nMore specifically, Pew explains, this brand of religion and politics is out of step with young adult views on same-sex rights and abortion.\n\nPostponement of marriage and parenthood, broader social disengagement and general secularization of society may also play a part, according to Pew.\n\nBut to be religiously unaffiliated doesn\u2019t require a lack of faith or spirituality, researchers say.\n\nYes, the \"nones\" group includes those who might call themselves atheists or agnostics. But it also accounts for many \u2013 46 million people \u2013 who don't belong to a particular group but are, in some way, religious or spiritual, according to Pew.\n\nThis is all part of the changing face of society and faith, and where the Internet fits in is just part of a complicated puzzle.\n\nThe evolving landscape includes plenty of people who go online in search of spiritual and religious sustenance, said Cheryl Casey, who delved into the issue for her 2006 dissertation.\n\nCasey, now a professor of media, society and ethics at Champlain College in Vermont, wrote about the \u201crevirtualization of religious ritual in cyberspace\u201d and the morphing relationship between technology and religion.\n\nThat Downey would find a correlation, that the Internet is increasing disaffiliation, makes perfect sense to her.\n\n\"The institutional control over the conversation is lifted, so it's not just a matter of more churches to choose from but more ways to have that conversation and more people to have that conversation with,\" she said Wednesday.\n\nPeople move away from formal affiliation and toward what she calls \"grass-roots religious exploration,\" where \"the nature of the medium allows for those conversations to grow organically.\"\n\nInnovations have long played a part in influencing religion, she said, and will continue to.\n\nSomething she wrote back in 2006 said it best.\n\n\u201cWhen a new technology, such as the printing press or the Internet, unleashes massive cultural change, the challenge to religion is immense. Cultural developments change how God, or the ultimate, is thought of and spoken about,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cThe dynamics of this transformation, however, await continued investigation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Jessica Ravitz, CNN (CNN) We can blame the Internet for plenty: the proliferation of porn, our obsession with cat videos, the alleged rise of teen trends like -- brace yourself -- eyeball licking.
