Revenues increased 0.6% but total earnings declined 9%. However, the beat ratio is 80.3% for the bottom line and 54.9% for the top line.\n\n\n\nComing to the Medical sector, 9.3% has already reported. These companies saw total earnings improvement of 7.7% on 15.1% higher revenues \u2013 much better than the S&P 500 figures. Also the beat ratio of 100% for the bottom line and 80% for the top line is better than the S&P index.\n\n\n\nOverall, the Medical sector is expected to deliver 1.9% earnings growth on 9% higher revenues in the first quarter. This compares favorably with the projected 9.7% earnings decline on 0.8% lower revenues in the S&P 500 index.\n\n\n\nHealthcare is part of the broader medical sector. Let\u2019s see what factors might have influenced its performance in the first quarter.\n\n\n\nThe exchange business seems to have been in good shape for some while it brought bad news for some others. UnitedHealth Group UNH has decided to exit the exchange business by 2017 if it remains unprofitable and has in fact already announced its exit from a few exchanges.\n\n\n\nWhile diversified product offerings, increasing membership and expansion into international markets are likely to have beefed up revenues, cost management should give the bottom line a boost.\n\n\n\nHowever, healthcare companies continued to face pressures from pricing, regulatory compliance costs, rising medical costs and competition.\n\n\n\nWith more than 175 index members releasing results from Apr 25\u201329, let\u2019s find out what\u2019s in store for three major healthcare providers that will report first-quarter earnings results this week.\n\n\n\nAnthem Inc.
