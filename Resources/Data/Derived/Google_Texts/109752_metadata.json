An aging population and advancements in medical care are the main reasons behind this level of growth.\n\nFor the Houston market, jobs are plentiful, with the continued expansion of local hospitals and health care facilities creating a shortage possibility in the field.\n\nLaura Rooney, D.N.P., A.P.R.N., director, UT Health Services, said these factors fuels the fire for the mixture of nursing positions.\n\n\"Drivers of the shortage include an aging nursing workforce, increased number of people receiving health care via the Affordable Care Act along with increased number of people living with complex, chronic disease that requires care,\" Rooney said. \"Nursing provides a diverse array of opportunities from health care and bedside nursing to advanced practice nursing to positions for nurses in the business world.\"\n\nThe variety of settings nurses are needed in is evolving, and jobs are not necessarily always in a hospital, Rooney said.\n\n\"The field of nursing extends to occupational settings, with nurses providing health and wellness, education, and case management. In the outpatient clinic setting, nurses are moving into positions such as 'care management' roles where their knowledge of the health care system allows them to effectively manage and facilitate the care for more complex patients,\" she said.\n\nAccording to www.nursingworld.org, the job market for nurses will continue to be strong in the coming year as demographic trends and new federal legislation regarding health care affect demand for nurses.\n\nData from 2013 on Monster.com stated registered nurse is the No. 1 health care job.\n\nHaving a bachelor's and/or master's degree in nursing also is a plus when finding a nursing position, stated a 2013 report from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.\n\nPinpointing the specifics driving the demand and opportunities for nursing jobs is based in part to the Affordable Care Act and the expanding health care industry. The emphasis on improved utilization of resources consistently affects employment opportunities in nursing.\n\nAll types of nurses are still a winning bet, Rooney said.\n\n\"There is no one type of nursing that is more in demand than others.
