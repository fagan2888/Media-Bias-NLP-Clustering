He was brought in as a brainy Ph.D. who crunches global data \u2013 but when Ryan ferrets out a meticulously planned scheme to collapse the U.S. economy and spark global chaos, he becomes the only man with the skills to stop it. Now, he\u2019s gone fully operational, thrust into a world of mounting suspicion, deception and deadly force. Caught between his tight-lipped handler Harper (Academy Award-winner Kevin Costner), his in-the-dark fianc\u00e9e Cathy (Keira Knightley) and a brilliant Russian oligarch (Kenneth Branagh), Jack must confront a new reality where no one can seem to be trusted, yet the fate of millions rests on his finding the truth. With the urgency of a lit fuse, he\u2019s in a race to stay one step ahead of everyone around him.\n\nProduced by Mace Neufeld, Lorenzo di Bonaventura, David Barron and Mark Vahradian. Based on characters created by Tom Clancy. Written by Adam Cozad and David Koepp. Directed by Kenneth Branagh.\n\n# # #\n\nAbout Paramount Pictures Corporation\n\nParamount Pictures Corporation (PPC), a global producer and distributor of filmed entertainment, is a unit of Viacom (NASDAQ: VIAB, VIA), a leading content company with prominent and respected film, television and digital entertainment brands.
