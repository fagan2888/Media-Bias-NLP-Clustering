Conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh blasted the GOP yesterday over the just-passed omnibus spending bill, arguing the United States should “disband the Republican Party” because the deal funds Obamacare, Planned Parenthood, and visas for foreign workers.

“There is no Republican Party,” Limbaugh said, declaring the GOP sold America “down the river.”

“You know, we don’t even need a Republican Party if they’re going to do this,” Limbaugh said. He mused that maybe the United States should “just elect Democrats, disband the Republican Party, and let the Democrats run it. Because that’s what’s happening anyway.”

Lamenting the lack of conservative reform despite Republicans controlling “the largest number of seats in the House they’ve had in Congress since the Civil War,” Limbaugh said Republicans have not “made any difference at all.”

“It is as though Nancy Pelosi is still running the House and Harry Reid is still running the Senate,” Limbaugh said. “‘Betrayed’ is not even the word here. What has happened here is worse than betrayal. Betrayal is pretty bad — but it’s worse than that.”

Limbaugh also said the Republican Party “would have to invent” Donald Trump if the presidential candidate didn’t already exist. “Repeated stabs in the back like this — which have been going on for years — combined with Obama’s policy destruction of this country, is what has given rise to Donald Trump,” Limbaugh insisted.
