On an exam that I\u2019d studied hard for and expected a good grade on, he returned my paper with no grade and the words \u201cCarpe Diem.\u201d As a very serious\u2014even obsessive\u2014 student, I wanted that grade, and I marched up to his desk dismayed. \u201cThere\u2019s no grade on this paper,\u201d I announced.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, barely looking up at me from his reading.\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to figure it out,\u201d he said.\n\nI was dismayed, to say the least. My goal was to be valedictorian, and I was counting on an A. I wanted that grade!\n\nI trudged to the library to look up carpe diem, which I discovered meant seize the day. It took me awhile, but finally I was forced to consider why Mr. Nabedrick had written those words on my paper. I think he looked at me as someone who was too focused on grades at the expense of really learning, and that there was more to life than a perfect grade. He was challenging me to open myself to opportunities and take risks.\n\nI did get an A in Mr. Nabedrick\u2019s class, and I did become valedictorian. But the words\u2014seize the day\u2014stayed with me. They shook me up, made me realize that my future was in my own hands.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about Jack Nabedrick a lot recently, because this is graduation season, and I am often asked what advice I\u2019d give to new grads. Seize the day seems like a good place to start. But once you seize the day, it\u2019s what you do with it that matters.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the secret to your success?\u201d a young woman asked me recently, gazing enviously at what she thought was my glamorous life.\n\n\u201cDo the work,\u201d I said. She looked disappointed. It wasn\u2019t a very glamorous answer.\n\nWhen I tell people that the reason I became Miss America was because I worked hard and strategized smartly, they usually roll their eyes\u2014\u201cYeah, right.\u201d But it happens to be true. I made lists. I practiced answering interview questions. I went back to practicing the violin for three hours a day, as I\u2019d done as a child. I worked my tail off to get in tip top shape, which was a struggle since I\u2019d grown up a fat kid. My grandfather, God love him, tried to prepare me for the inevitable disappointment. \u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl, but you\u2019re never going to be Miss America,\u201d he told me gently.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I tried not to be upset.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too short,\u201d he said.\n\nI wasn\u2019t about to take his word for it. I went to the library (this was before the Internet) and I found a book on the Miss America pageant. I learned that the very first Miss America in 1921, Margaret Gorman, was five foot one. I was two and a half inches taller. Do your research!\n\nI\u2019ve never been a person for whom things come easily. Every achievement has been the result of scrambling, throwing myself into a job, taking on the lowliest tasks so I can climb another notch. My first job in news was at a local station in Richmond, Virginia, where I covered neighborhood news and the crime beat. At night I\u2019d go home to my tiny apartment and sit on my futon making notes for the next day. I was determined to show up every morning with at least a couple of pitch ideas. Sometimes they even got approved! In the trenches I learned how to be disciplined, fast on my feet, and never complain. I built on that experience through three more local markets\u2014Cincinnati, Cleveland and Dallas\u2014before I landed at CBS in New York and then Fox News.\n\nWorking hard is important, but it isn\u2019t everything. No matter how much you throw yourself into a job, it doesn\u2019t guarantee that your career will be a steady climb upward. There\u2019s slippage in life. I\u2019ve failed, I\u2019ve been fired (a week after I got married), I\u2019ve been bruised. Like every high profile woman I know, I\u2019ve had to put up with a constant stream of commentary about my weight (too fat), my shape (too chunky), my hair (too blonde), and my brain (too dumb). Thanks to Twitter, I hear these remarks every single day. Sometimes I ignore them. Sometimes I write back. I don\u2019t take the snarky remarks too seriously. I try to inject a little humor\u2014laugh at myself when I can. My kids help a lot with that. One day when I rushed home from the studio without taking off my makeup, my son Christian looked at me with horror. \u201cMom, what happened to your face?\u201d\n\nBeneath the makeup, which is a necessity of national television, the most important thing is for me to be my true self, and if there is any secret that trumps them all it\u2019s to be real. Make the face you show the world\u2014in interviews, on the job, socially and professionally\u2014the reflection of what\u2019s in your heart and mind. That way you can always look in the mirror and like what you see\u2014the real you.\n\nGretchen Carlson is the anchor of \u201cThe Real Story\u201d on Fox News and the author of \u201cGetting Real,\u201d forthcoming on June 16.
