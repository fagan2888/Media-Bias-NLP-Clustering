Except this time he was in the wheelchair he\u2019s been in ever since the first visit left him paralyzed when his parachute malfunctioned.\n\nSEE ALSO: Kevin Ward\u2019s aunt blasts NASCAR\u2019s Tony Stewart for nephew\u2019s death\n\nCrazy, right? Whatever it is that causes someone to voluntarily fling himself off a structure 500 feet high, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not contagious.\n\nAfter watching Bissonnette\u2019s successful jump \u2014 wheelchair and all \u2014 I focused on the news from Canandaigua, New York, where 20-year-old driver Kevin Ward Jr. was killed during a sprint car race. That sounded normal enough until realizing that Ward was a pedestrian when three-time NASCAR champion Tony Stewart struck him.\n\nAuto racing is another extreme-type sport in which the thrill (and danger) of participation seems to be reward enough for competitors. We\u2019ve come to accept the fact that death is a realistic outcome in such activities, whether it\u2019s crashing to earth or crashing into a wall.\n\nSEE ALSO: Tony Stewart crash probe focuses on lighting, track\n\nThough both sports require a person to be, you know, a little nuts by normal standards, BASE jumping lives primarily on YouTube. Auto racing is on cable and free TV constantly.\n\nThe loss of life on a racetrack is tragic under any circumstances, but this instance is particularly sad because it has nothing to do with racing, per se. Instead, it has everything to do with the macho, tough-guy posturing that exists in the sport\u2019s undercurrent.\n\nThat\u2019s what led Ward to leave his vehicle after a wreck and walk onto the track to express his displeasure with Stewart.\n\nBut we\u2019ll probably never know whether Stewart\u2019s own emotions played a role in the accident.\n\nSurely he didn\u2019t mean to strike the young driver. Yet, no would be surprised if Stewart was trying to \u201cbuzz\u201d him, maybe trying to throw some dirt and a scare, but got closer than intended. Stewart\u2019s nickname is \u201cSmoke\u201d for a reason, namely the figurative cloud that arises when hotheads gets steamed.\n\nIn his final act on this earth, Ward showed signs of Stewart\u2019s fiery side. When Stewart was wrecked by Matt Kenseth during a NASCAR race a couple of years ago, Stewart stormed onto the track and hurled his helmet, bouncing it off the hood of Kenseth\u2019s car.\n\nInterestingly, Stewart wasn\u2019t disciplined for that act of road rage, although he picked up an official reprimand for a similar incident in 1999, when he threw his gloves at Kenny Irwin and reached inside the passenger side window before Irwin sped off.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that NASCAR hasn\u2019t been sterner when drivers behave like children.\n\nThe sport is dangerous enough without bringing tempers into play. Anger clouds judgment and there\u2019s not much room for error in cars travelling at high rates of speed.\n\nIf Stewart\u2019s right rear tire was a few inches more to the left, Ward would still be alive.\n\nHe also would be alive if he didn\u2019t venture into oncoming traffic. Or if he reconsidered after another car swerved to avoid him seconds earlier. Or if he decided to race remote-controlled cars instead of sprint cars.\n\nBut Ward loved what he did from the time he began to his fateful end. According to his website, he was 4 when he began racing go-karts and he finished second in his initial race. By the time he was 12, he had won six track championships and about 250 races.\n\nRacing was in his blood and he was unlikely to quit on his own. Maybe he was destined to be a lifer stuck on the minor circuits, far from the bright lights and big tracks, but he seemed determined to reach the highest level.\n\nOr perhaps die trying.\n\nMost of us don\u2019t understand the passion that leads Bissonnette to continue jumping in his wheelchair and leads Stewart to continue racing on dirt tracks in his spare time. But the need for clear-headed thinking and adherence to every safety measure during extreme sports is a necessity.\n\nAccidents happen, with and without reckless behavior being a factor. Bissonnette\u2019s mistake 10 years ago was miscalculating his speed on a flip, opening his chute too early and watching it become entangled on his leg.\n\nWard\u2019s lapse \u2014 and maybe Stewart\u2018s, too \u2014 was letting emotion get the best of him in the midst of a dangerous situation.\n\nStewart will have to live with the outcome for the rest of his life.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping the lesson learned saves another driver\u2019s life in the future.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The loss of life on a racetrack is tragic under any circumstances, but this instance is particularly sad because it has nothing to do with racing, per se.
