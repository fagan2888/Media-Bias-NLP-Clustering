First taxi drivers, now doctors. Who will Uber compete with next?

Full disclosure, Uber has not put the health care industry out of business. However, its new at-home flu shot service that will be available next Thursday will mean a lot fewer doctor visits for the flu shot this year. UberHEALTH, which was made available for users in Boston, New York, and D.C. back on Oct. 23, 2015, will be featured in major cities all across the United States.

“Flu season is just around the corner and trying to squeeze in your latest immunization this fall may not be on the top of your To Do List,” Uber said in a statement. “That’s why we’re leveraging the reliability and efficiency of the Uber platform and launching a one-day pilot program — UberHEALTH — in select cities today. Together with our partner Vaccine Finder we will bring flu prevention packs and shots directly to you — at the single touch of a button.”

UberHEALTH will charge $10 for an Uber that brings a nurse to your home or place of business with 10 flu shots. If you have nine other people looking to get their flu shot this upcoming Thursday, then have everyone put in a $1 and get your flu shot this year for less than a can of coke.
