Contrary to that appearance, Clinton\u2019s policies pack just as much poison as those the Vermont socialist has proposed. Consider, for example, the policy field where Sanders and Clinton appear to differ most: health care.\n\nSanders would replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with an even broader form of centrally controlled health care, a universal system in which the federal government acts as the single payer. Sanders claims most Americans would save, as a result of reduced premiums, about $5,000 more than they would end up paying in new taxes under his plan.\n\nClinton has criticized the high price tag of Sanders\u2019 proposal, saying she would rather \u201cstrengthen the Affordable Care Act\u201d in ways she imagines will save middle-income families $100 here and there.\n\nThese distinctions might suggest Clinton wants more government-limiting, market-minded health care than Sanders. She doesn\u2019t. The ACA, which Clinton defends, preserves the guise of federalism\u2014the division of power between the national and state governments\u2014through its allowance of state-run insurance exchanges, but it actually diverts nearly all power to Washington, DC. Instead of averting the imposition of a centrally controlled health care system, Clinton would extend Obama\u2019s usurpation of states\u2019 authority to implement health care reforms in their own ways. Worse, Clinton\u2019s path would restrict individuals\u2019 freedoms by limiting health care options.\n\nIn Iowa, Clinton criticized Sanders\u2019 plan for sending \u201chealth insurance to the states, turning over your and my health insurance to governors,\u201d The Washington Post reported. Clinton was not objecting to Sanders\u2019 plan because it would bypass governors, but because his single-payer system would somehow fail to bypass them.\n\nBy avoiding a single-payer system, Clinton\u2019s proposed health care reforms are less socialistic than Sanders\u2019, but only in a way that\u2019s similar to how an AK-47 is less lethal than a bazooka. Unintended consequences loom.\n\nFor instance, Clinton would impose price ceilings of $250 per month for drug costs to consumers with long-term care needs, forcing pharmaceutical companies to swallow any portion of the difference the government does not absorb. Fixing drug prices below market value will drive away drug developers and manufacturers, restrict supply, and ratchet prices up, not down, for most consumers. As Clinton\u2019s price ceiling further constrains profit potential, more companies will exit the supply chain. Only government subsidies to drug companies, paid for by new taxes (for which Clinton has criticized Sanders), will temporarily stem their exodus.\n\nThere is another way to relieve a supply crunch: Lifting ceilings and other price controls would let markets breathe and invite greater competition and innovation, which would strengthen the supply. In such a climate, high drug prices denote one thing: brand new drugs. Older drugs\u2014the ones consumers currently rely on\u2014will drop in price.\n\nUnfortunately, neither Democratic candidate is calling for this kind of change, and Clinton\u2019s plans to entrench Obamacare would ultimately destroy the nation\u2019s health care system and create a greater outcry for the socialist, single-payer system Sanders demands.\n\nClinton may win the nomination by managing to distinguish herself as the more practical, responsible health care reformer, but her call for additional market interventions will lead to Sanders-style socialism in short order. Those who expect to need any health care in the decades to come should think hard before pulling the lever for either Clinton or Sanders.\n\n[Originally published at Inside Sources]", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Instead of averting the imposition of a centrally controlled health care system, Clinton would extend Obama\u2019s usurpation of states\u2019 authority to implement health care reforms in their own ways.\nConsider, for example, the policy field where Sanders and Clinton appear to differ most: health care.\nThese distinctions might suggest Clinton wants more government-limiting, market-minded health care than Sanders.\nThose who expect to need any health care in the decades to come should think hard before pulling the lever for either Clinton or Sanders.\nBy avoiding a single-payer system, Clinton\u2019s proposed health care reforms are less socialistic than Sanders\u2019, but only in a way that\u2019s similar to how an AK-47 is less lethal than a bazooka."}
