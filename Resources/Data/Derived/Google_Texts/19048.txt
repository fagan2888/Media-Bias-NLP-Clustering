I’ll pay my ticket for violating a yellow light, but we should talk about the way Marshfield’s lights are timed.

EDITOR: On Wednesday, a judge declared me guilty of violating a yellow light from Oct. 4, 2014.

Because the observations I made of the yellow light duration were not scientifically backed by someone other than myself, I could not use this data. So I would like to state to the public that if one intersection’s distance is set for a three-second duration for a yellow light, then why is it that an intersection twice that distance (at least) has only a three-second yellow light duration also?

So if you have any concerns, please observe for yourself and write to our city to voice your concerns.

As for me, I will be still paying the fine and will avoid going through any traffic lights in Marshfield from now on. I did start the voice of concern of these intersections along Veterans Parkway. Now it’s the voice of others concerned that need to be heard.

Now I can shake off the dust from my feet and move on. Thank you to all that have heard my concerns, and your support.

Jodi Pankratz,

Marshfield
