If the changes are approved, the Eastern Pequot, the Schaghticoke, and the Golden Hill Paugussett could now qualify for federal recognition, which would allow them to pursue many avenues of economic development and cultural revitalization. All have held land for hundreds of years.\n\nNedra Darling, spokeswoman for the BIA, said, \u201cThe proposed \u2018expedited positive\u2019 process is primarily to be used for petitions in which there is no serious challenge among the local community and state.\u201d Connecticut\u2019s congressional delegation has announced they will dispute the new regulations.\n\n\u201cWe will fight like hell,\u201d announced U.S. Congressional Representative Rosa DeLauro to attendees at an April 16, Woodbury, Connecticut Town Hall Meeting.\n\nDeLauro said she was concerned about the tribe\u2019s land claims and that, \u201cThe Golden Hill Paugussett could potentially make another play for homeowners homes, and this is not a scare tactic, I want to be upfront.\u201d\n\nThe Golden Hill Paugussett and Schaghticoke have said they would be willing to exchange land claims to build casinos in Danbury and Bridgeport, Connecticut. The City of Bridgeport passed a referendum in support of casinos that could bring thousands of jobs to that impoverished city.\n\nThe state, however, is just saying no. DeLauro told the town hall meeting that additional casinos would void the compacts with the Mashantucket Pequots and the Mohegans. Together the two tribes have brought more than $5 billion to the state, according to Connecticut State Senator Kevin Witkos.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three Connecticut state recognized tribes, all of whom were denied federal recognition more than 10 years ago, have another chance to apply.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/10/connecticut-attacks-proposed-fed-rec-revisions-fears-land-claims-casinos-155223", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/eastern-pequot-reservation.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Connecticut Attacks Proposed Fed Rec Revisions, Fears Land Claims, Casinos"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-06-10T10:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Connecticut Attacks Proposed Fed Rec Revisions, Fears Land Claims, Casinos"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/10/connecticut-attacks-proposed-fed-rec-revisions-fears-land-claims-casinos-155223", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Federal Recognition, Federal Recognition Regulations, Schaghticoke, Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation, Chief Richard Velky", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "Connecticut Attacks Proposed Fed Rec Revisions, Fears Land Claims, Casinos"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcbdb\"", "article_summary": "Together the two tribes have brought more than $5 billion to the state, according to Connecticut State Senator Kevin Witkos.\nOne of the changes in the proposed regulations is an expedited positive ruling for state tribes that have held land since 1934.\nThree Connecticut state recognized tribes, all of whom were denied federal recognition more than 10 years ago, have another chance to apply due to newly proposed federal recognition regulations, issued recently by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\nDeLauro told the town hall meeting that additional casinos would void the compacts with the Mashantucket Pequots and the Mohegans.\nIf the changes are approved, the Eastern Pequot, the Schaghticoke, and the Golden Hill Paugussett could now qualify for federal recognition, which would allow them to pursue many avenues of economic development and cultural revitalization."}
