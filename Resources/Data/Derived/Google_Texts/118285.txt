WASHINGTON — Ever since President Reagan invited Lenny Skutnick — the federal employee who was the hero of the of Air Florida Flight 90 crash in the Potomac River in 1982 — the first lady's box at the State of the Union Address has been an extension of the address itself.

The White House on Sunday announced the complete 2016 list of Lenny Skutniks, including veterans, volunteers, college students, small business people, immigrants, activists and the CEO of Microsoft.

Presidents use those special guests to illustrate broader themes in their annual address to Congress. Obama's lineup gives clues about the content of his final State of the Union Address, which the White House has hinted will go beyond the traditional litany of policy proposals.

The guest list suggests that Obama will look back on how the country has changed during his presidency — the expansion of health care, deferred deportations, gay marriage and increasing use of clean energy. But he'll also likely promote what he sees as unfinished business — criminal justice reform, the opioid crisis, more affordable higher education and ending veterans homelessness.

And in one conspicuous display of political symbolism, Obama is leaving one seat in the first lady's box empty to illustrate "the victims of gun violence who no longer have a voice."

The other seats will be occupied by:

• Sue Ellen Allen, of Scottsdale, Ariz., a former prison inmate and the co-founder of Gina's Team, a nonprofit helping inmates reenter society and as a former inmate starting over after her release in 2009. She'll highlight Obama's proposals for criminal justice reform.

• Gloria Balenski, of Schaumburg, Ill., who wrote a letter to President Obama thanking him for the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.

• Jennifer Bragdon, of Austin, Tex., a 42-year-old community college student who works full time and is working toward a degree to become a middle school teacher. Obama has proposed free community college for eligible Americans.

• Edith Childs, of Greenwood, S.C., a county councilwoman and grandmother who started the “Fired up! Ready to go!” chant during Obama's presidential campaign in 2007.

• Cynthia K. Dias, of Las Vegas, Nev., a Vietnam veteran and registered nurse who volunteers with Veterans Village, a charity working to provide help for homeless veterans.

• Mark Davis, of Washington, whose business WDC Solar has installed more than 125 solar systems in Washington at no cost to homeowners with good credit through tax credits and private funds.

• Cary Dixon, of Huntington, W.Va., the mother of a drug addict who met Obama at a community forum on the heroin epidemic in Charleston, W.Va. last year.

• Lydia Doza, of Klamath Falls, Ore and Anchorage, Alaska, a 24-year-old native Alaskan college student pursuing a degree in software engineering technology at Oregon Tech, who will highlight the importance of science and engineering education.

• Refaai Hamo, of Troy, Mich, a Syrian refugee whose wife and one daughter were killing in by anti-personnel missile fired by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. After two years in Turkey, Homo received refugee status and moved to Troy, Mich. His story was featured on the website Humans of New York.

• Lisa Jaster, of Houston, Texas, a 37-year-old major in the U.S. Army Reserve who graduated from Ranger School last year following an administration directive to lift the ban on women in combat.

• Mark Luttrell, of Shelby County, Tenn., a Republican mayor and former sheriff who has advocated for criminal justice reform, creating specialty courts for drug, mental health, and veterans.

• Dannel Malloy, of Hartford, Conn., is the governor of Connecticut who has promoted several Obama administration priorities: raising the minimum wage to $10.10, guaranteeing paid sick leave and proposing new gun control measures.

Braeden Mannering, of Bear, Del., attended the White House Kids’ “State Dinner” as part of the first lady's Let's Move! initiative. The 12-year-old started his own nonprofit, Brae’s Brown Bags (3B), which provides healthy food to homeless and low-income individuals in his community.

• Satya Nadella, of Bellevue, Wash., is the CEO of Microsoft. The company is being recognized for expanding access to computer science in K-12 classrooms and increasing its paid leave benefits.

• Jim Obergefell, of Cincinnati. was the plaintiff in Obergefell v. Hodges, which ruled same-sex couples have the constitutional right to marry.

• Kathleen O’Toole, is the police chief of Seattle, Wash. which received a $600,000 grant from the Department of Justice to expand a six-month pilot program for body-worn police cameras.

• Ryan Reyes, of San Bernardino, Calif, whose partner Larry “Daniel” Kaufman was one of the 14 victims of the December 2 terrorist attack at Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. Daniel was a job trainer for adults with developmental disabilities at the Coffee N More shop, and is credited with saving the lives of four people when he warned others before being shot and killed in the attack.

• Ronna Rice, of Greeley, Colo., owns Rice’s Lucky Clover Honey, a raw and unfiltered honey exporter whose business trades with Pacific Rim nations that would be part of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership.

• Cedric Rowland, of Chicago, an Affordable Care Act "navigator" for Near North Health Service Corporation in Chicago. One woman he helped find health coverage for, Stephanie Lucas, will watch the State of the Union Address from the White House.
