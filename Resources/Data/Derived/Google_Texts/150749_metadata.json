Here in Pittsburgh, it\u2019s Bar Marco in the Strip District, and its sibling, the Livermore in East Liberty. The practice was implemented in April.\n\nBar Marco pays servers and cooks $35,000 a year for a 40-hour work week, plus health care and quarterly profit shares of a couple hundred dollars.\n\nCo-owner Justin Steel says the new practice is working just fine.\n\nThe key, he said, is education.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the greeting at the restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cSo customers understand that each dish is around 20 percent higher than it was with tips, so as to compensate 11 full-time staffers, five in the front of the house and the rest in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nFor guests, there\u2019s no line on the check to leave a tip. And it\u2019s the first statement on the restaurant\u2019s website, below the logo and the address.\n\nSince the changes have taken place,some employees have stayed, although many others have moved on to new restaurants that have incentivized pay in other ways.\n\n\u201cThe system we have implemented is not for people who need flexibility in their schedules,\u201d he said.\n\nNo other Pittsburgh restaurant has followed suit.\n\nTipping is a particularly American practice, with supporters who argue that it allows diners to reward especially good service and it keeps servers motivated.\n\nBut whether that\u2019s a reality has recently become the subject of heated debate. Few occupations pay a low base wage and require workers to hustle for tips to earn a living. Many argue that it demeans servers and requires that they put up with cases of harassing behavior just to get paid.\n\nTipping came about during Prohibition to make up for lost wages. In the 1960s, Congress voted to allow tipped workers to be paid 50 percent of the federal minimum wage, which led to the initial drop in servers\u2019 wages. Then in 1991, an amendment uncoupled the tipped minimum wage from the federal minimum wage, which has kept salaries to just over $2 an hour.\n\nAs a minimum wage hike has become a hot button topic, a handful of states has equalized tipped and non-tipped workers. But Pennsylvania is not among those states \u2014 servers here make as little as $2.83 an hour before tips.\n\nAlthough some Pittsburgh-area restaurant owners express a desire to make the switch to no tipping, they fear their profits will take a hit.\n\n\u201cI am against tipping, but as a small business owner I have yet to come up with a reasonable way to end it at Dinette,\u201d said chef owner Sonja Finn, who added she has a small profit margin and no safety net at her East Liberty restaurant.\n\n\u201cIf I get rid of tipping and raise prices, then I fear people will compare my price to places where tipping still exists and decide Dinette is too expensive. If I add a service charge, I fear customers might think it presumptuous to put it at 20 percent, so I would need to put it probably at 18.5 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my servers consistently are at 21 percent, so how would I make up the difference in pay?\u201d\n\nManagement in a couple of restaurant groups has said that the switch to no tips is impractical for businesses that now have to follow the Affordable Care Act. The cost of health care and employee compensation is a tally many business aren\u2019t prepared to pay.\n\nThat\u2019s why many people are shocked by Mr. Meyer\u2019s decision: With the size and scope of his operation, the costs must be significant. For one, his restaurants will no longer qualify for tax credits on tipped income, which, he told The New York Times, earns the group more than $1 million a year.\n\nUnion Square Hospitality Group has pulled in 25 James Beard awards and includes Union Square Cafe, The Modern in the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Gramercy Tavern \u2014 13 restaurants in all.\n\nBy late November, the website Eater reported, prices at the restaurants will be noticeably higher. Menus will inform diners of the policy. And there will be no space on the check for leaving a tip.\n\nElsewhere in Pennsylvania, restaurants that have gone to salaried employees have done it differently. Girard Restaurant in Philadelphia has eliminated tipping and pays workers $11 an hour before taxes, which after taxes ends up being almost $2 more than the Pennsylvania minimum wage for non-tipped employees. Unlike Bar Marco, on Girard\u2019s check, there is an option to leave a tip.\n\n\u201cOurs is not a good model for everyone,\u201d Bar Marco\u2019s Mr. Steel said. \u201cBut there are a lot of ways to do it that can work.\u201d\n\nMelissa McCart: 412-263-1198 or on Twitter @melissamccart.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.post-gazette.com/image/2015/10/17/_q90_cMC_z_ca230,141,2519,1667/20151016MWHbarmarcoMag07-6.jpg", "site_name": "Plate: Pittsburgh food, recipes, restaurants, drinks - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Last week, hospitality guru Danny Meyer announced that starting in November, his New York-based restaurant group would abolish tipping and", "title": "Restaurant scene: No other Pittsburgh restaurants following Bar Marco in no tipping"}, "twitter": {"domain": "post-gazette.com", "description": "Last week, hospitality guru Danny Meyer announced that starting in November, his New York-based restaurant group would abolish tipping and", "title": "Restaurant scene: No other Pittsburgh restaurants following Bar Marco in no tipping", "image": "http://www.post-gazette.com/image/2015/10/17/_q90_cMC_z_ca230,141,2519,1667/20151016MWHbarmarcoMag07-6.jpg", "creator": "@PittsburghPG", "site": "@PittsburghPG", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148144658590118}, "keywords": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Plate, Energy, food, recipes, restaurants, drinks", "google-site-verification": "sl2YoNahNhiOuOr3D0RcBa2eMf50pv8gTe6fZ6NB0SI", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Then in 1991, an amendment uncoupled the tipped minimum wage from the federal minimum wage, which has kept salaries to just over $2 an hour.\nHis announcement led to speculation as to whether it\u2019s the beginning of the end of tipping in restaurants.\nHere in Pittsburgh, it\u2019s Bar Marco in the Strip District, and its sibling, the Livermore in East Liberty.\nAs a minimum wage hike has become a hot button topic, a handful of states has equalized tipped and non-tipped workers.\nBar Marco pays servers and cooks $35,000 a year for a 40-hour work week, plus health care and quarterly profit shares of a couple hundred dollars."}
