Rafael Anchia (D-Dallas) is getting an earful from electric company lobbyists who don\u2019t like a bill he introduced in the 2015 Legislature.\n\nTwo sources in the Texas Legislature say Anchia\u2019s staffers are receiving what one calls \u201can unexpected backlash regarding the bill.\u201d\n\nAnchia\u2019s bill faces a hearing Wednesday in the House Committee on State Affairs \u2013 which means now is the time for supporters and opponents to act.\n\nHis House Bill 489 would place fees paid by consumers to electric companies for using smart thermostats under state regulatory rules. Because the gadgets are new, the way electric companies market them to customers is not regulated by the state. It also calls for the use of \u201cplain language\u201d in product contracts.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting here is that Anchia\u2019s bill is minor affecting few Texans who actually rent smart thermostats from an electric company. But apparently lobbyists don\u2019t want to open the door to any more regulation on the state\u2019s confusing retail electricity industry.\n\nAnchia\u2019s bill is in reaction to a Dallas Morning News Watchdog column I wrote in 2013 showing how Plano resident Tamara Galbraith was charged $495 by Tara Energy when she cancelled her smart thermostat rental.\n\nShe said the promised rewards didn\u2019t justify the expense.\n\nI showed readers the ultra-tiny print on the contract, rendering it essentially unreadable.\n\nThere ought to be a law, and that\u2019s what Anchia has said. He sees the need to place new technologies under state marketing rules. Smart thermostats weren\u2019t on the market a decade ago when Texas deregulated electricity.\n\nNow electric companies see them as a way to make money. They rent them to customers, some of whom don\u2019t realize they can buy smart thermostats on their own. The devices are supposed to adjust temperatures based on the habits of the people in the house.\n\nYou can let Anchia know your thoughts on his bill before Wednesday\u2019s hearing by sending him an email: to rafael.anchia@house.state.tx.us.\n\n# # #\n\nAs the Dallas Morning News Watchdog, I\u2019m pushing bills that fix major problems in the Texas retail electricity market. So far, I\u2019m disappointed because only one of my suggestions has been introduced (eliminating minimum usage penalties).\n\nRead my latest report on The Watchdog\u2019s legislative package for 2015: \u201cWatchdog: This week is legislature\u2019s last chance for electricity reform.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the text of the minor bill driving the Texas electric industry crazy.\n\nHB 489\n\nA BILL TO BE ENTITLED AN ACT relating to customer protections related to smart thermostat services marketing and contracts.\n\nBE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS: SECTIONA1.AASubchapter A, Chapter 17, Utilities Code, is amended by adding Section 17.010 to read as follows:\n\nSec.A17.010.AACUSTOMER PROTECTION; SMART THERMOSTATS.\n\n(a) The commission shall ensure that a retail electric provider or aggregator that offers to residential or small commercial customers a product or service related to smart thermostats provides to the customers in marketing communications and contract materials clear descriptions in plain language of the product or service, of the contract terms, and of customers \u2019 rights.\n\n(b)The commission shall adopt and enforce rules as necessary to implement this section. Rules adopted under this section must be at least as protective of customers \u2019 interests as general commission rules regarding marketing of and contracting for electric services for residential and small commercial customers.\n\n# # #\n\nYou really can\u2019t afford to miss Dave Lieber\u2019s Watchdog column every Friday and Sunday in dallasnews.com.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAzL3JlcC1yYWZhZWwtYW5jaGlhLWZhY2luZy1iYWNrbGFzaC1mcm9tLWVsZWN0cmljLWNvbXBhbmllcy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Dave Lieber", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "A minor bill designed to protect consumers is apparently driving the Texas electric industry crazy.
