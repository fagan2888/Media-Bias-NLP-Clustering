But hospitals and care facilities will be short 193,000 nurses to fill those positions. That\u2019s according to a report from Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Education and the Workforce.\n\nIt\u2019s a demanding job\u2014often 12-hour shifts, constantly on-the-go, caring for others. But it pays well. The average annual salary for a licensed practical nurse -- a certification usually tied to an associate degree-- is nearly $43,000. For a registered nurse, someone who typically holds a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, it\u2019s $68,910 a year. For those with more advanced degrees in the field, salaries are even higher. A nurse practitioner makes about $95,070 a year on average.\n\nIt's a steady job with good pay, so why the coming nurse shortage? Reasons include an aging U.S. population -- we'll need more nurses to care for the elderly -- as well as an aging profession. Lots of demand, weakening supply. \u201cMany of the nurses who are registered nurses right now in this country are in fact aging,\u201d says Nicole Smith, Senior Economist at the Georgetown University Center of Education and the Workforce who was one of the leads on the study. \u201cOver 50% of the nurses are over 50 years old. We have many nurses we expect to retire you know in the next 10 to 15 years,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, in addition to those openings, there will be many newly-created jobs as well. And not just the traditional type of nursing positions.\n\nBobby Matthews, who handles talent acquisition and retention for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York, says the Affordable Care Act has put emphasis back on preventive care. \u201cAs care moves from less of an in-patient focus to more of an out-patient focus,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have a higher need for things like clinical coordinators, patient navigators, nurses that are educated in the community so they are never admitted to the hospital to begin with.\u201d\n\n[Get the Latest Market Data and News with the Yahoo Finance App]\n\nThe job opportunities are there, but many can't get the credentials needed to take advantage. That's because nursing schools can\u2019t keep up with demand. According to the Georgetown study, 37% of applicants with the necessary test scores and qualifications were rejected from nursing schools. That\u2019s largely because these schools simply don\u2019t have the space or faculty to keep up with demand. Another report from the American Association of Nursing Schools found more than 78,000 applicants in total were rejected from undergraduate and graduate nursing schools in the 2013-2014 academic school year.\n\nMatthews says there are challenges already in finding top talent for nursing positions specifically in certain niche fields like neurosurgery and oncology. Finding experienced nurses in these fields can be difficult he says. \"We have to start looking ahead and figure out how we are going to train talent that we already have...how can we can we give them the skills and education to help them transition into those roles?\"\n\nFor those with the education and qualifications, it\u2019s a demanding job with solid pay and room for growth. Zhanna Khandros, a registered nurse at the cardiac care unit at Mount Sinai Heart Hospital in New York, started her career as a Licensed Nurse Practitioner, but once on the job, went back to school to get her Bachelor\u2019s of Science. The hospital she was working for at the time, reimbursed her for tuition. She became an RN and eventually moved to a better-paying job at Mount Sinai Heart.\n\nBut for Khandros, it\u2019s not the pay and career mobility, that drew her to the profession, she says. \u201cAt the end of the day, no matter how hard your day is no matter how much you\u2019re running, no matter how much you\u2019re on your feet and you\u2019re exhausted,\u201d she says, \u201cwhen that patient thanks you for everything you\u2019ve done, you say okay maybe it\u2019s all worth it. It\u2019s all worth it.\u201d\n\nTips for those considering the nursing field? Get as much education as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to attach yourself to a job that pays a pretty decent starting wage,\u201d says the Georgetown economist Smith. Smith says her research has found many of the most competitive and top-paying hospitals are now requiring a bachelor of science degree in nursing for many staff jobs.\n\nMore from Yahoo Finance\n\nChina's 'changing reality' a challenge and opportunity for the West: Wharton Dean\n\nThe jobs recovery is weaker than it seems\n\nThe Mall is not dead yet but \"it's a good time to get out,\" Davidowitz says", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "From Yahoo Finance: By 2020, there will be an estimated 1.6 million job openings for nurses in the United States.
