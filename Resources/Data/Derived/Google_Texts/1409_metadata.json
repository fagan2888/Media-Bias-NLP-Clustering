When Faal in turn helped her friend to move her car by dragging aside a wooden pallet blocking the way, she fell down the open manhole it had been covering.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Daily Mail reports Faal\u2019s comments after the accident, when she said: \u201cI moved the pallet out of the way with my foot and I was going to turn around to my friend say \u2018is that far enough?\u2019. I took a step over \u2013 never in my life did I think there was a hole underneath, I thought it had just fallen over. The next thing I remember is the pain. It was awful.\n\n\u201cI fell and smashed my face on the pallet, and I was in the hole with blood all over me and I couldn\u2019t move\u201d.\n\nFaal says the event, which left her with a suspected broken leg and two black eyes was so traumatic, she may never leave her house again. She was left lying in the open air for an hour waiting for a paramedic to arrive after her fall.\n\nAgoraphobia, which is commonly thought to be a fear of open spaces but is better understood as anxiety over uncontrollable or perceived dangerous situations has received heightened exposure as it featured heavily as a plot line in the popular Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul. In the popular American television series, beamed directly into British homes by the video streaming service Netflix, the elder, and considerably more successful lawyer brother of the protagonist has been reduced to the status of a dependent by his fear of the outdoors, and electromagnetic radiation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Agoraphobic Confirms Own Fears as First Trip Outside in Years Ends up in Hospital Visit", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Agoraphobic Confirms Own Fears as First Trip Outside in Years Ends up in Hospital Visit", "title": "Agoraphobic Confirms Own Fears as First Trip Outside in Years Ends up in Hospital Visit - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Manhole-Cover.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/04/21/agoraphobic-confirms-own-fears-as-first-trip-outside-in-years-ends-up-in-hospital-visit/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Agoraphobic Confirms Own Fears as First Trip Outside in Years Ends up in Hospital Visit", "title": "Agoraphobic Confirms Own Fears as First Trip Outside in Years Ends up in Hospital Visit - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Manhole-Cover.jpg", "creator": "@oliver_lane", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Breitbart London,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart London", "published_time": "2015-04-21T05:56:12-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart London", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/oliverlane"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Janet Faal, 57, of West Sussex had been working to get over her anxiety about open spaces with the help of a friend, who had taken her for a walk outside \u2013 only her third in 10 years.\nShe was left lying in the open air for an hour waiting for a paramedic to arrive after her fall.\n\u201cI fell and smashed my face on the pallet, and I was in the hole with blood all over me and I couldn\u2019t move\u201d.\nWhen Faal in turn helped her friend to move her car by dragging aside a wooden pallet blocking the way, she fell down the open manhole it had been covering.\nI took a step over \u2013 never in my life did I think there was a hole underneath, I thought it had just fallen over."}
