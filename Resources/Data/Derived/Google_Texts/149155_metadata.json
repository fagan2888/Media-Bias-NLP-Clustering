It claims the abrupt severing of doctor-patient relationships \"will shift the geriatric population to a crisis-oriented culture which further impacts the health and safety of Medicare beneficiaries and increases the cost of the health care, a situation that the Affordable Care Act was meant to address.\"\n\nIt also belies United's \"repeated and explicit commitments to improving their provider networks,\" the doctors claim. \"What United instead is doing is shifting the financial Burdens imposed by the Affordable Care Act from itself, a multibillion-dollar company, to the providers and patients, all with the aim of maximizing revenues. Such a bad faith response, which undermines clear legislative policies and is being done solely for the sake of profits, cannot be condoned.\"\n\nThe Society wants United Healthcare enjoined from its threatened termination, which it claims was done in violation of Medicare and Medicaid regulations.\n\nThe doctors are represented by David Adelson, with Kern, Augustine, Conroy & Schoppmann, of Westbury, N.Y.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc191\"", "article_summary": "The Medical Society of the State of New York sued United Healthcare Insurance Co. and three of its affiliates, in Federal Court.\nThe Society wants United Healthcare enjoined from its threatened termination, which it claims was done in violation of Medicare and Medicaid regulations.\nUnited claimed, disingenuously, that this unilateral boot was simply a way to \"amend\" the contracts, the Society says.\nThis will hurt the elderly patients and the doctors, the Society says.\n\"What United instead is doing is shifting the financial Burdens imposed by the Affordable Care Act from itself, a multibillion-dollar company, to the providers and patients, all with the aim of maximizing revenues."}
