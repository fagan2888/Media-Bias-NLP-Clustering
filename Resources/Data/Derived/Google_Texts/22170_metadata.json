John Kasich\u2019s combination presidential campaign and Obamacare promo tour stopped this week in North Carolina.\n\nA local TV host asked Kasich \u2014 one of few Republicans to embrace Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u2014 what he would say to North Carolina lawmakers \u201cadamantly against\u201d expanding Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken $14 billion over the next seven years back to our state, of Ohio money that we sent to Washington,\u201d Kasich replied Monday before defending the program\u2019s benefits for drug addicts, the mentally ill and the working poor.\n\nObamacare promises an open-ended stream of new federal Medicaid funding; there\u2019s no pool of Ohio or California or North Carolina money for states to dip into. Every state expanding Medicaid increases the total cost.\n\nKasich\u2019s attempt to obscure the facts didn\u2019t surprise Mitch Kokai, communications director for North Carolina\u2019s free-market John Locke Foundation.\n\nKasich, Kokai said, hasn\u2019t simply tried to justify his decision to expand Medicaid but has \u201cdoubled down on it and said others should do the same.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion cost $3.7 billion in its first 17 months and is already $1 billion over budget. Enrollment is much higher than projected, and so are costs per enrollee.\n\nKokai said it made sense for Time Warner Cable News Central NC to bring up Medicaid expansion while talking to Kasich about a potential presidential run, given Obamacare\u2019s continued importance to voters.\n\n\u201cSomeone seeking the Republican nomination who has actually taken an active role in supporting and implementing a major piece of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 that does set Governor Kasich apart,\u201d Kokai explained.\n\nNorth Carolina is one of 21 states in which Republican lawmakers have refused to put able-bodied, childless adults on Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\nMontana expanded Medicaid this spring after Kasich attacked Montana Republicans for their opposition. Kasich promoted Medicaid expansion in May campaign stops in South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nIn North Carolina, Kokai expects the impact of Kasich\u2019s Obamacare promotion \u201cis likely to be very limited.\u201d\n\nRegarding Kasich\u2019s claims about Medicaid expansion funding, Kokai said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone who\u2019s been following the debate here in North Carolina is going to buy that argument.\u201d\n\nBACKGROUND: Will Ohioans be taken in by Obamacare Medicaid spin?\n\nLater in his interview with Time Warner Cable News Central NC, Kasich used his unflinching support for Medicaid expansion to cultivate his straight-shooter image.\n\n\u201cI travel all over the country, I talk to every crowd, I never change any of my positions,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI find that people understand why we need to help the mentally ill, the drug-addicted and the working poor.\u201d\n\nKasich \u2014 who insists Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion has nothing to do with Obamacare \u2014 expressed confidence in talking points refuted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Congressional Research Service.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t find a lot of opposition once I get in the room and tell them what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Kasich added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
