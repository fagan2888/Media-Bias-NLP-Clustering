And like all brand marketers, they\u2019re getting smarter about getting through to the hard-to-reach demo.\n\nLooking at the numbers, it\u2019s little wonder why millennials are such a target. Those born between 1981 and the early 2000s make up a quarter of the U.S. population, and roughly 45 million are eligible to vote. That is expected to double by 2020, when millennials will comprise 40 percent of eligible voters. Clearly, Gen Y will play a major role at the ballot box in the midterms, and represents a key demo for Democrats and Republicans in the 2016 presidential race and beyond.\n\n\u201cMillennials are at a very important place in their lives, and that has really big implications for the future of government and activism,\u201d says Susan Feeney, a partner at creative agency GMMB, which specializes in political and advocacy ads and that worked on both of President Barack Obama\u2019s national campaigns.\n\nBut how can political parties and issues-oriented groups get through to a notoriously hard-to-reach demo? Much like marketing any goods or services, experts say, it all comes down to the synergy of content and platform\u2014putting out the right message on the right device at the right time. That\u2019s easier said than done. Just as brand marketers struggle to engage the millennial audience, politicians and advocacy groups find themselves striving for the perfect tone.\n\nWhere platforms are concerned, it is beyond clich\u00e9 to say millennials are tech-centric, channel-agnostic and social media-obsessed. Study after study bears that out. For example, a recent survey by SDL found that 30 percent of millennials use four or more digital communications devices daily, and the overall group checks mobile phones an average of 40 times per day, making a multiscreen strategy more essential than ever.\n\nGMMB\u2019s Feeney notes that video remains key, befitting a generation raised on images that play across multiple screens. But remember, this isn\u2019t 1984 or even 1994, when a single, broad buy on the CBS Evening News would deliver a high-impact message across demos. Millennials prefer to be in full command of how, when and where they consume media, as we all have come to know\u2014meaning that a buy across Comedy Central\u2019s programs must encompass their mobile apps as well.\n\nThe good\u2014and to some, surprising\u2014news is that this generation happens to be a responsive one. \u201cMillennials are more open to being influenced than most people think,\u201d says Jeff Fromm, author of Marketing to Millennials and president of FutureCast, a millennial-focused consultancy and partner firm of ad shop Barkley.\n\nFromm says it is a misconception that millennials hate advertising. In fact, many agree that young adults see ads as a necessary mode of communication in our culture, while they have proved they can, in fact, be swayed by messages that speak to their needs in ways they find entertaining and informative. That last term is key. Millennials place a high value on information sharing, even as they have an especially low tolerance for hype, histrionics and hard sells.\n\nWhether touting a presidential candidate, advocating for a healthcare program or raising awareness of a new initiative to combat social injustice, when it comes to crafting content, there are certain rules to follow when it comes to this demo, according to the experts. \u201cThey hold you to a higher standard for content,\u201d notes Zac Moffatt, co-founder of strategic consultancy Targeted Victory, who served as digital director of Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 White House bid. \u201cIf your content is not relevant,\u201d Moffatt says, \u201cyou get tuned out.\u201d\n\nOverly broad or simplistic messages are a recipe for disaster. Pitches, according to those who craft campaigns targeting the demo, must be laser-focused to match millennials\u2019 ideals and interests, providing access to data and tools they can use to take action in the real world. Ad messages should be linked with offline results or expected outcomes, for example, and should avoid preaching or scare tactics at all costs.\n\nAbove all, political and issues advertising aimed at young adults must be sincere\u2014and it\u2019s not enough to just sound sincere because this generation, raised on Google, does its own fact checking. \u201cThey can spot a phony a mile away,\u201d warns Fromm. \u201cThey want to know you stand for something.\u201d\n\nExperts cite \u201cIt\u2019s on Us\u201d as a campaign that gets it right targeting millennials on social issues. Designed to raise awareness of sexual assault on campus, \u201cIt\u2019s on Us\u201d posits, in plain but stirring language, that this cause should be everyone\u2019s concern. A PSA broke last month featuring celebrities Jon Hamm, Connie Britton, Questlove and others, speaking directly into the camera, each reading from a script that begins, \u201cIt\u2019s on us \u2026 to get in the way before it happens. To get a friend home safe. To not blame the victim. It\u2019s on us to look out for each other\u2014to not look the other way.\u201d Created by Mekanism for a White House initiative in partnership with Generation Progress and the Pvblic Foundation, the clip got 2.5 million YouTube views in its first week.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of the campaign is to establish shared responsibility,\u201d says agency CEO Jason Harris. The work is multifaceted and runs deeper than a single PSA, he stresses. \u201cBy creating a pledge and downloadable toolkits, we want people to make the leap from knowing there\u2019s a problem to saying, \u2018You know what? I am going to do something about it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe strategy is on point, seeing as Gen Y is a largely optimistic group that wants to take action for causes it believes in. The \u201cIt\u2019s on Us\u201d initiative also earns high marks for avoiding charged language and scary musical cues, and eschewing melodramatic reenactments and upsetting news footage. \u201cI think it is a solid example,\u201d Fromm says of the campaign. \u201cIt is no b.s. and takes a clear stand\u201d about working together to solve a problem that, unfortunately, some people would prefer to ignore.\n\nOf course, building empathy for a cause practically everyone is predisposed to support is far less daunting than developing ads around complex issues. Take the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Ads both pro and con have been everywhere, many of those messages targeting millennials.\n\nWhen Nail was enlisted to persuade young adults in Rhode Island to sign up for health insurance through the state\u2019s HealthSourceRI, the marketing shop proceeded from the insight that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing more intimidating or boring to them than insurance,\u201d says creative director Alec Beckett.\n\nTo overcome that, Nail created the tongue-in-cheek \u201cNag Toolkit.\u201d Bypassing traditional media, the digital initiative was designed to jump-start millennials\u2019 interest by casting their moms\u2014frequent foils for young adults\u2014in prominent roles. Moms were encouraged to sign up for OkCupid, Tinder and Snapchat in order to \u201cmercilessly nag\u201d their millennial offspring into buying coverage. Nail believed the adult kids\u2014devotees of the Onion and Stephen Colbert\u2014would respond in a positive way. \u201cWe knew they\u2019d get the joke,\u201d Beckett says. \u201cIt was a way for us to broach the conversation without being heavy-handed.\u201d The effort has been widely praised for speaking to the demo in a style it understands.\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cGot Insurance?\u201d campaign, created by the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative and ProgressNow Colorado Education, was more polarizing. With an eye toward college students, highly sharable digital content followed the misadventures of \u201cRob, Zack and Sam\u2014bros for life.\u201d One ad begins: \u201cKeg stands are crazy. Not having insurance is crazier. Don\u2019t tap into your beer money to cover those medical bills.\u201d Reads another: \u201cYo Mom, do I got insurance? My girlfriend broke my heart, so me and the bros went golfing. Then my buddy broke my head. Good thing my mom made sure I got insurance.\u201d\n\nWhile some contended that the ads talked down to their audience, Adam Fox, director of strategic engagement at CCHI, maintains that millennials got the joke. \u201cOur website had nearly 25 million hits, the ads were shared thousands of times on social media, and we received massive earned media coverage worth over $500,000 in publicity value,\u201d he reports.\n\nLikewise, Nail\u2019s Beckett points to the impact of \u201cNag Toolkit\u201d beyond the campaign. The \u201cright wing\u2019s fury\u201d about moms trying to seduce their own kids \u201cwas hysterical,\u201d he says. \u201cIt got us tons of free publicity. There are so many desperate media outlets that can be played. You\u2019ve got to wake up the trolls intentionally.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the trolls came out in droves, mostly from the left, to slam an anti-Obamacare campaign from nonprofit, millennial-focused advocacy group Generation Opportunity. Its Web video series \u201cOpt Out\u201d features a weird character with an outsize Uncle Sam mask, reminiscent of \u201cthe King\u201d from those old Burger King spots. In one clip, Uncle Sam snaps on a latex glove and prepares to give a twentysomething guy a proctology exam. In another, his face appears between the legs of a young woman visiting her gynecologist. A title card warns: \u201cDon\u2019t let government play doctor.\u201d\n\nSome found the approach crass, even vulgar, though \u201cOpt Out\u201d has its defenders. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s creepy, as it\u2019s actually shot very beautifully\u201d and the snark might appeal to some millennials, says Bill Green, who blogs at AdVerve. (The ads have been viewed more than 3.6 million times on YouTube.)\n\nPitching political candidates might be the ultimate test for millennial-focused agencies. The demo distrusts politics and the political class. A recent Reason-Rupe survey found that 66 percent of millennials believe government is inefficient and wasteful, while 60 percent think it abuses its powers.\n\nIssues advocacy\u2014including efforts like \u201cIt\u2019s on Us,\u201d backed by the White House\u2014can appear divorced from politics, while ads that promote a particular political candidate are necessarily seen as political. As the midterm elections approach, the experts contend, campaigns would do well to heed the lessons learned from Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election bid.\n\nBecause young adults view Washington as \u201ca cesspool,\u201d creative agency SS+K was determined to \u201csell a politician by not being political,\u201d notes Rob Shepardson, the shop\u2019s co-founder and partner. \u201cThey knew Obama, liked him as a person, but were disappointed with the economy and generally alienated from politics,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThere was an enthusiasm gap. Our job was to create that enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nSo, SS+K fashioned a two-pronged campaign. Quirky humor was the watchword in a spot dubbed \u201cFirst Time\u201d featuring millennial heroine and Girls creator Lena Dunham. In the bit, she advises viewers to be especially careful when picking partners for their \u201cfirst time\u201d\u2014first time voting in a presidential election, that is.\n\nAt the same time, SS+K launched \u201cFor All,\u201d which riffed on the final words in the Pledge of Allegiance. Individuals were encouraged to write brief statements reflecting their views (\u201cEqual Rights,\u201d \u201cMarriage Equality\u201d) on their hands with markers, pose as if reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, then upload the images to Instagram.\n\nTime magazine called the Dunham spot the \u201cmost memorable ad of the 2012 campaign,\u201d while more than 5,000 \u201cFor All\u201d photos were posted, generating nearly 80,000 tweets. (All told, 1.25 million more millennials voted for Obama in 2012 than in 2008, helping him win important swing states like Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio and ultimately retain the White House.)\n\nThe final takeaway, as Shepardson sees it: \u201cMillennials will align with somebody regardless of political labels based on values. Communicate through issues, not through the candidate. Negative ads and politics-as-usual can turn millennials off. They are quite shrewd when it comes to marketing. You need to get to a point or a benefit that matters to them. We had to be very careful not to make one false move and fall back into the traditional way of marketing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just like the whole of consumer marketing, political campaigns and social-issues advertisers\u2014especially in this midterm election year\u2014have millennials in their sights.
