Spotlight on… Kevin Durant, forward, Thunder

When: It was a short week for many of the NBA’s teams leading into the all-star break. But Oklahoma City managed to squeeze in three games in the latest evaluation period of Feb. 7-13. And Kevin Durant was stellar in that span, earning him Denver Post player of the week honors.

What’s up: Durant was a cumulative plus-20.7, which led all players, as the Thunder won all three games. Durant averaged 31.7 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.7 assists in the three games. He shot a sizzling 65.3 percent from the field and an impressive 61.9 percent from 3-point range.

Background: Anyone who attended the Nuggets’ game against Oklahoma City on Feb. 9 knows that was Durant’s best game of the week — 40 points, with full range on his jump shot on display all night long. His most important production, however, came in a win over the Memphis Grizzlies two nights later. His 26 points and 10 rebounds helped OKC topple one of the West’s best as the Thunder continues to climb back into the playoff race.

Dempsey’s take: It’s crazy to think this is Durant’s first player of the week award this season, but remember, he missed significant time because of injuries. He’s still played in only 26 of the Thunder’s 53 games to date. Because of that, he’s relatively fresh, a scary thought for teams opposing him after the all-star break.
