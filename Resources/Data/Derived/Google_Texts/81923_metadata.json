Now that prices are climbing at the grocery store, the 60-year-old school counselor says she might get rid of her single-cup brewer.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t see spending that much money on coffee,\u201d Foley said as she waited for a bus near Downtown Crossing earlier this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany coffee fans would disagree. But they are digging deeper now to pay for the brew that gets them started in the morning.\n\nAn unusual drought during the rainy season in Brazil sent coffee futures soaring earlier this year to their highest prices in more than two years. Months later, the effects are trickling down to consumers.\n\n\u201cBrazil has the largest supply of coffee in the world,\u201d said John DeMuria, managing partner of Volcafe USA, the national branch of the coffee trading company Volcafe Ltd. \u201cIf there\u2019s a hiccup in Brazil, everyone feels it.\u201d\n\nLast week, the J.M. Smucker Co. increased prices by 9 percent on its Folgers coffee and on Dunkin\u2019 Donuts packaged products it distributes to retailers. Kraft Foods Group followed a few days later with a 10 percent hike on Maxwell House and Yuban.\n\nDunkin\u2019 said it expects a \u201cmodest increase in coffee prices\u201d at its shops this year, citing rising commodity costs. Starbucks prices haven\u2019t changed, but the company said it\u2019s constantly watching the market. Keurig Green Mountain Inc., the Waterbury, Vt., company that sells billions of K-Cups a year, declined to talk about coffee prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechnomic Inc., a restaurant industry research firm in Chicago, said the price of a cup of coffee at quick-service restaurants nationwide increased by 2 percent to $2.29 in the first three months of the year \u2014 before the drought had any real effect on retail costs.\n\nBut many coffee drinkers, faced with the possibility of rising prices, don\u2019t need to think twice about the choice they would make. They want their coffee and are prepared to pay more.\n\nDamon Syphers, 52, said he drinks about four cups of coffee a day from his Keurig at home or purchased at Starbucks. The doctoral student and consultant from Malden said the $2.45 cup of iced coffee he sipped outside a Starbucks in Downtown Crossing earlier this week would have to jump to $4 before he considered cutting back.\n\n\u201cI need that jolt,\u201d he said.\n\nWendy Maeda/Globe Staff Reynaldo Albarado and his daughter, Yaxelis, 6, had breakfast at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Wednesday.\n\nNearby, Kendra Higgins of Brockton felt the same way. The 26-year-old fund-raiser said she spends exactly $4.12 a day on two medium-sized cups of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts black coffee, sometimes with a little cream and sugar. Higgins compared her need for coffee to a smoker who continues to buy cigarettes even as costs climb.\n\n\u201cI would still drink it,\u201d she said. \u201cTen percent is not a big deal, and I need coffee.\u201d\n\nHiggins and Syphers are not alone, said Joe Pawlak, a senior vice president at Technomic. Pawlak says American consumers rarely cut back their java consumption unless the hike is particularly egregious.\n\n\u2018I just can\u2019t see spending that much money on coffee.\u2019\n\n\u201cConsumers are still very cautious about what they are spending, but this is an affordable indulgence and one they are willing to spend on,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been conditioned to have it every morning, and they are used to it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to predict how trends on the global coffee commodity market will affect prices in supermarkets and coffee shops. Big retailers typically lock in prices far in advance.\n\nBut commodity contracts that serve as the world benchmark for Arabica coffee prices have soared by 57 percent so far in 2014. Earlier this year, the price had risen by 85 percent in fewer than three months.\n\nWendy Maeda/Globe Staff Dunkin\u2019 Donuts says it does not yet know how much of a price increase for coffee it will recommend to franchisees.\n\nThat jarring trend is all about the rain \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 in Brazil, which produces about a third of the world\u2019s coffee. The rain season there typically begins in September and continues for about six months. Rain is critical to the development of coffee tree cherries, which contain seeds that are roasted as coffee beans.\n\nThe rain arrived on time last fall. The trees flowered and the fruit set, but then the rain stopped uncharacteristically in December and a drought began, DeMuria said.\n\n\u201cThe rain season was shortened by three months,\u201d he said. \u201cSoil moisture was diminished, and in many areas, the trees shut down, and a lot of the formation and maturation of the bean didn\u2019t take place.\u201d\n\nA coffee fungus in Central America has made the problem worse.\n\nDeMuria said excess coffee supplies from the last two years eased some of the current shortage. Now prices reflect uncertainty about how the drought might affect future crops.\n\n\u201cThe situation isn\u2019t that bad because you have enough working stock to get us through,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real question now is how the next crop will do. No one knows because we\u2019ve never had a drought in this particular time period, and we don\u2019t have anything to fall back on.\u201d\n\nStill, coffee shops don\u2019t raise prices carelessly. Even modest increases for their products add up, and many are afraid of charging more than other competitors.\n\nA Dunkin\u2019 spokeswoman said the company has not yet determined the price increase it will recommend to its franchisees, who own most of the stores and have the final say on menu prices.\n\nPrices are a recurring topic of conversation at meetings of the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Independent Franchise Owners, said Robert Branca, who owns several stores in central Massachusetts. He called coffee Dunkin\u2019s \u201chero product.\u201d Many customers come in with exact change, and store owners resist increases as much as possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually the last resort to increase a cup of coffee,\u201d Branca said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you do when there are no other options.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.4238239227", "eomportal-id": 161229, "description": "Coffee prices are climbing as a result of a drought during the rain season in Brazil.", "eomportal-instanceid": 16, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Coffee prices are climbing as a result of a drought during the rain season in Brazil.", "title": "Coffee prices climb in grocery stores, shops - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/06/13/coffee-prices-climb-grocery-stores-shops/o6jnRPlq378voTvVXl8UWN/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2014/06/11/BostonGlobe.com/Business/Advance/Images/maeda_12coffee_biz2.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Wed May 25 18:55:35 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "coffee prices,caffeine,green mountain,john demuria,robert branca,Volcafe,starbucks,Dunkin' Donuts", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "eomportal-uuid": "194774f0-f370-11e3-8a49-f20cb1b355b9", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "coffee prices,caffeine,green mountain,john demuria,robert branca,Volcafe,starbucks,Dunkin' Donuts"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe77\"", "article_summary": "Keurig Green Mountain Inc., the Waterbury, Vt., company that sells billions of K-Cups a year, declined to talk about coffee prices.\nDunkin\u2019 Donuts said it expects a \u201cmodest increase in coffee prices\u201d at its shops this year.\nDunkin\u2019 said it expects a \u201cmodest increase in coffee prices\u201d at its shops this year, citing rising commodity costs.\nBut commodity contracts that serve as the world benchmark for Arabica coffee prices have soared by 57 percent so far in 2014.\nSmucker Co. increased prices by 9 percent on its Folgers coffee and on Dunkin\u2019 Donuts packaged products it distributes to retailers."}
