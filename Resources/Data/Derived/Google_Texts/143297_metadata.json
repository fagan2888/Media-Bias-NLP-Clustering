The letters direct patients to local navigators, who can answer question and help them with the sign-up process.\n\nThe hospitals' new campaign gets underway as the first open enrollment deadline approaches on Dec. 15.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell made a stop in Orlando to speak with some of the key players about enrollment efforts. She encouraged the public to visit healthcare.gov or localhelp.healthcare.gov to shop for a plan and sign up before the deadline.\n\nPeople who qualify for health insurance in the marketplace but don't sign up will get penalized either $325 or 2 percent of their gross income, whichever is higher.\n\nThe penalties don't apply to close to 1 million people who fall in the state's Medicaid coverage gap and are without health insurance, because they earn too little to qualify for federal financial aid in the marketplace and too much to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nSince last year, the number of uninsured has dropped from 22 percent to 19 percent in Central Florida.\n\nThe two hospital systems have identified nearly 150,000 uninsured patients in their databases and are currently finalizing the number of letters that will be mailed out. They will follow up with a community event at the end of January, targeting the newly insured.\n\n\"It will be a health-care basics conversation,\" said Jeff Hurst, senior vice president and senior financial officer at Florida Hospital.\n\nThere are more plans available in the marketplace this year, but the premiums have gone up, too. Anne Packham, the lead navigator in Central Florida, said that it's important for people who already have coverage to actively renew their plans instead of relying on auto-renewal.\n\n\"The important message is that if you have health care coverage through the marketplace, it's time to for you to review and make changes for 2015,\" said Steve Harr, executive vice president at Orlando Health.\n\nTo make an appointment with a navigator call 877-564-5031 or visit coveringcfl.net.\n\nnmiller@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5158.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Hospitals launch campaign for ACA", "date": "2014-12-09", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "Florida Hospital and Orlando Health officials have teamed up for an Affordable Care Act educational campaign in hopes of persuading their uninsured patients get coverage at the federal health insurance marketplace.", "title": "Hospitals launch campaign for ACA", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/health/os-burwell-obamacare-orlando-20141209-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5487aba9/turbine/os-burwell-obamacare-orlando-20141209", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "health insurance marketplace exchange federal aca burwell orlando health florida hospital", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/82239226", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "health insurance marketplace exchange federal aca burwell orlando health florida hospital", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Within the next month, Florida Hospital and Orlando Health will send out letters to uninsured patients to let them know that they could qualify for federal financial aid in the marketplace.
