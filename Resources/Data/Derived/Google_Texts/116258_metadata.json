The CO-OP is physician-led and clinically integrated emphasizing individual attention to members. Its 35,000 members include many individuals new to health insurance as well as small and large employer groups. According to Reiter, the pent-up demand for healthcare has brought to NMHC a high percentage of members with one or more chronic condition.\n\n\"We're committed to meeting members where they are,\" said Reiter. \"Whether they have asthma, diabetes, or a combination of chronic conditions, it's crucial to have a solution that creates a coaching plan tailored to the particular member.\"\n\nNMHC case and disease management teams will use CareWebQI, an interactive care management solution from MCG, to generate individualized care plans based on the Chronic Care guidelines. Chronic Care helps clinicians evaluate needs, identify goals, and support effective self-care for patients with chronic diseases or complex care needs.\n\n\"When NMHC began offering healthcare coverage in 2014, they chose to support the community and embrace medical risk instead of running away from it,\" said Jon Shreve, president of MCG. \"Their decision to purchase MCG guidelines and solutions is a testament to the merit of that approach. The NMHC commitment to innovation makes them an excellent partner for MCG.\"\n\nAbout New Mexico Health Connections (NMHC)\n\nNMHC, New Mexico's nonprofit, consumer-operated and -oriented (CO-OP) health plan, focuses on the well-being of patients by making sure care is coordinated at every level.
