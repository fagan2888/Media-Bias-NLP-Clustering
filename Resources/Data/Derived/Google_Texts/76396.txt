Republicans have officially floated their latest counter proposal to Obamacare. But they won’t have one key business segment on their side: The benefits industry.

In a nutshell, the GOP proposal for extending health insurance to the masses would replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with the American Health Care Reform Act, the fulcrum of which is a substantial tax deduction for individuals and families that have qualifying health insurance. People wouldn’t face the same pressure to buy insurance as they do under PPACA, but would still be incentivized to do so.
