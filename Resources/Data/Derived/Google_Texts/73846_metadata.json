Last Monday after the court\u2019s ruling, board members called a press conference to say they may seek a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the program.\n\nHowever, I keep going back to the beginning. As an education reporter with The Denver Post, I was among the first to write about Dougco\u2019s voucher plan.\n\nAt the time, district leadership wouldn\u2019t comment. Dougco\u2019s spokeswoman asked me to delay publishing an article. And the board tried to hold secret meetings about the plan at a private business office. Only after media attorneys interceded did the district allow press into the meeting.\n\nIt is gratifying the Colorado Supreme Court saw through Dougco\u2019s ruse.\n\nUnder the program, the district created a make-believe charter school called the Choice Scholarship Charter School that would collect the state per-pupil funds. A portion of that $6,100 per student would be sent to the student\u2019s chosen school in the form of a check to the parent, who would use it for tuition.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough that the virtual charter school had no buildings, employed no teachers and had no curriculum. Its students never attended a day of class. The school\u2019s existence was to collect money for private schools.\n\nSixteen of the 23 private schools under the program\u2019s 2011 pilot phase were religious in character, and 93 percent of the 271 scholarship recipients in 2011 enrolled in a religious school.\n\nFourteen of those schools were outside of the district\u2019s boundaries.\n\nProponents say the idea was to give families more choice.\n\nThey decry the court\u2019s interpretation of the state\u2019s constitution, specifically the s0-called Blaine Amendment, which forbids the state from using public money to fund religious schools.\n\nThe crux of their argument is that the Blaine Amendment is a 19th century holdover of anti-Catholic bias and should be overturned. They hope the U.S. Supreme Court will do this.\n\nColorado Supremes say the law should stand regardless of its ugly history.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the case against Dougco has its own ugliness.\n\nAt least eight of the schools \u201cdiscriminate on the basis of religious beliefs or practices,\u201d wrote Justice Monica Marquez.\n\nThe program also allows private schools to discriminate against students with disabilities. One school has an AIDS policy that allows it to expel HIV-positive students. Another school lists homosexuality as a cause for termination in its teacher contract.\n\nThe argument has been made that taxpayer money isn\u2019t going to these schools, that it is going to students. Under that notion, schools receiving state-subsidized funds can be as bigoted and exclusionary as they want, as long as the money is passed through.\n\nThat is a hollow argument and one that the state Supreme Court thankfully saw through.\n\nE-mail Jeremy Meyer at jpmeyer@denverpost.com.
