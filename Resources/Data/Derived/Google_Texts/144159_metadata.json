Finally, the GOP took control of the Senate and set a record for the number of seats it controlled in the House of Representatives.\n\nAs we all know, it did not take the Republicans long to blow it.\n\nA month after its incredible victory, the GOP squandered its mandate, surrendering to the Democrats. The GOP led House of Representatives did not proclaim its mandate and hold off on major decisions until the Republican majority in the Senate was sworn in. No, they went to the GOP position of preemptive surrender and gave President Obama and the Democrats almost everything they wanted.\n\nDespite the pleas and demands from the base, the GOP did nothing to stop Mr. Obama\u2019s executive amnesty. They even rewarded left wing billionaires who had spent millions to keep the Democrats in power by extending so-called \u201cGreen Energy\u201d subsidies.\n\nThe architect of the Republican surrender was House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nMr. Boehner has no love for the tea party. The feeling is mutual.\n\nIn 2010, Mr. Boehner loved the tea party. Why not? The previous two elections had looked like Custer\u2019s last stand for the GOP, except that Custer fared better than the Republican Party had.\n\nThe Republicans were on the political endangered species list and Mr. Boehner embraced the tea party as his only hope. As soon as he was in office, the tea party was simply a part of the Republican Party to be ignored.\n\nMr. Boehner made the obligatory statements about cutting spending and reducing Obamacare. Yet time after time, when the occasion called for him to stand and fight, he chose surrender.\n\n2014 is almost over and 2015 is almost here. The first order of business for the House of Representatives in 2015 is to elect a new Speaker of the House.\n\nIt cannot be John Boehner.\n\nMr. Boehner is already lining up the agenda for 2015. It includes amnesty. It includes meaningless votes to block Mr. Obama\u2019s executive amnesty but as with all of those Obamacare repeal votes, nothing will happen. Mr. Boehner\u2019s agenda includes more crony spending for the chamber of commerce and perhaps the biggest special interest giveaway of all, trying to ram the Trans Pacific Partnership treaty through, via \u201cFast Track\u201d legislation.\n\nHere is one simple message for the Republicans. The people who put you in office are not the chamber of commerce lobbyists. They are not the special interest cronyist groups that show up, pump your hand and write you a campaign check.\n\nThe people who put you in office are the rank and file conservative voter. Many of these people support the tea Pparty movement.\n\nAnd the people are tired of the Republican games in Washington.\n\nFor years, conservatives have talked about taking over the Republican Party. The Republicans give lip service to conservatives then go back to their big spending ways. In fact, it is hard to see much difference between the two parties.\n\nIf the Republicans re-elect John Boehner as speaker, it sends a message to the conservative base. It tells members of the tea party that the GOP thinks they should be neither seen nor heard. The GOP thinks they should only show up every two years to help Republican candidates and then let the party bosses decide what is best after that.\n\nNo more.\n\nIf the GOP re-elects Mr. Boehner, then it is time for a new conservative political party.\n\nMr. Boehner is the poster child for a Republican Party that believes in government of the special interest, by the special interest and for the special interest. Mr. Boehner is not interested in what is best for real Americans, only what is best for the lobbyists who come through his door and their clients.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nThis is a line in the sand.\n\nIf the Republicans prove once again it will be business as usual, then it is time for conservatives to find a new political home.\n\nLet\u2019s see how well the Republican Party fares without the base that Mr. Boehner and his friends so despise.", "article_metadata": {"description": "2014 turned out to be the year the Republican Party had long waited for.
