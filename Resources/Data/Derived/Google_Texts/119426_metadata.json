"Concentrated economic power, combined with fee-for-service incentives, has made healthcare \u201cthe least consumer-friendly\u201d U.S. industry and enabled arbitrary and capricious price gouging, according to the man behind Time magazine's notorious \"Bitter Pill\" investigation.\n\nSteven Brill, a lawyer, media entrepreneur and journalist, told health insurance professionals at AHIP\u2019s Operations and Technology Conference this week that while the country's longstanding problem of inadequate healthcare access may be solved by the Affordable Care Act, he thinks the law will at best make only modest gains towards its namesake principle of affordability.\n\nBrill said health insurers must contribute more to the goals of transparency and accountability \u2014 in part because they helped create the reimbursement system that\u2019s led to such a dysfunctional healthcare market, and in part because the ACA may do little to resolve the discontents of consolidated provider markets.\n\n\u201cHow will having eight insurance companies help if there\u2019s only one hospital?\u201d Brill asked, critiquing one of the ACA\u2019s main policy goals, competition among insurers.\n\n\u201cTo me it was amazing that in hundreds of small and midsize towns and cities, the American healthcare market has transformed tax-exempt nonprofit hospitals into the largest profit centers and largest employers,\u201d Brill said.\n\nConnecticut\u2019s Stamford Hospital \u201cis actually a larger business than the city of Stamford itself,\u201d and it saw a 12-percent profit margin last year, according to Brill. \u201cNot bad for a nonprofit.\u201d\n\nUnchecked market power has potentially terrible impacts on the most vulnerable among us, Brill said, like the underinsured small business owner he profiled in \"Bitter Pill,\" who was charged $13,000 for a first round of chemotherapy that costs hospitals a few thousand dollars to buy and pharmaceutical companies a few hundred dollars to manufacturer.\n\nBut it\u2019s not so much the people as the system and its incentives that are the problem. \u201cIf you give good people unaccountable power,\u201d Brill said, \u201cthey just get used to it and take advantage of it, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened in the healthcare economy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s starting to change with accountable care and value-based reimbursement, and with patients having to spend more and more of their paychecks on premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\n\nBut Brill thinks the architects of the ACA and the Obama Administration largely punted on the problem of costs by avoiding a few key issues. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that they looked to two paths, controlling costs or expanding coverage,\u201d and they went with expanding coverage.\n\nThere\u2019s still significant reform needed on drug pricing and medical malpractice, he noted. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to be giving CT scans to anyone who walks into an ER and says the word \u2018head,\u2019\u201d Brill said.\n\nAnd if the individual mandate was controversial, \u201cYou could imagine big corporations and trial lawyers getting together to block tort reform.\u201d\n\nTransparency, though, could be an antidote to the inertia in policy making, Brill said, and not just in healthcare.\n\nHe made that point while testifying at the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year, recommending that during congressional hearings and debates C-SPAN show the campaign contributions to each lawmaker from the industries being affected by (or benefiting from) the legislation.\n\nRichard Burr, a Republican senator from North Carolina, asked Brill: \u201cAre you implying that any member of this body would make any decision on policy based on campaign contribution.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Brill replied, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be transparent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url":
