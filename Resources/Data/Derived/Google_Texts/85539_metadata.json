But there was plenty hanging in the balance during this off-year cycle, mostly through a vast spectrum of different ballot initiatives.\n\nThere was some good, a lot of bad, and some downright ugly.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe big winner was good government reform. In Maine and Seattle\u2014quite literally from coast to coast\u2014voters approved groundbreaking measures that work to curb the influence of big money and special interests and empower small donors. Maine voters passed Question 1, which bolsters funding to the state\u2019s Clean Election program, increases transparency of outside spending, and enhances enforcement of campaign-finance violations.\n\nSeattle voters approved the Honest Elections initiative with 60 percent support. The measure creates a public campaign-funding system that gives residents $100 \u201cdemocracy vouchers\u201d to give to candidates while also strengthening campaign-finance restrictions.\n\nRedistricting reform also scored a major victory yesterday. Ohio overwhelmingly passed an initiative that restructures the state\u2019s redistricting process from a hyper-partisan process to one that requires bipartisan cooperation. Such reforms work to reduce the political gerrymandering of districts, of which Ohio has plenty.\n\nAdditionally, in San Francisco, voters approved a proposition that will crack down on secret lobbying by increasing disclosure requirements. Advocates said the measure was an attempt to curtail the practice in which companies like Airbnb would fund outside groups to do their lobbying.\n\nThe leftward movement of America\u2019s cities continued apace. In Salt Lake City, voters elected Jackie Biskupski, an openly gay Democrat, as their mayor. Democrat Joe Hogsett was elected mayor in Indianapolis. By the Prospect\u2019s count, that means 26 of America\u2019s 30 largest cities will have Democratic mayors come January.\n\nFor more on how cities and states are getting proactive on campaign-finance reform, read my feature from the Prospect\u2019s fall issue.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThere were a number of measures across the country that would have unilaterally increased wages for workers. But yesterday was not particularly good day for the labor movement. Most all of the labor initiatives failed. Why? A lack of strong organizing, and maybe a touch of overzealousness.\n\nIn September, the city council in Portland, Maine, increased the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. But Fight for 15 supporters wanted to take it further, pushing to get a measure on the ballot that would gradually increase the minimum to $15. Opponents, mostly from the business community, sounded the alarm that the increase would be too much, too fast. And in one of the clearest rejections of $15, 57 percent of voters denied the increase. The initiative\u2019s failure could give credence to those who argue for a more nuanced approach to minimum-wage increases, with a focus on local economies rather than a one-size-fits-all movement.\n\nTacoma had two dueling (and rather confusing) minimum-wage initiatives on the ballot. One called for a $15 minimum wage for businesses that brought in more than $300,000 in annual revenue. The second, more modest, measure (which was backed by the city council) called for a gradual increase to a $12 minimum for all workers in the city. Ultimately, more voters approved the across-the-board $12 minimum than the selective $15, so $12 it will be.\n\nIn Spokane, on the other side of the state, voters also rejected an ambitious measure that would have established a workers bill of rights\u2014a minimum-wage increase, equal pay for equal work, wrongful termination protections, and giving workers rights precedence over corporations. Resoundingly, 62 percent of voters opposed the plan. The initiative\u2019s backers blame a well-funded opposition campaign orchestrated by local businesses.\n\nHowever, the measure appears to have lacked robust support from organized labor and a strong organizing infrastructure.\n\nTo put salt in the wound of the failed ballot measures, Tea Party conservative Matt Bevin beat labor-backed Democrat Jack Conway for Kentucky\u2019s governorship. Unions had thrown their political weight against Bevin because he has pledged to turn Kentucky into a right-to-work state and threatened the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. Kentucky is one of the two remaining Southern states that are not right-to-work. Bevin\u2019s path to pass such legislation, however, will be more difficult since Democrats were able to maintain their control of Kentucky\u2019s House of Representatives.\n\nThe Downright Ugly\n\nReligious conservatives came out in droves in Houston to overturn a nondiscrimination ordinance that protected the rights of the LGBTQ community, thus killing the strongest such protection in the South. As Adele M. Stan wrote yesterday for the Prospect, conservatives used fear-mongering\u2014posing the whole thing as \u201cdisturbed\u201d men being allowed to use women\u2019s restrooms\u2014to build opposition to the ordinance. \u201cWhile not the most nuanced approach,\u201d Stan writes, \u201cthe right-wing bathroom barrage was ingenious in using fear to obscure the range of hatreds it represented.\u201d\n\nWhile it may be tempting to see yesterday\u2019s election as a sneak peek at what to expect in 2016, turnout is always low (except for older, whiter conservatives) during off-years. And the failures of the minimum-wage initiatives is not necessarily a condemnation of the Fight for 15 movement, but rather a reminder that strong on-the-ground organizing around such measures is crucial.
