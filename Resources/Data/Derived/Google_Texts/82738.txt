In his Friday column, the New York Times’ Paul Krugman argued that the economic, refugee, and terrorism crises are threatening to splinter what should become “the United States of Europe.”

Instead of banding together and facing these crises from a position of strength, the European Union foisted the cost of bank bailouts onto national governments, exacerbating the financial crisis; left the management of borders to national governments instead of instituting a union-wide policy, exacerbating the refugee crisis; and left antiterrorism initiatives up to national governments instead of imposing policies that were effective across all member nations, exacerbating the terrorism crisis.

“Imagine how New Yorkers would feel if political paralysis in New Jersey were getting in the way of any effective antiterrorist policy there,” Krugman wrote, “and you have a good idea of the problems Belgium has created for France.”
