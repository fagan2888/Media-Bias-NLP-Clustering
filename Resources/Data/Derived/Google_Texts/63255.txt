Hillary Clinton’s campaign is in the holiday spirit, bashing Republicans with a new Dr. Seuss-esque video that likens the GOP to the infamous Grinch.

The video, which includes rhyming narration and a Christmas tune, is titled “How the Republicans Steal Progress,” and is clearly based on Seuss’ famed “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.”

It hits Donald Trump, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for their stances on Planned Parenthood, Obamacare and immigration.

“American families like progress a lot. But the Grinches in GOPville, it seems they do not. Together they shout with great grinchy zeal, that on healthcare their plan,” the narrator says before several of the candidates are shown saying “repeal.”

The same wordplay is used to take on the Republicans’ stance on Planned Parenthood.

“Now if that weren’t enough to leave you all stunned. Take their stance on Planned Parenthood,” the narrator says before the video shows Bush and New and Jersey Gov. Chris Christie saying “defund.”

It’s not the first time someone has put Christmas-themed rhyming to use against Republicans. Last week Jimmy Fallon wrote a children’s book titled ”Winners Aren’t Losers” for Trump after the leading Republican candidate abruptly canceled an earlier appearance.

Trump played along during the bit, but there’s no doubt he won’t be as amicable about Clinton’s ad.
