(Published Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2013)\n\nDespite the government shutdown, Obamacare is open for business -- sort of.\n\nIt\u2019s the first day uninsured Americans can sign up for health care under the new law. But, NBC5 discovered the government website, healthcare.gov, wasn\u2019t working properly.\n\nWebsite Overwhelmed on Day One of ACA\n\nTuesday was the first day uninsured Americans can sign up for health care under the new Affordable Care Act, but the government website and local clinics have been overwhelmed with enrollment. (Published Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2013)\n\nMore than a million North Texans don\u2019t have health insurance. Many went to clinics like Los Barrios Unidos in Dallas to sign up, only to find out the website is down.\n\n\u201cRight now, I don\u2019t have the money to pay for it,\u201d says Gloria Cervantes. The mother of three can\u2019t afford insurance. That could change with the Affordable Healthcare Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be cheaper, less expensive, and I really need it,\u201d says Cervantes.\n\nOn the first day of online open enrollment, an error message appeared: \u201cWe have a lot of visitors on our site right now and we\u2019re working to make your experience better. Please wait here until we send you to the login page. Thanks for your patience!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised at all we've had a lot of interest, a lot of questions. I'm not surprised at all. I'm actually happy that there's so much interest. That a lot of people are actually trying to apply,\u201d says Los Barrios Unidos Community Clinic CEO, Leonor Marquez Cantu.\n\nWorkers at Los Barrios Unidos are going with the flow, signing up patients with paper applications and helping them understand the options.\n\nIn DFW, there are up to 53 plans to choose from with different levels of deductibles and copays all based on income.\n\n\u201cWe actually can't enroll if the site is down, but we can still assist people through the process manually,\u201d says Marquez Cantu.\n\nFor people who haven't been able to afford healthcare or have been denied because of preexisting conditions, the new law provides hope and access to care.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to get her checkups and I'm going to pay less,\" says Cervantes.\n\n\u201cHaving coverage will be a lot better for them, not just for their clinic visit here, if they need specialty care or hospital care, it'll be so much better for them to have coverage,\u201d says Marquez Cantu.\n\nFor people who sign up for insurance, benefits begin as early as January 1.\n\nTexas hospitals, clinics and charities are helping the uninsured enroll in health care exchanges after Gov. Rick Perry declared the state government would do as little as possible to help implement the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTexas is one of 27 states that did not set up its own health insurance exchange because of Republican opposition to the plan.\n\nTexas did not expand Medicaid to the working poor, so millions will remain uninsured.\n\nFind more coverage of the Affordable Care Act in our Special Section.\n\nCopyright Associated Press / NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas hospitals, clinics and charities are gearing up to help uninsured Texans enroll in health care exchanges.", "title": "Massive Demand as Obamacare Opens for Texans", "og": {"site_name": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth", "description": "Texas hospitals, clinics and charities are gearing up to help uninsured Texans enroll in health care exchanges.", "title": "Massive Demand as Obamacare Opens for Texans", "url": "http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Texas-Health-Care-Exchange-Relying-on-Feds-225967281.html", "image": "http://media.nbcdfw.com/images/1200*675/ObamaCare.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Texas hospitals, clinics and charities are gearing up to help uninsured Texans enroll in health care exchanges.", "title": "Massive Demand as Obamacare Opens for Texans", "url": "http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Texas-Health-Care-Exchange-Relying-on-Feds-225967281.html", "image": "http://media.nbcdfw.com/images/1200*675/ObamaCare.png?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcdfw", "site": "@nbcdfw", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 79562228021}, "keywords": "federal, obamacare, affordable, care, act, medicaid, texas, exchange", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/nbcdfw"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "federal, obamacare, affordable, care, act, medicaid, texas, exchange"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd57a\"", "article_summary": "(Published Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2013)More than a million North Texans don\u2019t have health insurance.\nRick Perry declared the state government would do as little as possible to help implement the Affordable Care Act.\nTexas is one of 27 states that did not set up its own health insurance exchange because of Republican opposition to the plan.\nIt\u2019s the first day uninsured Americans can sign up for health care under the new law.\nFind more coverage of the Affordable Care Act in our Special Section."}
