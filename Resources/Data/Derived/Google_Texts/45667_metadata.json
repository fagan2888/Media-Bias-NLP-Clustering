Apparently, Justice Antonin Scalia was a law school Whiz Kid about 50 years and 50,000 cocktails ago, and finds it hard to accept that lesser minds are not obliged to agree with him.\n\nFor his part, Chief Justice John Roberts turned political prognosticator in his dissent to Obergefell v. Hodges, the decision legitimizing gay marriage. \u201cStealing this issue from the people,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwill for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept.\u201d\n\nOPINION\n\nFollow @csteditorials\n\n// <![CDATA[\n\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');\n\n// ]]>\n\nGranted, if all you had to go by was the sky-is-falling rhetoric of Republican presidential candidates and their theological allies, you might think Roberts had a point. But he doesn\u2019t, partly because the Supreme Court ruling won\u2019t bring about dramatic social change at all. It merely affirms social changes that have already happened.\n\nBut hold that thought, because political handicappers at the New York Times argue that same-sex unions could be the best thing that ever happened to the GOP. Not because millions of outraged religious conservatives will stampede to the ballot boxes, but because. . . . Well, here\u2019s the headline: \u201cAs Left Wins Culture Battles, GOP Gains Opportunity to Pivot for 2016.\u201d\n\nFormer Bush speechwriter David Frum believes that the gay marriage fight is over. \u201cEvery once in a while,\u201d he told reporter Jonathan Martin, \u201cwe bring down the curtain on the politics of a prior era. The stage is now cleared for the next generation of issues. And Republicans can say, \u2018Whether you\u2019re gay, black or a recent migrant to our country, we are going to welcome you as a fully cherished member of our coalition.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSure, Republicans could say that. If Republicans were in the habit of dealing with reality, that is. Frum, a Canadian Jew who became a U.S. citizen in 2007, may be forgiven a bit of wishful thinking. Ever since getting pushed out of the American Enterprise Institute for saying Republicans were foolish not to negotiate Obamacare with the White House, he\u2019s been trying to persuade Republicans to act more like British Tories.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how today\u2019s GOP rolls. On the party\u2019s evangelical right, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was breathing smoke and fire. A Baptist preacher, Huckabee indulged in a bit of ecclesiastical wordplay, denying that the Supreme Court could do \u201csomething only the Supreme Being can do \u2014 redefine marriage.\u201d He denounced the ruling as a \u201cblow to religious liberty, which is the heart of the First Amendment,\u201d and vowed to defy it.\n\nIn this, Huckabee echoed Rev. Ronnie Floyd, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, who even before the Supreme Court ruling had vowed that, \u201cas a minister of the Gospel, I will not officiate over any same-sex unions or same-sex marriage ceremonies. I completely refuse.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t that brave of him? However, do you really suppose it\u2019s possible that Floyd, Huckabee and the rest of the hyperventilating GOP candidates fail to understand that all churches have an absolute First Amendment right to their own beliefs and practices? They\u2019re bravely refusing to perform ceremonies that nothing in this nor any imaginable Supreme Court decision would require of them.\n\nIf your church refuses to sanctify same-sex marriages (as mine certainly does), that\u2019s its unquestioned right. For that matter, the Catholic Church also refuses to marry previously divorced couples, or even admit them to communion \u2014 an absurdity to me, but not a political issue.\n\nNothing in the Supreme Court ruling changes those things. It\u2019s about marriage as a secular legal institution: two Americans entering into a contract with each other. Period.\n\nThat\u2019s why Bloomberg View\u2019s Jonathan Bernstein is right and Justice Roberts is wrong about same-sex marriage causing long-lasting social resentment. Marriage, he writes, is \u201ca done deal,\u201d and the issue will soon be relegated to \u201chistory books alongside questions of whether women should vote or alcohol should be prohibited.\u201d\n\nLoving v. Virginia, the 1967 decision invalidating miscegenation laws, was accepted almost immediately. Bernstein points out that in states such as Massachusetts and Iowa, where same-sex unions have been legal for years, they\u2019re no longer controversial.\n\nBecause it\u2019s really none of your business, is it, who loves whom? And it has zero effect on you personally. So grow up and get over it. In time, as Bernstein says, most people will.\n\nShorter term, however, millions of aggrieved GOP voters appear to have gotten the First Amendment upside down. They won\u2019t easily be dissuaded. Feeling besieged by the mainstream culture, they\u2019re encouraged by the Huckabees, Cruzes and Santorums of the world to believe that they\u2019re being persecuted because they can\u2019t make everybody else march to their drumbeat.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 problem is that to most Americans, that\u2019s the antithesis of religious liberty, and a surefire political loser.\n\nEmail: eugenelyons2@yahoo.com\n\nFollow the Editorial Board on Twitter: Follow @csteditorials\n\nTweets by @CSTeditorials// <![CDATA[\n\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+\"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");\n\n// ]]>", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/csteditorials\">Follow @csteditorials</a></p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/gene-lyons-why-the-gop-has-the-first-amendment-upside-down/", "site": "@suntimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Gene Lyons: Why the GOP has the First Amendment upside down"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282828", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Weather and More", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/gene-lyons-why-the-gop-has-the-first-amendment-upside-down/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "title": "Gene Lyons: Why the GOP has the First Amendment upside down"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf26\"", "article_summary": "Gene Lyons: Why the GOP has the First Amendment upside downFollow @csteditorials// <!\nBut he doesn\u2019t, partly because the Supreme Court ruling won\u2019t bring about dramatic social change at all.\nNothing in the Supreme Court ruling changes those things.\nShorter term, however, millions of aggrieved GOP voters appear to have gotten the First Amendment upside down.\nThey\u2019re bravely refusing to perform ceremonies that nothing in this nor any imaginable Supreme Court decision would require of them."}
