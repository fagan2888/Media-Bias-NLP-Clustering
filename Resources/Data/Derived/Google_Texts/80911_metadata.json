It\u2019s a music festival.\u201d\n\nThis wry but apt joke delivered by HARD founder Gary Richards (aka DJ Destructo) in the notorious promo video announcing the 2015 event has never been more apparent than this year.\n\nSince the inaugural HARD event back in 2007, Richards and his squad have made it a decided point to craft lineups that not only dig deep into the dance music underground and current zeitgeist, but also stacked them with crowd-pleasing hip-hop acts to deliver a diversity and edge rarely found in similarly BPM-powered fests.\n\nThis year, HARD Summer scored a coup by landing The Weeknd to top the first night\u2019s bill, along with dance music legends The Chemical Brothers next to young rap sensations like Rae Sremmurd and breakout U.K. synth-pop heroes Years & Years among the dozens of scheduled acts.\n\nThe Weeknd Debuts New Song 'Mood Music 2' During Intimate U.K. Show: Watch\n\nSet this year in the sprawling Fairplex in Pomona, Calif., the opening day of HARD Summer 2015 was not without its hiccups, but still provided plenty of highlights over the course of the festival\u2019s first day of music.\n\n4:10 p.m.: Emerging British dance-poppers Years & Years are 20 minutes late taking the HARDer outdoor stage, but make up for it with a charming and engaging set of their signature moody synth-driven songs. Lead singer Olly Alexander is sporting a fresh shock of bleached blond hair and is in strong voice as he leads the trio (augmented by a live drummer) through tracks like \u201cShine,\u201d \u201cDesire\u201d and their biggest U.S. hit, \u201cKing.\u201d With their debut album, Communion, already topping the U.K. charts, Years & Years seem more than ready to make an impact here in the States.\n\n5:22 p.m.: Inside the sweltering Purple Stage (which, like the Green and Pink stages, are set in large freestanding buildings), a sweaty fan says he\u2019s on the verge of passing out, despite draining three water bottles, which he holds up for inspection. While Sweater Beats is still playing, the crowd starts chanting \u201cYoung Thug,\u201d who was originally scheduled to go on at 5:10. Apparently, they hadn\u2019t seen his message on Twitter early in the day explaining that due to \u201cunforeseen circumstances\u201d he wouldn\u2019t be performing. By the time the following act, Giraffage, takes the stage, the message is received as dejected Young Thug fans stream toward the exits.\n\n6:09 p.m.: British duo Gorgon City is serving up classic \u201890s garage and poppy house, energizing the sun-drenched mob at the HARDer Stage with melodious hits like \u201cReady for Your Love\u201d and \u201cGo All Night.\u201d Announcing it\u2019s their first show with a live band, singer Lulu James shines with her strong vocals and engaging stage presence.\n\nTwo Women Die at Hard Summer Festival 2015 of Suspected Overdoses\n\n6:51 p.m.: \u201cTotal buzzkill, dude,\u201d mutters a disgruntled fan at the main stage when Schoolboy Q still hasn\u2019t taken the stage despite a scheduled 6:25 start time. While diehards hold out hope, a noticeable number of them start drifting toward the exits to see what else is going on.\n\n6:56 p.m.: A huge contingent has shown up to see Odesza, with the Seattle duo returning the favor with a charged-up set of their dreamy, danceable pop songs including \u201cSay My Name\u201d and remixes augmented with the occasional trap drop to keep the crowd on their toes.\n\n7:07 p.m.: \u201cIt is not my fault why I came onstage late,\u201d Schoolboy Q gripes to the crowd when he finally appears wearing a bright green dashiki and a sad face. \u201cIt\u2019s my management\u2019s fault, my DJ\u2019s fault and the people who run the band\u2019s fault. I\u2019m having a very bad day, so I need y\u2019all to cheer me up,\u201d he explained before launching into \u201cCollard Greens.\u201d Running through his hits \u201cHands on the Wheel\u201d and \u201cStudio,\u201d the rapper salvages what\u2019s left of his set time, and despite his dour mood gets the sizable crowd of fans who waited it out to bounce along to his beats.\n\n7:55 p.m.: Originally billed as \u201cDJ Question Mark,\u201d the surprise act on the main stage was DJ Snake, who turned up the delighted masses with a whiplash set of high-energy party hits, tearing through builds and drops with abandon. Mixing songs at lightning speed, snippets of Flosstradamus\u2019 \u201cMoshpit\u201d and Valentino Khan\u2019s \u201cBloodsucker\u201d were among the whirlwind of tracks he hurled at the crowd.\n\n8:12 p.m.: The Weeknd\u2019s breakout year marches on, with R&B\u2019s new star pulling one of the biggest and most fired-up audiences of HARD Summer\u2019s opening day to the relatively intimate confines of the HARDer Stage. Sound issues are noticeable from the start of his set, with pockets of the crowd chanting \u201cLouder!\u201d Rolling out fan favorites like \u201cHouse of Balloons/Glass Table Girls,\u201d \u201cThe Morning\u201d and Drake collaborations \u201cCrew Love\u201d and \u201cThe Zone,\u201d the audience energy explodes with newer songs \u201cThe Hills\u201d and especially \u201cCan\u2019t Feel My Face,\u201d which adds an entirely new wrinkle to The Weeknd\u2019s sexually-charged show. The moment is so electric that his set-ending Fifty Shades of Grey hit \u201cEarned It\u201d feels almost anticlimactic.\n\n9:10 p.m.: Porter Robinson is eliciting all of the feels on the main stage with his future-retro video game soundtracks, drawing heavily from his latest album, Worlds, with tracks like \u201cSad Machine\u201d and \u201cFlicker,\u201d complete with plenty of pyrotechnics and full-on fireworks.\n\n9:23 p.m.: The bass line of Rae Sremmurd\u2019s \u201cNo Type\u201d can be heard blasting from an overstuffed Purple Stage, with a mob of fans clamoring around the building unable to get in due to capacity.\n\n9:34 p.m.: Dance music OGs the Chemical Brothers set it off with \u201cHey Boy Hey Girl,\u201d charging through a blistering and dynamic set that stands out among the day\u2019s most satisfying sets. Picking through their extensive catalog, founding member Tom Rowlands (Ed Simons is not performing on this tour) fires up Chems classics \u201cOut of Control,\u201d \u201cSetting Sun\u201d and \u201cStar Guitar\u201d from behind banks of gear and fog machines and particularly dazzling visuals. They also drop in new songs from the recently released Born in the Echoes album, including \u201cGo\u201d and \u201cEML Ritual.\u201d\n\n10:27 p.m.: Hometown hero/Snapchat star/meme master Dillon Francis packs the main stage area for the last set of the night, mixing a slew of massive Moombahton tracks to his faithful flock that dance and crowd-surf to every drop. Grabbing the microphone, he tells his fans, \u201cI\u2019m playing all of this Moombahton for you.\u201d Cranking out fan favorites like \u201cNot Butter\u201d and surprises like a remix of The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Feel My Face,\u201d he pumps so much bass through the system that the speakers toward the back of the crowd cut out during his set. The crowd\u2019s energy doesn\u2019t diminish at all, and the first day of HARD Summer 2015 ends on a high note.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Set this year in the sprawling Fairplex in Pomona, Calif., the opening day of HARD Summer 2015 was not without its hiccups, but still provided plenty of highlights over the course of the festival\u2019s first day of music.", "title": "HARD Summer 2015 Day 1 Recap: The Weeknd, Chemical Brothers & More Highlight Opening Night", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6649538/hard-summer-2015-day-1-recap-the-weeknd-chemical-brothers", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/the-weeknd-hard-summer-festival-2015-billboard-650.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Set this year in the sprawling Fairplex in Pomona, Calif., the opening day of HARD Summer 2015 was not without its hiccups, but still provided plenty of highlights over the course of the festival\u2019s first day of music.", "title": "HARD Summer 2015 Day 1 Recap: The Weeknd, Chemical Brothers & More Highlight Opening Night", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6649538/hard-summer-2015-day-1-recap-the-weeknd-chemical-brothers", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/the-weeknd-hard-summer-festival-2015-billboard-650.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Set this year in the sprawling Fairplex in Pomona, Calif., the opening day of HARD Summer 2015 was not without its hiccups, but still provided plenty of highlights over the course of the festival\u2019s first day of music.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "HARD Summer 2015 Day 1 Recap: The Weeknd, Chemical Brothers & More Highlight Opening Night | Billboard"}, "article_summary": "The crowd\u2019s energy doesn\u2019t diminish at all, and the first day of HARD Summer 2015 ends on a high note.\n\u201cHARD Summer is not a rave.\nTwo Women Die at Hard Summer Festival 2015 of Suspected Overdoses6:51 p.m.: \u201cTotal buzzkill, dude,\u201d mutters a disgruntled fan at the main stage when Schoolboy Q still hasn\u2019t taken the stage despite a scheduled 6:25 start time.\nThe Weeknd Debuts New Song 'Mood Music 2' During Intimate U.K. Show: WatchSet this year in the sprawling Fairplex in Pomona, Calif., the opening day of HARD Summer 2015 was not without its hiccups, but still provided plenty of highlights over the course of the festival\u2019s first day of music.\nThis year, HARD Summer scored a coup by landing The Weeknd to top the first night\u2019s bill, along with dance music legends The Chemical Brothers next to young rap sensations like Rae Sremmurd and breakout U.K. synth-pop heroes Years & Years among the dozens of scheduled acts."}
