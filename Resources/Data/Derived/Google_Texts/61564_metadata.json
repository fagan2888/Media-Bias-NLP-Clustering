(Mario Anzuoni/Reuters)\n\nAfter months of remaining largely above the partisan fray \u2014 and often appearing cautious to a fault \u2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton has begun taking more risks and landing some punches against Republicans.\n\nThe more aggressive posture comes as Clinton has suffered an erosion in her public image, with more potential voters saying they view her unfavorably than at any point since she entered the 2016 race and fewer people saying they find her trustworthy.\n\nThat trajectory and the drumbeat of news about Clinton\u2019s unorthodox e-mail system when she was secretary of state have frayed some Democratic nerves and have fueled speculation that Vice President Biden may see a path to challenge the long- \u00addominant candidate.\n\nIt also comes as her biggest rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), is drawing crowds of 10,000 or more in the country\u2019s most liberal bastions \u2014 underscoring Clinton\u2019s enduring weakness within the party\u2019s progressive base.\n\nClinton\u2019s stepped-up tempo has included almost daily attacks on the better-known contenders among the wide Republican field, particularly billionaire front-runner Donald Trump and former Florida governor Jeb Bush.\n\n1 of 47 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Clinton on the campaign trail View Photos Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton has hit the ground running, visiting several states on her quest to become the Democratic nominee for president.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) \u2014 of her policy reversal on U.S. relations with Cuba.\n\nThe Clinton team mounted a preemptive spin campaign ahead of last week\u2019s maiden Republican debate and then invited reporters covering her to watch the two-hour debate at Clinton\u2019s Brooklyn headquarters.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all so out of touch, it\u2019s hard to choose\u201d a favorite among the 10 Republicans on the debate stage, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook joked partway through the event.\n\nThe week before, Clinton caught Bush off guard with a strong denunciation of his positions on Medicare, the Affordable Care Act and voting rights as he waited offstage to address the same civil rights forum. In the following days, she critiqued Trump, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas governor Rick Perry by name.\n\n[Jeb Bush draws fire for suggesting \u2018women\u2019s health issues\u2019 are overfunded]\n\nThat elbows-out approach was out of character for the careful, no-false-moves operation Clinton has built as the Democratic front-runner. The strategy is aimed in part at answering one of Democratic activists\u2019 regular complaints about Clinton: that despite posturing as a fighter, she has rarely taken the gloves off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say it and another to really do it,\u201d said Scott McLean, a professor of political science at Quinnipiac University, whose national poll is among those that have charted the erosion of Clinton approval levels that once appeared invincible.\n\nClinton has struggled to tamp down long-standing worries on the left that she is too close to powerful interests on Wall Street and in Hollywood. But her efforts now are also aimed at more moderate Democrats concerned that her early pace was too placid or regal.\n\nShe did little to dispel the image of privilege by spending the night of the Republican debates raising money in Hollywood and posing for a picture with reality television star Kim Kardashian.\n\nFormer House speaker and Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich said that Clinton is vulnerable and that the Democrats look like \u201ca gerontocracy.\u201d\n\nClinton is 67; Sanders and Biden are in their 70s.\n\nThe debate left him feeling good about the Republicans\u2019 chances next year, Gingrich said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty optimistic. We have a lot of work to do, but we\u2019re moving in the right direction,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Clinton\u2019s campaign leaders insist they are not running scared, her allies say the new injection of energy is partly an effort to counter negative coverage of her e-mail foibles and her falling poll numbers.\n\nHer campaign says Clinton\u2019s slide in popularity was inevitable as the well-known former secretary of state moved fully into the role of a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get nicked up a bit\u201d over a long campaign, chief strategist and pollster Joel Benenson told reporters Wednesday. \u201cThis is a marathon, not a sprint.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s favorability rating shrank from 44 percent to 37 percent between June and July, according to an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released last week. Other surveys show similar drops and indicate her lead over Sanders has eroded.\n\nAides say attention to such numbers obscures the unfavorable ratings for Republicans and the fact that Clinton leads every Republican contender in national head-to-head matchups. A new WMUR-University of New Hampshire poll, however, puts Bush, Walker and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) one or two points ahead of Clinton in that state \u2014 a statistical tie that is bad news for her.\n\nClinton\u2019s lead over Republicans nationally and over the rest of the Democratic field is a thin reed for a candidate with as long a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and as much time in the public eye as Clinton, McLean said.\n\n\u201cThe only thing she\u2019s got going for her is that Republicans are even more unfavorable and untrustworthy\u201d in national polls, McLean said.\n\nThe launch of a $2 million advertising campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire last week was not an emergency response to a drop in support in those early voting states, Benenson said.\n\n\u201cOh, no, not at all,\u201d Benenson said during a telephone briefing that was itself an example of the campaign\u2019s new posture. Anticipating a barrage of attacks on Clinton at Thursday\u2019s GOP debate, the campaign had offered Benenson for preemptive spin. \u201cThese ads have been in the works,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a story to be told.\u201d\n\nThe gauzy biographical spots strike a very different chord than Clinton\u2019s partisan jibes on the stump and her comebacks on Twitter. Republicans are not mentioned. The ads retrace themes of hard work and middle-class striving that Clinton struck when she entered the race in April and cast her as a champion for working people and families.\n\nThe campaign chose to run the ads now because it raised enough money to do so, another senior aide said. Clinton brought in more than $45 million between April and July. The campaign had set a threshold of about $35 million to begin ads, said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe aspects of campaign strategy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true she is playing more offense,\u201d said one campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy.\n\nThe shift reflects a sense that the time is right to draw attention to what the Clinton team sees as Republican policy positions that are out of step with public opinion, the official said. Clinton has begun regularly criticizing her opponents on same-sex marriage, immigration, and access to abortion and reproductive health care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just gearing up. It\u2019s more active and more aggressive,\u201d the official said, as the campaign begins to move past the phase of laying out Clinton\u2019s policy positions one by one.\n\n\u201cThis is an important time right now. They are getting a lot of attention, and we don\u2019t see any evidence that the attention is helping them,\u201d the official said of Republicans. \u201cWe see evidence the attention is hurting them and their brand. Trump has contributed to that.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s attacks will be limited to Republicans for now, the campaign official and other Clinton allies said.\n\nThe first Democratic debate is scheduled for October.\n\nThe audience for the tougher language is both Democratic primary voters and general-election voters, according to the campaign, although it is plain that reassuring politically active Democrats that Clinton will scrap with Republicans is a major motivation.\n\nThe campaign has been holding outreach meetings with select groups of supporters to discuss the attack strategy against Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe want independent voters and general-election voters to mark these moments and have them seep into the public consciousness as much as you can do in August,\u201d when the election is still more than a year away, the campaign official said.\n\n\u201cAnd we want to have Democratic voters see her doing this, see that she has prosecuted the case against Republicans very effectively.\u201d\n\nKaren Tumulty contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic front-runner is taking some risks and is landing some punches against GOP rivals.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/anne.gearan", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Democratic front-runner is taking some risks and is landing some punches against GOP rivals.", "title": "Facing an eroding image, Hillary Clinton goes on offense against GOP", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/after-months-of-caution-and-slipping-poll-numbers-clinton-goes-on-offense/2015/08/09/e2447744-3ca9-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/08/09/Interactivity/Images/crop_2962015-08-07T005409Z_01_MA512_RTRIDSP_3_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@agearan"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/after-months-of-caution-and-slipping-poll-numbers-clinton-goes-on-offense/2015/08/09/e2447744-3ca9-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/anne.gearan"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "e2447744-3ca9-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc7b\"", "article_summary": "(Mario Anzuoni/Reuters)After months of remaining largely above the partisan fray \u2014 and often appearing cautious to a fault \u2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton has begun taking more risks and landing some punches against Republicans.\nTrump has contributed to that.\u201dClinton\u2019s attacks will be limited to Republicans for now, the campaign official and other Clinton allies said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true she is playing more offense,\u201d said one campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy.\nThe first Democratic debate is scheduled for October.\nAnticipating a barrage of attacks on Clinton at Thursday\u2019s GOP debate, the campaign had offered Benenson for preemptive spin."}
