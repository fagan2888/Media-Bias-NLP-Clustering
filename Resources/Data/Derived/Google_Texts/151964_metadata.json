Big-time TV newsmen, especially Cronkite (\u201cthe most trusted man in America\u201d) didn\u2019t put their credibility on the line by crossing over into make-believe. And especially not at CBS News, where Cronkite, despite his own eagerness to accept this invitation from a hit sitcom, had to gain approval from the news division\u2019s president, a legendary stickler for journalistic purity.\n\nBy contrast, in the modern world of TV news where Brian Williams rose and fell, almost anything goes.\n\nBut not quite anything, to judge from NBC\u2019s decision, announced Thursday, to remove Williams permanently from the \u201cNightly News\u201d anchor desk for straying into make-believe while on the talk-show circuit. (Though banned from \u201cNightly\u201d for inflating his journalism exploits, he still is deemed sufficiently trustworthy to anchor breaking news and special reports on MSNBC, demonstrating that, at NBC News, the definition of \u201ctrustworthy\u201d is fluid).\n\nUnlike in Cronkite\u2019s day, TV journalists today routinely turn up on comedies and dramas (Netflix\u2019s political thriller \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d is a favorite gathering place) as well as on talk shows, where they heartily promote themselves and their respective news brands. And no one was more active, and adept, at this than Williams, a go-to guy for talk shows including \u201cLate Show with David Letterman,\u201d \u201dThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d and \u201cLate Night with Seth Meyers,\u201d for comedies including \u201cFamily Guy\u201d and \u201c30 Rock,\u201d for \u201cThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart,\u201d plus \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d where, as guest host, he zestfully embraced his inner ham.\n\nPurists might have complained that Williams\u2018 busy sideline as a silver-tongued TV personality gnawed away at his newsman gravitas. But it greatly enhanced his likeability quotient while arguably winning him new viewers as the chief truth-teller for NBC News, which, in turn, could boast \u201cOUR anchor is more charming than THEIRS!\u201d\n\nFor a long time, trust - so vital in the news equation - was a given with Williams. Certainly it was from his standpoint: He placed trust in the hands of his audience, who were trusted to draw a clear distinction, even as it eroded, between Serious Brian and Brian Lite. Unfortunately, this was a distinction Williams lost sight of. The anchor who reported on wars for NBC News got caught fudging his own war stories on \u201cLate Show\u201d and elsewhere.\n\nWhen Briangate erupted in February, \u201cDaily Show\u201d host Stewart defined the trap ensnaring Williams as the \u201cInfotainment Confusion Syndrome,\u201d a brain misfire that occurs, he said, \u201cwhen the \u2018celebrity cortex\u2019 gets its wires crossed with the \u2018medula anchor-dala.\u2019\u201d\n\nA shrewd diagnosis. After work, away from the anchor desk, Williams let his ego get \u201cthe better\u201d of him, he admitted to Matt Lauer during Friday\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d interview. \u201cTo put myself in a better light, to appear better than I was, I said things that were wrong. I told stories that were wrong.\u201d\n\nFor a long time, Williams gleamed bright as an all-purpose TV star, working both sides of the street as a serious newsman and a witty raconteur. Then, almost overnight, the public\u2019s trust in him hit a wall. According to one survey, he was the 23rd most trustworthy person in the country before his deceptions became known. Then his ranking plummeted to 835. The man who cracked jokes on talk shows was suddenly a punch line.\n\nNow, as he faces second-string status with his August return, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess if Williams can rid himself of what he called \u201ca bad urge inside me,\u201d if he can ever be taken seriously again.\n\n\u201cBrian now has the chance to earn back everyone\u2019s trust,\u201d said Andrew Lack, chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, on Thursday.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, NBC has the chance to earn back everyone\u2019s trust. Lester Holt, in his new role as what the network hopefully bills as \u201cpermanent anchor,\u201d must prove himself immune to Infotainment Confusion Syndrome. He must keep in mind that, with the current trust-challenged state of TV journalism, reporting the news is all that\u2019s required. He must, if asked, resist the urge to slow-jam the news with Fallon.\n\nFortunately, Holt is on the right track after four months temping at \u201cNightly News\u201d and now taking over for the man who couldn\u2019t resist.\n\n\u2022 EDITOR\u2019S NOTE - Frazier Moore is a national television columnist for The Associated Press.
