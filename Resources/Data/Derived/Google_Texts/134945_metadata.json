No one will bully me from taking on the FDA. I will continue to fight the EPA when they try to hold Florida to higher water standards than any state in the country, and I will join with other states to fight against the NLRB (National Labor Relations Board) when they tell a company like Boeing, who's in a union state, that they simply can't expand to a right-to-work state.\"\n\nThat several year-old case involved Boeing wanting to leave Washington state for South Carolina \u2014 an issue that has nothing to do with the Sunshine State.\n\nOn a roll, the attorney general then abruptly announced, \"This 'war on women'? I am so sick and tired of it,\" before calling out Republican women like Dana Young and Sandy Murman who stood behind her, as well as national Republicans like New Mexico Governor Susanna Martinez and New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte.\n\nFormer Governor Bush followed Bondi, where he disparaged Charlie Crist, saying, \"We have a candidate running for governor who\u2019s a great yapper. A great talker. My mother probably wouldn\u2019t want me to say this, but his name is Charlie Crist. All he does is talk. He doesn\u2019t act. He doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t believe in anything other than his own ambition.\"\n\nBush then laid out some of Rick Scott's accomplishments as governor. \"He has done each and every day what he said he was going to do,\" then added, \"Normally that means a guy gets re-elected.\"\n\nIf it was just about job creation, Rick Scott would be a shoo-in, as the economic numbers are starkly better under his watch than when Charlie Crist was governor. But the national and worldwide economy played a huge role in that, and Scott has had to work himself out of being in the mid to upper 30's in popular approval ratings to get where he is right now \u2014 in a dead heat, according to virtually every poll taken on the gubernatorial race.\n\nBush then went admittedly \"off the beaten path\" to advocate for a Republican U.S. Senate. Perhaps it's because he's been making the argument while criss-crossing the nation campaigning for Republicans, or that he's serious about a potential White House run in 2016, but the former governor grew animated in talking about how dysfunctional Washington is, and how a GOP Senate with a GOP House could show Americans that the Republicans are ready to govern again responsibly.\n\n\"The Republicans aren\u2019t the party of no. Harry Reid is just following the orders of Barack Obama who would prefer to use executive authority that he or may not have,\" Bush said. \"Instead of doing what should be done in a democracy which is building consensus, forging consensus, trying to find common ground with people that don\u2019t always agree, we\u2019ve lost that ability because of President Obama\u2019s complete disinterest in doing so, and his lapdog Harry Reid has made it harder and harder.\"\n\nNo mention was made of the Republicans' considerable role in blocking consensus.\n\nAlthough tomorrow is Election Day, the campaigning continues, with Texas Governor Rick Perry joining his good friend Rick Scott at a lunchtime appearance in West Tampa at noon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two Florida GOP rock stars, Pam Bondi and Jeb Bush, made their way to Tampa's Ybor City Monday afternoon in a last bit of campaigning before Tuesday's gene...", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "http://r3.cltampa.com/files/base/scomm/cltampa/image/2014/11/960w/_2.jpg", "site_name": "Creative Loafing: Tampa Bay", "description": "Two Florida GOP rock stars, Pam Bondi and Jeb Bush, made their way to Tampa's Ybor City Monday afternoon in a last bit of campaigning before Tuesday's gene...", "title": "Pam Bondi defends her fight against the feds at an Ybor City rally"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "7ehqC5TVlujj_KkCw_cMXSyKukkqxKv9SOkcxE1CbCI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd51fc\"", "article_summary": "Two Florida GOP rock stars, Pam Bondi and Jeb Bush, made their way to Tampa's Ybor City Monday afternoon in a last bit of campaigning before Tuesday's general election.\nAlthough tomorrow is Election Day, the campaigning continues, with Texas Governor Rick Perry joining his good friend Rick Scott at a lunchtime appearance in West Tampa at noon.\nBondi kicked it off by first making the case for Rick Scott, then segued into highlighting her work as AG in eliminating pill mills and combating human sex trafficking.\nFormer Governor Bush followed Bondi, where he disparaged Charlie Crist, saying, \"We have a candidate running for governor who\u2019s a great yapper.\nIf it was just about job creation, Rick Scott would be a shoo-in, as the economic numbers are starkly better under his watch than when Charlie Crist was governor."}
