Most of the stoops and entry courtyards were occupied by a handful of people \u2014 mostly women but also men \u2014 immersed in discussion, drawing passersby to stop and listen.\n\nSaturday\u2019s gathering was called \u201cBetween the Door and the Street,\u201d initiated by the artist Suzanne Lacy in collaboration with the Brooklyn Museum and Creative Time, a non-profit organization that presents and commissions public art projects. Ms. Lacy, who is based in Los Angeles, is known for holding large-scale projects described as \u201csocially engaged art.\u201d\n\nShe said that Creative Time had invited her to stage the project to \u201cexplore the relationship between gender justice, feminism and other activist movements, particularly those led by activists in the [New York City] area.\u201d For her, folks chatting on a stoop was the right artistic vehicle.\n\n\u201cFor me, the project aspires towards an egalitarian society, one where diversity is respected and people are empathic toward the situations of others,\u201d Ms. Lacy added.\n\nMore than 300 participants from 80 activist and social organizations were recruited for the event on Park Place (between Vanderbilt and Underhill Avenues), with the aim of reflecting diversity in terms of age, ethnicity, gender and gender identification. Ms. Lacy said that each group decided on which topic to address during the unscripted conversation, which ranged from poverty to gender equality to violence against women.\n\nAs for why she wanted to hold the conversations on stoops, Ms. Lacy noted that stoop-sitting has a \u201cstrong tradition\u201d in the city, and that \u201cit seemed a metaphor for redeveloping a sense of community and relationality to each other through conversation.\u201d\n\nWhile New Yorkers are used to accidentally overhearing conversations while going about their daily routines, \u201cBetween the Door and the Street\u201d encouraged attendees not only to eavesdrop, but to stay and ruminate on what they were hearing.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s kind of gorgeous is taking private issues and making them public,\u201d said Michelle Fine, 59, a CUNY professor who served on the project\u2019s advisory board. \u201cThat is, having the conversations that are often had alone, in one\u2019s apartment or one\u2019s head \u2026 and taking it outside and having those ideas circulate.\u201d\n\nPeople were often spotted leaning in very closely to the stoops, as sometimes it was difficult to hear the conversations. But in doing so, that often created a greater intimacy and connection between those who spoke and those who listened.\n\nFarah Tanis, 41, of Brooklyn, who served as a stoop leader for the group representing Black Women\u2019s Blueprint, a non-profit group, said that she felt and fed off of the audience\u2019s energy.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing to see that the crowd was looking and nodding as we said words like \u2018rape\u2019 and \u2018sexual assault\u2019 and \u2018rape culture\u2019 and accountability and responsibility,\u201d Ms. Tanis said.\n\nWhile she said she enjoyed the experience, she said that the next step would be for the conversations to occur in communities that needed it.\n\n\u201cWe need to go to communities where \u2026 people are highly impacted by sexual violence and poverty and criminal justice abuse,\u201d Ms. Tanis said. \u201cSo this as an idea is brilliant. But let\u2019s take it to communities that are desperate for it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "On a crisp fall day in Brooklyn, a hundred conversations were emanating from tree-lined Park Place in Prospect Heights.", "title": "In Brooklyn, Stoops as Scenes of Change", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/10/21/in-brooklyn-stoops-as-scenes-of-change/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AB558_nystoo_G_20131021093633.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "In Brooklyn, Stoops as Scenes of Change", "description": "On a crisp fall day in Brooklyn, a hundred conversations were emanating from tree-lined Park Place in Prospect Heights.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Carrie Melago", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "On a crisp fall day in Brooklyn, a hundred conversations were emanating from tree-lined Park Place in Prospect Heights.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-21T15:24:04-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/10/21/in-brooklyn-stoops-as-scenes-of-change/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-18841", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "On a crisp fall day in Brooklyn, a hundred conversations were emanating from tree-lined Park Place in Prospect Heights.", "title": "In Brooklyn, Stoops as Scenes of Change", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/10/21/in-brooklyn-stoops-as-scenes-of-change/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AB558_nystoo_G_20131021093633.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-18841", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-21T15:24:13-04:00"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe need to go to communities where \u2026 people are highly impacted by sexual violence and poverty and criminal justice abuse,\u201d Ms. Tanis said.\nBy Kirthana RamisettiOn a crisp fall day in Brooklyn, a hundred conversations were emanating from tree-lined Park Place in Prospect Heights.\n\u201cFor me, the project aspires towards an egalitarian society, one where diversity is respected and people are empathic toward the situations of others,\u201d Ms. Lacy added.\n\u201cIt was amazing to see that the crowd was looking and nodding as we said words like \u2018rape\u2019 and \u2018sexual assault\u2019 and \u2018rape culture\u2019 and accountability and responsibility,\u201d Ms. Tanis said.\nMs. Lacy said that each group decided on which topic to address during the unscripted conversation, which ranged from poverty to gender equality to violence against women."}
