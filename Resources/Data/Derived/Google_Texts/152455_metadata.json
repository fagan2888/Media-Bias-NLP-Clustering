At ages 4 to 5, white children where the shortest on average, but by ages 10 to 11, Asian children were shortest as a group.\n\nAt ages 10 to 11, there was an average height difference of 0.66 in (1.6 cm) between boys and of 0.5 in (1.2 cm) between girls in the least and most-deprived neighborhoods.\n\nBlack children showed the least difference in height between the most- and least-deprived neighborhoods, followed by Asian kids. In fact, black girls ages 4 to 5 in the most deprived areas had a slightly higher average height compared to those in the least deprived areas. White boys and girls showed the greatest height differences between rich and poor.\n\nHancock said that more research is needed to explain the findings, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that this is a single study rather than a total look at the evidence and it is an association that may be confounded by a whole range of factors.\u201d\n\nMisha Eliasziew, a biostatistician in the Department of Public Health and Community Medicine at Tufts University Medical Center, pointed out that placing different ethnicities into one group could weaken the results.\n\nShe also noted that grouping children by neighborhood wealth is a less precise way of measuring than if the study had looked at individual families\u2019 level of deprivation. Measuring nutrition, hygiene and access to medical care, which all contribute to children\u2019s growth, would also be important, said Eliasziew, who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"We know that malnutrition contributes to stunting and that stunting has negative long-term consequences. But . . . stunting is apt to be far more than a half inch to one inch,\u201d she said by email.\n\nEliasziew said parents should not be worried by the study results. \"These are one-half inch differences. Even the height difference between boys and girls is minute (approximately 1 cm = less than one-half inch).\u201d\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1Qilgcw Archives of Disease in Childhood, online September 4, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "height, differences, children, poor, rich", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A study of British children finds that slight height differences track with deprivation, especially among white kids, with children in poor neighborhoods standing up to two-thirds of an inch (1.6 centimeters) shorter than those in rich areas.", "title": "Small Height Differences Among Kids May Reflect Economic Disparities", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/small-height-differences-among-kids-may-reflect-economic-disparities-354260", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/24/height-differences.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A study of British children finds that slight height differences track with deprivation, especially among white kids, with children in poor neighborhoods standing up to two-thirds of an inch (1.6 centimeters) shorter than those in rich areas.", "title": "Small Height Differences Among Kids May Reflect Economic Disparities", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/small-height-differences-among-kids-may-reflect-economic-disparities-354260", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/24/height-differences.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/24/height-differences.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-24T14:52:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-24T14:52:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A study of British children finds that slight height differences track with deprivation, especially among white kids, with children in poor neighborhoods standing up to two-thirds of an inch (1.6 centimeters) shorter than those in rich areas."}, "article_summary": "Black children showed the least difference in height between the most- and least-deprived neighborhoods, followed by Asian kids.\nOverall, heights varied by ethnicity, with the black children tending to be tallest, on average, at both age points.\n\"These are one-half inch differences.\nWhite boys and girls showed the greatest height differences between rich and poor.\nAt ages 4 to 5, white children where the shortest on average, but by ages 10 to 11, Asian children were shortest as a group."}
