Here\u2019s how it\u2019s happening, and how it might impact the Forty Acres.\n\nThe House and Senate have to pass a bill to fund the federal government. Which, while rather fundamental-sounding, seems to be a sticking point for many members of Congress. If they can\u2019t agree on a funding scheme, the federal government shuts down on October 1. At the moment, they\u2019re slap-fighting and speechifying about funding (or not funding) the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.\n\nNot every government function would screech to a complete stop, but hundreds of national parks, museums, passport offices, and yes, the Department of Education are likely to shutter their offices.\n\nWhy would Congress dance so close to the edge of closing all those doors? Partisan fights have overshadowed the debates over basic government-funding bills in recent years, forcing Congress to pass very short-term stopgap measures called continuing resolutions. The last one was passed in March. With that resolution set to expire on September 30, the House passed a new resolution that stripped funding from ObamaCare, a move that neither the Democratically-controlled Senate nor the President himself is likely to accept. The Senate would prefer to pass one with the ObamaCare funding, which then has to be reconsidered by the House.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why we have ourselves a showdown and, possibly, a shutdown.\n\nIf it happens, it won\u2019t be that bad immediately for higher education. \u201cNo one knows for certain,\u201d says Bill Shute, the UT System\u2019s vice chancellor for federal relations, \u201cbut the impact should be minimal.\u201d He says the shutdown could still be avoided, and notes that while functions at the federal level may slow, higher education as we know it will not grind to a halt.\n\nNew applications for research funding and financial aid may stall during the shutdown, but existing funding schemes will continue to flow. Research funding, for example, is usually funded a year in advance. So, while the shutdown will mean certain federal employees will be placed on leave, and headaches will certainly ensue, the sum of the damages is likely to be low. Before a narrowly-avoided 2011 shutdown, the Chronicle of Higher Education looked back to the longest previous cessation of services, in 1995:\n\nDuring that 21-day shutdown, which spanned late 1995 and early 1996, federal contractors and servicers weren\u2019t paid, and questions submitted to the Education Department went unanswered. New regulations were postponed, and federal audits and program reviews were suspended. But three months after the shutdown ended, \u201cany trace of it had pretty much disappeared\u2014like water poured into sand,\u201d said Terry W. Hartle, vice president for government and public affairs for the American Council on Education.\n\nShute agrees, saying existing programs will continue relatively smoothly, unless of course you urgently need to call a furloughed Department of Education employee. \u201cIf it\u2019s already in place,\u201d he says, \u201cit won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Current indications point to a shorter shutdown, if any.\n\n\u201cBy late Sunday,\u201d he predicts, \u201cwe should know more.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the shutdown that\u2019s worrying experts. It\u2019s what might happen after. Even if Congress avoids or quickly ends the shutdown, lingering fiscal quarrels are likely to slow, confound, or otherwise annoy higher education administrators and officials over the coming weeks. Congress is likely to only pass a stopgap spending measure\u2014one that will fail to alleviate the sequester cuts impacting financial aid and research funding. And there\u2019s more. Here\u2019s Inside Higher Ed\u2018s Michael Stratford:\n\nCompounding the problem further are negotiations over raising the debt ceiling, which the Treasury Department says the government will hit on October 17. If the government were to run out of money to pay its obligations, higher education advocates worry that federal student aid and research funding would take a hit as the government chooses which bills to pay. \u201cNobody comes out of any these debates and bills and says, \u2018we did a great job\u2019,\u201d said Jonathan Fansmith, the associate director of government relations at the American Council on Education, lamenting the uncertainty surrounding short-term temporary funding compromises and stopgap measures. \u201cThere\u2019s no good policy being made, it\u2019s simply a sort of triaging of problems month to month, year to year.\u201d\n\nPhoto courtesy Ken Lund via Flickr Creative Commons.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government is poised\u2014once again\u2014to shut down many services if Congress can\u2019t agree on a plan to keep the lights on.
