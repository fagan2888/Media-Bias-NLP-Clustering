By granting Wheaton College's request, the court indicated that its decision does not dictate the outcome of litigation involving dozens of nonprofit groups.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, employers must provide health insurance policies that cover preventive services for women, including contraception and sterilization.\n\nThe administration had already crafted a compromise for religious-affiliated nonprofits that allows them to \"self-certify\" to their insurance carriers in a form that they object, on religious grounds, to providing contraception coverage. But various nonprofits, including Wheaton, said the act of signing the form also infringed on their religious rights.\n\nThe court said in its order that the college could instead send a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to state its religious objections. Employers would still be able to obtain contraceptive coverage via their health plans, the court said.\n\nThe court reached a similar outcome in January in a case brought by an order of Roman Catholic nuns called the Little Sisters of the Poor.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan. Sotomayor said the college had failed to meet the requirements for an injunction, adding that \"thinking one's religious beliefs are substantially burdened \u2013 no matter how sincere or genuine that believe may be \u2013 does not make it so.\"\n\nThe unsigned order said the court's action \"should not be construed as an expression of the court's views on the merits.\"\n\nReuters", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Supreme Court awards Wheaton College temporary exemption on Obamacare birth control", "date": "2014-07-03", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Reuters", "author": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "The\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0gave Wheaton College a temporary exemption from birth control coverage required by President\u00a0 Barack Obama 's health reform law, days after ruling that for-profit employers can opt out for religious reasons.", "title": "Supreme Court awards Wheaton College temporary exemption on Obamacare birth control", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-supreme-court-wheaton-college-birth-control-20140703-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53b5da3c/turbine/chi-supreme-court-wheaton-college-birth-control-20140703", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp04.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/80715179", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "obamacare, Wheaton College, exemption, birth control", "news_keywords": "obamacare, Wheaton College, exemption, birth control", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "The Supreme Court gave Wheaton College a temporary exemption from birth control coverage required by Obamacare, days after ruling that for-profit employers can opt out for religious reasons."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80c4\"", "article_summary": "The Supreme Court gave Wheaton College a temporary exemption from birth control coverage required by President Barack Obama's health reform law, days after ruling that for-profit employers can opt out for religious reasons.\nThe unsigned order said the court's action \"should not be construed as an expression of the court's views on the merits.\"\nBy granting Wheaton College's request, the court indicated that its decision does not dictate the outcome of litigation involving dozens of nonprofit groups.\nBut various nonprofits, including Wheaton, said the act of signing the form also infringed on their religious rights.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, employers must provide health insurance policies that cover preventive services for women, including contraception and sterilization."}
