Gregory Kehoe, Murgio's lawyer, did not immediately to requests for comment.\n\nAny plea secured in the case could mark a breakthrough for authorities investigating the hacking of JPMorgan, which compromised information in 83 million household and small business accounts.\n\nU.S. and Israeli authorities arrested four people in Israel and Florida in July in connection with two separate fraud schemes.\n\nWhile the cases appeared distinct and made no mention of the JPMorgan hacking, a person familiar with the matter has said both actions stemmed from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigation of the cyberattack.\n\nIn one indictment, U.S. authorities accused Murgio and Lebedev, both of Florida, of operating an underground bitcoin exchange, called Coin.mx, that was used to facilitate criminal activity including cyberattacks.\n\nIn another indictment, authorities accused three men of engaging in a stock manipulation scheme involving U.S. penny stocks.\n\nIn that case, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, both Israeli nationals, were arrested, and the U.S. government has sought their extradition.\n\nJoshua Samuel Aaron, a U.S. citizen who resides in Moscow and Tel Aviv, remains at large, authorities have said.\n\nThe case is U.S. v. Murgio, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-mj-02508.\n\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Christian Plumb)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S.", "title": "U.S. prosecutors in talks with second suspect tied to JPMorgan hack", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/14/US-prosecutors-talks-second-suspect-tied-JPMorgan-hack", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/jpmorgan-fraud_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/14/US-prosecutors-talks-second-suspect-tied-JPMorgan-hack", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/jpmorgan-fraud_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3e4\"", "article_summary": "The filing used language that is typically indicative of plea talks, though cases sometimes also can be resolved with deferred prosecution agreements or with charges being dropped.\nU.S. and Israeli authorities arrested four people in Israel and Florida in July in connection with two separate fraud schemes.\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have disclosed they are in discussions to resolve a case against a second Florida man linked to a massive data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co, after saying they are engaged in similar talks with his co-defendant.\nThe case is U.S. v.
