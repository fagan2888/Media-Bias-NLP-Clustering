From Scott Brown’s June 25 Facebook post advocating Advocare

PHOENIX—Elizabeth Warren mocked Scott Brown, who she defeated in 2012, at the Netroots Nation conference of progressive activists here Friday.

“That guy who was senator from Massachusetts five years ago sends around shirtless pictures of himself and sells diet pills,” she said. “Seriously!”

Such a personal shot is uncharacteristic for the Massachusetts Democrat. But Brown has become a punchline for Democrats since he moved to New Hampshire and then lost a challenge last year to Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.

In the past few weeks on Facebook, Brown began aggressively promoting Advocare, to which he attributed his “sudden weight loss.” Brown denied that he was a paid spokesman for the product, but he is listed as a distributor on the company’s web site.

Brown fired back at Warren, saying he was more effective at shepherding legislation through Congress than she was.

“If you compare our legislative records, you will find she has none,” the Republican said in a Facebook message to The Washington Post. “By working in a bi-partisan manner, I was able to pass the Stock Act, Hire a Hero Veteran’s Bill, the Crowdfunding Bill, the Arlington Cemetery Bill, the 3 percent withholding and many more. Her lack of character and accomplishments speaks volumes.”

Warren’s joke came amidst a broader riff about how much progress the left has made since she came to her first Netroots convention in 2010, from consumer protection to the Affordable Care Act, gay marriage in all 50 states and Confederate flags coming down.

“That’s a lot of change,” she said.
