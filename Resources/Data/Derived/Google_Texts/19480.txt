Sioux Falls, SD

Hundreds of volunteers gathered by an entrance at Arrowhead Park Saturday as police conducted a search for a missing woman. The friends, family and co-workers of Pam Kneip did what they could to bring the Sioux Falls realtor home.

"Thanks for the public that came out and assisted and helped. It definitely helps to bring this to a conclusion for the family and everyone that was involved," Captain Rich Miller said.

It wasn't the conclusion people wanted to hear. Kneip's vehicle was found in the park early Saturday afternoon prompting a search. A police officer found her body around 3 p.m. The attitude at the park turned from hope to sadness when volunteers found out Kneip died.

At this point, Miller says Sioux Falls Police don't expect foul play.

"There's nothing suspicious about the death that we found at this time. It is still under investigation at this point," Miller said.

Her family says she suffered from a serious heart condition that requires medication. Her death will be felt across the area, especially in the real estate field.

President of the Realtors Association of the Sioux Empire Brandon Martens talked with KELOLAND News while Kneip was still missing.

"Pam is a very outgoing person. Always there when you need her, always had a smile on her face. I would call her, I previously was in the same office as her and she lit up the room when she walked into a room," Martens said.

Many of the people who knew her came out to find her but all they discovered was heartbreak.

Kneip worked as a real estate with her husband, Greg. The 49-year-old went to school in South Dakota, studying at both SDSU and USD.

She also graduated from Lincoln High School in Sioux Falls.
