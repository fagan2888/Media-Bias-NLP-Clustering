we don't turn anyone away.\"\n\n\"We worry about the sustainability of this Catholic health ministry over time if we don't create the public policy that's necessary for us to take care of every man, woman and child in a very dignified way.\"\n\nA key goal of the conference, Tersigni observed, is \"to raise health-care quality throughout the world,\" with a special focus \"on the dignity and respect for human life, as well as to provide environments that are safe, high-quality and very low cost.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Head of U.S. Catholic health-care system addresses urgent concerns. \n\tVATICAN CITY \u2014 The president\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "Head of U.S. Catholic health-care system addresses urgent concerns.", "title": "Doctor Warns That HHS Mandate Puts Religious Identity at Risk", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/doctor-warns-that-hhs-mandate-puts-religious-identity-at-risk/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Tersigni.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/doctor-warns-that-hhs-mandate-puts-religious-identity-at-risk/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Tersigni.jpg", "description": "Head of U.S. Catholic health-care system addresses urgent concerns.", "card": "summary", "title": "Doctor Warns That HHS Mandate Puts Religious Identity at Risk"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register, catholic social teaching, health care, hhs mandate, religious frreedom, vatican city", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0fb\"", "article_summary": "\"So we differentiate ourselves,\" he continued, adding that the requirements of the HHS mandate threaten Ascension's status as a religious organization.\nAscension Health is a nonprofit Catholic health-care system directed by the Church that seeks to offer care and assistance to those most in need.\nTersigni is the president and chief executive officer of Ascension Health in the United States, as well as the president of the International Committee of Catholic Health Care Institutions at the Vatican.\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 The president of the leading Catholic health-care system in the U.S. said that the requirements of the HHS mandate are a great threat to the company\u2019s ability to continue serving those most in need.\n\"As an American health-care system,\" Tersigni explained, \"we continue to work very closely with the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops\" in finding a resolution to the concerns which the mandate poses."}
