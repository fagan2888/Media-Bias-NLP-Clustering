It has not been the best recovery, and we are not quite back to normal, but for the first time in years all signs are pointing in a positive direction.\n\nAnd that\u2019s despite all the blows \u2013 perceived and real \u2013 inflicted by both Republicans (government shutdown) and Democrats (the disastrous rollout of the Affordable Care Act) in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe almost burst free of the black hole of the great recession, if only the federal government had not added to uncertainty,\u201d said Dennis Delay, an economist at the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies.\n\nThat said, the recovery has been and still is very uneven. Yet companies are expanding. Exports are rebounding. People are buying houses again, and at higher prices. Fewer are losing homes and businesses. Indeed, businesses are making enough money that they have had to fork over nearly 9 percent more in taxes to the state.\n\nAnd, slowly but steadily, companies are hiring. The unemployment rate \u2013 a seasonally adjusted 5.1 percent in November \u2013 is more than a half-percent lower than last year, with the private sector adding more than 5,000 jobs for the month.\n\nBut those positive numbers mask some negatives, as economists point out.\n\nDelay said New Hampshire\u2019s \u201csluggish\u201d growth lags behind other states, and we won\u2019t hit our pre-recession employment peak until the spring.\n\nRuss Thibeault of Applied Economic Research in Laconia points out that most of the state\u2019s economic strength is in the southern tier, Portsmouth and the Upper Valley, and about two-thirds of the job growth is in lower-paying service occupations.\n\nBut not all service occupations are low-paying. Take, for example, the 10 jobs created at Vital Design \u2013 a Portsmouth firm that helps companies with Web, search engine and social media optimization \u2013 that Zachary Gregg founded during the recession.\n\nGregg said he had hoped companies would opt to \u201ccut the cost of customer acquisition\u201d by turning to his company to replaced laid-off sales reps. They did, and the company has doubled its number of employees in two years.\n\nAnd jobs are being created in the manufacturing sector.\n\nNew Hampshire Ball Bearings, for instance, added about 160 employees at the beginning of the year at its facilities in Peterborough and Laconia, bringing its total employment to 1,250 in the Granite State. The plants here primarily concentrate on the aerospace industry, which has grown despite defense cuts, thanks to the growth of the commercial aviation sector.\n\nIn fact, the aerospace industry has been the focus of the New Hampshire International Trade Resource Center. The center \u2013 which used to have a dozen employees, but was down to one thanks to state budget cuts \u2013 received a $600,000 federal grant to bring it up to three. Coincidentally or not, the state\u2019s exports suffered during that time leading to the grant, but they rose 19 percent for the first three quarters of 2013, the biggest increase in the nation, according to Tina Kasim, the center\u2019s program manager.\n\nReal estate and construction\n\nWhat has this slow but stable growth meant for housing, which led us into the financial mess?\n\nFor one, the foreclosure crisis appears to be almost over. There were 25 percent fewer foreclosures this year, resulting in the fewest number of people losing their homes since 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, homes sales in the first 11 months are up 10.5 percent, pending sales are up 9.6 percent and prices are up 8.8 percent.\n\nThe turnaround could not have come at a better time for Matt Ajemian, who founded Granite Coast Realty in Hampton in 2009, after spending a decade working at a larger company.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t control the market,\u201d he said back then. \u201cYou work within its parameters and make sure your clients understand that.\u201d\n\nBut in 2013, Ajemian faced another kind of problem: a three-way bidding war for a downtown Portsmouth condo that eventually sold for $330,000, $2,000 above the asking price.\n\nRevenue is up 35 percent at Northcape Design Build, said Everett Pollard, whose firm specializes in renovations of the second-home market around Lake Sunapee. He cites one $2 million project, owned by a New York City area energy broker, that includes a 50-foot-long mudroom.\n\nHomes are moving around Lake Winnipesaukee as well, especially in the lower end (under $1 million), said Thibeault. There have been 145 lakefront sales thus far in 2013, close to the 2004 peak.\n\nStatewide, single-family housing permits are up 16 percent for the first three quarters of the year. There are now more than 1,400 more people employed in construction compared to the same time last year, a 7 percent increase.\n\nThe commercial real estate market has also improved, said Chris Norwood, president of NAI Norwood Group in Bedford, especially multifamily residential construction. But industrial and office construction is still flat, with some exceptions: Londonderry, near Manchester-Boston Regional Airport, has \u201ccome into its own,\u201d and there has been a spurt of growth in Epping. Both areas, not coincidentally, are accessible by a highway.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure precedes the development,\u201d said Norwood.\n\nRetail and travel\n\nPeople seem to be more willing to buy more than houses. \u201cPsychologically, people are feeling more optimistic, pulling the trigger for the engagement,\u201d said Bellman of Bellman\u2019s Jewelers. \u201cA lot of people in long-term relationships kept on putting it off.\u201d\n\nMore home sales means more furniture sales too. \u201cI definitely have seen an upswing,\u201d said Goodrich of Top Furniture.\n\nThe North County has been the hardest-hit region in the state, but now, with a resurgence in the second-home market, opening of the new federal prison and the Burgess biomass plant in Berlin, \u201cwe\u2019ve got some stability.\u201d\n\nThe sales increase wasn\u2019t staggering, about 5 to 7 percent, she said, \u201cbut that\u2019s a lot for our area.\u201d\n\nThe opening of the biomass plant has helped the logging industry, according to Jasen Stock, executive director of the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association. \u201cLast month when I visited loggers and sawmills, it felt like we turned the corner. There is a real optimism.\u201d\n\nThere is more demand for industrial-grade pine from the Middle East. People are paying top dollar for red oak. All that means more money flowing through the more rural regions of the state just in time for the holidays.\n\nGenerally, retailers are \u201ccautiously optimistic,\u201d said Nancy Kyle, president of the Retail Merchants Association of New Hampshire, whose pre-Thanksgiving survey predicted a 4 percent increase in holiday sales. Some 58 percent said that store sales were up during the first three quarters of the year.\n\nAnd with Black Friday moved up to Thursday, there was a mad rush in New Hampshire, particularly since blue laws prevented stores in Maine and Massachusetts from joining in. But whether this early start led to increased or redistributed sales is not yet known.\n\nSnowy weather could have slowed retail sales, but that weather is a good sign for ski areas, which opened early this winter, and stayed open later last winter.\n\nThe 2012-13 season had 74 more days with snow cover compared to the winter before that, and it showed, with ski area attendance up 21 percent from the 2011-12, according to New Hampshire\u2019s Travel Barometer, compiled by the Institute for New Hampshire Studies at Plymouth State University.\n\nThe barometer also shows that there were roughly the same number of visitors to New Hampshire in the 2013 fiscal year (ending June 30), but they spent 5.3 percent more. More recent statistics indicate that trend is continuing. Hotel occupancy through October, for instance, is at 59.8 percent, only a percent higher than last year, but those visitors are spending about $3 more a day than in the first nine months of 2012. Rooms and meals tax revenue during the same three quarters is up about 4.5 percent.\n\nJeffrey Correa of Door to Door Delivery has noticed the spending trend. He also started his business \u2013 a third-party delivery service \u2013 in the middle of the recession. Business is growing, and what Correa has noticed is that the average check has increased by $20, even though many of his restaurants offer more value-priced meals.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that explains it is that people just feel like they can spend more money,\u201d he said.\n\nNot all restaurateurs agree. Tom Boucher, owner of Great NH Restaurants Inc., owner of the T-Bones, Cactus Jack\u2019s and The Copper Door restaurants, says he is making only a percent more than last year; in 2012, the company saw a 4 percent increase. He blames the uncertainty over Obamacare and the government shutdown.\n\n\u201cAll that plays into the psyche of the consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cJust eat at home tonight and save money.\u201d\n\nThose on the grocery side of the business have noticed the opposite.\n\n\u201cWe had benefited when people decided to eat at home,\u201d said John Dumais, president at New Hampshire Grocers Association. \u201cNow we see them swinging back to the restaurants.\u201d\n\nPeople are even going for higher-priced wine, said Christian Vitone, CEO of Vitone Family Wines, who started his firm selling mid-priced wines made in California, but distributed primarily to state stores from Amherst. Business has been booming \u2013 27 percent growth in 2012 and 22 percent this year \u2013 but Vitone has noticed the market is becoming more upscale, and he is offering a more exotic Petite Sirah that sells for more than $20 a bottle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big bold wine with a beautiful dark pigment,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, New Hampshire, here\u2019s a toast to a growing economy and a Happy New Year.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 357619467597909}, "description": "N.H. is not quite back to normal, but for the first time in years, all signs are pointing in a positive direction", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9af1\"", "article_summary": "Signs of economic life in New HampshireN.H. is not quite back to normal, but for the first time in years, all signs are pointing in a positive directionBy Bob SandersLooking for a sign that the recession is finally over?\n\u201cWe had benefited when people decided to eat at home,\u201d said John Dumais, president at New Hampshire Grocers Association.\nIn fact, the aerospace industry has been the focus of the New Hampshire International Trade Resource Center.\nSo, New Hampshire, here\u2019s a toast to a growing economy and a Happy New Year.\nFor Jeffrey Correa of Door to Door Delivery, also in Manchester, it\u2019s that the average check for a meal has jumped from $40 to more than $60."}
