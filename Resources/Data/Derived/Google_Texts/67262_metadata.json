He has been a Roseville resident and city employee since 1990.\n\n\"The city council has asked Acting City Manager Rob Jensen to be Roseville's next city manager, effective Jan. 1, 2016 (after Ray Kerridge\u2019s retirement on Dec. 31), and Rob has accepted, which is why the contract is on the council\u2019s agenda for consideration,\u201d city spokeswoman Megan Macpherson said in an email to the Press Tribune. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant position to be CEO of the region\u2019s only full-service city, and along with that comes the responsibility of overseeing a half-billion-dollar annual budget, 15 departments and 1,200 employees, so it\u2019s a priority for our City Council to determine who will fill that role.\u201d\n\nJensen\u2019s appointment comes with relative speed, as the city conducted a seven-month nationwide search before hiring Kerridge on June 17, 2010.\n\nKerridge had planned to retire in the near future and considered doing so last December, but uncertainty in regard to the timeline of his recovery after a vehicle accident in late June prompted an immediate decision.\n\nKerridge said in a statement last month that giving the council ample time to appoint a new city manager was a priority to him, though they did not end up needing so much notice.\n\nKerridge held the position of city manager in Roseville for five years, after leaving the same position in Sacramento. The London native retires with four decades of public service.\n\nHis tenure saw the Vernon Town Square, a new Sutter Health office and downtown traffic roundabout completed in Roseville.\n\nJensen\u2019s official capacity was changed from \u201cinterim\u201d to \u201cacting\u201d city manager at council\u2019s Aug. 5 meeting, as city regulations require council to make an appointment in the event a city manager is absent longer than three months, as Kerridge will have been.\n\nJensen\u2019s contract will start with a $255,000 annual base salary. The contract officially begins in 2016, when Kerridge\u2019s contract expires.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
