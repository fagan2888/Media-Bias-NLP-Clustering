At left is Barela's wife, Darla. ( Jenny Sparks / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nGil Barela was supposed to die six years ago.\n\nIn autumn 2007, the retired Marine, 49 at the time, began feeling unusually fatigued. Soon he started losing sensation in his legs, feet and hands. His mind was slipping, too; on one occasion he drove in circles around his Pueblo neighborhood, unable to locate his own home.\n\nWithin weeks, he found himself in a hospital bed, preparing for the worst.\n\nHe's 56 now, and has shattered his doctors' expectations.\n\nTo call Barela a survivor, however, doesn't tell the whole story. In fact, he considers himself a victim, burdened by a disease he's convinced he wouldn't have if not for years of what others have called deceit and negligence on the part of the U.S. military.\n\n'Planning for a Funeral'\n\nThe exhaustion and physical deterioration caught up to Barela one day in October 2007, when he fainted and had to be rushed to a hospital for emergency gallbladder removal. When he awoke from surgery, he found his wife, Darla, sitting next to him, crying.\n\n\"She couldn't even speak,\" Barela recalls.\n\nHe'd soon learn that his liver was all but destroyed. Doctors were reluctant to take a biopsy, for fear Barela would bleed to death.\n\nRight before Christmas, Barela was told he wouldn't live more than a week.\n\n\"I was thinking I'd be planning a funeral,\" Darla says.\n\nBarela remained at Pueblo's St. Mary-Corwin Hospital until New Year's Eve, at which point his health insurance could no longer cover his stay.\n\nOn New Year's Day 2008, Barela's 50th birthday, he weighed 166 pounds. Thirty days earlier, he'd been closer to 250.\n\nWorn out and expecting to die, he retired from the National Association of Letter Carriers, where he'd represented U.S. Postal Service labor union workers for more than 25 years. The job took him around the country for speaking engagements, and it also introduced him to Darla, herself a longtime mail carrier. The two met in Greeley after a seminar on union contracts, and they were married in 2002.\n\nGil Barela, right, and his wife Darla talk recently in their Loveland home about his battle with the Veteran's Administration regarding exposure to tainted water at Camp Lejune, N.C. (Jenny Sparks / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nBy simply reaching age 50, Barela had defied his doctors' predictions. He would spend the next 18 months in and out of doctor's appointments, and in November 2009, having sold their house, he and Darla moved to Loveland to be closer to family.\n\n\"I wanted her near them,\" Barela says, \"You know, just in case.\"\n\nWithin weeks of the move, Barela, stable but still very sick, received a letter from the IRS, urging him to contact the Marine Corps as soon as possible. He spoke on the phone with a Marine representative, who asked Barela if he was aware of any contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, the 246-square-mile military base in Jacksonville, N.C., where Barela was stationed between 1981 and 1984, working as a radio repairman.\n\nThat was the first time he'd heard of contamination on the base. Barela's Marine Corps contact told him to expect a packet in the mail, and then hung up.\n\nWaiting on the VA\n\nIn spring 2010, Barela's packet arrived. It included a questionnaire with a list of illnesses that may have been spread by Lejeune's water. Barela checked the \"liver disease\" box.\n\nHaving received his questionnaire, Barela was urged by Marine Corps officials to visit the Larimer County Veterans' Service Office in Fort Collins. It took three months before he could secure an appointment, but when he finally did, he met with a case worker who suggested filing a claim for the reimbursement of his medical costs.\n\nIt was not until July 13, 2011, when Barela, having far outlived his 2007 diagnosis, officially filed a claim with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, more commonly known as the VA.\n\nHe and Darla waited, and Barela stuck to a daily regimen that included long naps and 16 medications for a constellation of ailments. For someone suffering from terminal illness, he kept fairly busy, driving his grandchildren to school and even chairing the board of the Larimer County Fair and Rodeo, a position he holds to this day.\n\nStill, Barela says, in many respects the liver disease \"took away my livelihood.\"\n\nAdds Darla: \"People look at him and he seems OK. But they don't live with him. I'm watching him die before my eyes.\"\n\nGil Barela, right before graduating from boot camp in 1980. (Special to the Reporter-Herald)\n\nHe also devoted much of his free time to researching Camp Lejeune. It didn't take him long to locate \"The Few, The Proud, The Forgotten,\" a website with comprehensive information on all things Lejeune contamination. There, Barela found a list of more than 1,000 Lejeune veterans and family members suffering illnesses ranging from sleep apnea and chronic pain to a dozen different cancers. Reading their testimonials and browsing the site's registry, Barela began to realize what, exactly, had everyone so sick.\n\nThe Janey Act\n\nStarting in the mid-1950s and continuing until 1987, many of the approximately 1 million service members and families who lived on Lejeune bathed in and drank water contaminated with harmful, sometimes deadly chemicals, including those found in dry cleaning fluid, crude oil, pesticides and refrigerants.\n\nAs Barela would learn, the existence of these chemicals in Lejeune's water was confirmed before he'd set foot in North Carolina. In 1979, the EPA cited the base as a \"major polluter,\" with violations stemming from sewage treatment, industrial wastewater and oil discharges that had seeped into 71 of Lejeune storm drains.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the Lejeune wells containing hazardous chemicals were tested and eventually shut down. According to National Journal Editor Mike Magner, the only reason the contamination was cut off when it was is that it'd begun seeping into the water of the base's higher-ups.\n\n\"It actually took a fuel leak directly into the water system that ended up at the officers' housing. The wife of the chief of staff turned on her faucet one day and smelled gasoline,\" says Magner, who authored the recent release, \"A Trust Betrayed: The Untold Story of Camp Lejeune and the Poisoning of Generations of Marines and their Families.\"\n\nBy the time officials seriously addressed the contamination problem, it was too late for Barela and many of the hundreds of thousands of people who may have been exposed. It was too late for more than 100 children born on the base with birth defects or cancer. And, with decades-long latency periods tied to some of the contaminants, it was likely too late for many people who don't even know they were sick.\n\n\"Whole families have died from ailments caused by exposure to these chemicals,\" says Jerry Ensminger, a former Marine Corps drill sergeant who lived on Lejeune for 11 years. \"That (stuff's) criminal. There's no other way to put it.\"\n\nEnsminger co-founded The Few, The Proud, The Forgotten and has dedicated the better part of 20 years to fighting for Lejeune victims, appearing six times in Washington, D.C., to testify before the House and Senate. Like Barela and so many others, his interest in the issue developed under heartbreaking circumstances: His daughter Janey was conceived on Lejeune, and died of leukemia at just 9 years old.\n\nEnsminger had no sense that poisonous water may have caused Janey's death, but in 1997, three years after retiring from the military, he heard a local TV station report on the release of a Camp Lejeune health assessment that revealed babies born at the base had lower birth weights, a sign of other health problems.\n\n\"I dropped my plate of spaghetti when I saw that,\" he recalls. \"I thought, 'Oh my god, this could be the answer to the question that's bugged me since 1983.\"\n\nEnsminger was angry, and he was resolved to expose the military for everything it knew about Lejeune's water.\n\n\"I can't explain to you how disillusioned I was after having been somebody that carried the torch for an organization that prides itself on honor and integrity,\" says Ensminger, who still lives in North Carolina, not far from Lejeune. \"To see this kind of conduct from the leaders of that organizations was nothing short of betrayal.\"\n\nDue in large part to Ensminger's persistence, the Janey Ensminger Act was signed in August 2012 by President Obama. The measure entitles Lejeune victims suffering from any of 15 specific ailments to free medical care. Eighteen months after the Janey Act's passage, however, Barela is still waiting. Ensminger isn't surprised.\n\n\"They go through people's claims,\" he says, \"and they nitpick 'em to death. They find one little administrative flaw in there, and they deny you.\"\n\n'No other explanation'\n\nIn May 2013, nearly two years after Barela filed his claim, the VA rejected his request for medical expense compensation, and suggested something other than Lejeune's water was responsible for his liver disease.\n\nBarela appealed the ruling, and, at the suggestion of Ensminger, has had two different doctors write letters on his behalf.\n\nIn the opinion of Loveland gastroenterologist Lewis Strong, Barela \"had multiple chemical exposures to TCE, PCE, Benzene, Ethylbenzene and Xylene while in the military.\"\n\n\"There is no other explanation for his cirrhosis,\" Strong concluded, adding that toxic exposure \"contributed significantly\" to Barela's liver disease.\n\nHe's also gotten some help from the offices of U.S. Sens. Mark Udall and Michael Bennet, both Colorado Democrats. One Udall staffer told Barela his case was a \"slam dunk.\"\n\nEvidently, all the phone calls and letters on Barela's behalf have done little good. Five weeks ago, he received a letter from the VA explaining that action on his appeal \"may be delayed\" due to a high volume of claims. That letter, preformatted and impersonal, symbolizes a tragic reality: According to data shared by the office of Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., only about one in four Lejeune claims are approved.\n\nBoulder Democrat Jared Polis, Barela's representative in the U.S. House, says his staff has worked on hundreds of veteran claims, through what he describes as \"an incredibly frustrating process.\"\n\n\"I think what we need to do through the VA is have a more customer-centric agency,\" Polis adds. \"Many vets who should have earned benefits don't even bother pursuing them because it takes years of paperwork simply to get what they deserve.\"\n\nEven if his appeal succeeds, Barela knows it won't cure him, and he's at peace with that. After all, he was supposed to be dead six years ago.\n\n\"At this point, all I want are the benefits,\" he says, facing Darla and clutching a folder filled with physician notes and appeal documents. \"I want to know that my wife will be taken care of when I'm dead. I hope in the end that somebody will just fess up and say, 'We screwed up, and we're going to make it right.'\"\n\nContact Alex Burness 970-669-5050 ext. 521 or burnessa@reporter-herald.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_25505436/loveland-veterain-is-waiting-answers", "modificationDate": "2014-04-06T15:37:44-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0406/20140406_122255_SCAN0060_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Alex Burness \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "Gil Barela was supposed to die six years ago.\n\n\nIn autumn 2007, the ex-Marine, 49 at the time, began feeling unusually fatigued.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:25505436:view"}, "startDate": "2014-04-06T11:21:49-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_25505436/loveland-veterain-is-waiting-answers", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0405/20140405__06rhabarela_TEST~2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Gil Barela was supposed to die six years ago.\n\n\nIn autumn 2007, the ex-Marine, 49 at the time, began feeling unusually fatigued.", "title": "Loveland veteran is waiting for answers"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Gil Barela was supposed to die six years ago.\n\n\nIn autumn 2007, the ex-Marine, 49 at the time, began feeling unusually fatigued.", "title": "Loveland veteran is waiting for answers", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_25505436/loveland-veterain-is-waiting-answers", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0405/20140405__06rhabarela_TEST~2.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-04-06T11:21:49-0600", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2024-04-05T21:35:14-0600", "sailthru.title": "Loveland veteran is waiting for answers", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Loveland News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Alex BurnessReporter-Herald", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0406/20140406_122255_SCAN0060.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-04-06T11:24:03-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland News, Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado news, Loveland News Loveland news, Loveland News Colorado news, US Loveland News news, world Loveland News news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8edb\"", "article_summary": "At left is Barela's wife, Darla.\nWhen he awoke from surgery, he found his wife, Darla, sitting next to him, crying.\nBarela's Marine Corps contact told him to expect a packet in the mail, and then hung up.\n(Special to the Reporter-Herald)He also devoted much of his free time to researching Camp Lejeune.\n( Jenny Sparks / Loveland Reporter-Herald )Gil Barela was supposed to die six years ago."}
