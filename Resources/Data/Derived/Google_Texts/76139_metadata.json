Kay Bailey Hutchison never mentioned her successor \u2013 Ted Cruz \u2013 by name, but she blasted his attempts to derail the U.S. government by attempting to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI think that most Republicans wanted to negotiate on the issue of spending and the debt and the deficit,\u201d she said during a brief interview at the Omni Hotel in Dallas, where we ran into the former senator having lunch. \u201cI think a few people threw in an issue that you could not win. It was absolutely clear you could not win it. And as I\u2019ve said, I was voting on Christmas Eve two years ago against that bill. I did everything I could, and so did all the Republicans in Congress \u2014 every single one.\u201d\n\nShe went on to call the fight against Obamacare \u201ca mistaken strategy,\u201d and blamed Republican leadership for not getting the party back on track.\n\n\u201cThe leaders tried to lead the conference in the right direction, and if they hadn\u2019t been hijacked we would have been negotiating on what we should have been negotiating on and made progress on the real capability to succeed in lowering the debt and the deficit. Furthermore, Obamacare is falling of its own weight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to do a kamikaze mission on that, because it was taking care of itself \u2026 because it\u2019s not working. I am very glad we\u2019re not going to have a default. That\u2019s a minimal standard to clear, and we cleared it. But, honestly, I think the Republicans have learned you cant have a few outliers hijack what the leaders are trying to do.\u201d\n\nAround 10 p.m. the House is expected to vote on the Senate\u2019s deal to reopen government and avert a U.S. debt default. Cruz, who pushed for concessions over Obamacare as a condition of keeping the government running, won\u2019t stand in the way of the deal.\n\nThe likely resolution comes on the day the Houston Chronicle ran an editorial making the statewide rounds: \u201cWhy we miss Kay Bailey Hutchison.\u201d The reason: She\u2019s not Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cI was very flattered\u201d by the editorial, Hutchison said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few people send it to me. I wasn\u2019t expecting anything like that. People say they miss me \u2014 I hear it all the time \u2014 but it was surprising. And what was especially touching was where they said that while I worked for the country, I never forgot about Texas.\u201d\n\nHutchison was asked if the shutdown was a distraction for her party or something far more detrimental.\n\n\u201cI think most things that happen, even when they\u2019re wrong, can be overcome with a more positive, united effort,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t say how this will all play out. I do believe Obamacare is going to be an issue in the 2014 election, and I believe it will be positive for Republicans. And I don\u2019t think we need to throw up any more red flags on it, because it\u2019s a red flag in of itself.\u201d\n\nThe simple fact is, she said, \u201cwe negotiated on the wrong issue on the first place. And I am not blaming [U.S. Sen.] Mitch McConnell or Speaker John Boehner. I think that was always in Mitch\u2019s sights. His biggest issue is addressing this enormous debt, and he fought the good fight on Obamacare; Boehner too. I don\u2019t think we needed to throw that into this mix. We should have been negotiating on how we\u2019re going to cut spending responsibly, and that starts with entitlements.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMC9rYXktYmFpbGV5LWh1dGNoaXNvbi1ibGFzdHMtZ29wLW91dGxpZXJzLXdoby1oaWphY2tlZC1kZWJ0LWRlZmljaXQtZGViYXRlLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "On Wednesday former Sen.
