Essentially, the 22 states that have worked to implement both major provisions of the law \u2014 including setting up a state-level insurance marketplace and expanding the eligibility requirements for Medicaid \u2014 have seen their uninsured rates drop by an average of 7.1 points, about two points more than the remaining states that have not taken both steps. In some states, the uninsured rate has declined by more than 10 percentage points.\n\nThe results are consistent with multiple previous surveys that have documented a dramatic drop in the uninsured rate since Obamacare\u2019s coverage expansion started taking effect in 2013. Over the past two years, these polls have consistently found that the law is helping the low-income people and people of color who have historically lacked access to adequate insurance.\n\nAnd Gallup\u2019s new data isn\u2019t the only marker to measure the progress under the Affordable Care Act. According to several recent studies, the law is delivering results in other key areas, effectively refuting many of the dire predictions from its detractors.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association at the end of July concluded that Obamacare is successfully connecting more Americans to health services like doctors and medication. Researchers extrapolated survey data from more than 500,000 Americans and found that, since the health law took effect, more people say they have a primary care physician and fewer people say they\u2019re struggling to afford their care.\n\n\u201cThe ACA\u2019s first two open enrollment periods were associated with significantly improved trends in self-reported coverage, access to primary care and medications, affordability, and health,\u201d the researchers concluded \u2014 a point that directly contradicts Obamacare\u2019s critics, who claimed that the law would actually reduce access to health care.\n\nAnother analysis released this week from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, meanwhile, found that Obamacare didn\u2019t have an adverse effect on labor force participation or substantially increase the number of Americans working part-time jobs \u2014 which debunks the right-wing talking point that the law is a job killer.\n\nOf course, the law isn\u2019t perfect. Proponents of a single-payer system say that the ACA doesn\u2019t go far enough to insure all Americans. There are questions about Obamacare\u2019s ability to maintain affordable health care for some middle class people. Health care reform also appears to be contributing to more mergers between huge insurance companies, and it\u2019s unclear how that trend could eventually affect the public.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to ignore the evidence that it\u2019s making progress in multiple areas. Other studies examining different aspects of the Affordable Care Act have concluded that the law is helping to reduce hospital errors, to ensure Americans can pay their medical bills, and to maintain competition in the insurance market.\n\nThe data hasn\u2019t stopped Republicans in the Senate from attempting to repeal Obamacare as recently as two weeks ago, and the heated political debate surrounding health reform has shown no sign of cooling off even as the law\u2019s policies have become entrenched. But it\u2019s perhaps having a gradual impact on public opinion. Gallup also found that Americans\u2019 attitudes about the law have become more positive in recent months.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The data keeps piling up.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The data keeps piling up.", "title": "The Proof That Obamacare Is Working Is Getting Really Hard To Ignore", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/08/10/3689845/obamacare-working-research/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/10113030/AP_77259690683.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The data keeps piling up.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/10113030/AP_77259690683-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Proof That Obamacare Is Working Is Getting Really Hard To Ignore", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/10113030/AP_77259690683.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/10113030/AP_77259690683.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-10T14:43:15+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health The Proof That Obamacare Is Working Is Getting Really Hard To Ignore CREDIT: AP Photo/Carolyn KasterMore than five years after President Obama first signed his landmark health care reform law, it\u2019s becoming more difficult for critics to deny that it\u2019s accomplishing many of its major goals.\nHealth care reform also appears to be contributing to more mergers between huge insurance companies, and it\u2019s unclear how that trend could eventually affect the public.\nThere are questions about Obamacare\u2019s ability to maintain affordable health care for some middle class people.\nIn some states, the uninsured rate has declined by more than 10 percentage points.\nOn Monday, Gallup released the latest data on the uninsured rate, finding that the states that embraced Obamacare have seen the largest drops in the number of residents going without health care."}
