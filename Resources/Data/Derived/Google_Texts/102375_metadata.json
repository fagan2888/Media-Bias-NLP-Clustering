Rauner\u2019s budget proposal \u2013 a cut his administration says is necessary because of the state\u2019s dire financial picture but a move critics say could cost Illinois more money in the long run.\n\nState funding for addiction treatment programs is projected to be about $124 million in fiscal year 2015; Rauner\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2016 would cut that to about $99 million.\n\nThat kind of cut could hurt an already underserved lower-income population, said Sara Moscato Howe, CEO of the Springfield-based Illinois Alcoholism and Drug Dependence Association, a trade group that represents community-based addiction and mental health treatment providers.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got an alarming heroin epidemic right now, [and] prescription drug overdoses,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes no sense why you would not prioritize funding these services.\u201d\n\nIf Rauner\u2019s budget proposal is passed, about 7,800 fewer people across the state will be able to access substance abuse care, according to the Illinois Alcoholism and Drug Dependence Association.\n\nNumbers surrounding Gov. Rauner's proposed budget\n\nHowe said treatment programs that receive state funds can be a \u201csafety net\u201d for lower-income people with substance problems.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t have anywhere else to go that will take them,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s really the safety net.\u201d\n\nAn emailed statement from Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said the state\u2019s fiscal situation necessitates funding cuts.\n\n\u201cDue to years of out-of-control spending and irresponsible budgeting, Governor Rauner was faced with a $6 billion deficit and had to make some difficult choices,\u201d according to a statement Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly emailed RedEye. \u201cHis budget prioritizes funding to the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nYou can't do more with less. You do less with less. \u2014 Joel Johnson, president of the Human Resources Development Institute, which provides mental health and drug addiction treatment.\n\nBut drug-dependency specialists argue that their population is extremely vulnerable, and that funding cuts under Rauner as well as former Gov. Pat Quinn target their clients because they are relatively disenfranchised.\n\nJoel Johnson, president of the Human Resources Development Institute, which provides mental health and drug addiction treatment, said he knows the state is in dire budget straits, but said cutting treatment for addicts isn\u2019t the answer.\n\n\u201cCan the state continue to operate in debt? The answer is no,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the same regard, where are you going to make these cuts? \u2026 I think that we serve a population of poor, lower socioeconomic levels and otherwise disenfranchised ... [who] \u201cThe people that we serve are oftentimes the last ones people think about.\u201d\n\nAnd no matter how much funding the state allocates, addicts will still have problems, said Johnson, whose organization.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t rocket science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can cut the money in one place \u2026 but it doesn\u2019t make the need go away.\u201d\n\nState funding cuts are nothing new to advocates of addiction treatment programs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 over here,\u201d Howe said. \u201cWe really are dealing with the same situation that we have for the last eight years now.\u201d\n\nJohnson said if the new funding cuts go through, it will mean reducing his organization\u2019s capacity to provide outpatient treatment as well as residential treatment.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do more with less,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do less with less.\u201d\n\nHowe said that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened over the past few years of funding cuts.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve been cut, we\u2019ve seen the capacity in our system shrink, [and] you\u2019re going to continue to see that,\u201d she said.\n\nHowe argued that cutting treatment for funding may actually cost the state more money in the long run, since addicts who aren\u2019t helped might end up in jails and emergency rooms\u2014which can be more expensive than treatment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if by wiping those dollars out, the state doesn\u2019t have to pay for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do. They\u2019ll just have to pay for them 10, 15 times fold.\u201d\n\nKelly said that many people who need treatment for addictions are covered under the Affordable Care Act, a claim Johnson didn\u2019t dispute\u2014but he said many of his clients have \u201cessentially managed care insurance\u201d such as Medicaid, rather than private insurance via the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvocates and lawmakers have time to haggle before a budget is passed; Howe said she plans to keep in contact with legislators and Rauner\u2019s staff.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that the end budget will not be as devastating, and we also recognize that we\u2019re working with a new administration,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully moving forward, if we\u2019ve done our job, we\u2019ve also educated the governor\u2019s staff on why it\u2019s important not to let the cuts happen.\u201d\n\nmcrepeau@redeyechicago.com | @crepeau\n\nYou can find our coverage online and in print every Wednesday this year.
