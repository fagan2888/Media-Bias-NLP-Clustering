It was right there on the vital signs monitor clock: 30 minutes left to finish the patient\u2019s history and do her physical. And here she was, a real talker, expounding on the pros and cons of Obamacare. I pressed ahead with my questions about her health, not rushing her, but taking advantage of her pauses to steer the conversation in the direction of the information I needed to present in less than an hour to my supervising doctor.\n\nA classmate and I had been assigned to this patient\u2013I\u2019ll call her Mrs. G.\u2013as part of our course on the physical exam. She lay in her bed on the inpatient cardiac ward, frail under gown and blanket, an IV dribbling into her arm. We worked systematically, with lots of ground to cover. At this stage of our medical education, year two, nothing we do is for the patient\u2019s benefit. Not the barrage of questions, not the poking and prodding for findings we\u2019re only just beginning to understand. It\u2019s all for our training. We find our patients catch-as-catch can. Sometimes one of our physician teachers will ask a patient to let us perform an examination. Other times the nurses tell us which of their charges that day are the nicest, and we ask those patients to put up with us. Invariably, they do. Though sicker than sick, they generously act as guinea pigs so we can learn the skills to help our future patients.\n\n\n\nMrs. G. was hoarse but still chatty as she answered our questions about her heart problems. \u201cHave you experienced any palpitations?\u201d I asked. \u201cOnly twice. Right before I came to the hospital, and the first time I saw my husband,\u201d she deadpanned. They\u2019d been married, she said, 63 years. As my classmate and I prepared to move from taking the history to doing the physical exam, it struck me that Mrs. G. was doing me a favor\u2014allowing me to learn by practicing my budding physical exam skills on her frail form. And she was even entertaining. But I couldn\u2019t repay her with the open-ended listening she was clearly hoping for. It\u2019s starting, I found myself thinking. This is why everyone says doctors are always in a rush.\n\nShe was still talking. \u201cThey say I may go down in days,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just hoping to get to Christmas with my grandkids.\u201d\n\nIt was a mental slap on the wrist. I\u2019m running out of time? I thought. My cheeks warm, I contemplated how few hours she could have left on this earth. A few hundred, probably. If she was lucky. And yet, here she was, spending one of those hours helping me grow into a doctor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In our ongoing 'Doctor-in-Training' series, time is of the essence in more ways than one for a medical student conducting a routine physical on an elderly patient", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "In our ongoing 'Doctor-in-Training' series, time is of the essence in more ways than one for a medical student conducting a routine physical on an elderly patient", "title": "Running Out the Clock", "url": "http://time.com/16180/running-out-the-clock/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/pha289000020.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/pha289000020.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "In our ongoing 'Doctor-in-Training' series, time is of the essence in more ways than one for a medical student conducting a routine physical on an elderly patient", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Running Out the Clock"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "medical school, medicine", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "medical school, medicine"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd271d\"", "article_summary": "A classmate and I had been assigned to this patient\u2013I\u2019ll call her Mrs. G.\u2013as part of our course on the physical exam.\nI\u2019m running out of time.\nI\u2019m running out of time?\nAt this stage of our medical education, year two, nothing we do is for the patient\u2019s benefit.\nIt was right there on the vital signs monitor clock: 30 minutes left to finish the patient\u2019s history and do her physical."}
