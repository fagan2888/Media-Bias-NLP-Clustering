But hospital officials told the Committee of the Whole before a packed council chambers that it wants a role in running the service.\n\nChief medical officer Dr. Saria Saccocio said that by choosing one hospital over another, the council would be \u201cchoosing one population over another, rather than choosing Greenville County in its entirety.\u201d\n\nAnd allowing GHS control of EMS affords them a significant advantage in the market because of changes under the Affordable Care Act that focus reimbursement on patient outcomes instead of just procedures performed, according to Johnna Reed, vice president of population health management.\n\nSt. Francis CEO Craig McCoy, who noted he was a paramedic with the Greenville County EMS from 1994 to 2002, proposed that both hospitals form a nonprofit joint venture to run EMS and split the deficit.\n\n\u201cEverything in health care today is moving toward collaboration,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should ask yourselves why St. Francis is being excluded.\u201d\n\nGHS has said that it\u2019s not about market share, but that operating EMS with two different management structures would be too difficult.\n\nKernell said there are examples of systems run by two hospitals, some that work well and some that don\u2019t.\n\nHe said that after reviewing different models, he determined it would be in the best interest of the county to look at a single entity to run EMS because it\u2019s difficult to operate the organization with two bosses.\n\n\u201cAnd you have to have two willing participants,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t force that to happen.\u201d\n\nHe said that any contract would include safeguards to protect St. Francis\u2019 interests.\n\nBut St. Francis chief operating officer Dan Duggan said the hospital has little reason to trust that its interests would be protected because of a lack of transparency surrounding the issue.\n\nCouncilman Jim Burns questioned whether an EMS that doesn\u2019t include both systems can serve public safety, and councilman Butch Kirven said it makes sense for the county to partner with health care professionals. He asked that McCoy meet one-on-one with GHS CEO Michael Riordan.\n\nAnd councilman Sid Cates asked if the EMS system isn\u2019t broken, why fix it?\n\nThe council didn\u2019t vote on the issue.\n\nBut councilman Willis Meadows said he would make a motion at the next meeting to study whether it\u2019s possible for both hospitals to be involved in running EMS.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1EiR8ND", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Bon Secours St. Francis Health System told Greenville County Council Tuesday that a collaboration with Greenville Health System to run the county\u2019s EMS program is the best way to ensure public safety", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenville News", "description": "Bon Secours St. Francis Health System told Greenville County Council Tuesday that a collaboration with Greenville Health System to run the county\u2019s EMS program is the best way to ensure public safety", "title": "County Council hears St. Francis\u2019 side in EMS battle", "url": "http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/2015/08/25/county-council-hears-st-francis-side-ems-battle/32369319/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenvilleonline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bon Secours St. Francis Health System told Greenville County Council Tuesday that a collaboration with Greenville Health System to run the county\u2019s EMS program is the best way to ensure public safety", "title": "County Council hears St. Francis\u2019 side in EMS battle", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8223c4bd3b4bb15a66d404f93386207cec40c6fc/c=66-0-467-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/25/Greenville/B9318583910Z.1_20150825212622_000_GF2BMRSV4.3-0.jpg", "creator": "@greenvillenews", "site": "@greenvillenews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=758240887", "fb": {"app_id": 127457533984247}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/liv.osby"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb615\"", "article_summary": "Bon Secours St. Francis Health System will make a case to Greenville County Council on Tuesday as to why it should be included in running the county\u2019s EMS program (Photo: FILE)Bon Secours St. Francis Health System told Greenville County Council Tuesday that a collaboration with Greenville Health System to run the county\u2019s EMS program is the best way to ensure public safety.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t force that to happen.\u201dHe said that any contract would include safeguards to protect St. Francis\u2019 interests.\nSt. Francis CEO Craig McCoy, who noted he was a paramedic with the Greenville County EMS from 1994 to 2002, proposed that both hospitals form a nonprofit joint venture to run EMS and split the deficit.\nUnder the proposal, St. Francis would be part of an advisory committee.\nAnd councilman Sid Cates asked if the EMS system isn\u2019t broken, why fix it?"}
