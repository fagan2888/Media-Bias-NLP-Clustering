None could hold a candle to the tenure of the 2015 opening night\u2019s featured act.\n\nThe festival that launched in downtown Las Vegas in 2013 -- and features 18 sprawling blocks of world-class street art, culinary demonstrations and, of course, performances -- had the pleasure of kicking off this year's festivities with headliner Stevie Wonder taking the stage.\n\nPaul McCartney & Stevie Wonder's Classic 'Ebony and Ivory': Exclusive Remix Premiere\n\nPrior to the legendary musician\u2019s performance, the table was set with stellar performances from the likes of Top Dawg Entertainment\u2019s SZA, AWOLNATION and Shamir, among others. As the thousands of festivalgoers sweated it out in the Vegas evening\u2019s sweltering conditions while feasting on fine foods from some of Las Vegas\u2019 top restaurants and indulging in intriguing art installations, they were greeted with strong sets from Minnesota\u2019s Atmosphere -- who rummaged through their impressive near-two decade catalog of emo raps -- as well as the downtempo stylings of Thievery Corporation and their robust catalog of grooves taken from their nine studio albums.\n\nBut the first day of festivities hovered around Stevie Wonder, and even some of today\u2019s finest artists had to tip their cap to the braided legend during their performance.\n\nBefore Hozier\u2019s soulful set took everyone to church -- courtesy of the 2015 Billboard Award-winning song of the same name -- the Irish singer took a moment to gush about what was to come.\n\nHozier Performs 'Take Me to Church' at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards: Watch\n\n\u201cI saw my name next to Stevie Wonder and I flipped my f---ing wig,\u201d he said during his set that saw him roll through songs including \u201cFrom Eden\u201d and \u201cSomeone New.\u201d And he certainly wouldn\u2019t be the only one.\n\nAt 10:45 p.m., Wonder emerged onstage with a full band backing him and tore right into the desert air with one classic cut after another. From the funky chords of \u201cHigher Ground\u201d to the reggae tinged \u201cMaster Blaster (Jammin\u2019),\u201d it was a sight to behold as three generations of Stevie Wonder fans were dancing on the grassy grounds.\n\nFor the next two hours and 10 minutes, Mr. Wonder would brilliantly serenade the crowd with four decades worth of material. Even 130 minutes wasn\u2019t enough for the 25-time Grammy Award-winning artist -- because hits such as \u201cPart Time Lover,\u201d \u201cLately\u201d and \u201cI Just Called to Say I Love You\u201d never made their way into his set list.\n\nRegardless, Wonder was on his game as he blessed the crowd with his trademark harmonica on the sweet \u201cSend One Your Love\u201d and tickled the ivory on the 1986 adult contemporary hit \u201cOverjoyed\u201d(which '90s babies may know best from an Air Jordan commercial).\n\nHe playfully dueled with his background singers as they displayed their powerful voices. But, always the jokester, Wonder warned them to not steal the show from him.\n\nObviously, for the youngsters in the crowd that aren\u2019t in tune with Wonder, there was performance a couple of blocks away that certainly satisfied their festive mood.\n\nFor those who preferred to turn up to the midnight groove, Major Lazer had the formula over at the Ambassador stage.\n\nDiplo at iHeartRadio Music Festival 2015: Major Lazer Working With Sia, The Weeknd & More on New Album\n\nWith Washy Fire leading the fist pumping frenzy, Major Lazer\u2019s 70-minute romp was their mashing of reggae, electronic, house and EDM genres as they slid in choice cuts from three full-length albums, Peace Is the Mission, Free the Universe and Guns Don\u2019t Kill People\u2026 Lazers Do.\u201d One of the highlights found Washy Fire demanding the crowd to remove their shirts and toss them into the air on his count of three, providing a exhilarating spectacle.\n\nBut at the end of the day, this was the Stevie Wonder show, and the 65-year-old never seemed to tire as he glided through his classic ballads and closed strong with \u201cSuperstitious,\u201d \u201cSir Duke\u201d and \u201cLiving for the City.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the crowd was worn down from some brutally warm weather conditions, but Wonder appeared to have more in his gas tank. Unfortunately, his time was up, and arguably one of the greatest singer/songwriters the world has ever seen took his bow and exited stage right to punctuate a magnificent kickoff to the 2015 edition of the festival -- while setting the bar high for fellow headliners Imagine Dragons and Kendrick Lamar.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "The Life Is Beatiful Festival had the pleasure of kicking off this year's festivities with headliner Stevie Wonder taking the stage.", "title": "Stevie Wonder Delivers in Spades on Life Is Beautiful's Opening Night", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6708115/stevie-wonder-life-is-beautiful-festival-2015", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/stevie-wonder-life-is-beautiful-2015-billboard-650.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Life Is Beatiful Festival had the pleasure of kicking off this year's festivities with headliner Stevie Wonder taking the stage.", "title": "Stevie Wonder Delivers in Spades on Life Is Beautiful's Opening Night", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6708115/stevie-wonder-life-is-beautiful-festival-2015", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/stevie-wonder-life-is-beautiful-2015-billboard-650.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The Life Is Beatiful Festival had the pleasure of kicking off this year's festivities with headliner Stevie Wonder taking the stage.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Stevie Wonder Delivers in Spades on Life Is Beautiful's Opening Night | Billboard"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1747\"", "article_summary": "Stevie Wonder performs onstage during day 1 of the 2015 Life Is Beautiful Festival on Sept. 25, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nBut the first day of festivities hovered around Stevie Wonder, and even some of today\u2019s finest artists had to tip their cap to the braided legend during their performance.\nFrom the funky chords of \u201cHigher Ground\u201d to the reggae tinged \u201cMaster Blaster (Jammin\u2019),\u201d it was a sight to behold as three generations of Stevie Wonder fans were dancing on the grassy grounds.\nFor the next two hours and 10 minutes, Mr. Wonder would brilliantly serenade the crowd with four decades worth of material.\nNone could hold a candle to the tenure of the 2015 opening night\u2019s featured act."}
