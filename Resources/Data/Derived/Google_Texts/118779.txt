People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is offering a $5,000 reward to help find those responsible for sealing two dogs inside an aquarium case and abandoning them.

Multiple news organizations report a Hinds County resident found the puppies on Nov. 18 near a creek. The lid of the glass aquarium had been cemented shut.

PETA senior director Colleen O'Brien says the dogs were terrified, trapped and left to die.

The dogs were eventually taken to the Mississippi Animal Rescue League where they have been recovering and will soon be ready for adoption.

Anyone with information about the case is encouraged to contact the Hinds County Sheriff's Office.
