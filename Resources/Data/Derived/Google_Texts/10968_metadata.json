They also attacked New Hampshire's official website, visitnh.gov.\n\nWhile the site was knocked offline, Maine's Secretary of State Matt Dunlap assured that it was not \"hacked,\" and that information was not breached.\n\nFrom the Bangor Daily News:\n\nA hacker group using the Twitter handle Vikingdom2015 has claimed responsibility for taking down both maine.gov and New Hampshire\u2019s visitnh.gov, although the latter site is now currently operating. The same group has taken responsibility for what\u2019s known as \u201cDenial of Service\u201d attacks on other government websites, such as Oklahoma City\u2019s okc.gov.\n\nhttp://t.co/pICnaONbU1 will be down for a while.
