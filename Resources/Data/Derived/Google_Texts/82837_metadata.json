Could it save us money and change the doctor-patient relationship?\n\nHow telemedicine works\n\nTelemedicine is the practice of patients and doctors having an appointment via the phone or computer \u2013 Skype, for instance. Many believe that it has the potential of expanding access to health care while providing cheaper services to patients.\n\nCost-effective and in line with technological change\n\nIf you struggle with transportation or access to healthcare, having the possibility of consulting your doctor virtually is a game-changer. Experts argue that virtual care also cuts emergency room costs for health providers while allowing doctors to see more patients. Furthermore, home care and monitoring of those in need of long-term assistance could be easily accomplished remotely.\n\nRemote healthcare in emergency situations\n\nDr. Lawrence R. Wechsler, chairman of the Department of Neurology, University of Pittsburgh Schools of the Health Sciences, and vice president of telemedicine services, believes that in the treatment of stroke, for instance, \u201ctelemedicine can offer a huge advantage\u201d. An expert doctor hundreds of miles away from a local hospital can treat patients within minutes.\n\nTimely interventions can significantly reduce stroke-related disabilities.\n\nIn terms of economic savings, using telemedicine could cut insurance costs. Human resources consultancy Towers Watson estimates the savings at $6 billion a year for companies that buy coverage for employees.\n\nIs telemedicine sustainable?\n\nIn order to make telemedicine a sustainable model, experts have urged U.S. states to recognise it as a reimbursable service.\n\n\u201cA lot of (our services) have been held back a little bit by the lack of reimbursement,\u201d said Matt Levi, director of virtual health services at CHI Franciscan.\n\nIn CHI Franciscan, the service has been around for a few year.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, if some health systems and insurers are rushing to offer video consultations for routine ailments, telemedicine is also facing \u201cpushback from some more traditional corners of the medical world\u201d.\n\nMore and more health providers, however, are stepping up to provide telemedicine services to a broader population \u2013 in urban and rural areas alike.\n\nThe technology is out there\n\nAs telemedicine service connects patients with health-care providers, the system also brings technology into peoples\u2019 homes.\n\n\u201cWe sent tablet technology into the homes of patients who are at end-of-life and they connected weekly with their physicians for their appointments,\u201d said Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre manager of telemedicine and palliative care Trina Diner.\n\n\u201cThe technology is out there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot less expensive than it used to be and a lot of people are a lot more comfortable with technology so all the conditions are right for us to move into that environment\u201d.\n\nWould you ever use telemedicine services?\n\nFor more technology-related news, check out Clapway Trends:\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "As telemedicine service connects patients with health-care providers, the system also brings technology into peoples\u2019 homes.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Clapway", "description": "As telemedicine service connects patients with health-care providers, the system also brings technology into peoples\u2019 homes.", "title": "Ask Your Doctor How Telemedicine Really Works - Clapway", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://clapway.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ask-Your-Doctor-How-Telemedicine-Really-Works-.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-12T15:31:38-04:00", "url": "http://clapway.com/2015/07/12/ask-your-doctor-how-telemedicine-really-works-246/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As telemedicine service connects patients with health-care providers, the system also brings technology into peoples\u2019 homes.", "creator": "@Clapway", "image": "http://clapway.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ask-Your-Doctor-How-Telemedicine-Really-Works-1.jpg", "title": "Ask Your Doctor How Telemedicine Really Works - Clapway", "site": "@Clapway", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 590094704401531}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/clapway", "section": "Exploration", "tag": "what is telemedicine", "published_time": "2015-07-12T15:30:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-12T15:31:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "access to healthcare, cheap healthcare, chi franciscan, chi franciscan telemedicine, connecting doctors with patients, health insurance, health news, healthcare insurance, healthcare plans, healthcare today, healthcare u.s., healthcare us, local hospitals, medicine and technology, remote healthcare, skype doctors, technological change, technology news, telehealth, telemedicine, telemedicine insurance, telemedicine service, telemedicine services, telemedicine us, thunder bay regional health sciences centre, virtual consultations, virtual hospitals, what is telemedicine"}, "article_summary": "More and more health providers, however, are stepping up to provide telemedicine services to a broader population \u2013 in urban and rural areas alike.\nThe technology is out thereAs telemedicine service connects patients with health-care providers, the system also brings technology into peoples\u2019 homes.\nWould you ever use telemedicine services?\nExperts argue that virtual care also cuts emergency room costs for health providers while allowing doctors to see more patients.\nMany believe that it has the potential of expanding access to health care while providing cheaper services to patients."}
