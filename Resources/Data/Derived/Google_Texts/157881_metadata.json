Even Tuesday evening, when Republicans and Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee released summaries of the bill, the land deal was left out.\n\nRambler and other opponents couldn\u2019t find out until late Tuesday night when the bill, named the \u201cCarl Levin and Howard P. \u2018Buck\u2019 McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015\u201d (after the retiring Senate and House committee chairmen), was finally posted online. The news that Apache burial, medicinal and ceremonial grounds would be given to Resolution Copper, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, was on page 1,105.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I thought about was not really today, but 50 years from now, probably after my time, if this land exchange bill goes through, the effects that my children and children\u2019s children will be dealing with,\u201d Rambler said in an interview.\n\nThe land includes territory where Apaches gather medicinal plants and acorns -- a food source that Rambler said has sustained his people for as long as they know. It also surrounds the Apache Leap, a summit from which trapped Apaches once jumped to their deaths rather than be killed by settlers in the late 1800s.\n\n\u201cSince time immemorial people have gone there. That\u2019s part of our ancestral homeland,\" Rambler said, referring to the overall area in question. \"We\u2019ve had dancers in that area forever -- sunrise dancers -- and coming-of-age ceremonies for our young girls that become women. They\u2019ll seal that off. They\u2019ll seal us off from the acorn grounds, and the medicinal plants in the area, and our prayer areas.\u201d\n\nThere are supposed to be two areas excluded from mining, including Apache Leap, but the bill specifies Resolution Copper can get permission in just 30 or 90 days to drill among the oaks.\n\nRio Tinto has pursued the deal for a decade, and it was apparently pushed into the NDAA largely thanks to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). It passed the House once in 2011, but when leaders brought it to the floor twice last year, they couldn\u2019t find enough votes, and pulled it. Most Democrats opposed it and growing numbers of Republicans were concerned about how it was being conducted. To many, it looked like a sweetheart deal being made outside of the regular process of dealing with federal land. And some were unhappy that the prime beneficiary, Rio Tinto, also owns a uranium mine in Africa with Iran. Others worried that most of the copper will go to China, which owns 10 percent of Rio Tinto.\n\nThe argument for the land swap -- the government will acquire other lands in exchange -- is economic development and jobs. The company claims it will generate $61 billion in economic activity and 3,700 direct and indirect jobs over 40 years. Opponents dispute those numbers, but Rambler is not sure they matter, even if they are accurate.\n\n\u201cIt seems like us Apaches and other Indians care more about what this type of action does to the environment and the effects it leaves behind for us, while others tend to think more about today and the promise of jobs, but not necessarily what our creator God gave to us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe is particularly worried about the longterm impact. The company intends to use a variety of \u201cblock cave\u201d mining that digs underneath the ore and causes it to collapse from its own weight. Resolution Copper describes the process in a video:\n\nThe land above such mines eventually cracks and subsides.\n\n\u201cWhat those mountains mean to us is that when the rain and the snow comes, it distributes it to us,\u201d Rambler said. \u201cIt replenishes our aquifers to give us life.\u201d He\u2019s not sure how that will happen once the land starts subsiding. Resolution Copper promises to monitor it.\n\nIn comments to The Huffington Post on Tuesday, spokespeople for the mine said that it had filed an operating plan with the federal Forest Service and was starting a review under the National Environmental Policy Act, which is supposed to ensure that federal lands are protected.\n\nBut Rambler found little assurance in that, since NEPA only applies while the land belongs to the federal government.\n\n\u201cThis is what will happen -- the law in one area says there will be consultation, but the law in another area of the bill says the land exchange will happen within one year of enactment of this bill,\u201d Rambler noted, correctly. \u201cSo no matter what we\u2019re doing within that one year, the consultation part won\u2019t mean anything after one year. Because then it\u2019s really theirs after that.\u201d\n\nTwo properties within the land would remain in the hands of the federal government, one around the Apache Leap and one an area called Oak Flats. Outside of those places, the federal government would have no say under NEPA, an official with the Bureau of Land Management said.\n\n\u201cWe would only have to do NEPA on any activity that would take place on remaining federal land,\u201d said Arizona BLM official Carrie Templin. The company promises to stop 1,500 feet short of Apache Leap, but reserves the right to drill in Oak Flats.\n\nThe Arizona exchange is not the only land measure in the defense bill.\n\nIn fact, there are dozens of other land-related items, including at least one more that is angering Native Americans. A transfer of 1,600 acres from the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State for industrial development has also sparked protest by tribes, who note that the area also contains lands important to them, and which are already undergoing various federal evaluations that would be short-circuited by the legislation.\n\nStill another deal would benefit a Native American corporation in Alaska called Sealaska. It is opposed by environmental groups, though, because it would open some 70,000 acres of the Tongass National Forest to logging.\n\nEnvironmental groups approve of some of the deals in the bill, but those have been attracting anger on the right. Two leaders of the Heritage Foundation campaign arm described them in an op-ed as a \"land grab\" that had no place in a defense bill. Another, Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment, also slammed it in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe federal lands package added to the National Defense Authorization Act is a backroom deal that would lock up use of hundreds of thousands of acres of land,\u201d said Ebell, although it is likely he would favor the part of the Rio Tinto deal that allows mining since he favors using federal land for resources. \u201cMany of these federal land lockups could never be enacted on their own if debated and voted in the light of day.\"\n\nSen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) also doesn't think the land bills belong in the defense measure, and has vowed to stall the bill as long as possible until they are removed.\n\nThe bill is expected to be voted on in the House as soon as this week, and sent to the Senate in a manner that does not allow it to be amended. If anything is to change in the bill, it would have to happen before then, and House leaders would have to agree to allow amendment votes.\n\nUPDATE: 11:15 p.m. -- Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) tried Wednesday night to offer an amendment to remove the Resolution Copper deal from the defense bill, but lost in the House Rules Committee on a 6-4 vote, with three Democrats supporting him, and his GOP colleagues voting against him. The Rules Committee determines how measures will be considered on the floor. It decided to give the NDAA one hour of debate, with no vote on Cole's amendment.\n\nMichael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.
