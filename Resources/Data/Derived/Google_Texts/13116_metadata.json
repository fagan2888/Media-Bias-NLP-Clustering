The middle section of today\u2019s Morning Jolt . . .\n\nNow, five days from now \u2014 five days from now \u2014 on October 1st, millions of Americans who don\u2019t have health insurance because they\u2019ve been priced out of the market or because they\u2019ve been denied access because of a preexisting condition, they will finally be able to buy quality, affordable health insurance. (Applause.) In five days.\n\nJust for fun, let\u2019s turn the wayback machine to September 26, 2013 , and take a look at how President Obama was touting the imminent debut of Healthcare.gov.\n\nEh, not so much : \u201cThe survey, conducted by nonprofit research foundation The Commonwealth Fund , found that 21 percent of adults who visited the health insurance marketplaces said they enrolled. Of those who visited but did not enroll, 48 percent said they weren\u2019t sure they could afford a plan, 46 said they were still deciding on a plan, and 37 said they had technical difficulties with the website.\u201d\n\nBack to Obama:\n\nAbout 85 percent of Americans already have health insurance \u2014 either through their job, or through Medicare, or through the individual market. So if you\u2019re one of these folks, it\u2019s reasonable that you might worry whether health care reform is going to create changes that are a problem for you \u2014 especially when you\u2019re bombarded with all sorts of fear-mongering.\n\nSo the first thing you need to know is this: If you already have health care, you don\u2019t have to do anything . . .\n\nThe so-called fear-mongers were right: \u201cAt least 3.5 million Americans have been issued cancellations, but the exact number is unclear. Associated Press checks find that data is unavailable in a half the states.\u201d\n\nStarting on Tuesday, every American can visit HealthCare.gov to find out what\u2019s called the insurance marketplace for your state. Here in Maryland, I actually think it\u2019s called MarylandHealthConnection.gov. (Applause.) MarylandHealthConnection.gov. But if you go to HealthCare.gov, you can look and they\u2019ll tell you where to go. They\u2019ll link to your state.\n\nAn update from Maryland, October 29: \u201cOn the same day that a top Obama administration official apologized for the troubled federal health care website, the head of Maryland\u2019s system said some state residents are still unable to complete their enrollments online.\u201d\n\nNow, this is real simple. It\u2019s a website where you can compare and purchase affordable health insurance plans, side-by-side, the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 same way you shop for a TV on Amazon. You just go on and you start looking, and here are all the options.\n\nEr . . . no. \u201cBoth Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., said on CBS\u2019 \u2018Face the Nation that the HealthCare.gov website should go offline until it is fully functional.\u201d\n\nSo you enter in some basic information about yourself, what level of coverage you\u2019re looking for. After that, you\u2019ll be presented with a list of quality, affordable plans that are available in your area. It will say clearly what each plan covers, what each plan costs. The price will be right there. It will be fully transparent.\n\nBefore this law, only a handful of states required insurance companies to offer you instant price quotes, but because of this law, insurers in all 50 states will have to offer you instant price quotes. And so if you\u2019ve ever tried to buy insurance on your own, I promise you this is a lot easier. It\u2019s like booking a hotel or a plane ticket . . .\n\nEr . . . no: \u201cAndrew Slavitt of Optum, whose company stands to make up to $85 million for its work . . . blamed a decision by CMS within two weeks of the launch to require users to fully register in order to browse for health insurance products, instead of being able to get information anonymously, as originally planned.\u201d\n\nPremiums are going to be different in different parts of the country, depending on how much coverage you buy. But 95 percent of uninsured Americans will see their premiums cost less than was expected . . .\n\nEr . . . no: \u201cToday, the Manhattan Institute released the most comprehensive analysis yet conducted of premiums under Obamacare for people who shop for coverage on their own. Here\u2019s what we learned. In the average state, Obamacare will increase underlying premiums by 41 percent.\u201d\n\nThe insurance companies are saying these marketplaces, this law, will work. They\u2019re putting money on the line because they think it will work. Competition, choice, transparency \u2014 all these things are keeping costs down.\n\nKnowing you can offer your family the security of health care \u2014 that\u2019s priceless. Now you can do it for the cost of your cable bill. Probably less than your cellphone bill. (Laughter and applause.) Think about that. Good health insurance for the price of your cellphone bill, or less.\n\nEh . . . a lot of the uninsured are not interested yet: \u201cAbout 17 percent of people who don\u2019t have health insurance actually tried to buy some on the new marketplaces in October, a new survey published Monday indicates. . . . Health officials have made clear the frustrations will not be completely over for anyone, even by the end of the month. The troubled website crashed again Monday, its third complete outage in just over a week. But this time, technicians were able to get it up and running again after 90 minutes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Obama \u2018Misspoke\u2019 (Lied) on Lots More than Keeping Your Plan", "sailthru.author": "Jim Geraghty", "description": "Happy Election Day.
