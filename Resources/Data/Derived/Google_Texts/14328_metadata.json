A team of international scientists set out to find the answer and analyzed 343 previously published studies. They found \u201cstatistically significant and meaningful differences in composition between organic and non-organic crops.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt shows very clearly how you grow your food has an impact,\u201d lead researcher Dr. Carlo Leifert, a professor of ecological agriculture at Newcastle University in England, told The New York Times. \u201cIf you buy organic fruits and vegetables, you can be sure you have, on average, a higher amount of antioxidants at the same calorie level.\u201d\n\nThey found that concentrations of a wide variety of antioxidants were found at higher levels in organic crops and crop-based foods. Many of the compounds have been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases and certain types of cancers. The study found organic crops contained an overall 17 percent higher concentration of antioxidants than chemically-laden crops. Certain antioxidants had a much wider gap, such as flavanones, which were 69 percent higher in organic crops.\n\n\u201cWe are not making health claims based on this study, because we can\u2019t,\u201d Leifert said. The study, he said, is insufficient \u201cto say organic food is definitely healthier for you, and it doesn\u2019t tell you anything about how much of a health impact switching to organic food could have.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, antioxidants have the power to prevent or delay types of cell damage. Supplements don\u2019t work as well to deliver the benefits fruits and vegetables can deliver, which is why seeking a crop that yields higher concentrations of antioxidants is of importance to our daily nutrition and disease prevention.\n\nOrganically farmed crops don\u2019t use the conventional chemical fertilizers and pesticides that are used to keep insects and other predators away to preserve the crops and yield a larger supply. Although organic farming approaches offer benefits, such as healthier soils and antioxidant rich fruits and vegetables, they produce a smaller quantity of crops.\n\nLast year, organic food sales in the United States accounted for $32.3 billion, which is just over four percent of the total market, according to estimates from The Organic Trade Association. The higher prices of organic fruits and vegetables serves as a deterrent of healthier eating altogether for many shoppers, which is why less expensive, non-organic produce may be the better choice. However, not everyone sees the benefits of putting greater emphasis on organic crops.\n\n\u201cThe other argument would be, if you just eat a little bit more fruits and vegetables, you\u2019re going to get more nutrients,\u201d Alan Dangour, a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told The New York Times. \u201cTo my mind, there\u2019s no convincing evidence that these foods are different in nutritional composition.\u201d\n\nSource: Leifert C, Nicot P, Niggli U, et al.
