Before a new commander in chief is elected-- President Obama will give his final State of the Union address.

Senator James Lankford invited the president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University to be his guest.

Dr. Everett Piper has led Oklahoma Wesleyan University for 13 years. The university is one of four Christian universities in Oklahoma that have sued the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act.

Lankford invited Piper to the State of the Union because of the actions he's taken to defend religious liberty.

Piper says Obamacare infringes on a woman's right to choose what type of contraception she wants or needs.

Piper says the suit, which is poised to go before the Supreme Court, is about religious liberty that is guaranteed by the first amendment.

"Sexual decisions and sexual behavior and sexual choices have always been part and parcel of the religious conversation. And now all of the sudden the government is presupposing to establish and prohibit the free expression and practice therein of those religious convictions. That is not the place of the government."

Despite his disagreement with the Obama administration, Piper looks forward to witnessing a piece of history.

"I think this is a big deal. The State of the Union is an opportunity for the USA to declare who it is and what it is our strengths and weaknesses are. And I think that's a wonderful opportunity to be part of that."

President Obamaâ€™s final State of the Union address is next Tuesday at 8 p.m.
