Ted Cruz is looking for a last minute boost on the eve of Indiana's crucial presidential primary in the form of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence

"This is a time for choosing," the popular Republican governor said at the beginning of a new 30-second ad, titled "Pence for Cruz." Pence endorsed Cruz last week as the Texas senator tries to cut into the momentum GOP front-runner Donald Trump has amassed.

The ad will air statewide in Indiana ahead of its Tuesday primary, where 57 delegates are at stake.

"All of America is looking to Indiana to make a choice," Pence said. "I'm a Reagan conservative. I see Ted Cruz as a principled conservative who's dedicated his career to advocating the Reagan agenda."
