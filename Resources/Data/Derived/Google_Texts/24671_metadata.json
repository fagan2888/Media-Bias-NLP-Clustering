That\u2019s what it takes.\u201d\n\nColorado (15-4, 4-2 Pac-12) took a step in shaking off the shock of losing its floor leader. The Buffs came out as the aggressor, raced to the big lead with an 18-0 run and recorded 10 blocked shots for the first time since 2006.\n\nAlso, the Buffs controlled the glass, winning the rebounding battle 43-23 against a Trojans squad that used two 7-footers. Without Dinwiddie, Colorado will go as far as its frontcourt takes it. This was a good first step.\n\n\u201cSpencer is a key aspect of this team,\u201d CU junior guard Askia Booker said. \u201cIt was rough the first game. But everyone is growing up.\u201d\n\nColorado coach Tad Boyle is optimistic the Buffs can remain competitive in the Pac-12 by being true to their identity. That\u2019s playing tenacious defense. But after the loss to UCLA on Thursday, he said his team had to somehow regain the swagger that Dinwiddie brought to every game.\n\n\u201cOur guys believed today,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cThis is just what the doctor ordered. Obviously, it\u2019s one game and we have to move on. (But) this team has grit. It has toughness. We can win some games in this league.\n\n\u201cI was planning on playing without Spencer Dinwiddie next year anyway (assuming the junior heads a year early to the NBA). It just came a little bit earlier.\u201d\n\nGranted, Southern California (9-9, 0-5) won\u2019t be confused with No. 25 UCLA. It may take a couple of recruiting classes before new Trojans coach Andy Enfield can fully install his \u201cDunk City\u201d system that last spring enabled Florida Gulf Coast to become the first 15-seed to reach the NCAA Tournament\u2019s Sweet Sixteen.\n\nGetting more players to contribute with ball movement will be crucial without Dinwiddie, and Boyle pointed to Booker\u2019s stats line: 13 points on just five field-goal attempts, and six assists.\n\nSophomore forward Xavier Johnson and freshman guard Jaron Hopkins also reached double-figure scoring for the Buffs with 10 points apiece. The 6-5 Hopkins, who has replaced Dinwiddie in the starting lineup, appeared more comfortable than he did against UCLA.\n\nHopkins also helped limit Southern California\u2019s most talented offensive player, Byron Wesley, to 3-for-14 shooting from the field.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to get out and defend as best I could,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cI gave it my all.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No. 21 Colorado bounces back as Buffs blow out USC behind Josh Scott", "title": "No. 21 Colorado bounces back as Buffs blow out USC behind Josh Scott", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/18/no-21-colorado-bounces-back-as-buffs-blow-out-usc-behind-josh-scott/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140118__george-king-cubuffs-011814p1.jpg", "height": 500}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140118__george-king-cubuffs-011814p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-18T14:26:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T06:47:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaff9\"", "article_summary": "Without Dinwiddie, Colorado will go as far as its frontcourt takes it.\nSophomore forward Xavier Johnson and freshman guard Jaron Hopkins also reached double-figure scoring for the Buffs with 10 points apiece.\nBOULDER \u2014 This time, injured Colorado star Spencer Dinwiddie could lean back on the Buffaloes\u2019 bench and smile.\nThe 6-5 Hopkins, who has replaced Dinwiddie in the starting lineup, appeared more comfortable than he did against UCLA.\nAlso, the Buffs controlled the glass, winning the rebounding battle 43-23 against a Trojans squad that used two 7-footers."}
