The United States, Canada and Panama were the only nations to oppose the declaration.\n\nOn Saturday, more than 5,000 protesters banged pots, blew horns and whistles and carried banners in the capital to decry crippling inflation and now-chronic shortages of basics including flour, milk and toilet paper. Similar protests were held in at least five other cities.\n\nAll over Venezuela, people spend hours every week queuing up at supermarkets, often before dawn, without even knowing what may arrive.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to buy. You can only buy what the government lets enter the country because everything is imported. There\u2019s no beef. There\u2019s no chicken,\u201d said Zoraida Carrillo, a 50-year-old marcher in Caracas.\n\nThe capital\u2019s government-allied mayor had refused the marchers a permit to hold the rally, leading opposition leader Henrique Capriles to accuse authorities of trying to \u201ccriminalize\u201d peaceful protests.\n\n\u201cNicolas (Maduro) is afraid of the empty pots of our people. He mobilizes hundreds of soldiers against empty pots,\u201d he said of the man who defeated him by a razor-thin margin in April presidential elections.\n\nCapriles also reiterated opposition complaints that the government is sending \u201cfunctionaries and groups of paramilitaries \u2014 which they have armed \u2014 to put down protests.\u201d\n\nMaduro has faced several weeks of daily student-led protests across the nation that he claims are an attempt by far-right provocateurs to overthrow him. They have been joined by mostly middle-class Venezuelans fed up with inflation that reached 56 percent last year and one of the highest murder rates in the world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Protest stymied after Venezuelan diplomatic win", "title": "Protest stymied after Venezuelan diplomatic win", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Protest stymied after Venezuelan diplomatic win", "title": "Protest stymied after Venezuelan diplomatic win", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/08/protest_stymied_after_venezuelan_diplomatic_win/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/venezuela-protests.jpeg8-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Protest stymied after Venezuelan diplomatic win", "title": "Protest stymied after Venezuelan diplomatic win", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/venezuela-protests.jpeg8-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Fabiola Sanchez", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd8b0\"", "article_summary": "The capital\u2019s government-allied mayor had refused the marchers a permit to hold the rally, leading opposition leader Henrique Capriles to accuse authorities of trying to \u201ccriminalize\u201d peaceful protests.\nAll over Venezuela, people spend hours every week queuing up at supermarkets, often before dawn, without even knowing what may arrive.\nThe United States, Canada and Panama were the only nations to oppose the declaration.\nHe mobilizes hundreds of soldiers against empty pots,\u201d he said of the man who defeated him by a razor-thin margin in April presidential elections.\nPresident Nicolas Maduro\u2019s socialist government, meanwhile, celebrated as a diplomatic victory an Organization of American States declaration supporting its professed efforts to bring a peaceful solution to the country\u2019s worst political violence in years."}
