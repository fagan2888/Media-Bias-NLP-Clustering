Lynn Luker, R-Boise, wouldn\u2019t study full Medicaid expansion as allowed under Obamacare, but would examine the prospect of a modified proposal. Full Medicaid expansion would give coverage primarily to able-bodied working adults who earn less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level each year.\n\nLuker said the House should fully study the idea before diving into a huge policy shift that could cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars in the years to come.\n\nHouse Democrats offered stiff opposition to the measure.\n\nRep. John Rusche, D-Lewiston, criticized the plan for addressing health needs too slowly.\n\n\u201cTo my mind, it\u2019s clear we have kicked the can down the road,\u201d Rusche said.\n\nOther legislators were less thoughtful. Rep. Dan Rudolph, D-Lewiston, peppered Luker with questions before offering his critique.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, the reasons to delay doing this are bogus,\u201d said Rudolph.\n\nThat comment drew a mild rebuke from House Speaker Scott Bedke, R-Oakley.\n\nThe plan also drew opposition from the House\u2019s more conservative faction. Rep. Ron Nate, R-Rexburg, opposed the bill because he believes it\u2019s the next step to accepting full Medicaid expansion.\n\nHealth and Welfare Chairman Fred Wood, R-Burley, planted himself firmly in the middle of his colleagues. Wood said Idaho needs more time to prepare for whatever might come next, and he rejected the idea that Idaho need not do anything for Idahoans in the gap created by Obamacare.\n\nHe urged colleagues to view the vote in proper context.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, I think we are taking a meaningful step,\u201d Wood said. \u201cI think that\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nThe House, on a 43 to 26 vote, also approved $10.4 million in grants for federally-approved community health centers. Of that amount, $400,000 would fund data collection to help the state learn more about people in the gap. The rest, $10 million, would support community health centers.\n\nRusche blasted this plan, too, characterizing it as insufficient. He suggested his colleagues \u201cnot delude\u201d themselves in believing the grants would fully address the needs of the people in the gap.\n\nHouse Majority Caucus Chair John Vande Woude, R-Nampa, said while the plan isn\u2019t perfect, it\u2019s a positive step forward that will help health centers provide follow-up and preventative care for the gap population.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just going to sit on our hands,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth measures now head to the Senate for consideration, which will likely come tomorrow. Legislators want to wrap up their business for the year by the end of the week.\n\nIn addition to passing on Medicaid expansion, legislators also rejected Idaho Gov. Butch Otter\u2019s Primary Care Access Program, a $30-million-per-year proposal that would give routine medical care to Idahoans who lack coverage.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "IdahoReporter.com", "description": "For the third year in the a row, the Idaho Legislature will pass on Medicaid expansion.
