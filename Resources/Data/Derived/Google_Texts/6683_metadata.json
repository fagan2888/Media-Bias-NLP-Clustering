That means there will be a demand for more doctors. At the same time, Medicare pilot programs as well as hundreds of new Accountable Care Organizations offered by physicians' groups, hospitals and insurers have pushed health care toward a team-oriented approach.\n\nThe administration officials said there should be no problem recruiting primary care physicians, although medical students have been drawn to medical fields that pay higher salaries, often to pay off their student loans.\n\nRecruiting primary care practitioners for the residencies makes sense because young people are interested in working with teams of providers, the officials said.\n\nA medical home or ACO means a doctor can quickly get a patient exactly what he or she needs. For example, a heart-disease patient is likely to be more at-risk for depression and may also need physical therapy and nutrition counseling. The team-based approach makes the resources necessary, as well ensuring everyone on the team thinks about a patient's entire health, rather than just the area in which he or she specializes.\n\nPriority for the residents will be given to hospitals and other community-based health groups, such as ACOs or medical homes, that emphasize team-based care in underserved areas, including rural areas, though residencies in other settings will also be awarded. The budget also proposes bringing payments to teaching hospitals in line with the cost of providing care.\n\nThe National Health Services Corps now has 8,900 health care providers but would increase to 15,000 people in the service every year for the next five years. The corps provides scholarships and student loan repayments for people who practice in high-need areas. This comes in addition to increases that have more than doubled the number of corps members from 3,600 in 2008.\n\nFollow @KellySKennedy on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1bNsJRA", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Adds $5.23 billion over 10 years to train 13,000 primary care residents in high-need communities, and in team-based care, such as an accountable care organization -- Extends higher payments to", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Adds $5.23 billion over 10 years to train 13,000 primary care residents in high-need communities, and in team-based care, such as an accountable care organization -- Extends higher payments to", "title": "Obama budget will seek record funding for new doctors", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/27/new-budget-proposes-record-funding-for-new-doctors/5836317/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Adds $5.23 billion over 10 years to train 13,000 primary care residents in high-need communities, and in team-based care, such as an accountable care organization -- Extends higher payments to", "title": "Obama budget will seek record funding for new doctors", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/335dc91d64f4adede3dc04a796b3ba9caf3940ac/c=0-0-2348-2348&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/26//1393446034000-XXX-13-NEWS-41733.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Barack Obama", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Barack Obama", "title": "Obama budget will seek record funding for new doctors", "author": "Kelly Kennedy", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/nation", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/859870d97ca8586a2d0cfd1577f038e44e68af43/c=0-88-2592-3547/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/26//1393446034000-XXX-13-NEWS-41733.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b6617d1eabd76e2c8bb97687fd11932b07bb2cb/c=0-0-2348-2348/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/26//1393446034000-XXX-13-NEWS-41733.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f02de05e7fcd8032e3cfbc995d9ca1d56de7b7cc/c=0-0-2592-1949/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/26//1393446034000-XXX-13-NEWS-41733.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/af8784670d80b8c370851cef6e824b11d518ebe3/c=0-0-2592-1462&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/26//1393446034000-XXX-13-NEWS-41733.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-02-27T09:31:26.630000-05:00", "shorthed": "Budget seeks funds for new doctors", "articleid": 5836317, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3f252b20660d7eb68ffeb8ea7505a9a02b3a05e2/c=0-0-2592-1462/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/26//1393446034000-XXX-13-NEWS-41733.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/28e20f9a65f53e1c0bddb9ffcdcb387c053f54a8/c=0-0-2183-3888/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/26//1393446034000-XXX-13-NEWS-41733.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, President Obama, budget, National Health Services Corps, Medicaid, Medicare, accountable care organizations"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8150\"", "article_summary": "The president's budget proposal:\u2022 Adds $5.23 billion over 10 years to train 13,000 primary care residents in high-need communities, and in team-based care, such as an accountable care organization.\nThe proposal also addresses a shortage of mental health providers by offering residencies for psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners and other mental health providers as part of the team-based approach.\nThe budget, which Obama will reveal Tuesday, marks the first time Medicare funds will be used to increase the number of medical residents, and it's the largest-ever proposed increase of the corps, officials said.\nThe administration hopes to boost both team-based care, as well as send residents out to rural areas and areas with lower access to care, officials said.\nThe National Health Services Corps now has 8,900 health care providers but would increase to 15,000 people in the service every year for the next five years."}
