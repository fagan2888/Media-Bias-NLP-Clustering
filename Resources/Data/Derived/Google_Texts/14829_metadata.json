If Gov. Nathan Deal had said yes to the offer, it would have resulted in more than $3 billion in federal funds flowing into Georgia this year for payment to the doctors and hospitals that treat Medicaid patients.\n\nDeal has refused to accept this money to expand Medicaid coverage, even though such healthcare groups as the Medical Association of Georgia and the Georgia Hospital Association support expansion.\n\nThe governor recently signed a bill transferring the authority for that decision from his office to the General Assembly, which means the state likely will never take the money.\n\nOther governors have accepted the federal funds, including such Republican chief executives as Rick Snyder of Michigan, Jan Brewer of Arizona, Chris Christie of New Jersey and Terry Branstad of Iowa.\n\nWhen Snyder signed the \u201cHealthy Michigan\u201d legislation for Medicaid expansion, he said, \u201cThe federal funds for Healthy Michigan are part of the Affordable Care Act. Many have strong feelings about this law and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right answer in many respects. However, it is the law of the land and it will be implemented.\u201d\n\nBrewer had to browbeat a Republican-controlled legislature to get approval for using the federal healthcare funds in Arizona, but after she succeeded she remarked, \u201cIt was a win, win, win all the way around.\u201d\n\nWhen Christie made the decision to accept Obamacare money for New Jersey, he said, \u201cWe are putting people first. Which is why, after considerable discussion and research, I have decided to participate in the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nDeal and the legislative leadership in Georgia have taken the opposite course, and I think a large factor in their decision was political spite toward a Democratic president. What better way to express that spite than to slap the hand offering you billions of dollars in federal money?\n\nThere is always a price to pay for this kind of behavior, as it turns out.\n\nThe widespread media coverage of the Obamacare implementation has prompted thousands of people to step forward to sign up for Medicaid coverage. In many cases, these are people who were already eligible for coverage but were not aware of it \u2013 so they will have access to healthcare even if their state does not accept federal funds for Medicaid expansion.\n\nHealthcare experts call this the \u201cwoodwork effect,\u201d because these people have figuratively come out of the woodwork to sign up for coverage.\n\nA study released last week indicates that nearly 100,000 people in Georgia who had been eligible for Medicaid coverage all along signed up for the program as Obamacare was being rolled out in recent months.\n\nIt is estimated these new enrollees will cost the state about $90 million in additional yearly Medicaid expenses. That is where our leadership has put us.\n\nThe state refuses to accept more than $3 billion in federal funds for Medicaid expansion but it is on the hook to pay another $90 million in Medicaid costs anyway.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a smart deal to me, but that\u2019s what happens when your decisions are influenced by political spite instead of logic and reasoning.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "The Augusta Chronicle, Columbia County, Georgia, South Carolina, Newspaper, News, Sports, Evans, Martinez, Appling, Harlem, Grovetown, North Augusta, Opinion", "og": {"url": "http://newstimes.augusta.com/opinion/2014-05-21/dont-cut-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face", "type": "article", "site_name": "Columbia County News-Times", "description": "I was taught at a young age that you shouldn't cut off your nose to spite your face. \nIn other words, don't engage in destructive action just because you're angry at someone, because you usually end up hurting yourself more than the other person.", "title": "Don't cut off your nose to spite your face"}, "description": "A Chronicle Media website."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca112\"", "article_summary": "I was taught at a young age that you shouldn\u2019t cut off your nose to spite your face.\nThe widespread media coverage of the Obamacare implementation has prompted thousands of people to step forward to sign up for Medicaid coverage.\nWhen Snyder signed the \u201cHealthy Michigan\u201d legislation for Medicaid expansion, he said, \u201cThe federal funds for Healthy Michigan are part of the Affordable Care Act.\nThis expansion of Medicaid is a key provision of the Affordable Care Act, known more familiarly to consumers as Obamacare.\nWhat better way to express that spite than to slap the hand offering you billions of dollars in federal money?"}
