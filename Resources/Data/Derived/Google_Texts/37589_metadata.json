The event was organised two days before the International Women's day to show support for feminists. (REUTERS/Kacper Pempel)\n\n4356173\n\nIn 1964, singer Leslie Gore recorded \u201cYou Don\u2019t Own Me,\u201d a feminist anthem of equality of the sexes. It was a hit, and it has endured.\n\nToday, feminists under the banner \u201cThe Department Of Peace,\u201d are using the song as a rallying cry to get women to vote for Democrats this November.\n\nGore introduces the video that features semi-celebrities like Lena Dunham and Carrie Brownstein, and others.\n\nWhile lip-syncing, the participants dance and some flash signs reading things like \u201cget your rosaries off my ovaries,\u201d and \u201cmy body is not a battleground.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou Don\u2019t Own Me\u201d PSA \u2013 Upworthy from The Department of Peace on Vimeo.\n\nOther messages flashed on the screen are:\n\n\u201cWomen constitute more than half the population.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2012, 53% of voters were women.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour vote matters, especially when some people plan to overturn Roe v. Wade, immediately defund Planned Parenthood, shut down the nation\u2019s family planning program, and repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s send a clear message on Nov. 4th.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not go backwards!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen women vote, women win!\u201d\n\nAt the end of the video, Gore returns to clarify the message for anyone who may have missed it throughout the video. \u201cI recorded \u2018You Don\u2019t Own Me\u2019 in 1964. It\u2019s hard for me to believe but we\u2019re still fighting for the same things we were then. Yes, ladies, we\u2019ve got to come together, get out there and vote, and protect our bodies; they\u2019re ours. Please vote.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood receives millions in taxpayer subsidies annually and the Affordable Care Act mandates insurance companies offer \u201cfree\u201d contraception, which is actually paid for by raising premiums on everyone. For the government to truly \u201cget their laws off\u201d these women\u2019s bodies, these subsidies would have to be ended. But that\u2019s not what these women, and this group, is advocating for.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Derek Hunter", "description": "Celebrities want women to vote for Democrats, get more 'free' things", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "In 1964, singer Leslie Gore recorded \u201cYou Don\u2019t Own Me,\u201d a feminist anthem of equality of the sexes.
