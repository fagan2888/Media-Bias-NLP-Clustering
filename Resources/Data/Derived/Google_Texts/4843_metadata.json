Ted Cruz said the collapse of manufacturing in Detroit was a result of years of left-wing policies during Thursday\u2019s Fox News Republican debate. The moderators asked Cruz how he would bring jobs back to America, and his answer mostly revolved around criticizing regulations supported by Democrats.\n\n\u201cDetroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of left-wing policy,\u201d Cruz said Thursday night. \u201cAnd then for 50 years, left-wing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies, weak crime policies, and have driven the residents out.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed by the moderators on an answer to their question, Cruz replied that he would lift regulations like Obamacare and eliminate regulators like the Environmental Protection Agency. He argued that his \u201cbusiness flat tax\u201d plan would attract companies back to the United States and make them want to do more manufacturing here.\n\nPhoto: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nPhoto: Reuters/Jim Young Previous Next\n\nHis tax plan has come under fire from some critics who say it is basically a value-added tax (VAT tax), which is a consumption tax added to purchases for goods and services. Many countries rely on VAT taxes but they are unpopular in the U.S. Cruz has argued that his is a business flat tax, and he repeated that his plan would be good for businesses on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAmerican ingenuity can beat anyone but right now the government isn\u2019t giving us a level playing field,\u201d he said.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThursday\u2019s debate was expected to be an important moment for Cruz. During the last Republican debate, he and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio spent most of the evening attacking Donald Trump, but to little avail. Trump still swept both senators on Super Tuesday this week, taking home wins in seven states, while Cruz pulled out three states and Rubio earned his first win by carrying the Minnesota caucuses.\n\nCruz has tried to position himself as the only viable alternative to Trump, despite the fact that many in the Republican establishment dislike him at least as much or more than they dislike The Donald. Still, the Texas senator called on the other GOP candidates to unite behind him on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cFor the candidates who have not yet won a state, who have not racked up significant delegates, I ask you to prayerfully consider our coming together, uniting,\u201d Cruz said after winning the primary in his home state of Texas. \u201cThat is the only way to beat Donald Trump. Our campaign beats Donald Trump resoundingly. For that to happen we must come together.\u201d\n\nIn national polls, Cruz still sits in second place behind Trump, with Rubio in a close third and Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Ben Carson \u2014 who did not attend Thursday\u2019s debate and has said he will likely drop out of the race soon \u2014 at single digits. The question for Cruz ahead of Thursday\u2019s debate was whether he would focus his attacks on Trump once again or use the opportunity to take out his opponents for the non-Trump spot.\n\nThe debate marked the candidates\u2019 last chance to make a public appeal before another round of voting takes place on Saturday. With Trump continuing to accumulate delegates, the other candidates have felt increasing pressure to stop him before the math becomes too difficult and Trump has legitimate claim to the party\u2019s nomination.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ted cruz, donald trump, marco rubio, john kasich, fox news republican debate, republican debate, republican party, gop, republicans, presidential primary, president, 2016, white house, nomination, texas, super tuesday, attacks, establishment, michigan, us", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "The Texas senator said he was the best person to bring manufacturing jobs back to America.", "title": "Ted Cruz Blames Left-Wing Policy For Detroit's Destruction, Says His Tax Plan Will Bring Manufacturing Back", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/ted-cruz-blames-left-wing-policy-detroits-destruction-says-his-tax-plan-will-bring-2329861", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/03/04/gettyimages-513619430.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Texas senator said he was the best person to bring manufacturing jobs back to America.", "title": "Ted Cruz Blames Left-Wing Policy For Detroit's Destruction, Says His Tax Plan Will Bring Manufacturing Back", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/ted-cruz-blames-left-wing-policy-detroits-destruction-says-his-tax-plan-will-bring-2329861", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/03/04/gettyimages-513619430.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/03/04/gettyimages-513619430.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "National", "published_time": "2016-03-03T22:52:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-04T08:41:39-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Texas senator said he was the best person to bring manufacturing jobs back to America."}, "article_summary": "Texas Sen.
