According to Heather Fazio, the new Texas political director for the Marijuana Policy Project, “Medical marijuana will get an excellent hearing.” The fact that significant reform bills are already slated for discussion when the State Legislature reconvenes in early 2015 is one significant sign of this.

The political coalition that she is part of as much as forming right now also reflects the strong libertarian streak Texas is known for. And while Fazio admits that one of the toughest hurdles to overcome is the equally obstinate, if not reflexive, law and order theme that floats about the state, this is also a two-pronged conversation. Texas is a border state and the level of violence here from not “just” domestic assaults on the War on Drugs, but federal soldiers enforcing international borders and laws caused by just the war on cannabis is one of the most enduringly bloody in the country.

“One of the reasons I am so passionate about what I’m doing with moving drug reform forward is because of the absolutely devastating violence that we are seeing on the border because of the illegal drug trade,” says Fazio. “The cartels are very, very obviously willing to secure their hold on profits using extreme violence which will continue unless legalization occurs. That will allow Texas farmers and Texas entrepreneurs to provide a product we know there is a market for -- Texas patients - of whom veterans are a huge community.”
