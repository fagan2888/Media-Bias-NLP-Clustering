And polling data now shows Americans agree the Obama administration is being unfair to the Catholic nuns in attempting to coerce them into paying for abortion-causing drugs.\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor are asking the nation\u2019s highest court to ensure they do not have to comply with Obamacare\u2019s abortion mandate. The mandate compels religious groups to pay for birth control and drugs that may cause abortions.\n\nWithout relief, the Little Sisters would face millions of dollars in IRS fines because they cannot comply with the government\u2019s mandate that they give their employees free access to contraception, sterilization, and abortion-inducing drugs.\n\nThe Catholic News Agency has more on the new poll showing Americans side with the Little Sisters:\n\nAbout 53 percent of Americans said the process required by the government is \u201cunfair,\u201d while only 32 percent did not, according to a new Marist Poll commissioned by the Knights of Columbus. \u201cIt is not reasonable for the government to demand that some \u2013 and only some \u2013 religious employers engage in activity that is totally unnecessary to the government\u2019s stated purpose of providing elective and morally problematic drugs to employees,\u201d Carl Anderson, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, said April 18. \u201cSuch action doesn\u2019t just violate the rights of employers like the Little Sisters, it is also at odds with the American people\u2019s understanding of basic fairness, and our long-standing commitment to protecting the deeply-held beliefs of every American \u2013 especially when those beliefs are the minority view.\u201d The Marist Poll survey of 1,020 adults was sponsored by the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization with over 1.8 million members worldwide. It claims an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of Catholic nuns who care for the elderly poor, urged the Supreme Court to protect them from $70 million dollars in government fines for refusing to violate their Catholic faith. This is the second time the Sisters have been forced to ask the Supreme Court for protection from the government\u2019s efforts to make them to provide contraceptives to their employees. The Supreme Court gave the Sisters preliminary protection in January 2014, and it will hear their case in March of this year.\n\nFollow LifeNews.com on Instagram for pro-life pictures and the latest pro-life news.\n\n\u201cThe Little Sisters spend their lives taking care of the neediest members of our society \u2014that is work our government should applaud, not punish,\u201d said Mark Rienzi, Senior Counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. \u201cThe Little Sisters should not have to fight their own government to get an exemption it has already given to thousands of other employers, including big companies like Exxon and Pepsi Cola Bottling Company.\u201d\n\nTheir Supreme Court brief explains why the government does not need the Little Sisters at all: because it already has many other ways to get contraceptive coverage to those who want it. \u201cIndeed, the government has invested billions of dollars in creating exchanges for the express purpose of making it easy to obtain qualifying insurance when it is not available through an employer. The government cannot explain why those exchanges suffice to advance its goal of getting contraceptive coverage to the tens of millions of [other] people . . . yet are not good enough\u201d for the employees of the Little Sisters.\n\n\u201cAs Little Sisters of the Poor, we offer the neediest elderly of every race and religion a home where they are welcomed as Christ. We perform this loving ministry because of our faith and cannot possibly choose between our care for the elderly poor and our faith, and we shouldn\u2019t have to,\u201d said Sr. Loraine Marie Maguire, Mother Provincial of the Little Sisters of the Poor. \u201cAll we ask is that our rights not be taken away. The government exempts large corporations, small businesses, and other religious ministries from what they are imposing on us \u2013 we just want to keep serving the elderly poor as we have always done for 175 years. We look forward to the Supreme Court hearing our case, and pray for God\u2019s protection of our ministry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is ridiculous for the federal government to claim, in this day and age, that it can\u2019t figure out how to distribute contraceptives without involving nuns and their health plans.\u201d said Senior Counsel Mark Rienzi.\n\nPreviously, the Supreme Court ruled that the Christian-run Hobby Lobby doesn\u2019t have to obey the HHS mandate that is a part of Obamacare that requires businesses to pay for abortion causing drugs in their employee health care plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans Agree Obama Has Been Unfair to Little Sisters Trying to Make Them Fund Abortions", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The Supreme Court has heard the case from the Little Sisters of the Poor challenging the Obamacare HHS mandate that is forcing them to fund abortions.
