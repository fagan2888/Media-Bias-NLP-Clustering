The Independent Women’s Forum (IWF) is a conservative non-profit in the United States that recently filed an amicus curiae brief in support of Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged — a group that has petitioned the Supreme Court to take up its case against the Department of Health and Human Services.

The IWF argues that the 2012 mandate under the Affordable Care Act that requires all employer-sponsored insurance to cover a comprehensive list of contraceptive drugs and procedures without imposing any cost-sharing on the consumers at the time of service is not just pitting women against religious communities that object to the use of contraception, it is a mandate that will have adverse consequences on public health, distort health care markets, particularly for contraception, and threatens First Amendment rights.
