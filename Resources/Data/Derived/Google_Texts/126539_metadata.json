Mark Udall and Republican gubernatorial candidate Bob Beauprez \u2014 it lured out-of-state media wanting a chance to watch Colorado\u2019s election up close and personal.\n\nThe presence of The Washington Post, MSNBC and even Colorado news outlets that normally don\u2019t travel to Pueblo to cover the annual dinner further cements Colorado\u2019s status as a swing state.\n\nThe match-up between Udall and his Republican challenger, Rep. Cory Gardner, could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate after November. Gardner wasn\u2019t at the dinner, but participated in the State Fair parade the next day.\n\nBeauprez has already gotten plenty of help from the Republican Governors Association, from the RGA\u2019s controversial meddling in the GOP primary to the association\u2019s clever pool hall ad attacking Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper.\n\nPueblo County Commissioner Sal Pace, who received some of that national press two years ago when he ran for Congress, said among the topics he was asked about include Colorado\u2019s switch to same-day voter registration. The mood of Colorado voters \u2014 our economy\u2019s better but we\u2019re still mad about guns \u2014 was also another topic.\n\nThe dinner regularly attracts lawmakers and lobbyists, other elected officials, the governor\u2019s staff and Pueblo civil leaders.\n\nFor Beauprez, the son of a dairy farmer, going to the State Fair brings back plenty of memories. His dad Joe showed the champion steer in 1935, and father and son showed dairy cows in the 197s and 1980s.\n\n\u201cThis is all very familiar,\u201d Beauprez said.\n\nWhen Gov. Hickenlooper had his photo taken with Rep. Lois Landgraf, R-Fountain, he popped the usual joke about he wasn\u2019t certain whether it helped her or hurt her. \u201cI\u2019m running unopposed,\u201d she said, which got a big laugh from the governor.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bob Beauprez,Cory Gardner,John Hickenlooper,Mark Udall,Republican Governor's Association,Sal Pace", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Colorado's election has attracted plenty of attention from the national press, cementing its status as a swing state.", "title": "All eyes on Colorado's election", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/08/24/colorado-election-state-fair/111719/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/08/checkedshirtsw.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Colorado's election has attracted plenty of attention from the national press, cementing its status as a swing state.", "title": "All eyes on Colorado\u2019s election", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/08/24/colorado-election-state-fair/111719/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/08/checkedshirtsw.jpg", "creator": "@lynn_bartels", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Colorado's election has attracted plenty of attention from the national press, cementing its status as a swing state."}, "article_summary": "His dad Joe showed the champion steer in 1935, and father and son showed dairy cows in the 197s and 1980s.\nThe Colorado State Fair\u2019s legislative barbecue Friday night attracted more than U.S. Sen.
