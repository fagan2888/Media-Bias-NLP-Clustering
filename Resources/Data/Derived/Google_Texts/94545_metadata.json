It manifests itself in women differently than it does in men, which makes it one of the silent killers. In order to bring awareness to the disease that\u2019s killing more women than men today, an array of stars in red dresses and jumpers lined the runway last weekend for the American Heart Association (AHA) Go Red For Women Red Dress Collection 2015.\n\nBackstage in the Lincoln Center, to kick off Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York City, more than 20 celebrities from singer and fashion model Ciara to TV personality and fashion designer Kristin Cavallari dressed in runway red. Fashion was used as American Heart Month\u2019s mouthpiece to bring education and awareness to women of demographics.\n\nCiara walks the red runway in Lincoln Center.

Jones, who has survived heart disease for five years, was able to elect and schedule her own open heart surgery as a preventive measure for her heart disease. As a black woman, Jones was also at a higher risk for heart disease. At first, she wanted to become a financial donor to the AHA, but eventually became so much more and brought crucial attention to the disease.\n\n\u201cWhat we as women have to do is take control of our own health, demand answers, and be aware of what these symptoms can mean,\u201d Jones told Medical Daily. \u201cWomen by nature are nurturers. We take care of everybody around us. When you\u2019re getting on a plane you\u2019ll listen to the flight attendants give instructions, and the first thing they say \u2018in case of emergency, put your own oxygen mask on first before attempting to help others. And it reverberates in my mind at all times \u2014 if momma ain\u2019t healthy ain\u2019t nobody in the family is healthy. Getting your own health in order is of paramount importance.\u201d\n\nStar Jones holds up a heart for survivors.

When it comes to heart disease, 80 percent is preventable, which means eight out of 10 people who get heart disease could have avoided reaching that point of unhealthy cardiovascular crisis.\n\nEat Your Heart Out\n\n\u201cI feel like not only am I supporting women but when people see me they think of food,\u201d Top Chef and co-host of The Chew, Carla Hall, told Medical Daily. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be a reminder to be in control of your food and that is one way that we can be in control of this disease. High blood pressure, sodium, especially in the African-American community, and the fact that I am from Tennessee, where all of that southern food people eat is unhealthy. But I have always had to balance keeping my southern traditions and health.\u201d\n\nCarla Hall backstage getting ready for her dress.

By making good food choices, such as including a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, salmon, tuna, skinless chicken and turkey, nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils, you will be giving your body the best fighting chance it has against the disease, according to the AHA. Limit sugar, saturated fats, and trans fats in your diet, while minimizing sodium intake and moderating alcohol, and maintaining at least 30 minutes of exercise a day.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother died of a heart attack. She was always taking care of other people,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re sick we say, \u2018I can keep going, I can keep going because I have to take care, I have to nurture, I have to do something for someone else.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s also a huge factor.\u201d\n\nFurthering the theme of food health and wellness, the AHA handed out booklets containing 200 light and easy \u201cHealthy Recipes for Your Heart\u201d to the attending guests. A southern favorite repurposed into healthy goodness is the Spicy Over-Fried Chicken, which takes 30 minutes in the oven and costs you 195 calories per serving. For winter months, turn to the Vegetarian Two-Bean Chili, which takes 20 minutes to cook and weighs in at 291 calories per sodium. All of the recipes are low sodium and filling for men and women.\n\nEvery day since 2004, more than 275 women\u2019s lives have been saved by Go Red For Women movement. The success of speaking out about heart health and the gender and ethnic disparities has shown brightly with each step beneath the flashing lights of the runway.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "carla, hall, chew, how, feed, heart, health, plus, ny, fashion, weeks, go, red, women, show, photos", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Heart health can be nearly eradicated with diet, so Carla Hall paired up with the AHA to teach you how.", "title": "Celebs Take On Heart Health At NY Fashion Week [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/carla-hall-chew-how-feed-heart-health-plus-ny-fashion-weeks-go-red-women-show-photos-322416", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/16/american-heart-association-fashion-show.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Heart health can be nearly eradicated with diet, so Carla Hall paired up with the AHA to teach you how.", "title": "Celebs Take On Heart Health At NY Fashion Week [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/carla-hall-chew-how-feed-heart-health-plus-ny-fashion-weeks-go-red-women-show-photos-322416", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/16/american-heart-association-fashion-show.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/16/american-heart-association-fashion-show.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-16T18:04:32-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-17T10:31:55-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Heart health can be nearly eradicated with diet, so Carla Hall paired up with the AHA to teach you how."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e7a\"", "article_summary": "When it comes to heart disease, 80 percent is preventable, which means eight out of 10 people who get heart disease could have avoided reaching that point of unhealthy cardiovascular crisis.\nJones, who has survived heart disease for five years, was able to elect and schedule her own open heart surgery as a preventive measure for her heart disease.\nCiara walks the red runway in Lincoln Center.\nHeart disease is the No.\nPhoto courtesy of Steven ChencharikHall is bringing awareness to an often overlooked factor in heart disease, and that\u2019s diet."}
