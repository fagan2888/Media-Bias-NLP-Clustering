Pew! Soldiers with handheld energy blasters are the stuff of G.I. Joe, not real life \u2026 until now. The U.S Army is currently testing electricity guns for possible use against electronics on the battlefield. They don\u2019t look like props from the popular cartoon show but, rather like regular standard-issue M4 rifles with a pair of antennas that shoot out from the barrel and then spread, giving the front end of the gun a musket-like shape.\n\nSoldiers \u201calready carry rifles. Why not use something that every soldier already carries,\u201d said James E. Burke, an electronics engineer with the U.S.Army\u2019s Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center, or ARDEC. Burke spoke with Defense One at a National Defense Industry Association event in Baltimore on Tuesday.\n\nRelated: This Lethal Laser Could Cripple ISIS and Other Enemies\n\nBurke\u2019s apparatus, which he\u2019s named the \u201cBurke Pulser,\u201d consists of two wide antennas, a piezoelectric generator and a few other small bits and pieces. It has a blast shield to protect the user from electricity levels that the inventor describes as \u201chazardous.\u201d\n\nThe Pulser takes the explosive energy released when the gun fires and converts it into pulses of electrical energy. This is done via the piezoelectric effect, which derives an electric charge when pressure is exerted on crystalline materials such as quartz, changing the balance of positive and negative ions.\n\nThe Pulser isn\u2019t the first electricity gun ever invented. One of the more interesting prototypes that have emerged over the last several years came from, Seattle-based hacker Rob Flickenger, who cast a Nerf gun in aluminum and rigged it to shoot 20,000 volts of electricity a short distance.\n\nThe military, too, has been experimenting with so-called energy weapons for decades, including lasers. \u201cMost of these are vehicle-towed and require a huge power system,\u201d Burke noted. \u201cThe antennas are sometimes seven feet.\u201d The Burke Pulser, meanwhile, fits onto an M4 rifle like a standard suppressor. Burke estimates that the cost to mass-produce them would be less than $1,000 each.\n\nWhat do you do with an energy gun? You don\u2019t shoot people. The gun is intended for use against electronics, potentially giving dismounted soldiers an edge against the ever-wider range electronic and cyber threats that they might face on patrol:Bluetooth-enabled improvised explosive devices, consumer drones modified to be more deadly, and the like.\n\nRelated: 7 New Weapons in Vladimir Putin's Arsenal\n\nThe Army is currently testing the Pulser against an assortment of devices, a 555 timer, a bipolar junction transistor and a yellow light emitting diode, or LED, combined into a single target. \u201cAll these things pretty much generalize all the common electronics you\u2019ll find in a circuit board,\u201d Burke said.\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is fire at it. If the LED light stops blinking, it was defeated and if smoke comes up, it was destroyed.\u201d\n\nAs for the range, \u201cwe\u2019re still investigating,\u201d said Burke The capabilities measured so far \u201cturn classified very quickly.\u201d He couldn\u2019t go into detail about how the tests were progressing, but he called them \u201cvery promising.\u201d\n\nThis article oringially appeared on DefenseOne.\n\nRead more from DefenseOne:\n\nShinzo Abe Is the Ally America Needs\n\nThe United States Needs a Drone Board\n\nRand Paul's Drone Reversal", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Pew!
