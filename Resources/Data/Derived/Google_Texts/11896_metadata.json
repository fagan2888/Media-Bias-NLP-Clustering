(REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton)\n\n4037512\n\nKarl Rove, the voice of the Republican donor class, is predicting that tea party-backed primary candidates will lose nearly all their primary fights against business-backed GOP politicians during 2014.\n\n\u201cEvery Republican senator and virtually every representative challenged in a primary as insufficiently conservative will win,\u201d Rove wrote in a Dec. 26 blog post, an excerpt of which appeared in The Wall Street Journal. The op-ed listed his predictions about American politics in 2014.\n\nRove\u2019s business vs. tea party prediction is somewhat self-serving \u2014 he\u2019s positioned himself as a leader of the GOP-affiliated donors and businesses who are facing criticism from the tea party\u2019s populist advocates of small government.\n\nRove, however, leaves himself wiggle room to claim victory next December even if his business donors fail to gain a glorious victory over the GOP\u2019s small-government voters.\n\nHis careful language doesn\u2019t predict that all GOP business-backed incumbents will survive the populist wave, and doesn\u2019t promise that GOP primary voters will always pick business-favored candidates instead of tea party candidates.\n\nSo if a few GOP House members are dethroned by the tea party, and if few or most business guys strike out in Senate primaries, or if the GOP leadership ignores business priorities, Rove still gets to declare next December that his 2014 predictions were correct.\n\nBut Rove\u2019s 2014 predictions are an important guide to the short-term priorities of the establishment GOP.\n\nJudging by his article, the GOP establishment will focus on Obamacare \u2014 and avoid divisive issues like immigration \u2014 in a determined effort to win a majority in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIn reaction to ObamaCare, GOP political divisions are giving way to unity,\u201d Rove wrote.\n\n\u201cTens of millions more Americans will lose their coverage and find that new ObamaCare plans have higher premiums, larger deductibles and fewer doctors. Enrollment numbers will be smaller than projected and budget outlays will be higher,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSupport for ObamaCare will drop below 30%, causing congressional Democrats to clamber for major changes and delays,\u201d he said.\n\nIn November, \u201cRepublicans will keep the House with a modest pickup of 4-6 seats [and] the GOP will most likely end up with 50 or 51 Senate seats,\u201d said Rove.\n\nBut Rove\u2019s business allies may make that GOP unity impossible. For example, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is threatening to spent $50 million in primary races to help their business-friendly candidates defeat small-government tea party candidates, according to a Dec. 26 Wall Street Journal news-article.\n\nThat determination is laced with contempt for the Tea Party members who created the GOP\u2019s House majority in 2010 and 2012. \u201cOur No. 1 focus is to make sure, when it comes to the Senate, that we have no loser candidates\u2026 our mantra [is]: No fools on our ticket,\u201d Scott Reed, the chamber\u2019s top political strategist, told the Journal.\n\nTo bolster his prediction of victory in November, Rove downplayed possibly the most divisive fight in 2014 \u2014 the battle over the joint effort by liberals and businesses to triple immigration over the next 10 years.\n\nIn that battle, Big Business has allied itself with liberals because executives want to import more immigrant and guest-worker labor so they can reduce costs.\n\nIn his 2013 predictions, Rove predicted that Republicans would give at least lip service to reforming the immigration system: \u201cOn immigration, Republicans will advance a framework that includes border security, guest workers and a lengthy, difficult road to citizenship.\u201d\n\nHe also predicted that Obama\u2019s immigration effort would fail because it wouldn\u2019t bring in enough low-wage guest workers. \u201cAn immigration proposal put forward by Mr. Obama will go nowhere because it lacks a credible guest-worker program and contains too speedy a path to citizenship,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s Senate-passed bill does permanently double the inflow of guest workers to more than one million per year.\n\nThat bill would also triple the legal inflow of Democratic-leaning immigrants to 30 million over the next 10 years, and boost business profits.\n\nSince then, GOP House Speaker John Boehner has blocked its advance, possibly because he knows the increase in guest workers is even more unpopular among the GOP\u2019s base-votes and among swing-voters than the proposed amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants. One poll showed that the guest-worker proposal got strong support from only two percent of respondents.\n\nObama is looking for GOP cooperation, and claimed recently that Boehner is signaling some support for immigration legislation, even as other GOP leaders \u2014 such as Sen. Jeff Sessions \u2014 and reform groups \u2014 such as NumbersUSA \u2014 argue that high levels of immigration make Americans more dependent on big government and less supportive of the GOP.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "'Every Republican senator and virtually every representative challenged in a primary as insufficiently conservative will win'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Karl Rove, the voice of the\u00a0Republican donor class, is predicting that tea party-backed primary candidates will lose nearly all their primary fights against business-backed GOP politicians during 201", "title": "Rove predicts GOP unity and Senate win in 2014", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/12/26/rove-predicts-gop-unity-and-senate-win-in-2014/", "image": {"width": 1143, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/karl-rove-reuters-e1455309965303.jpg", "height": 492}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Every Republican senator and virtually every representative challenged in a primary as insufficiently conservative will win'", "title": "Rove predicts GOP unity and Senate win in 2014 Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/12/26/rove-predicts-gop-unity-and-senate-win-in-2014/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/karl-rove-reuters-e1455309965303.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-26 17:36:08", "sailthru.title": "Rove predicts GOP unity and Senate win in 2014", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "republican-party,neil-munro", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "karl rove,republican party", "sailthru.description": "Karl Rove, the voice of the\u00a0Republican donor class, is predicting that tea party-backed primary candidates will lose nearly all their primary fights against business-backed GOP politicians during 201", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/karl-rove-reuters-e1455309965303.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21a2\"", "article_summary": "His careful language doesn\u2019t predict that all GOP business-backed incumbents will survive the populist wave, and doesn\u2019t promise that GOP primary voters will always pick business-favored candidates instead of tea party candidates.\nThat determination is laced with contempt for the Tea Party members who created the GOP\u2019s House majority in 2010 and 2012.\n\u201cIn reaction to ObamaCare, GOP political divisions are giving way to unity,\u201d Rove wrote.\n(REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton)4037512Karl Rove, the voice of the Republican donor class, is predicting that tea party-backed primary candidates will lose nearly all their primary fights against business-backed GOP politicians during 2014.\nJudging by his article, the GOP establishment will focus on Obamacare \u2014 and avoid divisive issues like immigration \u2014 in a determined effort to win a majority in the Senate."}
