Seven of the Democratic lawmakers surrounding President Obama when he signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 are either now out of Congress or on their way out.

As depicted in this Daily Caller graphic, seven smiling Democrats have gone down or out in the last four years.

Among the retirees:

Tom Harkin: The Iowa senator announced last year that he will step down after completing his fifth term in 2015.

Chris Dodd: The Connecticut Democrat chose not to run for re-election in 2010 and now works as a lobbyist for the motion picture industry.

John Dingell: Michigan congressman Dingell announced his retirement Monday, effective at the end of this year, after nearly six decades in the House.

Patrick Kennedy: The Rhode Island Democrat’s 2011 retirement marked the first time since 1947 that no Kennedys were in Congress. That phenomenon was short-lived.

Henry Waxman: The mustachioed California congressman is not seeking re-election in 2014.

George Miller: The California Democrat announced last month that he will retire from the House at the end of his current term.

Max Baucus: The Montana Democrat resigned from the Senate this month to become Obama’s ambassador to China, ensuring that he’ll get to deal with the Communists now instead of having to go back and face Montana voters.

Who will be the next Democrat to bite the dust?
