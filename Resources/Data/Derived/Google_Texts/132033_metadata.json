The vote will set the stage for a full vote in the Senate regarding a broader package of legislation that would streamline and incentivize development of drugs and devices.\n\nThe five bills, which join 14 other bills that has been with mostly unanimous support from Democrats and Republicans, endorsed a prior hearings in February and March. The bills are collectively a Senate version of the 21st Century Cures Act that was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives last year.\n\nChairman of the committee, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said on Wednesday that if the legislation does eventually become law that \u201cit will be the most important bill that Congress enacts this year.\u201d\n\nWhile the effort has received bipartisan support, the parties have not been in total agreement. A central demand from Democrats is for billions of additional dollars in permanent annual funding be allocated for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe two sides are \u201cmaking progress\u201d toward a deal on so-called mandatory funding, Alexander said. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the committee\u2019s ranking member, acknowledged Alexander\u2019s efforts, saying additional funding is essential to Democratic support for the various bills.\n\n\u201cWe need an agreement on how we\u2019re going to boost mandatory investment in the NIH and the FDA,\u201d said Murray.\n\nS. 2700, the FDA and NIH Workforce Authorities Modernization Act, was included in Wednesday\u2019s bill, which would allow the agencies greater hiring authority.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure there\u2019s a sufficient amount of brainpower within those agencies\u201d to support FDA approvals and determine what research the NIH should be doing,\u201d said Alexander.\n\nS. 185, a second bill, the Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act, would direct the FDA to approve antibiotics for serious medical needs based on risk-benefit profiles of intended profiles of the narrow population, as opposed to a broader spectrum of patients.\n\nA third bill endorsed by the committee, S. 2713, the Advancing Precision Medicine Act, would implement the White House\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiative. It is intended to improve understanding of distinct disease characteristics in individual patients, allowing physicians to select drugs that are more likely to work.\n\nThe Promoting Biomedical Research and Public Health for Patients Act, S. 2742, would try to ease administrative red tape for NIH staff as well as increase performance evaluations for NIH leadership. The fifth bill, S. 2745, called the NIH Strategic Plan and Inclusion of Clinical Research, would try to increase minority representation in clinical trials.\n\nThe FDA would be required under one amendment adopted at Wednesday\u2019s hearing to explain its decisions to issue guidance rather than engaging in formal rulemaking. The amendment passed over Democratic opposition, with Murray adding that FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf is \u201cvery concerned\u201d the obligation would be time-consuming and might \u201cthrow some sand in the gears of the agency\u2019s important public health work.\u201d\n\nIn February and March many other provisions were included in the bills advanced by the committee. Incentives included are those for pediatric research, eased approvals for certain drug-device \u201ccombination products,\u201d improvements to electronic health records, an expanded program of fast-track review for breakthrough medical devices and relaxed regulations for some types of lower risk health software.\n\nSource: Sweeping Medical Innovation Bill Nears Senate Vote\n\nPhoto credit: commons.wikimedia.org\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medical innovation bill nears Senate vote as the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on Wednesday advanced five bills", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Eric Needs", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "Medical innovation bill nears Senate vote as the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on Wednesday advanced five bills", "title": "Medical Innovation Bill Nears Senate Vote - Legal Reader", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Capitol-Senate.jpg", "url": "http://www.legalreader.com/medical-innovation-bill-nears-senate-vote/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"app_id": 1598871133679697}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thelegalreader", "section": "News & Politics", "published_time": "2016-04-08T15:46:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Medical innovation bill nears Senate vote as the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions advanced five bills on Wednesday aimed at strengthening medical research.\nSource: Sweeping Medical Innovation Bill Nears Senate VotePhoto credit: commons.wikimedia.orgJoin the Discussion\nThe vote will set the stage for a full vote in the Senate regarding a broader package of legislation that would streamline and incentivize development of drugs and devices.\nThe bills are collectively a Senate version of the 21st Century Cures Act that was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives last year.\nS. 2700, the FDA and NIH Workforce Authorities Modernization Act, was included in Wednesday\u2019s bill, which would allow the agencies greater hiring authority."}
