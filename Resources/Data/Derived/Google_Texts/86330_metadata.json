Bentley outlined his plan in a December 2014 address.\n\n\"Two years ago we embarked on a very ambitious mission, and that was to transform Alabama's Medicaid program into more efficient and more affordable program for Alabama's taxpayers,\" Gov. Bentley said.\n\nThis will affect health services for 655,000 poor mothers, children, and some disabled and elderly residents, Bentley's office said. It's not an expansion of Medicaid, related to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHuntsville Hospital is among the health care providers who will be part of the new regional network. CEO David Spillers said the approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is a start.\n\n\"The approval by CMS confirms that the plan to reform Alabama Medicaid is worthy of funding,\" said Spillers.\n\nSpillers said more should be done, though.\n\n\"CMS is providing start-up funds only for the transition to Regional Care Organizations. These monies are not for Medicaid expansion, which we continue to support,\" he added.\n\nRecent estimates find 140,000 Alabama residents still fall into the coverage gap, where they aren't eligible for Medicaid and don't make enough money for an Obamacare health coverage tax credit.\n\nGovernor Bentley proposed moving money from the Education Trust Fund to shore up a $157 million budget shortfall for the fiscal year that begins October 1.\n\nRead more on the changes.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "32.366805;-86.299969", "description": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. - Tuesday, Governor Robert Bentley announced the federal government will provide up to $750 million to Alabama during five years to help establish a regional managed care system for Medicaid.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "ef3232fc915138f86f550fcf7ba418f7"}, "og": {"site_name": "WHNT.com", "description": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2013 Tuesday, Governor Robert Bentley announced the federal government will provide up to $750 million to Alabama during five years to help establish a regional managed care sys\u2026", "title": "Gov.
