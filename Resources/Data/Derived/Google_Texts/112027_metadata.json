This is not because of the reason you might suspect \u2013 that Republicans will obstinately endeavor to obstruct Obamacare in every way they can (though that seems to be the case). Instead, even after the smoke clears from the government shutdown (presumably with the law intact), the battle over universal healthcare will still not be over, but for a more fundamental reason: Obamacare, whatever its advantages (and despite the right\u2019s worst fears), does not create a system of universal healthcare.\n\nNow first, to be clear, this is not to say that Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act won\u2019t help many people. The uninsured who become eligible for coverage through the expansion of Medicaid, for example, will of course be better off \u2013 assuming they don\u2019t live in one of the 20 or more states that have callously elected to deny them this potentially lifesaving opportunity. Additionally, many uninsured who were previously unable to afford private health insurance may now be able to do so, for instance through the new income-based premium subsidies. And most of us will benefit from many of the law\u2019s insurance reforms, like the one that prevents insurers\u2019 from denying us coverage because we are sick.\n\nAnd at the same time, have no doubt: The various Republican alternatives for American healthcare would be disastrous. Consider the most recent GOP healthcare proposal H.R. 3121, which would gut state insurance regulations, eliminate popular ACA reforms like the ban on \u201cpreexisting conditions,\u201d end the Medicaid expansion, and provide tax benefits that would preferentially benefit the wealthy, among other unhelpful proposals that would do nothing to help the uninsured. Conservative \u201cconsumer-driven\u201d healthcare dreams, more generally, would in truth be nightmares, radically furthering the transformation of healthcare into yet another commodity, bought by \u201cconsumers\u201d in proportion to their means, not provided to patients on the basis of their needs.\n\nYet these facts don\u2019t change the fundamental fact that the ACA will not create what so many of us want, what the right so fervently fears, and \u2013 most important \u2013 what so many people really need: true universal healthcare. Why?\n\nFirst, on a basic level, the ACA is not universal healthcare because though it will reduce uninsurance, it won\u2019t provide universal coverage. According to the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s May 2013 estimates, even by 2020 some 30 million Americans will be left uninsured under the ACA, a number that can only be partially attributed to intransigent Republican state governments that have blocked the expansion of Medicaid in their states.\n\nBut even putting aside those 30 million people, the ACA is insufficient because it will not deliver what most of us think of as universal healthcare: a system of equitable and comprehensive care for all, with full protection against the cost of illness. Indeed, on the contrary, underway already is a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d in American healthcare, in the words of Dr. Drew Altman of the Kaiser Foundation, that moves us \u201cfrom more comprehensive to less comprehensive\u201d health insurance, with patients paying more and more out of pocket every time they get sick. Ironically, even with the ACA going into full effect, \u201cthe vision of insurance that they\u2019ve [conservatives] always favored,\u201d as Altman told the New York Times, \u201cwith more skin in the game, is the one that\u2019s coming to dominate in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nThe data clearly show, for instance, that with each passing year, more and more of the insured are already paying higher and higher deductibles, co-pays, and co-insurance whenever they actually need to use their expensive insurance (despite unsurprising evidence that rising out-of-pocket expenses can deter people from seeking needed medical care). In another disturbing trend, major employers \u2013 including Walgreens, Sears and Darden restaurants \u2013 seem to be moving away from \u201cfixed benefit\u201d health insurance to \u201cfixed contribution\u201d plans, in which employees receive a lump sum to buy a healthcare plan, with no guarantee that these contributions will keep up with the cost of health insurance in future years. It should be noted that this \u201cquiet revolution\u201d toward higher out-of-pocket expenses and more limited benefits is not of the ACA\u2019s making. At the same time, however, the ACA will do little to reverse it (and, in the case of the new excise tax on \u201cCadillac\u201d healthcare plans, may even exacerbate it).\n\nMeanwhile, for those not insured by their employer and who buy health insurance on the state exchanges that opened on Oct. 1, \u201cunderinsurance\u201d may very well become the norm. The plans on the exchanges will be offered in tiers, with the lowest level \u2013 the Bronze plan \u2013 only required to have an actuarial value of 60 percent (that is to say, the percent of your average annual healthcare expenses that insurance actually pays for), with out-of-pocket annual expenses (after your premium is paid) reaching as high as $12,700 a year for families (depending on income). Moreover, to keep premiums in check, many of these plans will have significantly limited networks of doctors and hospitals, bringing back memories of 1990s managed care. In Missouri, for instance, the Anthem BlueCross BlueShield Plans sold on the exchange will exclude one of the state\u2019s top hospital systems, thereby denying access to the state\u2019s primary academic medical center and its prominent children\u2019s hospital.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right hates the new healthcare law because they think its reach will be universal.
