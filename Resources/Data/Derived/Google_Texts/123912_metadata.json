Lucca, a 12-year-old German Shepherd, is just the latest example of these four-legged war heroes.\n\nTrained to sniff out explosives, Lucca completed more than 400 missions throughout her six years of service with the military. It\u2019s estimated that she saved thousands of lives, including U.S. troops, allied forces, and locals, while she served in Afghanistan and Iraq. The true number, of course, is impossible to know.\n\nThroughout her service there was not a single human casualty during any of her patrols. Unfortunately, however, her last one was in March of 2012 when she and her handler found a 30-lb IED in Afghanistan. While they searched, a second bomb exploded, injuring Lucca but miraculously no one else.\n\nHer front left leg had to be amputated and she suffered severe burns to the chest, but after being medevaced to Germany for recovery, she was up and walking again a mere 10 days later.\n\nThis week her incredible service and heroism were honored in London, where Lucca received the PDSA Dickin medal, which is the highest honor any animal can receive while serving in military conflict. According to the PDSA website, it is widely recognized as the animal version of receiving the Victoria Cross, and \u201cacknowledges outstanding acts of bravery or devotion to duty displayed by animals serving with the Armed Forces or Civil Defence units in any theatre of war throughout the world.\u201d\n\nLucca, who has since been adopted by one of her previous handlers, accepted the medal during a ceremony at the Wellington Barracks. She\u2019s the first Marine Corps working dog to receive the award.\n\n\u201cLucca is very intelligent, loyal and had an amazing drive for work as a search dog,\u201d said her owner Gunnery Sergeant Willingham.\n\n\u201cIn addition to her incredible detection capabilities, Lucca was instrumental in increasing moral for the troops we supported. In between missions, I took the searching harness off and let her play and interact with the troops.\n\n\u201cDue to her personality, demeanor and proficiency as a search dog, Lucca made friends wherever she went. Today, I do my best to keep her spoiled in her well-deserved retirement.\u201d\n\nLucca was responsible for discovering a number of IEDs and apprehending four insurgents.\n\n\u201cLucca\u2019s conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty makes her a hugely deserving recipient of the PDSA Dickin Medal,\u201d said Jan McLoughlin, director general of the PDSA. \u201cHer ability and determination to seek out arms and explosives preserved human life amid some of the world\u2019s fiercest military conflicts.\u201d\n\nBravo, Lucca!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gallantry. .05/26/2016 19:39:13PM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Gallantry.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - US War Dog Receives Highest Honor for Military Service", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/04/07/us-military-working-dog-awarded-highest-medal-for-service-animals-n2144840", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/4/7/12.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Gallantry.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - US War Dog Receives Highest Honor for Military Service", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/04/07/us-military-working-dog-awarded-highest-medal-for-service-animals-n2144840", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/4/7/12.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "US War Dog Receives Highest Honor for Military Service , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDue to her personality, demeanor and proficiency as a search dog, Lucca made friends wherever she went.\nMilitary working dogs save countless lives on the battlefield, so it\u2019s only fitting that they too get some recognition for their hard work.\nTrained to sniff out explosives, Lucca completed more than 400 missions throughout her six years of service with the military.\nShe\u2019s the first Marine Corps working dog to receive the award.\n\u201cHer ability and determination to seek out arms and explosives preserved human life amid some of the world\u2019s fiercest military conflicts.\u201dBravo, Lucca!"}
