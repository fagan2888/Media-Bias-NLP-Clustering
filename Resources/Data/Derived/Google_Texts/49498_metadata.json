It thus helps both parties avoid the main concerns of women.\n\nWomen, who are 51 percent of the population, want and need to be listened to across a wider spectrum of our backgrounds and experiences.\n\nWomen are not chattel property nor is the activity of our wombs around birth control or other personal choices the government\u2019s business for which we should expect others to pay.\n\nThough the women\u2019s vote going forward is again in play, it should not have taken the efforts of CNN pollsters Nicole McCleskey, Linda DiVall and Kellyanne Conway to figure out the obvious: the status quo isn\u2019t working any more for women.\n\nThey want substance and solutions:\n\nAs today\u2019s youth understand, women know it is all about \u201cthe Benjamins.\u201d Money talks and all else walks. Women want control and choices over our lives reflecting who we are.\n\nAs managers of our own budgets we can\u2019t spend what we don\u2019t have and would appreciate the government doing the same.\n\nMost of us must work; therefore, equal pay must be tendered for equal, not equivalent, work.\n\nThe government must quit creatively taxing us at every avenue and leave us with more money to take home than the government takes while allowing us to fund our own business ventures.\n\nThe government\u2019s role relating to our children is a struggle which hasn\u2019t been adequately discussed much less dealt with.\n\nJobs and the economy sit at the heart of our ability to provide for our families and ourselves, educate our children or have engaging and satisfying futures holding hope for the possibility of retirement.\n\nObamacare\u2019s one size fits all philosophy limits our choices, costs more than most will ultimately be able to pay for the insurance and doesn\u2019t guarantee access or same provider services.\n\nIn their concentration and fights over reproductive health, whether birth control is used, is a choice which Republicans can\u2019t take away, and the individual woman must rightfully retain.\n\nAn understanding which Democrats and others won\u2019t verbalize, though they know it is right, and must accept is that in making our choices, nowhere in the US Constitution, does it state the government will be responsible for paying for that individual choice.\n\nThis is the gap, not gender but in public policy understandings.\n\nThe women\u2019s vote, a right to it was delivered by the Republican Party in 1920, is not monolithic nor are our issues or approaches to them all the same.\n\nWe want to participate in an equal opportunity society which while giving us responsibility for our choices and allowing us more flexibility, less regulations over our lives.\n\nThrough job growth and personal responsibility, we will find women are not just the life of the party, but per Abraham Lincoln, are the hands which rock the cradle undergirding the nation.\n\nDR.
