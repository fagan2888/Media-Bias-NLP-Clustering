Julie Larsen Maher/Wildlife Conservation Society\n\nLike members of the New York Giants, these guys are big, muscular and call New York home. But unlike the team, these giants are not very fast.\n\nTwo giant Aldabra tortoises named Rocket and Abdul are settling into their new home at the Bronx Zoo, in an exhibit built to resemble their natural habitat.\n\nThe two male tortoises weigh approximately 400 and 600 pounds. Julie Larsen Maher/Wildlife Conservation Society\n\nRocket, who weighs about 600 pounds, and Abdul, who clocks in at about 400 pounds, have access to a fresh water pool and \u201clush vegetation\u201d in their new home at the Zoo.\n\nGiant Aldabra tortoises are believed to live 200 years or more and are able to swim, taking dips in water to help regulate their temperatures, according to the Zoo. Native to the Aldabra atoll in the Seychelles, they are one of only two species of giant tortoises remaining.\n\nThe tortoises have been housed in an exhibit that is designed to imitate their natural habitat, with plenty of vegetation and a freshwater pool. Julie Larsen Maher/Wildlife Conservation Society\n\nGiant Aldabra tortoises are classified as \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. An estimated 100,000 remain in the wild, according to the Zoo.\n\nThe tortoises arrived at the Bronx Zoo last year as the exhibit was being constructed and made their public debut last week.\n\nRelated video:\n\nTwo giant Aldabra tortoises called Rocket and Abdul are settling into their new home at the Bronx Zoo.
