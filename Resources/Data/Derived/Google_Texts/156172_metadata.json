Opposition, in some cases, has been based on sincere and deeply held beliefs. All of us who welcome today\u2019s news should be mindful of that fact and recognize different viewpoints, revere our deep commitment to religious freedom.\n\nIn other words, \u201cIf you like your religion, you can keep your religion.\u201d\n\nThis statement from our president is no truer than his lie during the ObamaCare debate about being able to keep your doctor and insurance under ObamaCare.\n\nObama knew he was lying then. Obama knows he is lying now about protecting religious freedom.\n\nLegalizing same sex marriage was not the endgame for the Left \u2014 it is in fact the creation of a weapon that will now be used to marginalize, punish, terrorize, and decimate the Christian religion, its practitioners, and the Church itself.\n\nThe small business owners and CEOs already targeted for extinction by the Left are just the beginning.\n\nChurches that refuse to perform same sex weddings will not only be relentlessly shamed as bigots by the left and their allies in the mainstream media, their tax-exempt status will be also challenged; their ability to perform public services will be extinguished. The media is smoothing this jihad, but it is already happening.\n\nNaturally, the government will take religion\u2019s place.\n\nObama can sing \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t believe a word of it.\n\nObama\u2019s a proven liar, and his comments about respecting religion are a tactical move to get us to take down our guard.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama On Gay Marriage: 'If You Like Your Religion, You Can Keep Your Religion'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama On Gay Marriage: 'If You Like Your Religion, You Can Keep Your Religion'", "title": "Obama On Gay Marriage: 'If You Like Your Religion, You Can Keep Your Religion' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 719, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Bundesrat-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-06-27T08:11:41-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/27/obama-on-gay-marriage-if-you-like-your-religion-you-can-keep-your-religion/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama On Gay Marriage: 'If You Like Your Religion, You Can Keep Your Religion'", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Bundesrat-Getty.jpg", "title": "Obama On Gay Marriage: 'If You Like Your Religion, You Can Keep Your Religion' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, Gay Marriage,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-06-27T08:08:02-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-06-27T08:11:41-07:00", "tag": "Gay Marriage", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd73ee\"", "article_summary": "Obama\u2019s a proven liar, and his comments about respecting religion are a tactical move to get us to take down our guard.\nLegalizing same sex marriage was not the endgame for the Left \u2014 it is in fact the creation of a weapon that will now be used to marginalize, punish, terrorize, and decimate the Christian religion, its practitioners, and the Church itself.\nObama can sing \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t believe a word of it.\nObama knows he is lying now about protecting religious freedom.\nAll of us who welcome today\u2019s news should be mindful of that fact and recognize different viewpoints, revere our deep commitment to religious freedom."}
