It\u2019s a monument to the neoliberal reshaping of our southern neighbor\u2019s economy, and to the social and cultural interpenetration between America and Mexico in a paradoxical era of supposed closed borders and supposed free trade. This burgeoning new city bristles with all the incoherent architectural detail of an upscale suburb outside Houston or Phoenix \u2013 Tudor meets Gothic meets Mission meets ranch \u2013 but is eerily, deadly quiet. That\u2019s because none of its residents are actually alive.\n\nThis is the Culiac\u00e1n cemetery, crowded with hundreds of young men who got rich and died young in Mexico\u2019s drug wars, to be interred behind bulletproof glass in McMansion-style crypts, alongside their customized Silverado pickups, their kitsch-heroic color portraits, their stuffed animals and religious icons, their AK-47s. Every army honors its fallen in its own way, and as we see in Shaul Schwarz\u2019s arresting documentary \u201cNarco Cultura,\u201d this place is hallowed ground for warriors of the Sinaloa Cartel, which is probably the dominant criminal organization in Mexico, North America and the world. If you\u2019ve purchased marijuana or cocaine or crystal meth or almost any other illegal drug during the past decade or so, then you helped pay for this place, and helped put people in it too.\n\nI know that\u2019s harsh. I\u2019m not actually saying that ordinary Americans\u2019 desire to get high is the fundamental problem behind the nihilistic cycle of Mexico\u2019s drug wars, only that this is one of those situations where there\u2019s more than enough blame to go around. America\u2019s demented drug policy and its voracious appetite for drugs have fueled the violence, as has the unresolved social and political crisis in Mexico, a nation corrupted and distorted from top to bottom by drug money. One could argue that the real villain is neither Mexican nor American, but a global free-trade ideology that pretends to be neutral and apolitical. Schwarz\u2019s film is about how the drug trade and the drug war have transformed Mexican culture on both sides of the border, but what we see in that Culiac\u00e1n graveyard is that the values of the drug war, and indeed the values of organized crime more generally, are just the values of capitalism pushed to a grotesque extreme.\n\nMore than 60,000 people have been killed in Mexico since 2006, when then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n, a pro-American free-marketeer with a Harvard MBA, launched a military-style campaign against the nation\u2019s drug cartels, which were already locked in internecine warfare against each other. (He also allowed the DEA to cross the border and operate openly within Mexico for the first time.) Those are just the government\u2019s murder statistics; many observers believe the real harvest of death is more like 100,000. As a melancholy crime-scene investigator in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez named Richi Soto tells Schwarz, his notorious border city \u2013 a major hub for narcotics transport into the United States \u2013 had more than 3,000 reported murders in 2010 alone. Across the river in El Paso, Texas, there were five murders that year. (While the murder rate in Ju\u00e1rez has decreased since then, it remains extremely high by world standards, and the overall rate of drug-related crime in Mexico has not fallen much, if at all.)\n\nThe history of violence that produced that shocking disparity, and that horrifying and ludicrous city of the dead in Culiac\u00e1n, is full of what-ifs, but here\u2019s the biggest one: What if America had not succumbed to the anti-drug hysteria of the Reagan years, and had pursued a drug policy that was sane and rational rather than contradictory and self-destructive? Mexico\u2019s troubled love-hate relationship with the United States has long been a matter of unacknowledged codependence, in which they send us people or commodities (often people as commodities) that our economy relies upon but we\u2019d rather not talk about: Farmworkers and chicken-gutters; maids, nannies and gardeners (papers not required); cheap fruit in the middle of winter; lots and lots of drugs.\n\nSuccessive Democratic and Republican administrations have poured countless billions into prisons and police departments in a fruitless campaign to stop the drug trade, but America\u2019s demand for drugs never slackened, and the Mexican cartels only grew in power and paramilitary might. There are any number of good arguments for legalizing marijuana and decriminalizing almost all other forms of street drugs, and I suspect we\u2019ll get there eventually, much more slowly than we should have. You can call it compassion or shame or sheer self-interest, but the same war that has killed thousands in Mexico (including many innocent bystanders) has also fueled the growth of the prison-industrial complex in the United States, and driven the widespread incarceration of brown and black people. However many border fences we build and however much we demonize each other, our two nations have a shared destiny, and any cancer that poisons one will also poison the other.\n\nIn \u201cNarco Cultura,\u201d we hear Edgar Quintero, a Mexican-American singer of narcocorridos \u2014 a hugely popular genre of Mexican pop song in praise of the drug lords, and sometimes commissioned by them \u2013 sum it all up: \u201cAs long as the gringos keep smoking it, we\u2019ll keep making it.\u201d That song is about crystal meth, which Quintero doesn\u2019t personally make, use or sell. (Did you know that you can find meth-smoking instruction on the Internet? I did not know that.) He\u2019s a cheerful, upbeat guy who smokes a little weed from time to time but avoids the harder stuff, a loving father who hopes to build a future for his family on the narcocorrido craze. Quintero has spent his entire life in L.A. and is more comfortable speaking English than Spanish; as he complains to a friend, there are Mexican idioms he doesn\u2019t quite get. His band is called Buknas de Culiac\u00e1n, in tribute to a place he\u2019d never been. There\u2019s really no other way to say it: He\u2019s a fanboy, both of established narcocorrido stars like El Komander and drug kingpins like Sinaloa Cartel head Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, currently ranked by Forbes as the 67th most important person in the world. (He\u2019s just below House Speaker John Boehner and just above New York Times editor Jill Abramson.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "America's failed drug policies -- and our insatiable drug appetites -- have helped kill innocent people in Mexico", "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "America's failed drug policies -- and our insatiable drug appetites -- have helped kill innocent people in Mexico", "title": "We got high, thousands in Mexico died", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/23/we_got_high_thousands_in_mexico_died/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/narco_cultura1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "America's failed drug policies -- and our insatiable drug appetites -- have helped kill innocent people in Mexico", "creator": "@andohehir", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/narco_cultura1.jpg", "title": "We got high, thousands in Mexico died", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "We got high, thousands in Mexico died", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Documentaries, Drugs, Editor's Picks, Mexican Cartels, Mexican Drug War, Mexico, Movies, Narco Cultura, narcocorridos, Our Picks, Our Picks: Movies, Sinaloa Cartel, War on Drugs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1a1\"", "article_summary": "(He also allowed the DEA to cross the border and operate openly within Mexico for the first time.)\n(While the murder rate in Ju\u00e1rez has decreased since then, it remains extremely high by world standards, and the overall rate of drug-related crime in Mexico has not fallen much, if at all.)\nAs a melancholy crime-scene investigator in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez named Richi Soto tells Schwarz, his notorious border city \u2013 a major hub for narcotics transport into the United States \u2013 had more than 3,000 reported murders in 2010 alone.\nTopics: Documentaries, Drugs, Editor's Picks, Mexican Cartels, Mexican Drug War, Mexico, Movies, Narco Cultura, narcocorridos, Our Picks, Our Picks: Movies, Sinaloa Cartel, War on Drugs, Media News, Life News, Entertainment NewsJust outside the city of Culiac\u00e1n, near the northwestern coast of Mexico, sits an impressive new development, a boomtown where construction never stops.\nThose are just the government\u2019s murder statistics; many observers believe the real harvest of death is more like 100,000."}
