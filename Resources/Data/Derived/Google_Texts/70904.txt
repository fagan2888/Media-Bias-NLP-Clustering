Volunteers are gearing up for a free two-day dental clinic in Salina.

The Salina Journal reports that the Kansas Mission of Mercy clinic will be open Friday and Saturday at the Salina Bicentennial Center. More than 115 dentists, 50 hygienists and 250 dental assistants are expected to volunteer. Salina dentist Cindy Reed says volunteers get more out of the experience than they give. She says the patients are "really thankful" and that many have been suffering from dental pain.

Since its first project in February 2003 in Garden City, the Kansas Mission of Mercy has provided nearly $13 million in dental care to more than 24,000 patients.

The events are known for attracting patients from hundreds of miles away. Some camp out so they can receive the free services.
