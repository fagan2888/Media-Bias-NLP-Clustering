Photo courtesy of Shutterstock\n\nA Canadian couple is suing Atlanta-based Xytex Corp. sperm bank for falsely advertising Sperm Donor 9623 as a healthy Ph.D. student, when in reality he was a college drop-out with a serious mental health diagnosis and a criminal background. Unfortunately, this is not the first time a sperm bank has been in hot water for discrepancies between the sperm they advertise and the sperm they deliver.\n\nDonor 9623 was described as a man with an IQ of 160, an undergraduate degree in neuroscience, a master\u2019s degree in artificial intelligence, who was pursuing a Ph.D. in neuroscience engineering. According to the couple, Angela Collins and Margaret Elizabeth Hanson, representatives from the bank personally described Donor 9623 as \u201cmature beyond his years\u201d and possessing \u201can impressive health history,\u201d The Associated Press reported. Based on this description, choosing Donor 9623 to be the father or their now 3-year-old son was not a difficult decision.\n\nIt was only after Xyrex sent the couple several emails which inadvertently disclosed the donor\u2019s full name that his true identity came to light. After a bit of personal investigating, the couple learned that Donor 9623 had schizophrenia, dropped out of college, and had previously been arrested for burglary. Even worse, upon seeing an image of the donor, the couple noticed that the photo provided to them by Xytex had been altered to remove a large mole from his cheek.\n\nThe couple is now suing both the company and the donor, who is believed to have fathered 36 children in total; 15 other couples may join in the Collins-Hanson lawsuit. According to an open letter written by the company\u2019s president, Kevin O\u2019Brien, the errors \u201cdo not reflect the representation provided to Xytex\u201d and the company is not at fault.\n\nO\u2019Brien upheld that the donor had undergone a medical exam and supplied copies of both his bachelor and undergraduate degree, and insists that the couple was \u201cclearly\u201d informed that this donor\u2019s background had not been verified by Xytex.\n\nSan Francisco-based lawyer Nancy Hersch, who is representing both the Canadian couple and possibly the 15 other potential clients, disagrees. She insists that it was never made clear that the information regarding Donor 9623 had not been confirmed and that the experience has left families \u201cfrightened, scared, upset, and misused\u2026\u201d The Star reported.\n\nThis is not the first time a mistaken identity at the sperm bank has led a couple to the courtroom. Last year a sperm mix-up made national news when a white couple in Ohio was accidentally given black sperm, resulting in a clearly biracial baby girl. The couple sued the sperm for the mistake, claiming that although they loved their daughter the unexpected racial differences caused an emotional challenge for both the child and the parents.\n\nIn 2006, a sperm bank over-look became light-threatening when five children born in the Detroit area were born with the rare and potentially deadly genetic disorder, severe congenital neutropenia. The disease affects the white blood cells and leaves patients vulnerable to infection and even leukemia. All five cases were traced back to one sperm donor from a Michigan bank, Live Science reported. In this case, although the bank had screenings for common hereditary disease, this did not include more rare diseases, highlighting the small yet ever-present risk couples take when receiving sperm from unknown sources.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sperm bank, sperm bank mix-up, artificial insemination, ivf, fertility", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Atlanta sperm bank is being sued after sperm advertised as belonging to a healthy PhD student was traced back to a man with schizophrenia and a criminal background.", "title": "Sperm Bank Sued After 36 Kids Fathered By Falsely-Advertised Donor", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sperm-bank-mix-couple-sues-after-donor-boasted-healthy-phd-student-turns-out-be-330120", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/21/sperm-bank.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Atlanta sperm bank is being sued after sperm advertised as belonging to a healthy PhD student was traced back to a man with schizophrenia and a criminal background.", "title": "Sperm Bank Sued After 36 Kids Fathered By Falsely-Advertised Donor", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sperm-bank-mix-couple-sues-after-donor-boasted-healthy-phd-student-turns-out-be-330120", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/21/sperm-bank.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/21/sperm-bank.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-21T13:45:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-21T17:36:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Atlanta sperm bank is being sued after sperm advertised as belonging to a healthy PhD student was traced back to a man with schizophrenia and a criminal background."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd105b\"", "article_summary": "Unfortunately, this is not the first time a sperm bank has been in hot water for discrepancies between the sperm they advertise and the sperm they deliver.\nBased on this description, choosing Donor 9623 to be the father or their now 3-year-old son was not a difficult decision.\nThis is not the first time a mistaken identity at the sperm bank has led a couple to the courtroom.\nAll five cases were traced back to one sperm donor from a Michigan bank, Live Science reported.\nLast year a sperm mix-up made national news when a white couple in Ohio was accidentally given black sperm, resulting in a clearly biracial baby girl."}
