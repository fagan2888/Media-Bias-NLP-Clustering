French society now includes a class of dispossessed separated from national identity. These citizens, predominantly young Muslims, with ancestry in France\u2019s former North African colonial possessions such as Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, exist in a state of \u201cspiritual poverty.\u201d\n\nFacing a stagnating economy (a topic I\u2019ve written on here), lacking self-belief, and regarded with fear by the broader society, Hussey identifies a tragic, angry underclass seemingly destined to rot in bleak housing projects. As one man puts it: \u201cIn the banlieue we are separated from France by \u2026 an enormous wall.\u201d This wall is both physical\u2014access to Parisian wealth centers are hindered by long train journeys\u2014and psychological.\n\nSpeaking of the housing projects, Hussey says their inhabitants \u201cdo not belong here. No one does.\u201d Moreover, via his extensive interviews, Hussey shines a light on the exculpatory culture of victimhood by which many banlieuesards consider their plight: \u201cThey openly identified with the Palestinians, whom they saw as prisoners in their own land, like the dispossessed of the banlieues.\u201d For Hussey, this combustible mix of absent opportunity and social alienation causes regular rioting in major French cities.\n\nWith remarkable depth for a comparatively short book, Hussey considers the disastrous French experience in Algeria. Noting the arrogance and brutality of French occupying forces, Hussey explains the birth of a horrific insurgency. Then, with meticulous description, he shows us how Algeria descended into a \u201cpsychotic state\u201d where no one was safe or neutral. \u201cThe FLN [insurgents] slit throats, decapitated bodies and mutilated genitalia; the French razed whole villages and practised torture as a systematic weapon of war.\u201d We see how the conflict evolved into new grotesque forms with each passing year. Indeed, the French government also fought with its expatriate citizens. As Hussey also notes, France then shamefully abandoned the Algerians who had served in its military.\n\nHussey\u2019s focus on Algeria is by far the most useful of his three colonial studies. Though his consideration of the French experiences in Tunisia and Morocco are interesting, their length distracts from his political analysis. Hussey should have kept these chapters shorter and tighter.\n\nTo be sure, his analysis is often compelling. He repudiates the casual simplicity with which many Westerners viewed pre-Arab Spring Tunisia: \u201cBelow the surface\u201d was a \u201cbitter version of Tunisian reality \u2026 within the nation\u2019s psyche.\u201d Sometimes Hussey seems to get lost in his many historical anecdotes. At one point, he spends a page forcibly extracting a political lesson from a battle between soccer thugs.\n\nUltimately, this limits the potential of his examination of French instability. And that\u2019s a shame, because, while Hussey\u2019s book deals excessively in his colonial-blame thesis, Hussey does broach into other important issues. He outlines the casual but increasingly virulent anti-Semitism of many French Muslims. He examines the darker side of the 1960s culture wars, and the Westerners who used Tangiers as a city-size brothel.\n\nStill, the author could have spent more time examining how Salafi Jihadist preachers and terrorists win recruits. On this issue, Hussey correctly identifies the main source of extremism\u2014a desire for purpose among disillusioned young men\u2014but he exaggerates the legacy of colonialism in fueling this extremism. With violent instability wreaking havoc in the Middle East, and with many French citizens operating in Syria, jihadism deserves more attention. Hussey finishes his book with an insightful study of how France\u2019s massive Muslim prison population is being radicalized. His message here is hard to repudiate: prison alone cannot address these social ills.\n\nIn the end, Hussey\u2019s book is worth reading\u2014just not for the reasons Hussey would submit. In its rich descriptions of dilapidated French communities and boiling social tensions, Hussey\u2019s book carries a warning for America.", "article_metadata": {"description": "REVIEW: The French Intifada by Andrew Hussey", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "\u201cParis is both near and distant; it is a few short steps away, but in terms of jobs, housing, making a life, for these young people it is as inaccessible and far away as America.\u201d    Andrew Hussey", "title": "French Lessons", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/french-lessons/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/French-riot-2005-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cParis is both near and distant; it is a few short steps away, but in terms of jobs, housing, maki", "title": "French Lessons", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/French-riot-2005-150x150.jpg", "creator": "@TomRtweets", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "With violent instability wreaking havoc in the Middle East, and with many French citizens operating in Syria, jihadism deserves more attention.\nCharting a course between former French colonies and the poor banlieues (suburbs) that ring Paris and other major French cities, Hussey paints a nation at war\u2014with itself.\nIn its rich descriptions of dilapidated French communities and boiling social tensions, Hussey\u2019s book carries a warning for America.\nWith remarkable depth for a comparatively short book, Hussey considers the disastrous French experience in Algeria.\nThough his consideration of the French experiences in Tunisia and Morocco are interesting, their length distracts from his political analysis."}
