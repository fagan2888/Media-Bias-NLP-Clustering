Introduction:

Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Levin, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to participate in todayâ€™s hearing on the tax treatment of health care. I am Joseph Antos, the Wilson H. Taylor Scholar in Health Care and Retirement Policy at the American Enterprise Institute. The views I offer today are mine alone.

My testimony makes the following points:

The current tax exclusion provides a strong incentive for employers to offer health insurance to their employees, but it is inefficient and unfair.

The Cadillac tax discourages employers from offering high-cost health plans, but it does not correct problems with the tax exclusion.

Congress should not simply repeal the Cadillac tax without offering a real reform plan.

Capping the exclusion is a sensible compromise that would be both simpler and fairer than the current system, and could be accomplished without disrupting the way most people purchase health insurance.

Comprehensive reform of the tax treatment of health insurance would address the tax exclusion, the Cadillac tax, and the subsidies offered on the exchanges through the Affordable Care Act (ACA). We should not ignore middle-class persons buying on the individual insurance market, who cannot access either exchange subsidies or subsidies through the employer market.
