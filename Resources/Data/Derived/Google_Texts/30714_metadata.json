Probably not, but one of the similarities \u2014 a humorous example of life imitating art \u2013 is too ironic not to point out.\n\nAnd it all involves the trendy tech giant Apple.\n\nAs TheBlaze reported over the weekend, SNL viewers were treated to a laugh at Obamacare\u2019s expense when the show devoted an entire skit to mocking the confusion and complaints surrounding the health care law. Among gripes voiced by citizens in the comedic clip was one woman\u2019s rant about her broken iPhone.\n\n\u201cI already have a complaint about Obamacare,\u201d said the woman after she approached Obama\u2019s lectern. \u201cMy iPhone 5s broke and I took it to the Genius Bar and they would not fix it. I mean what the hell is that?\u201d\n\nThe faux-Obama, clearly flustered, explained that the angry constituent was confusing Obamacare with AppleCare \u2014 the latter of which is a product protection program.\n\n\u201cWell, either way. Happened on your watch,\u201d she responded.\n\nWatch this portion of the skit at the 3:10 mark:\n\nFlash-forward to the very real debate over the government shutdown and Obama\u2019s comments about problems surrounding logging on to HealthCare.gov (we covered some of that this morning).\n\n\u201cLike every new law, every new product roll-out, there are going to be some glitches in the sign-up process along the way that we will fix,\u201d said Obama, who went on to work these problems out in the coming days.\n\nIn an effort to provide an illustration, he invoked Apple and some of the problems that were recently encountered in the company\u2019s mobile operating system upgrade (iOS 7).\n\n\u201cConsider that just a couple of weeks ago Apple rolled out a new mobile operating system and within days they found a glitch, so they fixed it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anybody suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads or threatening to shut down the company if they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s not how we do things in America. We don\u2019t actively root for failure.\u201d\n\nWatch Obama\u2019s real-life comments here:\n\nLife imitating art at its finest.\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Did President Barack Obama take direction from \"Saturday Night Live\" in crafting today's speech about health care reform and the government shutdown?
