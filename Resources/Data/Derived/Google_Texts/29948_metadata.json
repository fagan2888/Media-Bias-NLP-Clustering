I didn't expect I could come back to the Olympic Games.\"\n\nZhou was a teenager when she won the 1,500m in Vancouver and then a gold in the 3,0000m relay. But she was not the favorite this time after Shim established herself as the woman to beat.\n\nJust 17, Shim won at last year's world championship and led for most of Saturday's final before having to settle for silver.\n\n\"I'm happy, but not totally happy,\" she said. \"I couldn't run my best race, but it's my first Olympics and I think I did it OK.\"\n\nItaly's Arianna Fontana finished third to add a bronze medal to the silver she won in Thursday's 500m final.\n\n\"My goal was to get into the final and once there to try to do something,\" Fontana said. \"With five laps to go I started to get tired, but I wanted to win that medal.\"\n\nFontana had originally finished third in the 500m but was promoted to second after Britain's Elise Christie, who is emerging as one of the unluckiest competitors at the Games, was relegated from second place to eighth for causing a pileup.\n\nChristie again incurred the wrath of officials on Saturday when she was eliminated from the opening round of the 1,500m for failing to cross the finish line.\n\nAlthough she needed only to finish third in her heat to advance to the quarter-finals, and was coasting along in second place with the finish line in sight, Christie made a last-second decision to try and pass Fontana.\n\nShe succeeded but in changing course she veered too far inside and failed to cross the actual finish line, forcing the referee to declare her a non-finisher.\n\nThe British team considered an appeal but decided not to protest after watching a replay of the final.\n\n\"I've looked at the video and we're talking centimeters here,\" Christie's coach Nicky Gooch told reporters. \"To the letter of the law it's probably right, but she's clearly qualified through that race.\"\n\nThere were more wipeouts in the final when China's Li Jianrou, who won the 500m gold medal, was sent sprawling along with South Korea's Kim Alang and American Emily Scott.\n\nAll three slid into the protected boards and out of contention, leaving four skaters in with a chance of a medal.\n\nOf the survivors, the odd one out proved to be Jorien ter Mors of the Netherlands, one of the rare competitors who races in both short- and long-track speed skating.\n\n(Reporting by Julian Linden;
