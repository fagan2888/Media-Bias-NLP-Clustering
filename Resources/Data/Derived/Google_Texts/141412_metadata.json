The campaign is to support two bills sponsored by Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens \u2014 SB 4 and SB 10 \u2013 both of which will provide all California residents with access to health care, regardless of their immigration status. The bills are currently making their way through the legislature.\n\n\n\nSeveral county officials also spoke at the press conference.\n\n\n\n\u201cHealth care for all, regardless of immigration status, is morally the right thing to do, and is fiscally responsible governance,\u201d said Arvin Mayor Pro-Tem Jose Gurrola. He said he was speaking as a private citizen and not as a representative of the Arvin City Council. \u201cHealth and disease (do) not discriminate.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaker after speaker pointed out that by providing everyone access to health care, uninsured people could avoid expensive emergency room visits.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause of a broken immigration system and a lack of leadership at the federal level, we have millions of people in this country and thousands in this county who are living under the shadows without access to primary and preventive care,\u201d Gurrola said, noting that it costs taxpayers more money in the long run.\n\n\n\nLack of access to preventive care could potentially lead to a public health crisis, said Bill Phelps, chief of programs at Clinica Sierra Vista. He said that by not providing immigrants access to immunizations it could lead to a countywide outbreak of influenza, smallpox or other epidemics.\n\n\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act grants California citizens access to preventive coverage through Medi-Cal or Covered California, the online health care exchange, Phelps said that the program\u2019s major shortcoming is in failing to address the needs of undocumented immigrants.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are still many left outside of the Affordable Care Act who also need and deserve the opportunity to obtain affordable coverage,\u201d Phelps said. \u201c[Immigrants] are contributing to our local, state and national economy, and maintaining a healthy workforce is vital to our nation\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeveral #HEALTH4ALL supporters also spoke when the Board of Supervisors opened their meeting for public comments.\n\n\n\nMarisol Alcantar told the Board of Supervisors about her inability to find a doctor who could perform vital surgery she needs to survive.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was very important that the Board hear our stories because many of us need medicine,\u201d Alcantar said in Spanish through an interpreter. \u201cAt this moment, there\u2019s no way to receive the care that I need.\u201d\n\n\n\nSouth Kern resident Maggie Vazquez said she had watched her migrant parents deal with the everyday obstacles of life as an undocumented farm worker in the Central Valley.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey worked day in and day out in the fields, trying to provide food and a lifestyle for their family,\u201d Vazquez said. \u201cIt\u2019s so unfair to see them struggle with finding basic access to health care.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo far, the #HEALTH4ALL campaign has successfully fought to get $40 million set aside in the state budget to provide health care for undocumented children, said Josth Stenner of the California Partnership, an organization that connects grassroots organizers with representatives of state and local legislatures.\n\n\n\nThe #HEALTH4ALL press conference was hosted in conjunction with several Kern County activist groups, including Faith in Action Kern County, California Partnership, the United Farm Workers Foundation, and Building Healthy Communities-South Kern.\n\n\n\nOnly 37 percent of an estimated 68,000 undocumented immigrants in Kern county currently have access to healthcare coverage through their employers, Stenner said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
