Carly Fiornia, the former Hewlett Packard CEO, has barely thrown her hat in the ring and movement feminists are already wrinkling their nose at her. They are dismissing her as just another Sarah Palin who’d be bad for women.

But that is a big mistake, I note in my column at The Week. Fiorina is no hockey-mom-with-lipstick lightweight. She is an intelligent, savvy and strong woman who is great on the stump. If her trailing poll numbers ever pick up (she polls dead last in the Republican field, in the RCP average) she will invite scrutiny, especially of her years at Hewlett Packard, which might turn up a less than stellar record given the ignominious way in which she was booted out (with a $20 million severance package).

But when it comes to women’s issues, she speaks to women’s concerns in a way that real women might find much more authentic than the leaden pieties of feminist darling, Hillary Clinton.

“Fiorina is using Clinton's dogmatic progressivism to set up a contrast with her positions that seem to strive for a higher left-right synthesis.”
