Merry Christmas if you are getting some of the dough. Drinks on you.\n\nWho says Democrats and Republicans can\u2019t get along? This week president Obama signed a massive one-stop bill (a.k.a \u201cCromnibus\u201d) that will keep the government funded until the end of the fiscal year. Among other things, the bill appropriates $1.1 trillion in funding\u2014including over $550 billion for the Department of Defense.... Although Congress managed to stay within agreed upon budget caps for the second year in a row, that\u2019s about the best that can be said for the Cromnibus. Indeed, lawmakers appeared to be primarily concerned with pleasing defense contractors and protecting defense jobs back in the District. The Project on Government Oversight (POGO) found that the bill included billions of dollars that the Pentagon didn\u2019t request. Among the unrequested programs were $341 million to modernize twelve Apache helicopters and nine Black Hawk helicopters, $1 billion to begin work on an additional San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship, $154 million for an additional P-8A Poseidon Navy surveillance aircraft and $1.46 billion for fifteen EA-18G Growler electronic warfare planes. However, the prize for the most egregious unrequested item goes to the $479 million to be spent on four additional F-35 fighter jets (bringing the total number funded to 38).\n\nTo make matters worse, Santa doesn't just stuff stockings at the Pentagon. Spending on \"defense-related\" things and activities gets spread around like the clap at a brothel stationed near an army camp. In fiscal 2013, de Rugy explains, the base defense budget was $503 billion.\n\nBut that excludes an additional $82 billion in war funding, the $25 billion for the nuclear weapons programs contained in the Department of Energy\u2019s budget, and all the defense related money spent through the Department of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs and International Affairs. Once you add it all, the total defense spending for fiscal year 2013 is roughly $861 billion\u2014and that\u2019s not including interest, which amounts to roughly $58 billion.\n\nRelated: Click on chart.\n\nWho else got loads of gifts in the #cromnibus?
