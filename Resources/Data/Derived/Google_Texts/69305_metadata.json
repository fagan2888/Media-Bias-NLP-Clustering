Mr. Shirley has also joined three other historians in a tangle with Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly, whose recent best-seller \u201cKilling Reagan: The Violent Assault that Changed a Presidency\u201d suggested that the 1981 attempt on Reagan\u2019s life seriously compromised his ability to lead America. Mr. O\u2019Reilly, who describes himself as an \u201cinvestigative historian,\u201d is also the author of \u201cKilling Lincoln,\u201d \u2018Killing Kennedy,\u201d \u201cKilling Jesus\u201d and \u201cKilling Patton.\u201d\n\nMr. Shirley and his fellow historians \u2014 who have written 19 Reagan books between them \u2014 penned a commentary for The Washington Post countering that Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s book \u201crestates old claims and rumors, virtually all of which have been discredited by the historical record.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly dismissed the commentary as a \u201chit piece\u201d and stood by his claims about Reagan.\n\n\u201cThe struggle goes on over the meaning and the legacy of Ronald Reagan. Some push an agenda because they represent the establishment, or they want to kiss up to liberal society, and they figure the best way to do this is to unfairly trash the legacy of Ronald Reagan with innuendo and half-truths. But Shakespeare was right, truth will come to light,\u201d Mr. Shirley tells Inside the Beltway.\n\nFOR THE LEXICON\n\n\u201cSpeakstakes\u201d\n\n\u2014 Rush Limbaugh\u2019s new term for the evolving House speaker race, which he describes as \u201cmurky.\u201d\n\nFREEDOM CAUCUS: KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON\n\n\u201cA supermajority of the Freedom Caucus voted to support Rep. Paul Ryan as our next speaker. We did so without agreeing to any of Mr. Ryan\u2019s conditions. We remain firm in our commitment to open, accountable and limited government,\u201d says Rep. Raul R. Labrador. \u201cA group of united conservatives stood their ground to improve the office of the speaker while not giving up our ability to change and influence the process. Some voices in the conservative media are complaining that the Freedom Caucus did not go far enough or fight hard enough. I completely disagree.\u201d\n\nThe Idaho Republican continues: \u201cIn a body of 435, a group that comprises less than 10 percent of the body and less than 20 percent of the Republican conference effectively stood together to change the way Washington works. We did not change everything, but we changed some things.\u201d\n\nMr. Labrador adds: \u201cRegardless of who becomes the new speaker, I will continue to hold him accountable, just as I did Speaker John Boehner. But if he works with us to keep the promises we made to our constituents, I will also do everything I can to help him succeed. A united Republican Conference, advancing a conservative agenda, will allow us to improve the lives of everyday Americans and stop the excesses of this administration.\u201d\n\nA CRUZ REMINDER\n\n\u201cOne more liberal justice and our right to keep and bear arms is taken away from us by an activist court. One more liberal justice and they begin sandblasting and bulldozing veterans memorials throughout this country. One more liberal justice and we lose our sovereignty to the United Nations and the World Court.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz, to an audience at the Garrison coffee house in Clarinda, Iowa.\n\nBEYOND DINNER AND A MOVIE\n\nIt now takes economics and game theory to explain the excruciatingly complicated dating scene in the nation\u2019s capital and elsewhere.\n\nJournalist Jon Birger, author of \u201cDate-onomics: How Dating Became a Lopsided Numbers Game\u201d has crunched basic economic principles, demographics, game theory and number-crunching to explain America\u2019s \u201ccuriously lopsided dating and marriage market among single, college-educated, looking-for-a-partner women.\u201d\n\nMr. Birger will talk things out at the Cato Institute on Tuesday with Karin Agness, president of the Network of Enlightened Women, and Emily Ekins, a Cato research fellow. Watch the discussion live at 6 p.m. EDT at Cato.org/live.\n\nCARLY CONFRONTS THE BIG DOGS\n\n\u201cDuring the debate I\u2019ll have the opportunity to speak directly, at once, to tens of millions of Americans \u2014 and earn their support and their trust, just like I\u2019ve done in front of smaller audiences across the nation,\u201d notes Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina in a new voter outreach prior to the third GOP debate on Wednesday.\n\nIt is her preferred milieu; polls taken following the previous debates landed her in second place among her rivals, though she has slipped back in the weeks since the most recent debate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best to convince more Americans that we need real leadership in the Oval Office \u2014 not another self-serving career politician, just like I did in the first two debates,\u201d says Mrs. Fiorina. \u201cBut in the days that follow, when our momentum is reaching fever pitch, I\u2019ll be counting on your help to make sure the big bump we receive turns into permanent, lasting support for this campaign. And I\u2019ll be blunt: The only way this happens is if we have the financial resources to go head to head with the big dogs in the race and fight to make our voice heard.\u201d\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 88 percent of Americans say they are Christian; 31 percent are evangelicals, 26 percent Protestant, 23 percent Catholic.\n\n\u2022 55 percent would prefer a president \u201cwho has experience in private sector leadership, but no experience holding elected office.\u201d\n\n\u2022 41 percent prefer a president \u201cwith experience holding elected office, but no experience in private sector leadership.\u201d\n\n\u2022 44 percent say they are moderates, 35 percent conservative, 18 percent liberal.\n\n\u2022 30 percent self-identify as Democrats, 26 percent as independents, 23 percent as Republican, 18 percent as \u201cnone of these.\u201d\n\n\u2022 37 percent live in a household with a gun.\n\nSource: An AP/GFK poll of 1,027 U.S. adults conducted Oct. 15-19.\n\n\u2022 Weary sighs, complaints to jharper@washingtontimes.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Historian Craig Shirley had already written four books on Ronald Reagan when \"Last Act: The Final Years and Emerging Legacy of Ronald Reagan\" was published two weeks ago -- an unprecedented look at the 40th president's years after he left the White House.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Historian Craig Shirley had already written four books on Ronald Reagan when \u201cLast Act: The Final Years and Emerging Legacy of Ronald Reagan\u201d was published two weeks ago \u2014 an unprecedented look at the 40th president\u2019s years after he left the White House.", "title": "Inside the Beltway: The Reagan legacy wars continue", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/25/inside-the-beltway-the-reagan-legacy-wars-continue/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/15/9_152015_reagan8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/15/9_152015_reagan8201.jpg", "description": "Historian Craig Shirley had already written four books on Ronald Reagan when \"Last Act: The Final Years and Emerging Legacy of Ronald Reagan\" was published two weeks ago -- an unprecedented look at th", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Inside the Beltway: The Reagan legacy wars continue"}, "Author": "Jennifer Harper", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08a4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe struggle goes on over the meaning and the legacy of Ronald Reagan.\nBut Shakespeare was right, truth will come to light,\u201d Mr. Shirley tells Inside the Beltway.\nHistorian Craig Shirley had already written four books on Ronald Reagan when \u201cLast Act: The Final Years and Emerging Legacy of Ronald Reagan\u201d was published two weeks ago \u2014 an unprecedented look at the 40th president\u2019s years after he left the White House.\nSome push an agenda because they represent the establishment, or they want to kiss up to liberal society, and they figure the best way to do this is to unfairly trash the legacy of Ronald Reagan with innuendo and half-truths.\nSome voices in the conservative media are complaining that the Freedom Caucus did not go far enough or fight hard enough."}
