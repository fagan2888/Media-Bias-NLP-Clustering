Without it, all the incentive to sign up washes away. Someday, the IRS may have the authority to come and take away everything in a person\u2019s house, including the house itself, for failing to pay the insurance penalty. Or, they could be punished retroactively for penalties they didn\u2019t pay years prior and were never notified about.\n\nPublic opposition may prevent such legislation from passing in the short-term, but politicians know how to spin just about any issue so that ordinary citizens will support it without realizing it. Fear-mongering is a powerful and effective political tool.\n\nThis is why it is so urgent for us to act preemptively against any and all possible means of enforcing Obamacare in the states, including those which are currently. We cannot afford to wait until there are real consequences for not paying the penalty, and it will happen. Such legislation by the states would prevent the record of local liens from being kept that could later be used for future prosecution.\n\nTo see model legislation, click here.\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "With tax season coming around, many Americans who lack health insurance will be slapped with the shared responsibility penalty.
