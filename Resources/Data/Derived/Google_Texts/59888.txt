Portland, Ore., 2015 – VendScreen, the leading developer of vending industry cashless payment technology, is equipped to move the vending industry into full compliance with the recent regulations announced by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and slated to take effect on Dec. 1, 2016. Citing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, the FDA will require all food retail locations to list caloric information for consumers at point-of-purchase. VendScreen software is an interactive retail outlet for vending machines, offering not only calorie data, but nutritional and product information as well.

“Offering point-of-purchase nutritional information at vending machines was the inspiration for VendScreen’s beginnings,” said Dave Grano, president and CEO of VendScreen, “but it’s really only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the capabilities we can afford vending machine operators. In addition to helping operators keep ahead of federal regulations, at a fraction of the cost of acquiring new, intelligent machines, VendScreen software offers additional conveniences of cashless transactions, consumer loyalty programs and centralized monitoring.”

Owners and operators with more than 20 vending machines will be subject to the FDA’s new guidelines. According to Vending Times, “the FDA’s publication of its caloric–content labeling rules has given operators another reason to consider wireless information displays,” such as VendScreen’s retrofit device. Operators who don’t upgrade existing machines with new technology may be limited in their approach to achieving compliance; they may require significant human resources to add calorie rolls or stickers, or significant capital to acquire intelligent machines.

“Nutrition information is just one of the many important factors why I’ve chosen to install VendScreen software across my machines,” said Brad Bohlin, owner of AllTexas Vending. “Operators can take steps today to be in full compliance with regulations taking effect in two years’ time,” continued Bohlin, “and they can do so cost efficiently. In addition, they can rest assured that VendScreen’s offerings are dynamic and capable of adding features and options that may be in demand – from consumers or regulators – down the road.”



With VendScreen, operators can provide consumers with full access to product and nutritional information, and additional features like cashless payment, instant help, loyalty rewards and credit codes for refunds. The software lends itself to an improved user experience, which has led to an overall average sales increase of 15 percent per retrofitted machine.

VendScreen software harnesses industry-leading mobile communications and transactional security standards for consumer data protection, and can be updated wirelessly as customer needs change or new apps become available for smartphones.
