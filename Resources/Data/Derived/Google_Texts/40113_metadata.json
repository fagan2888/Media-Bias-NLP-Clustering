But many share O\u2019Neill\u2019s harsh assessment of the state\u2019s two-term governor.\n\nTRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>\n\nEven as Christie travels the country in pursuit of the Republican nomination, his approval rating in New Jersey has plunged, to the woeful 30% range.\n\n\"There's a growing sense among New Jerseyans this guy is simply not on the job and we're seeing a state that is stagnating because of it,\u201d said Patrick Murray, who directs polling at New Jersey's Monmouth University.\n\nChristie is not the only governor with eyes on the White House who faces trouble back home.\n\nWisconsin's Scott Walker, one of the top contenders for the Republican nomination, also gets disapproving marks from a majority of constituents, as does Louisiana's Bobby Jindal, which raises an obvious question: Why should they be elected president if those who know them best aren't pleased with their performance?\n\nThe governors speak of the tough decisions they've had to make as their state\u2019s chief executive \u2014 a contrast, they say, with the many U.S. senators, past and present, who are running for president and have never done anything but debate and vote on legislation.\n\n\u201cI would be bored to death,\u201d Christie once said of life in the Senate. \u201cCan you imagine me banging around that chamber with 99 other people? Asking for a motion on the amendment in the subcommittee? Forget it.\"\n\nFor Christie and Walker, though, the discontent threatens to undercut a key rationale for their presidential campaigns, the argument that support in their Democratic-leaning states shows an ability to broaden the Republican Party's appeal and, ultimately, win the White House.\n\nThe reasons for the governors\u2019 sagging approval vary.\n\nJindal, who is focused on rallying the party's conservative base, has alienated old allies in the business community and Louisiana\u2019s GOP-run Legislature by taking a hard right turn.\n\nHis refusal to consider tax hikes to close a $1.6-billion deficit, which arose in good part from earlier tax cuts, is seen by critics as an attempt to bolster his political credentials at the expense of the state's education and healthcare systems. A May poll gave Jindal a 32% approval rating.\n\n\"There's been an increasing perception in Louisiana that Bobby Jindal has moved on and cares more about the opinion of people outside the state borders than he does about people inside the state borders,\u201d said Pearson Cross, a political scientist at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette who is writing a book on Jindal.\n\nTimmy Teepell, who is managing Jindal's presidential campaign, rejected that assertion. He said Jindal had improved the education and healthcare systems and paid a price for pushing through other big changes, including a sizeable cut in the number of state employees. \u201cThose battle scars are still fresh,\u201d Teepell said, but will heal when residents see the benefit of Jindal\u2019s policies.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the union-battling Walker has long been a polarizing figure, admired by Republicans, loathed by Democrats and generally supported by independent voters. But of late he\u2019s been seen more negatively than positively \u2014 the most recent Marquette University Law School survey pegged his approval at 41% \u2014 as Walker sparred with fellow GOP lawmakers over proposed cuts to education and healthcare and other steps to close a $2.2-billion budget deficit.\n\nHis difficulties have been compounded by Wisconsin\u2019s tepid economy, which lags others in the region.\n\nWalker said polls go up and down. \u201cWhen people see the benefits of the budget as opposed to just the media talking about the complaints locally, I think we\u2019ll be back on track in the state as we have many times before,\u201d Walker said on Fox News.\n\nBut of all the candidates running, none has fallen further, harder than Christie, who was once considered a front-runner for the GOP nomination but now is fighting to make the cut of 10 candidates allowed onstage for next month\u2019s first presidential debate.\n\nThe scandal over a September 2013 traffic tie-up on the George Washington Bridge seriously hurt his reputation, even though Christie vehemently denies involvement in the political revenge plot and no evidence has surfaced to refute that claim. The episode, which came to light months afterward, quickly doused the glow of Christie\u2019s landslide reelection and cast the governor\u2019s combative style and brusque personality in a considerably less-flattering light.\n\nHe might have been forgiven if the state\u2019s economy was doing better, said Ben Dworkin, who teaches political science at Rider University, just outside the capital in Trenton.\n\nJob creation has been weak, the state's credit rating has been repeatedly downgraded \u2014 it\u2019s now among the worst in the country \u2014 and funding to repair New Jersey\u2019s crumbling roads and bridges has nearly run dry.\n\nA Christie spokesman provided a long list of actions the governor has taken this year, disputing the notion he has abandoned the state.\n\nAs for the polls, \u201cThese things are all temporary snapshots in time and nothing that concerns me much at all,\u201d Christie told reporters during an April swing through New Hampshire. \u201c... What matters is who you are and how you present yourself to people.\u201d\n\nBudget wrangling and economic struggles aside, there is something else that Christie and Jindal, in particular, share: a high rate of absenteeism that contributes to a sense they are more focused on winning the White House than performing the job at hand.\n\nJindal spent close to half of 2014 outside his home state, according to Baton\u2019s Rouge\u2019s Advocate newspaper. Christie has been away from New Jersey about 40% of his second term, according to public radio station WNYC.\n\nBy contrast, Walker stuck comparatively close to home, which may be a reason his approval numbers have held up somewhat better.\n\nThere is one other GOP governor in the race, Ohio\u2019s John Kasich, whose 55% positive rating in a February poll seems gaudy compared with his gubernatorial rivals.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Question for governors: Why should you be president when your own constituents don't like you?", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "When Chris Christie recently launched his presidential bid with a pep-style rally at his old high school, Jim O\u2019Neill pointedly skipped the homecoming event.", "title": "Question for governors: Why should you be president when your own constituents don't like you?", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-gop-presidential-govs-20150724-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55b16610/turbine/la-na-gop-presidential-govs-20150724", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, John Kasich, 2016, Presidential Campaign, 2016 Presidential Campaign, 2016 GOP Primary, Campaigns And Elections, State Government, Governors", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/84063008", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-07-24", "Description": "When Chris Christie recently launched his presidential bid with a pep-style rally at his old high school, Jim O\u2019Neill pointedly skipped the homecoming event.   \u201cI didn't want to do anything that would have suggested, even tacitly, that I was supportive of him or his policies,\u201d said O\u2019Neill, the district's...", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, John Kasich, 2016, Presidential Campaign, 2016 Presidential Campaign, 2016 GOP Primary, Campaigns And Elections, State Government, Governors"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdafd4\"", "article_summary": "Jindal spent close to half of 2014 outside his home state, according to Baton\u2019s Rouge\u2019s Advocate newspaper.\nBy contrast, Walker stuck comparatively close to home, which may be a reason his approval numbers have held up somewhat better.\nChristie is not the only governor with eyes on the White House who faces trouble back home.\nChristie has been away from New Jersey about 40% of his second term, according to public radio station WNYC.\nWhen Chris Christie recently launched his presidential bid with a pep-style rally at his old high school, Jim O\u2019Neill pointedly skipped the homecoming event."}
