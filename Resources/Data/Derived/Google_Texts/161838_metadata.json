From putting on his colorful silks to slipping on his boots - he could do this routine in his sleep. Walking down to the paddock for the last time, Sunday\u2019s races will cap his career on the track.\n\n\u201cThis place has been great to me from \u201888 and all the way up to here,\u201d he said.\n\nCliff won his first race at Remington Park 27 years ago during the track\u2019s inaugural races in 1988.\n\n\u201cIt was a big day, a lot of people here,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThere's nothing like winning a race, the thrill of victory I guess.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a thrill that has sustained him. To date, he\u2019s won more races at Remington Park than any other jockey, with 2,125 career wins in Oklahoma City and 4,457 overall. Three of those races include the Oklahoma Derby, the richest thoroughbred race at Remington Park.\n\n\u201cThat's the race you want to win when you come to Remington Park for the fall meet, that's the one,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, though, he says it's time to hang up his saddle.\n\n\u201cI'm 53, and my legs aren't as good as they used to be, I want to leave while I\u2019m still doing pretty good, I don't want to wait until I\u2019m washed up,\u201d Berry said.\n\nBerry said being a jockey can be grueling.\n\n\u201cIt's very taxing on your legs, I mean you got to be really fit, nobody can come off the street and ride a race,\u201d he said.\n\nAll the pain and hectic schedules were worth it to Berry. Looking back on his many trips down the stretch, he fondly remembers the horses he\u2019s ridden.\n\n\u201cYou learn their likes and don't likes and they're kind of like pets, you get to know them, some of them have got a lot of character, some of them are quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cI've had a lot of favorites through the years, you know, a lot of them that stand out.\u201d\n\nSo he makes his way from the paddock to the track one last time Sunday, crediting the owners, trainers and fans for their support as he leaves the starting gate for good.\n\n\u201cI know I will miss it,\u201d he said. \u201cMonday I\u2019ll be lost, Sunday I\u2019m just going to enjoy myself.\u201d\n\nBerry rode in five races during Sunday\u2019s Springboard Mile. He placed fifth, third, eighth, seventh and seventh.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Thoroughbred season ends Sunday at Remington Park and for one long-time Oklahoma jockey that ending marks a new beginning down a different track.", "author": "Deanne Stein", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30736169/long-time-winningest-oklahoma-jockey-hangs-up-the-saddle", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9451337_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Thoroughbred season ends Sunday at Remington Park and for one long-time Oklahoma jockey that ending marks a new beginning down a different track.", "title": "Long-Time Winningest Oklahoma Jockey Hangs Up The Saddle"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9451337_G.jpg", "description": "Thoroughbred season ends Sunday at Remington Park and for one long-time Oklahoma jockey that ending marks a new beginning down a different track.", "card": "summary", "title": "Long-Time Winningest Oklahoma Jockey Hangs Up The Saddle"}, "wnreadableurl": "long-time-winningest-oklahoma-jockey-hangs-up-the-saddle", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/12/13", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,horse racing, jockey, remington park", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS20", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,horse racing, jockey, remington park"}, "article_summary": "Thoroughbred season ends Sunday at Remington Park and for one long-time Oklahoma jockey that ending marks a new beginning down a different track.\nTo date, he\u2019s won more races at Remington Park than any other jockey, with 2,125 career wins in Oklahoma City and 4,457 overall.\n\u201cThis is my second home, Remington Park is,\u201d jockey Cliff Berry said.\nCliff won his first race at Remington Park 27 years ago during the track\u2019s inaugural races in 1988.\nThree of those races include the Oklahoma Derby, the richest thoroughbred race at Remington Park."}
