Things like telemedicine, electronic health records,\" said Verizon Co-Chair and CEO Lowell McAdam. \"All of these innovations can help people take charge of their health and improve their quality of health and their lives.\"\n\nNot coincidentally, health IT is in an increasing part of the telecom giant's business. Verizon was one of the contractors that worked on the federal HealthCare.gov insurance exchange last year.\n\nFor Walgreen President and CEO Greg Wasson being a health-care provider means having a better perspective about what really works to improve the health of both the company's employees and its customers. His strategy starts with an incentive to change.\n\n\"Proactive benefit designs that encourage healthy behavior\u2014trying to mitigate cigarette smoking, help people with weight loss\u2014which are the top two causes of disease in this country,\" said the drugstore chain chief.\n\nWhile Walgreen promotes smoking cessation, Wasson and the company's board have so far resisted calls from health advocates to stop selling tobacco products in its drug stores. Rival CVS Health stopped selling tobacco earlier this month.\n\nSome health advocates may also take issue with Coca-Cola's role on the council, and the soft drink maker's commitment in the report to support community programs to combat childhood obesity.\n\nRead MoreWal-Mart's latest price rollback: Doctor visits\n\n\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center's Marchibroda said the report is meant to spark a dialog about health care, and to encourage large and small business leaders to help bring about change.\n\n\"This was meant to be not something exclusive to the CEO council,\" she said. \"We hope hundreds of thousands of employers will step forward and also make commitments in the coming month.\"\n\n\u2014By CNBC's Bertha Coombs", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "The top executives of Coca-Cola, Bank of America, Aetna and others will unveil a new initiative in Washington Tuesday afternoon at the Bipartisan Policy Center.", "author": "Bertha Coombs", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Top executives of Coca-Cola, Bank of America, Aetna and others will unveil a new initiative in Washington Tuesday at the Bipartisan Policy Center.", "title": "CEOs write prescription for health-care overhaul", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/16/aetna-bank-of-america-others-unveil-a-new-initiative-for-health-care-overhaul.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/09/15/102002616-167248933.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Top executives of Coca-Cola, Bank of America, Aetna and others will unveil a new initiative in Washington Tuesday at the Bipartisan Policy Center.", "title": "CEOs write prescription for health-care overhaul", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/16/aetna-bank-of-america-others-unveil-a-new-initiative-for-health-care-overhaul.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/09/15/102002616-167248933.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@BerthaCoombs", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Health Care IT, US: News, Coca-Cola Co, Bank of America Corp, Aetna Inc, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, CVS Health Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-09-16T11:58:38-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2014-09-16T13:00:45-0400", "tag": "Verizon Communications Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 102002519, "news_keywords": "health care costs, CEOs, Bank of America, Aetna, Coca-Cola"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2725\"", "article_summary": "Read MoreWhy your boss wants you to see online doctors\"We need to use the power of that technology to transform health care.\n\"This was meant to be not something exclusive to the CEO council,\" she said.\nThe CEOs are challenging business leaders not just to improve care for their companies, but their communities and the nation's health system.\nsaid council member Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America.\n\"All of these innovations can help people take charge of their health and improve their quality of health and their lives.\""}
