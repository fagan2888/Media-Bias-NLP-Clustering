(BMR has since said it has closed for \"security\" reasons and refers would-be customers to Silk Road, which has already re-emerged.)\n\nCustomers sophisticated enough to tame the not-so-user-friendly Tor Project software and network could find user profiles on which black market entrepreneurs sold biological agents; abrin, ricin and other toxins; firearms; explosives; counterfeit goods and documents; and illegal drugs, the government said.\n\nKorff was selling abrin, and in the transaction with the undercover agent, he provided instructions for how to use it, specifying that \"the oral dose would be 150mg of abrin that is enough for a 330 pound target\" and that \"it is not a pill it comes in a liquid to put in a drink or in food like the bun of a cheeseburger,\" according to transcripts of the negotiations attached to the affidavit.\n\nIf it was to be used in a drink, Korff helpfully suggested light rum or whiskey, the messages showed. The victim should \"die by the forth [sic] day,\" he allegedly wrote.\n\n\"I guarantee it will work,\" he allegedly wrote. \"If you drop the abrin in someone's drink Wednesday he will be dead Friday and there is no way to trace it after 24 hours of ingestion.\"\n\nKorff told the agent he would deliver the abrin \u2014 which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists as an \"extremely toxic plant protein\" similar to ricin \u2014 in hollowed-out candles, according to the affidavit.\n\nIf the buyer was satisfied, Korff allegedly wrote, \"I can always make more.\"\n\nThe candles were duly delivered on Jan. 15 \u2014 in a McDonald's bag \u2014 the federal agents said, and Korff was as good as his word. They were found to contain \"a detectable amount of abrin,\" according to the affidavit.\n\nKorff's estranged uncle and sister were at the detention hearing Friday morning but wouldn't speak to reporters.\n\nTheir attorney, Daniel Endrizal, told reporters that Korff lost both of his parents before he was 15 and had been living in foster care ever since.\n\n\"He's had a tough way to go, he really has, but we're not making excuses for him,\" Endrizal said.\n\nMore from NBC News Investigations:\n\nFollow NBC News Investigations on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Florida teenager nabbed in an undercover sting sold and delivered deadly toxins on the Web, federal agents said in court documents this week.", "author": "Investigations", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "A Florida teenager nabbed in an undercover sting sold and delivered deadly toxins on the Web, federal agents said in court documents this week.", "title": "Florida teen sold deadly toxin abrin online, US says", "url": "http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/24/22435409-florida-teen-sold-deadly-toxin-abrin-online-us-says", "image": "http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=alex-johnson38A0D6D2-F927-5909-2D39-02247C8E2D24.jpg&width=original", "type": "article"}, "contentId": 22435409, "section": "{\"domainName\":\"investigations\",\"displayName\":\"Investigations\",\"avatar\":\"http:\\/\\/nvcdn.nbcnews.com\\/_vine\\/images\\/av\\/30x30\\/group.gif\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/investigations.nbcnews.com\\/\",\"type\":\"group\",\"ass\":\"\",\"groupId\":\"5187\",\"articleCount\":\"1225\",\"seedCount\":\"147\",\"memberCount\":\"4\",\"description\":\"\",\"createDate\":1279868940,\"groupType\":null,\"groupTypeId\":\"5\",\"blessed\":0,\"lastPub\":1460216486,\"isEnabled\":1}", "title": "Florida teen sold deadly toxin abrin online, US says - Investigations", "trackData": "{\"section\":\"US news\",\"subSection\":\"Open Channel\",\"sitePageId\":\"a22435409\",\"headline\":\"Florida teen sold deadly toxin abrin online, US says\",\"pageSource\":\"Investigations\",\"typeName\":\"Story\",\"byline\":\"Investigations\",\"tags\":[],\"seedSource\":\"\"}", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"asap\", \"load_pers\":\"1\"}", "cip": "63.235.20.165", "nv": {"contentId": 22435409, "contentType": "n"}, "date": "May 26, 2016, 4:11 pm", "server": "web08", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "canonical": "http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/24/22435409-florida-teen-sold-deadly-toxin-abrin-online-us-says"}, "article_summary": "Authorities said Korff tried to sell abrin \u2014 a highly noxious toxin similar to ricin \u2014 to an undercover federal agent.\nJesse William Korff, 19, allegedly sold deadly toxins on the underground website Black Market Reloaded, which has since said it has shut down.\nThey were found to contain \"a detectable amount of abrin,\" according to the affidavit.\nA Florida teenager nabbed in an undercover sting sold and delivered deadly toxins on the Web, federal agents said in court documents this week.\nIf the buyer was satisfied, Korff allegedly wrote, \"I can always make more.\""}
