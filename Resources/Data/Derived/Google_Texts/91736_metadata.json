Under Barack Obama, the radical Left has apparently felt that its time has come, and its movement toward open totalitarianism has accelerated. The recent displays of homofascism are but the tip of the iceberg in the Left\u2019s attempts to create an all encompassing control of your lives, your words, and even your thoughts. There is not a single area in your lives or mine that the Left would not like to domineer so as to force compliance. Indeed, anyone who has been paying any attention knows that the left-wing agenda is characterized by this. There is not a single aspect of their agenda that cannot be accurately described by one of the following terms: coerce, regulate, control, punish, socially engineer, mandate, confiscate, or dominate.\n\nHow else can one describe the ongoing left-wing commitment to the stamping out of free speech, whenever that speech contradicts the gay agenda, as well as other parts of the \u201cprogressive\u201d platform? With the resignation of newly minted Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich, the \u201cprogressive\u201d Left, especially its social wing, has once again shown itself to be the enforcers a political correctness in speech and thought that ought to be chilling to any person who actually cares about individual liberty.\n\nThis is doubly ironic because the Left has spent decades trying to convince Americans that \u201cthe Religious Right\u201d and other bogeymen are the ones who really want to control your lives. Despite the overwhelming lack of actual evidence for this proposition, the Left has nevertheless managed to convince a sizeable share of mind-numbed drones in this country of it. So, while half a country full of useful idiots is running around worrying that the \u201cRepublicans\u201d or \u201cTea Partiers\u201d are going to take away their condoms or something, the movers and shakers in the leftist movement are busy worming their way into every facet of our lives with a view to forcing us to live by their dictates.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand the Left once you start understanding them through the lens of fascism. How else do you explain their drive for gun control? It certainly isn\u2019t from any evidence that gun control \u201ccuts crime\u201d\u2014in fact, just the opposite is the case as we see looser and looser regulations on firearms ownership and use leading to less crime. But, see, fascists don\u2019t believe private individuals should have guns, but only the police and the military should, so you and I should have them taken away from us regardless.\n\nHow do you explain the left-wing obsession with global warming, despite the fact that every major prediction they have made to date has failed to come to pass, and that we are in fact in the midst of a 17-year-long pause in warming? Yet, you have wacko left-wingers who want to imprison people for being \u201cclimate deniers.\u201d Why? Because, when you get to the root of it, \u201cglobal warming\u201d serves as an excellent cover story for taking control of and destroying the industries, and therefore the high standard of living that has allowed Americans and other Westerners to live lives free from \u201cneeding\u201d to be provided for by all-encompassing government.\n\nThe left-wing hatred for free speech I\u2019ve covered previously. What\u2019s funny is that, without a trace of irony, you had people writing in the comments about that article trying to defend the notion that people ought to \u201cpay\u201d for saying things that liberals disagree with, and were apparently doing so with a straight face.\n\nEven the freedom-unfriendly aspects of the so-called \u201cWar on Terror\u201d put into place during Bush\u2019s administration, such as TSA harassment at airports, warrantless wiretapping of innocent Americans\u2019 communications, and laws that allow citizens to be \u201cindefinitely detained\u201d for \u201csuspicion of terrorism\u201d have all been continued and expanded under the Obama administration, and are now defended by those on the Left.\n\nIn fact, you can go right down the line and compare the radical Left in America today with totalitarian regimes such as Nazi Germany, the Stalinist Soviet Union, and (just to make it fun) the dystopic nation of Oceania depicted in George Orwell\u2019s 1984:\n\nThe American Left Totalitarian Regimes Oppose private gun ownership, only police and the military should have guns Outlawed private gun ownership, only police and the military had guns Oppose homeschooling and other alternatives to public skoolz Outlawed any form of alternative education systems not completely controlled by the state Encourage children to inform on their parents about guns in the home, lack of support for gay and environmentalist agendas Recruited children to turn their parents in for unapproved opinions or opposition to government policies Enforce political correctness and other social and political efforts to discourage wrong opinions Employed propaganda and punishment to discourage \u201cthought crime\u201d that consisted of holding to wrong opinions Support the breakdown of the nuclear family because it reinforces anti-progressive values Tried to break down the nuclear family because it was a source of \u201cheterodox\u201d loyalties (i.e. to something other than the state) Support abortion and do not recognize the right to life of all individuals, especially those with congenital disorders Employed abortion (and post-birth murder) to \u201cweed out\u201d dysgenic individuals or those who were \u201cunwanted\u201d Oppose economic freedom for businesses by mandating executive wages, directing production, and denying the right to hire or fire who they will Business was either state-run or else was forced into \u201ccorporatistic\u201d public-private partnerships that mandates executive pay, production, and employment practices Support welfare and other give-away programs that work to encourage individual dependence on government Used government to coerce citizens into dependence upon state support for daily necessities\n\nAnd the list could go on and on.\n\nThe problem is that once the Left realizes that there is a limit to how far they can get with their agenda merely by lying to people and using smokescreens, they\u2019re going to have to try to get the rest of the way there through outright violence and open intimidation. That\u2019s when things will get really ugly. That\u2019s when the progressive \u201cS.S.\u201d will go from mere rhetoric to being a reality.\n\nSo, what can we do about all of this?\n\nWell, for the time being, we need to do everything within our power to oppose the further advancement of their agenda at a demotic level. This means directly disobeying everything the Left wants to push through. They don\u2019t want us to own guns? Go out and buy as many guns with as much ammunition, as you can reasonably afford, learn how to use them, and have the resolve to use them against all enemies, both foreign and domestic. And under no circumstances should we ever register these guns. Ever. The Left tries to shut us up? Just get louder and louder. Vent your opinions on every blog, comments section, and forum you can find. Overwhelm them with free speech. Hound them across the internet until they finally shut the thing down, and then hound them with pamphlets in the streets and soapboxes on the corners if we have to. They want to force us to put our kids in public skools where they can get at them with propa-gay-nda and Common Core nonsense? Pull your kids out of the system and homeschool or put them into private or religious schools. Starve the beast. Start educational coops to help each other out. Long story short\u2014double down on opposing everything they\u2019re trying to do. Don\u2019t continue to let them do what they want unhindered while ducking your head down and \u201cminding your own business.\u201d If there ever was a time for conservatives and liberty-lovers to relearn the virtue of public-spiritedness (which is not the same thing as socialism, by the way, reread your Tocqueville), it is now.\n\nMay come a time when opposing the Left\u2019s cultural and political coup in America may involve more than just words\n\nBut also\u2014and let\u2019s be very serious here\u2014understand that there may come a time when opposing the Left\u2019s cultural and political coup in America may involve more than just words. The Left will not be content until they control us all completely. If they can\u2019t do it by deceit and guile and dependency, they will try it by other means. There may well come a day when the left-wingers actually do try to put \u201cclimate deniers\u201d in prison for opposing the party line. When that happens, be prepared to shoot back. If they try to come and take our guns away, be prepared to make them pay a high price for each one. If they come to take our children away, be prepared to show them what being a \u201cPapa Bear\u201d is really all about. And know that if this type of situation ever does come to pass, it is WE, not they, who are in the right. It is WE who have inalienable rights that no government and no social cadre can ever rightly or justly infringe. Shooting back will not be an act of rebellion, but an act of preservation of our constitutional government from terroristic interlopers seeking to overturn it by revolution. THEY are the revolutionaries, the traitors, the terrorists.\n\nI know this all sounds \u201cradical,\u201d but is it really? Our country was born through the fire and blood of men who felt the exact same way as I\u2019ve expressed above, men who were actually engaging in the defense of their rights and liberties as Englishmen, predicated upon the natural law foundation that was as old as our civilization, and even before. They actually went to war for far fewer offences than we have endured\u2014we\u2019ve been remarkably long-suffering in putting up with the antics of the Left for as long as we have. Nobody wants to see our society reach the point where actual shooting is involved\u2014which is why we need to take every step we can to stop those who hate our Constitution and our society NOW, rather than continuing to let the situation grow worse unimpeded.
