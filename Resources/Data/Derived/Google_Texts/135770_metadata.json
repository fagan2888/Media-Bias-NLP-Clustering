Police said the man had left the service but was found a short time later.\n\nBrownlee has proved a polarizing figure in the rebuilding of Christchurch. Many people frustrated at delays in collecting insurance or at the slow pace of the downtown reconstruction have blamed him.\n\nEarlier in the day, Brownlee was heckled by a man during an outdoor radio interview: \u201cYou\u2019ve done a bad job. A bad, bad job,\u201d the man yelled after first shouting an insult. On air, Brownlee laughed off the incident.\n\nBrownlee\u2019s spokesman, Nick Bryant, said the lawmaker didn\u2019t wish to comment on the incident at the service because it had become a legal matter.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time this month that somebody has thrown something at a New Zealand lawmaker. On Feb. 6, a woman threw a pink toy penis at Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce to protest an international free trade deal.\n\nEarlier during Monday\u2019s memorial service, speakers made the point that while there had been big progress since the quake, there was much left to be done.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Zealand city marks 5 years since quake that killed 185", "author": "Nick Perry", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New Zealand city marks 5 years since quake that killed 185", "title": "New Zealand city marks 5 years since quake that killed 185", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/22/new_zealand_city_marks_5_years_since_quake_that_killed_185/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/new-zealand-earthquake-memorial.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Zealand city marks 5 years since quake that killed 185", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/new-zealand-earthquake-memorial.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "New Zealand city marks 5 years since quake that killed 185", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "New Zealand city marks 5 years since quake that killed 185", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Hundreds of people attended the botanical gardens service in New Zealand\u2019s second-largest city to memorialize the magnitude-6.1 quake that killed 185 people on Feb 22, 2011.\nA bad, bad job,\u201d the man yelled after first shouting an insult.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 A service to commemorate the fifth anniversary of a deadly earthquake in the New Zealand city of Christchurch turned ugly Monday when someone threw goop over the government minister responsible for quake recovery efforts.\nIt\u2019s the second time this month that somebody has thrown something at a New Zealand lawmaker.\nEarlier in the day, Brownlee was heckled by a man during an outdoor radio interview: \u201cYou\u2019ve done a bad job."}
