And a lot of it.\n\nThat's why the second MediFuture conference this week in Tampa asked a panel of college students for some insight. While the five men and one woman say they may not be using the health care system much now, it's important medicine doesn't assume that technology is all they care about.\n\nThese students say they are typical of many college students: they\u2019re educated, have health insurance and work out regularly. And they live a healthy lifestyle \u2013 give or take a few extra drinks on the weekend. Most go to the doctor only when needed, say when a shoulder pops out of place or a sinus infection knocks you down.\n\nThey say they definitely don\u2019t embrace what they describe as today\u2019s model of health care, where you have a designated primary care physician and wait days or weeks for an appointment. Phil Michaels is getting his MBA at the University of Tampa. He says he wants a relationship with a doctor to be convenient, and on demand.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for all millennials but this is how I would like to communicate with them. I don\u2019t want to spend two hours of my day driving to the doctor\u2019s office, waiting, seeing the doctor, you know, waiting to check out,\" Michaels said. \"I can text him, I can Skype with him \u2013 show him the bruise on my arm \u2013 send him a picture message. And I know it\u2019s being done right now, but we need to make sure it\u2019s reaching a mass audience.\u201d\n\nThat concept isn't far fetched. Concierge medicine and is an option for people able to pay for the exclusive service.\n\nBut some say that convenience shouldn\u2019t diminish the personal interaction between patients and their health care providers. Klaus Grim is a student at the University of Tampa. He says that connection is why he is studying to become a physician\u2019s assistant.\n\n\u201cI kind of disagree. Because I think that\u2019s kind of where medicine exceeds is the patient, the patient doctor relationship,\" Grim said. \"And it\u2019s part of being human and talking to someone face to face.\"\n\nHis need for the human touch is an important reminder to the nearly 600 professionals in health care and tech industries attending the three-day MediFuture event. Participants were wowed by the high-tech, consumer-centered gadgets featured in ballrooms throughout the conference hotel.\n\nTech company Jawbone pitched its JawboneUP fitness tracker link with a clips on your dog\u2019s collar -- called Whistle -- and a interactive food scale called Prep Pad, done in partnership with the Orange Chef Co.\n\nGuideWell, the parent company of insurer Florida Blue, set up mock bathrooms, workplaces and storefronts to highlight its gadgets. One garnering a slew of questions was an interactive bathroom mirror, where computerized health reports pop up as you start the day.\n\nUniversity of Tampa graduate student Keven Jenkins said technology may be second nature to his generation. But they won\u2019t embrace health apps unless they make sense to the individual, and if they work well.\n\n\u201cI do think there is a lot of opportunity for improvement in regards to that kind of technology,\" he said. \"I use it, but I\u2019m not a tremendous fan at the moment. I think there is still a lot of room still for improvement, as with much technology when it first goes live. \u201c\n\nDionte Madden, a senior at the University of Central Florida, told the crowd that the fitness tracker his parents gave him as a present goes unused.\n\nHe and other panelists said they prefer to go old school \u2013 working out with a familiar exercise routine, and using friends and family as accountability buddies. Madden says apps are great at tracking health data, but it\u2019s no fun living by the numbers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather just go and work out because that\u2019s what I\u2019m used to doing. From the student athlete\u2019s perspective, the apps really aren\u2019t that useful because you already know your body and what is best for you,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd don\u2019t assume these young adults are enamored by scientific advances. Many on the panel said they\u2019re reluctant to undergo genomic testing, which breaks down DNA to predict their chances for serious and potentially deadly disease.\n\nGrim, the aspiring physicians assistant, would rather focus on being well, than worrying too much.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to know\u2026 I just think if I find out I have something, I\u2019m not living the life I want to be living beforehand,\" he said. \"\u2026Say I know I have something, I\u2019m going to change my whole life around. And I think life is just so full of surprises.\u201d\n\nHe wasn't alone. When it came to that question, only one of the six students was eager to find out what the future held.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
