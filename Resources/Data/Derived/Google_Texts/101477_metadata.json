In Kansas, the GOP rewrote laws for their welfare programs, turning assistance from a safety net into a barbed-wire fence, treating recipients\u2014mostly single parents and children\u2014like paroled convicts. In 11 red states, 37 new rules have been adopted this year creating more barriers to abortion\u2014from requiring parental consent, to mandatory waiting periods, to falsely telling women that some procedures can be reversed.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there. As a June 30th deadline approaches for states to expand Medicaid\u2014 state-run health care for the poor\u2014by using Obamacare\u2019s federal subsidies, 21 red states are still refusing to do so. According to Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s statistics, 960,000 adults and 2.52 million children are being deliberately denied access to care. In a handful of other red states, the right-wing war on labor grinds on by repealing prevailing wage laws for construction jobs, which academics found cuts union wages by 10 percent and non-union construction pay by two-to-four percent.\n\nWhat would Republicans try to do if they controlled Congress and the White House after the 2016 election? It\u2019s not a far-fetched question. The presidency has swung between the two major parties after each two-term president since 1992. The GOP\u2019s just-passed 2016 budget in Congress may be heading for President Obama\u2019s veto pen, but it signals what they\u2019d do\u2014justified by hyped fears about retiring the federal debt. In red states, social conservatives are going after abortion rights, opposing LGBT equality, and punishing welfare recipients. Meanwhile, business conservatives are following the template from the pro-corporate American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and going after unions, opposing living wages, denying climate change and more.\n\nWhat follows are 12 striking examples of what GOP rule in Washington could bring.\n\n1. Cut health insurance to 27 million people. This would be the result from repealing Obamacare and its related Medicaid expansion, as the House-Senate\u2019s just-passed 2016 budget agreement seeks. In its first five years, Obamacare expanded coverage to 16.5 million uninsured, and expanded Medicaid in 29 states and Washington, D.C. It did that by paying start-up costs for several years and 93 percent after that. The Republicans want none of that. They do not see health care as a right, public obligation or responsibility, but a service for those who can afford it and a profit center for the private sector.\n\n2. Impoverish health care for the poor. The GOP attack on public health care does not stop with Obamacare. Medicaid is the state-run health plan for 70 million low-income people. That includes single parents, people with disabilities, every third child in the U.S, and the elderly. It pays more for long-term care and for nursing homes than any source, according to congressional analyses. The GOP budget wants to repeal the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, cut another $500 billion from Medicaid over the next decade, and turn it into a block grant to the states. No matter how you parse it, these changes\u2014which would play out differently in different states\u2014would shrink options for society\u2019s most vulnerable, worsening pressures for people already in crisis.\n\n3. Privatize and gut senior healthcare. The GOP\u2019s war on safety nets continues with\n\nMedicare, the federal health plan for Americans older than 67. The GOP would turn it into a voucher program, where beneficiaries get an annual fixed payment to buy private insurance\u2014whose costs cannot be accurately known up front, according to Congressional Budget Office studies. That means more out-of-pocket costs for seniors on fixed incomes. Because Obamacare contained a provision that lowered prescription drug costs, those too would go up. The GOP\u2014like the Obama White House\u2014would cut $430 billion from Medicare over the next decade, which would undermine the health care options.\n\n4. Put Social Security on the chopping block. Despite efforts by progressive groups and growing numbers of elected Democrats to recognize a looming retirement security crisis and call for expanded payments (paid by lifting a payroll tax cap), the GOP keeps falsely saying that Social Security is driving the federal debt. They are calling for a commission to \u201cstudy\u201d its problems and propose solutions, which means future cuts. Their intentions could not be clearer. A small part of Social Security, covering people with disabilities, will run out of money next year or face benefit cuts. Instead of using money from the retirement trust as in the past, the GOP\u2019s budget agreement says not \u201ca penny\u201d can be used this way. They are pretending there is a major fiscal crisis when there is not, when the government has been acting as a bank for taxpayers and holding their money. As is the case with the health care, Republicans want to dismantle or privatize the program.\n\n5. Increase hunger for tens of million of poor. The GOP doesn\u2019t want to confront the realities of poverty in America, which include tens of millions of children. The House Budget Committee Democrats\u2019 analysis of the GOP budget explains that it would cut $300 billion to food stamps, \u201cgreatly reducing benefits or pushing many more people from the program.\u201d In Kansas, the GOP went even further in revising state welfare law, which now contains lifetime benefit caps, harsh work requirements, $25-a-day limits on bank withdrawals, restrictions on where recipients can shop and buy food, background checks, ongoing drug tests, and more.\n\n6. Cut public school programs and funds. The GOP does not believe education is an investment in America\u2019s future. Spending on education would fall to its lowest level in 15 years, with 46,000 additional children losing access to Head Start, more layoffs of special education teachers and those who work with disadvantaged youths, the House Budget Committee Democrats said. Similarly, adult job training would be cut, as well as funding for medical and scientific research grants.\n\n7. Make college out of reach and more expensive. As higher education keeps getting more expensive, student debt keeps growing. Yet the GOP budget worsens this problem. It cuts another $200 billion from higher education over the next decade, of which $85 billion is Pell grants\u2014federal student loans\u2014whose maximum will be frozen \u201cforever,\u201d according to House Democrats. Additionally, the GOP would start charging interest on loans while students are in college, adding thousands to borrowing costs. It also ends a $2,500 tax credit \u201cthat helps more than 10 million low- and moderate-income students,\u201d House Democrats said. Taken together, the Republican\u2019s philosophy toward education only can be characterized as a Darwinian, based on their belief that government should have no role in helping people achieve goals\u2014even through education.\n\n8. Raises taxes on middle- and working class. The GOP budget would increase taxes for millions because it ends an annual tax credit that helps millions pay for college, and it lets key provisions expire in the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit. The National Priorities Project, whose analysis of the GOP budget echoed House Democrats, said these moves would end up \u201craising taxes on millions of working families.\u201d\n\n9. Postpone needed infrastructure repairs. The Republicans also believe America\u2019s roads and bridges can get by for another decade with minimal maintenance, and will cut transportation funding by 26 percent\u2014$235 bilion\u2014over the next decade.\n\n10. Turn away from vets but boost the Pentagon. The GOP hounded the White House when a scandal broke out a Veterans Administration hospitals where vets could not see physicians promptly. Yet the GOP budget cuts discretionary funding for vets next year by $1.9 billion and envisions $20 billion in cuts over the next decade. That\u2019s coming as vets from Iraq and Afghanistan are returning with horrible injuries requiring more\u2014not less\u2014health care and services. At the same time, the GOP budget uses loopholes to add $187 billion for next year\u2019s overseas military operations \u201cfor unrelated defense needs,\u201d the House Budget Committee Democrats said. This is more of the \u201clove war but abandon the soldier\u201d pattern that\u2019s existed for years in Washington.\n\n11. What\u2019s not happening? Apart from going backwards on government programs, the GOP is ignoring many pressing issues. Their budget has nothing for immigration reform. Instead, Congress is siding with right-wing governors who sued to block White House executive orders suspending deportations\u2014even as 2.3 million undocumented people live in those red states. There\u2019s an ongoing effort to block federal climate change research at the CIA, Pentagon and most recently NASA. Meanwhile, all of the GOP\u2019s presidential contenders are downplaying or denying that climate change is real, siding with the fossil fuel industry, which works to undermine renewable energy options.\n\n12. A GOP lock on the Supreme Court? The GOP\u2019s budget in Congress and recent developments in red states show what they would seek to do if they had a congressional majority and the presidency after 2016\u2019s elections. It\u2019s clear they would try to dismantle or privatize health care and retirement security safety nets, like Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. They will do nothing to make higher education more accessible; instead they would raise student loan interest rates. Meanwhile, their rough treatment of the poor would keep the most vulnerable Americans trapped at the bottom\u2014and they\u2019d punish those who seek public assistance, starting with food stamps.\n\nIf all that and more wasn\u2019t enough, they also would have the power to select and confirm the next Supreme Court justices\u2014where the current Republican-appointed 5-4 majority has made decisions that are radical and regressive. From turning the federal elections into a nominating process controlled by the rich where voters only weigh in at the very end, to allowing red states to reject the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare and gutting The Voting Rights Act, to siding with corporate and state power in anti-democratic ways, a Republican lock on Washington could result in an even more right-wing Court as there are four justices approaching or older than 80.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to scoff at the party-line budget votes in Congress, because the Obama White House would never sign anything like that into law. But that budget agreement is not just an ideological statement. It is a blueprint for a GOP dismantling of federal government, where life would become harder and harsher for multitudes. That\u2019s worth remembering as the 2016 campaign rhetoric heats up, and Republicans promise to bring a new era of freedom and prosperity to America.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Jeb-Bush-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Here are 12 ways the GOP would destroy the US if they controlled the White House after 2016"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2261\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, in red states where Republicans control the Legislature and executive branches, the rampage has exceeded even this Congress\u2019 wildest dreams.\nIn red states, social conservatives are going after abortion rights, opposing LGBT equality, and punishing welfare recipients.\nWhat would Republicans try to do if they controlled Congress and the White House after the 2016 election?\nThe GOP\u2019s war on safety nets continues withMedicare, the federal health plan for Americans older than 67.\nThe National Priorities Project, whose analysis of the GOP budget echoed House Democrats, said these moves would end up \u201craising taxes on millions of working families.\u201d9."}
