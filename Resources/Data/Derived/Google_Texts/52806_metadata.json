For a moment, do your best to suspend disbelief and imagine that there\u2019s another superpower, great power, or even regional power somewhere that, between 2001 and 2003, launched two major wars in the Greater Middle East. We\u2019re talking about full-scale invasions, long-term occupations, and nation-building programs, first in Afghanistan and then in Iraq.\n\nIn both countries, that power quickly succeeded in its stated objective of \u201cregime change,\u201d only to find itself mired in deadly conflicts with modestly armed minority insurgencies that it simply couldn\u2019t win. In each country, to the tune of billions and billions of dollars, it built up a humongous army and allied \u201csecurity\u201d forces, poured money into \u201creconstruction\u201d projects (most of which proved disasters of corruption and incompetence), and spent trillions of dollars of national treasure.\n\nHaving imagined that, ask yourself: How well did all of that turn out for this other power? In Afghanistan, a recent news story highlights something of what was accomplished. Though that country took slot 175 out of 177 on Transparency International\u2019s 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index, though its security forces continue to suffer grievous casualties, and though parts of the country are falling to a strengthening Taliban insurgency, it has for some years proudly held a firm grip on one record: Afghanistan is the leading narco-state on planet Earth.\n\nIn 2013, it upped its opium poppy cultivation by 36%, its opium production by almost 50%, and drug profits soared. Preliminary figures for this year, recently released by the U.N., indicate that opium cultivation has risen by another 7% and opium production by 17%, both to historic highs, as Afghanistan itself has become \u201cone of the world\u2019s most addicted societies.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, where there once was Iraq (171st on that index of kleptocracies), there is now a Shiite government in Baghdad defended by a collapsed army and sectarian militias, a de facto Kurdish state to the north, and, in the third of the country in-between, a newly proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d run by a terror movement so brutal it\u2019s establishing records for pure bloodiness. It\u2019s headed by men whose West Point was a military prison run by that same great power and its bloodthirstiness is funded in part by captured oil fields and refineries.\n\nIn other words, after 13 years of doing its damnedest, on one side of the Greater Middle East this power has somehow overseen the rise of the dominant narco-state on the planet with monopoly control over 80%\u201390% of the global opium supply and 75% of the heroin. On the other side of the region, it\u2019s been complicit in the creation of the first terrorist mini-oil state in history, a post-al-Qaeda triumph of extreme jihadism.\n\nA Fraudulent Election and a Collapsed Army\n\nThough I have no doubt that the fantasy of relocating Washington\u2019s deeds to Beijing, Moscow, Tehran, or any other capital crumbled paragraphs ago, take a moment for one more experiment. If this had been the work of any other power we thought less well of than we do of ourselves, imagine the blazing headlines right now. Conjure up \u2014 and it shouldn\u2019t be hard \u2014 what the usual war hawks would be spouting in Congress, what the usual suspects on the Sunday morning talk shows might be saying, and what stories cable news networks from CNN to Fox would be carrying.\n\nYou know perfectly well that the denunciations of such global behavior would be blistering, that the assorted pundits and talking heads would be excoriating, that the fear and hysteria over that heroin and those terrorists crossing our border would be somewhere in the stratosphere. You would hear words like \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cbarbaric.\u201d It would be implied, or stated outright, that this avalanche of disaster was no happenstance but planned by that same grim power with its hand on the trigger these last 13 years, in part to harm the interests of the United States. We would never hear the end of it.\n\nInstead, the recent reports about Afghanistan\u2019s bumper crop of opium poppies slipped by in the media like a ship on a dark ocean. No blame was laid, no responsibility mentioned. There were neither blazing headlines, nor angry jeremiads, nor blistering comments \u2014 none of the things that would have been commonplace if the Russians, the Chinese, or the Iranians had been responsible.\n\nJust about no one in the mainstream excoriates or blames Washington for the 13 years leading up to this. In fact, to the extent that Washington is blamed at all for the rise of the Islamic State, the focus has been on the Obama administration\u2019s decision not to stay longer in Iraq in 2011 and do even more of the same. (Hence, President Obama\u2019s recent decision to extend the U.S. combat role in Afghanistan through at least 2015.)\n\nAll in all, we\u2019ve experienced a remarkable performance here when it comes to not connecting the dots or feeling the need to assign responsibility or accountability for what\u2019s happened in these years. In some fashion, we Americans continue to see ourselves, as we have since 9/11, as victims, not destabilizers, of the world we inhabit.\n\nTo add to this spectacle, the Obama administration spent endless weeks helping engineer a fraudulent Afghan presidential election \u2014 funded in part by the opium trade \u2014 into a new, extra-constitutional form of government. The actual vote count in that election is now, by mutual agreement of the two presidential candidates, never to be revealed. All of this took place, in part, simply to have an Afghan president in place who could ink a new bilateral security agreement that would leave U.S. troops and bases there for a further decade. If another country had meddled with an election in this fashion, can you imagine the headlines and commentary? While reported here, all of this again passed by without significant comment.\n\nWhen it comes to a path \u201cforward\u201d in Iraq, it\u2019s been ever deeper into Iraq War 3.0. Since a limited, \u201chumanitarian\u201d bombing campaign began in August, the Obama administration and the Pentagon have been on the up escalator: more air strikes, more advisers, more weaponry, more money.\n\nTwo and a half weeks ago, the president doubled the corps of American advisers (plus assorted other U.S. personnel) there to 3,000-plus. Last week, the news came in that they were being hustled into the country faster than expected \u2014 specifically into dangerous, war-torn al-Anbar Province \u2014 to retrain the American-created, now thoroughly sectarian Iraqi army, reportedly in a state of remarkable disarray.\n\nIn the meantime, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey, the Pentagon, and the White House continue to struggle over whether American boots can be put on the ground in a combat capacity, and if so, how many and in what roles in a \u201cwar\u201d that essentially may have no legal basis in the American system of government. (Shades of Afghanistan!) Of course, much of this internecine struggle in Washington is likely to be obviated the first time U.S. advisers are attacked in Anbar Province or elsewhere and boots end up hitting the ground fast, weapons firing.\n\nVietnamizing Iraq, Iraqicizing Vietnam\n\nIn the meantime, think about what we would have said if the Russians had acted as Washington did in Afghanistan, or if the Chinese had pursued an Iraq-like path in a country of their choosing for the third time with the same army, the same \u201cunified\u201d government, the same drones and weaponry, and in key cases, the same personnel! (Or, if you want to make the task easier for yourself, just check out U.S. commentary these last months on Ukraine.)\n\nFor those of a certain age, the escalatory path the Obama administration has set us on in Iraq has a certain resonance and so, not surprisingly, at the edges of our world, familiar words like \u201cquagmire\u201d are again rising. And who could deny that there\u2019s something eerily familiar about it all? Keep in mind that it took less than three years for the Kennedy administration to transition from the first several hundred American advisers it sent to Vietnam to work with the South Vietnamese Army in 1961 to 16,000 armed \u201cadvisers\u201d in November 1963 when the president was assassinated.\n\nThe Obama administration seems to be in the grips of a similar escalatory fever and on a somewhat similar schedule, even if ahead of the Vietnam timetable when it comes to loosing air power over Iraq and Syria. However, the comparison is, in a sense, unfair to the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. After all, they were in the dark; they didn\u2019t have a \u201cVietnam\u201d to refer to.\n\nFor a more accurate equivalent, you would have to conjure up a Vietnam scenario that couldn\u2019t have happened. You would have to imagine that, in May 1975, at the time of the Mayaguez Incident (in which the Cambodians seized an American ship), just two weeks after the South Vietnamese capital Saigon fell, or perhaps even more appropriately in terms of the dual chronologies of the two wars, in December 1978 when the Vietnamese invadedCambodia, President Gerald Ford had decided to send thousands of American troops back into Vietnam.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The American national security machinery seems incapable of handling the single threat it was built to destroy", "title": "Dick Cheney is in Obama\u2019s head: Why U.S. foreign policy is broken", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The American national security machinery seems incapable of handling the single threat it was built to destroy", "title": "Dick Cheney is in Obama\u2019s head: Why U.S. foreign policy is broken", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/07/dick_cheney_haunts_obama_why_u_s_foreign_policy_is_broken_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/obama_cheney.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The American national security machinery seems incapable of handling the single threat it was built to destroy", "title": "Dick Cheney is in Obama\u2019s head: Why U.S. foreign policy is broken", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/obama_cheney.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tom Engelhardt", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Iraq, Iraq war, TomDispatch, TomDispatch.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc3c6\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Iraq, Iraq war, TomDispatch, TomDispatch.com, News, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on TomDispatchLet\u2019s play a game, the kind that makes no sense on this single-superpower planet of ours.\nIn 2013, it upped its opium poppy cultivation by 36%, its opium production by almost 50%, and drug profits soared.\n(Hence, President Obama\u2019s recent decision to extend the U.S. combat role in Afghanistan through at least 2015.)\nWe\u2019re talking about full-scale invasions, long-term occupations, and nation-building programs, first in Afghanistan and then in Iraq.\nHaving imagined that, ask yourself: How well did all of that turn out for this other power?"}
