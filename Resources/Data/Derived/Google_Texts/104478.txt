Mia Love of Utah

Voters in the state of Utah elected Mia Love, the Brooklyn-born daughter of Haitian immigrants, to serve in the US House of Representatives.

Love, 38, is black and a fiscal conservative who graduated from Connecticut's University of Hartford. She supports gun rights, opposes a woman's right to choose abortion, and wants to repeal ObamaCare.

She also is the first black Republican woman to be elected to Congress. And she said in a speech, "My parents immigrated to the U. S. with 10 dollars in their pocket, believing that the America they had heard about really did exist. When times got tough, they didn't look to Washington, they looked within.''

Now there's an idea in opposition to the nanny state.

"The message of the Democrats is that the American dream is over. 'The government is all you have. Give up your dreams, and the government will save you, the government will heal you, the government will be your hope and change.' We know here in Utah, none of that is true."

If only they knew that in New York.

She also said, "The government is not your salvation. The government is not your road to prosperity. Hard work, education will take you far beyond what any government program can ever promise."
