Q: What are the best exercises to improve balance?

A: Your options are legion. Tai chi, for instance, rapidly builds balance. A study published last year found that older people after several weeks of tai chi classes performed much better on balance tests, and generally performed better than another group who had spent those same weeks learning ballroom dancing.

Similarly, yoga generally enhances balance. In a study published in January, collegiate male athletes displayed better balance after 10 weeks of yoga classes than a control group.

But you also can become less wobbly without leaving your living room.

“All you need is some space, a table or wall nearby to steady yourself if needed, and a pillow,” said Jay Hertel, a professor of sports medicine at the University of Virginia.

Simply stand near a wall and raise and bend one of your legs. Press that leg against your other leg, stork style. Try not to sway. If you start to topple, steady yourself against the wall. Hold this stance for as long as possible, then switch legs and repeat.

Seem easy? Do it with your eyes closed, or stand on a thick pillow, which makes the ground unstable. (A wobble board also works, but pillows are cheaper.)

“Stand on one leg while you brush your teeth,” Hertel suggested, “and close your eyes if it’s too easy. It may sound ridiculous, but if you do that for two or three minutes a day, you’re working your balance really well.”
