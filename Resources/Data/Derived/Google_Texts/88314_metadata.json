Facilities in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act have had it particularly hard. Kansas--which has the highest number of critical access facilities in the country--has not expanded its Medicaid program. Georgia, another state that has not expanded Medicaid, has also seen its rural hospitals suffer financially.\n\nAnd while Kentucky has expanded its Medicaid program, Becker's said 68 percent of its rural hospitals are below the national average in assessed financial strength and 15 are in danger of closing.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Becker's Hospital CFO article\n\n- check out the High Plains Public Radio report\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNumerous reasons for the rural hospital crisis\n\nGeorgia's rural hospitals continue to deteriorate\n\nRural Tennessee hospitals struggle to stay open\n\nRural healthcare crisis: What does the future hold?", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u200bAs many as 30 rural hospitals in Kentucky and Kansas are at risk of closing due to financial duress, Becker's\u00a0Hospital CFO\u00a0has\u00a0reported.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthFinance", "description": "\u200bAs many as 30 rural hospitals in Kentucky and Kansas are at risk of closing due to financial duress, Becker's\u00a0Hospital CFO\u00a0has\u00a0reported.", "title": "Rural health crisis: 30 hospitals in two states could close", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthfinance.com/story/rural-health-crisis-30-hospitals-two-states-could-close/2015-04-27", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthfinance.jpg", "type": "website"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "hospitals,National Rural Health Association,Operations & Business Management,rural hospitals", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0611\"", "article_summary": "Georgia, another state that has not expanded Medicaid, has also seen its rural hospitals suffer financially.\nAs many as 30 rural hospitals in Kentucky and Kansas are at risk of closing due to financial duress, Becker's Hospital CFO has reported.\nTo learn more:- read the Becker's Hospital CFO article- check out the High Plains Public Radio reportRelated Articles:Numerous reasons for the rural hospital crisisGeorgia's rural hospitals continue to deteriorateRural Tennessee hospitals struggle to stay openRural healthcare crisis: What does the future hold?\nRural hospitals have been in a fiscal crisis for several years now, with the NRHA saying that 48 hospitals have shut down since 2010, and another 283 are experiencing financial duress.\nA number of factors have hit rural facilities hard, including a tough financial environment and declining populations in their service areas, according to Becker's."}
