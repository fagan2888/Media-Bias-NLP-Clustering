Critiques of ABC’s internet broadcast of the final Democratic presidential debate before the primaries flooded social media on Saturday night.

Journalists and progressive public figures already criticized the DNC for holding the critical New Hampshire debate on the Saturday night before Christmas.

ABC also unexpectedly pushed back the debate from 8pm to 8:30pm, despite advertising the former time for days.

When the debate finally started, users across the U.S. reported widespread skips and freezes in ABC’s web live-stream.

Very disappointed with @ABC's live stream of the Democratic Debate. Worst feed of all time. #demdebate — WaWa (@ConnorWaWa) December 20, 2015

@Xylious @ABC has one of, if not THE, worst streaming platform. unwatchable — Ilana Steinberg (@lanibirdtweets) December 20, 2015

@ABC Fix your live stream or don't host a presidential debate. — Robert Vankirk (@vankirkr89) December 20, 2015

@ABC has no problem streaming required ads when I load their pages. Why is the stream of the debate itself such poor quality? — Adam Ward (@WardHydroLab) December 20, 2015
