Ted Cruz at the San Diego\u2019s Town and Country Hotel on Monday evening\n\nA total of 2,000 tickets were made available to the public on April 8, and were sold out in roughly half-a-day\u2019s time .\n\nCruz spoke for about 30 minutes and focused on what he called the three critical issues in this year\u2019s campaign: jobs, freedom and security.\n\nHe touched on bringing back small businesses to America by \u201ctaking the boot of the federal government off of the backs of the necks of small businesses,\u201d getting rid of Obamacare and passing a simple flat tax.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. We will pass common sense health-care reform that makes health care personal and portable and affordable and keeps government from getting in between us and our doctors. We will pass a simple flat tax, where every American can fill out their taxes on a post card. And when we do that, we should abolish the IRS.\u201d\n\nCruz also spoke out about his plans for illegal immigration, saying he wanted to bring America back to its original principles and values.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stop amnesty and secure the borders and end sanctuarycities and end welfare benefits for those here illegally.\u201d\n\nHe also added, after a supporter in the crowd yelled out, \u201cWhat about the fence?\u201d, that planned to add more fence and triple the Border Batrol. He gave his word that he will end illegal immigration if elected president.\n\nSome people at the rally were undecided whom to vote for and showed up to hear what Cruz had to say.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been super interested in the whole presidential race and the campaign,\u201d said Brayan Gonzalez, a 22-year-old Republican. \u201cPersonally, we\u2019re Republicans and we don\u2019t really have a candidate that we can get behind right now or that we really support, so we\u2019re just getting a feel for the different candidates and right now Ted Cruz is the one who\u2019s out here, so we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nThe crowd at the rally was mixed between older and younger voters. Patrick Johnson, a 25-year old business owner, wanted to see what Cruz had to offer him. He who was on the fence between voting for Cruz or Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI think the reason why I showed up is I really care about the future of the country and my future. So when you look at politics, politics kind of runs the whole show. So if you know what\u2019s going on politically and get in with the right people, you can kind of control your destiny. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m young and I\u2019m here at this rally.\u201d\n\nAfter the rally, a number of supporters were outside holding signs of who they thought should be elected the next resident.\n\nFormer City College student Michael Farrell was outside of the rally holding a Donald Trump sign. He chose not to go into the rally because he didn\u2019t want to support Cruz.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t support Cruz based on the fact that he didn\u2019t right away show up to vote to audit the Fed (Federal Reserve). If you don\u2019t show up to the vote to audit the Federal Reserve Bank right away, you\u2019re not even electable to me.\u201d\n\nCalifornia is established as a \u201cno-party reference\u201d state, which means voters who are not affiliated with a party can choose whom they would like to vote for on election day.\n\nAs it turns out, California\u2019s primary election, with 172 delegates at stake, could be the deciding factor for the Republican Party. As of now, Donald Trump has 743 delegates and Cruz is trailing behind, with 545. A total of 1,237 delegates are needed to secure the nomination.", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"url": "http://www.sdcitytimes.com/news/2016/04/12/mixed-crowd-checks-out-cruz/", "site_name": "City Times", "type": "article", "description": "A mixed crowd of old and young people, including some undecideds, attended a presidential rally for Sen.
