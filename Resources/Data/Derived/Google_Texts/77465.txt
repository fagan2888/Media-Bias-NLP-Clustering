A 4.2 magnitude earthquake centered north of Oklahoma City hit Friday morning, the latest in a series of quakes that's prompted state regulators to call for more restrictions on oil and gas operators.

According the U.S. Geological Survey's website, the quake happened at 5:39 a.m. in an area 3 miles northeast of Edmond and 16 miles north-northeast of Oklahoma City. It happened at practically the same spot as a damaging Tuesday quake - and at practically the same time of day.

Comments left on the KAKE News Twitter feed indicate people felt the quake in midtown Wichita and Derby. It reportedly was strong enough to knock items off a bathroom shelf in derby.

Oklahoma has become one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world, with the number of quakes magnitude 3.0 or greater skyrocketing from a few dozen in 2012 to more than 800 in 2015.

Many of the earthquakes are occurring in swarms in areas where injection wells pump salty wastewater -- a byproduct of oil and gas production -- into the earth.
