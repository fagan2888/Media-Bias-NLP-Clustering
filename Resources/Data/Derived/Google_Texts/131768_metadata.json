Several of these claims have come into question (including an Americans for Prosperity ad that received two Pinocchios from our own Glenn Kessler).\n\n\"Those tales turned out to be just that -- tales, stories made up from whole cloth,\" Reid said, accusing the Koch brothers of \"trying to buy America.\"\n\nIn response to Reid's remarks, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) office sent out dozens of local media clips featuring people whose premiums increased or had other problems related to Obamacare.\n\nUpdate 1:08 p.m.: Koch spokesman Philip Ellender has released the following statement, noting that the AFP ad features a woman suffering from leukemia:\n\n\"While Charles Koch and David Koch were not responsible for the advertisement in question, we believe it is disgraceful that Senator Reid and his fellow Democrats are attacking a cancer victim as part of their campaign against Charles Koch and David Koch.\"\n\nUpdate 4:22 p.m.: Reid has now softened his statement -- albeit slightly. He said on the Senate floor: \"I can't say that every one of the Koch brothers' ads are a lie, but I'll say this: Mr. President, the vast, vast majority of them are.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reid referred to ads being run by conservative groups featuring the stories of people affected by Obamacare.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aaronblakewp?fref=ts", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Reid referred to ads being run by conservative groups featuring the stories of people affected by Obamacare.", "title": "Harry Reid: All Obamacare horror stories are \u2018untrue\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/02/26/harry-reid-all-obamacare-horror-stories-are-untrue/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacarefacts-images/obamacare-cartoon-2-a.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@aaronblake"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/02/26/harry-reid-all-obamacare-horror-stories-are-untrue/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "washington post politics, harry reid, harry reid obamacare horror stories, obamacare, obamacare ads, americans for prosperity,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aaronblakewp?fref=ts"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "washington post politics, harry reid, harry reid obamacare horror stories, obamacare, obamacare ads, americans for prosperity,"}, "article_summary": "\"Despite all that good news, there's plenty of horror stories being told,\" Reid said on the Senate floor.\n(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) declared Wednesday that all of the \"horror stories\" being told in relation to the federal health-care law are false.\nReid referred to ads being run by conservative groups featuring the stories of people affected bythe Affordable Care Act.\n\"Those tales turned out to be just that -- tales, stories made up from whole cloth,\" Reid said, accusing the Koch brothers of \"trying to buy America.\"\nHe said on the Senate floor: \"I can't say that every one of the Koch brothers' ads are a lie, but I'll say this: Mr. President, the vast, vast majority of them are.\""}
