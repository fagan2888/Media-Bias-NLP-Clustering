The Ken Ham-helmed organization Answers in Genesis has responded week after week with blog posts attempting to explain away Neil deGrasse Tyson with a tedious Bible-based refrain.\n\nThough it is not part of his science-rooted belief system, Tyson, for his part, has said that there are plenty of \u201cfully functioning\u201d scientists who believe in God. The issue is treating the Bible as a scientific text, which is what Young Earth creationists do.\n\n\u201cNone of that [the Bible] is consistent with any scientifically derived information about the world,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cSo enlightened religious people know this, and don\u2019t try to use the Bible as a textbook, using a Western example.\u201d\n\nHere are some major moments that made creationists fume.\n\n1) On the age of the universe\n\nIf you\u2019re a Young Earth creationist, you believe that the world was created by God somewhere between 6,000 and 7,000 years ago. But in the fourth episode, \u201cA Sky Full of Ghosts,\u201d Tyson explains why scientists know for a fact that the universe is much, much older.\n\nYou see, light from the Crab Nebula is around 6,500 light-years from Earth \u2014 meaning light from the nebula takes 6,500 years to reach us. And the Crab Nebula is relatively close to Earth; that there are celestial objects much farther away whose light reaches our planet means that they must be older as a result. Tyson explains:\n\n\u201cBut if the universe were only 6,500 years old, how could we see the light of anything more distant than the Crab Nebula? We couldn\u2019t. There wouldn\u2019t have been enough time for the light to get to Earth from anywhere farther away than 6,500 light years in any direction. That\u2019s just enough time for light to travel a tiny portion of our Milky Way Galaxy. To believe in a universe as young as six or seven thousand years old is to extinguish the light from most of the galaxy not to mention the light from all the 100 billion other galaxies in the observable universe.\u201d\n\nNaturally this set off a firestorm of pseudo-science from Ken Ham\u2019s Young Earth creationist group, Answers in Genesis.\n\n2) On the age of the Earth\n\nIn \u201cThe Clean Room,\u201d Episode 7 of the series, Neil deGrasse Tyson starts with a query: How old is the Earth?\n\nMany scientists have pondered this question over the years. One of the earliest was Irish Archbishop James Ussher, who published several works in the mid-1600s known collectively as \u201cChronology,\u201d in which he calculated the age of the Earth based on clues supposedly hidden in the Bible.\n\nAnd the date he arrived at: 4004 B.C.\n\nTyson doesn\u2019t blame Ussher for using the Bible, as it was the predominant text at the time. He does, however, point out that a much more accurate \u201cbook\u201d is now readily available to scientists \u2014 one written in the Earth\u2019s rocks and sediment. Observing the layers of the planet\u2019s crust, scientists can measure with increasingly remarkable accuracy the actual age of the Earth. One such scientist whom Tyson introduces to viewers is Caltech researcher Clair Patterson. Through a tedious process, depicted in the video below, Patterson determined that the Earth was 4.5 billion years old. Once again, creationists responded none too kindly to such a suggestion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Cosmos\" may be finishing soon, but these truths are written in the stars -- whether Ken Ham likes it or not VIDEO", "author": "Sarah Gray", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Cosmos\" may be finishing soon, but these truths are written in the stars -- whether Ken Ham likes it or not VIDEO", "title": "Five \u201cCosmos\u201d moments that made creationists\u2019 heads explode", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/08/neil_degrasse_tysons_scientific_smackdown_7_cosmos_moments_that_made_creationists_heads_explode/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/neil_degrasse_tyson_jesus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Cosmos\" may be finishing soon, but these truths are written in the stars -- whether Ken Ham likes it or not VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/neil_degrasse_tyson_jesus.jpg", "title": "Five \u201cCosmos\u201d moments that made creationists\u2019 heads explode", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Five \u201cCosmos\u201d moments that made creationists\u2019 heads explode", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, age of the earth, cosmos, Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, Creationism, Editor's Picks, Evolution, Neil degrasse Tyson, Science, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabb1\"", "article_summary": "The issue is treating the Bible as a scientific text, which is what Young Earth creationists do.\n\u201cSo enlightened religious people know this, and don\u2019t try to use the Bible as a textbook, using a Western example.\u201dHere are some major moments that made creationists fume.\n1) On the age of the universeIf you\u2019re a Young Earth creationist, you believe that the world was created by God somewhere between 6,000 and 7,000 years ago.\nYou see, light from the Crab Nebula is around 6,500 light-years from Earth \u2014 meaning light from the nebula takes 6,500 years to reach us.\nObserving the layers of the planet\u2019s crust, scientists can measure with increasingly remarkable accuracy the actual age of the Earth."}
