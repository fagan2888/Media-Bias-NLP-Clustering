Jamelle Bouie on how poor blacks got shut out.\n\nBy the time it was fully formed, the Confederacy had eleven member states: Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and the territory that is now Oklahoma.\n\nThis, with the exception of Arkansas, is also a partial list of those states that have rejected the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. As the New York Times points out in today\u2019s must-read story, the direct result of this is to block millions of Americans from access to health insurance. And while Southern states don\u2019t comprise the majority of those that aren\u2019t expanding Medicaid, the majority of people who will suffer are poor, black, and in their borders. These are some of the most vulnerable people in the country\u2014with terrible outcomes on most measures of well-being\u2014and Obamacare won\u2019t help them.\n\nNow, you could call this a coincidence, but then you\u2019d have to grapple with a few things. First, that these are states which\u2014in the aftermath of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the Voting Rights Act\u2014passed draconian voter identification laws that limit access and burden low-income blacks with onerous requirements. In North Carolina, for instance, Republicans banned paid voter registration drives, removed a week from the early voting period, eliminated flexibility in voting hours, and made it difficult for precincts to designate additional voting sites for the elderly or those with disabilities. The effects of this are so disparate as to compel action from the Justice Department, which is suing North Carolina\u2013and Texas\u2014for alleged racial discrimination in voting rights.\n\nThese are also states characterized by the most racially polarized voting in the country. The overwhelming majority of Republican voters in states like Mississippi and Alabama are white, and the overwhelming majority of Democratic voters in those states are black. As a recent paper found, \u201cGeneral Social Survey and National Election Studies data from the 1970s to the present indicate that whites residing in the old Confederacy continue to display more racial antagonism and ideological conservatism than non-Southern whites.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times notes that conservative lawmakers \u201cbristle\u201d at the suggestion that race has anything to do with their rejection of the Medicaid expansion. \u201cState Senator Giles Ward of Mississippi, a Republican, called the idea that race was a factor \u2018preposterous,\u2019 and said that with the demographics of the South\u2014large shares of poor people and, in particular, poor blacks\u2014\u2019you can argue pretty much any way you want.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know if racial animus was a factor in the South\u2019s rejection of the Medicaid expansion. But if the Southern states have large shares of poor black people, it\u2019s because\u2014for the bulk of their history\u2014they were explicitly organized to maintain black disadvantage, a fact that shapes almost everything about the region. The deep anti-government ethos of Southern conservatism, for instance, has its roots in slavery, Jim Crow, and white supremacy. The slaveholders who articulated \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d ideology in antebellum period gave way to the post-Confederates who used law and violence to maintain the white power structure. In turn, their descendants\u2014who occupied both parties for the better part of a century\u2014worked furiously to undermine public goods and keep federal interference to a minimum. There\u2019s a reason, after all, that the far right of the South is also home to a variety of white nationalists and unabashed neo-Confederates.\n\nNo, this is not a convoluted way of calling Republicans racists. It is, however, a reminder that the political culture of the South is profoundly shaped by race. \u201cContemporary differences in political attitudes across counties in the American South trace their origins back to the influence of slavery\u2019s prevalence more than 150 years ago,\u201d note political scientists at the University of Rochester in a paper exploring the legacy of slavery. Race, simply put, is encoded in the politics of the South. Lawmakers can have \u201ccolorblind\u201d motives, but there is no colorblind policy: To reject the Medicaid expansion is to disadvantage African Americans. There\u2019s no other way around it.\n\nThis raises a disturbing question. If Medicaid is an anti-poverty measure, and if it the expansion is meant to provide an additional floor of support for low-income Americans, what happens when there\u2019s a large racial divide in who benefits, itself a product of past racism? At The Atlantic, Ta-Nehisi Coates looks at this racial disparity and connects it to past expansions of the social safety net, which\u2014for similar reasons\u2014either excluded blacks or left them with fewer benefits. He writes that with Obamacare, \u201cone can see how an ostensibly, and well intentioned, progressive and color-blind policy proposal can actually expand a wealth gap.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. News,", "publicationDate": 201310031759, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "Thanks to Republican legislators in old Confederate states, universal health-care won\u2019t be so universal.
