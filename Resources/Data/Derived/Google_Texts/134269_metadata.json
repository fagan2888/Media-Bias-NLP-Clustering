Valley View Blvd., during World Breastfeeding Week. The free family event is set to include information booths, refreshments, infant massage, Gymboree play time, face painting, giveaways and more.\n\nAdmission to the event is free (mention it at the ticket window). It does not include general admission to the Springs Preserve, and museum and gallery admission are separate. Last year, the first year that Naturally Nurturing was held, saw about 100 attendees.\n\nBreastfeeding has been called Mom\u2019s special gift.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something a mom can give to her infant, that only she can do,\u201d said Madeleine Sigman-Grant, Ph.D., a registered dietitian and president of the Southern Nevada Breastfeeding Coalition. \u201cThe ingredients in breast milk are unique and cannot be replicated in a can of formula. The only things we\u2019ve been able to replicate are the nutrients, but there is so much more \u2014 immune properties, growth factors, things that affect the brain, the GI (gastrointestinal) tract \u2014 we can\u2019t put that blend into a can.\u201d\n\nShe said nursing provides a time for a mother to bond with her baby, especially in today\u2019s hectic world when women often return to work. Sigman-Grant said the rates for breastfeeding in Nevada show that more than 80 percent of women want to breastfeed, at least part of the time.\n\nThe view of breastfeeding has been changing, she said.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning it was, like, that\u2019s disgusting. \u2026 Now, we\u2019re recognizing that it is the natural thing to do,\u201d Sigman-Grant said, adding that generations of formula-raised infants would likely show that they fall short in terms of health, intelligence and capabilities.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, breastfeeding rates continue to rise. Breastfeeding initiation increased from 74.6 percent in 2008 births to 76.9 percent in 2009 births. This improvement in initiation represents the largest annual increase over the previous decade. Breastfeeding at 6 months increased from 44.3 percent to 47.2 percent.\n\nChristine Fergus, childbirth educator for Summerlin Hospital Medical Center, 657 N. Town Center Drive, said the majority of women giving birth there elect to breastfeed and can attend classes, which average 15 couples. They are held twice a month, one in the afternoon and one in the evening.\n\nAttendees learn feeding cues \u2014 the baby moving his lips while sleeping, sucking on his fist and bobbing his head up and down. Crying is a late sign of hunger. They\u2019re taught to expect the infant to nurse eight to 12 times in each 24-hour period and the most common ways to hold a child for breastfeeding, which are the cradle hold, the football hold and lying down.\n\n\u201cI think most women understand that it is the best milk for the baby, that it\u2019s the natural food for humans,\u201d Fergus said. \u201cThey know there are a lot of immunity factors, but I don\u2019t think most know that it\u2019s disease prevention, not just helping when the child is a baby. It helps reduce diseases later on like heart disease and diabetes and obesity, even as an adult.\u201d\n\nBreastfeeding also has benefits for the mother.\n\n\u201cIt helps them reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes and those metabolic type of diseases,\u201d Fergus said. \u201cIt burns those calories, that weight we put on during pregnancy. It burns about 500 calories a day. So, it helps our metabolism, too.\u201d\n\nThere are still social barriers and economic constraints, even though Nevada was one of the first states to enact a law, Nevada Revised Statutes 201-232, protecting a mother\u2019s right to breastfeed in public.\n\n\u201cWhen a baby is hungry, a baby is hungry,\u201d Sigman-Grant said. \u201cA woman should not have to hide something that is natural. She shouldn\u2019t have to go out to her car to breastfeed when it\u2019s 105 degrees outside. Nor should she have to go to the ladies\u2019 room to feed her baby. After all, how would you like it if your lunch was (served) in a bathroom?\u201d\n\nSigman-Grant said in a perfect world, businesses, restaurants and community sites would have a private area set aside just for breastfeeding.\n\nFergus noted that besides the hassles of pumping milk at work, it\u2019s \u201cnot as pleasant as when you\u2019re holding your baby. Pumping is not the same and it also doesn\u2019t empty the breast as well as a baby does.\u201d\n\nThat means the milk supply drops and mothers have to supplement baby formula with their milk.\n\n\u201cSometimes, they just give up,\u201d Fergus said. \u201cIt takes real dedication to continue pumping. The recommendation is at least a year.\u201d\n\nObstacles to breastfeeding can occur in the home as well, when fathers and grandparents insist they be allowed to feed the baby. There are other ways they can bond with the infant, said Sigman-Grant, such as giving the baby a massage or a bath, taking him for a walk or singing to him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Mom\u2019s milk that will get that baby to strive, to grow, to be protective,\u201d Sigman-Grant said.\n\nIn 10 years, she said she\u2019d like to see breastfeeding be the norm, with mother\u2019s milk fed exclusively to infants for at least the first three or four months of life.\n\nFor breastfeeding assistance, visit nevadabreastfeeding.org or call 702-257-5583.\n\nFor more information about the event, visit snvbreastfeeding.org or call the Springs Preserve at 702-822-7700.\n\nContact Summerlin Area View reporter Jan Hogan at jhogan@viewnews.com or 702-387-2949.", "article_metadata": {"description": "August is National Breastfeeding Month, and Naturally Nurturing, a breastfeeding community fair, is scheduled from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Aug. 9 at the Springs Preserve, during World Breastfeeding Week.
