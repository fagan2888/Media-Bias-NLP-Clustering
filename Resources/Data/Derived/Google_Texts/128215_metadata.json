I enjoy being a enator. I love the senate, It\u2019s dented a little bit, banged up a ittle bit, but it\u2019s still functional,\u201d Harkin said during an interview Friday on IPTV. \u201c\u2026But, again, it\u2019s time for me to move on. It\u2019s time for me to retire. It\u2019s time for young people and new people to come in.\u201d\n\nThe current federal spending plan expires this Thursday, December 11. Harkin thinks congress may vote for a one-week delay that keeps the current spending levels in place, then vote next week on a long-term, comprehensive spending plan.\n\nHarkin\u2019s voluntary exit from the senate comes 42 years after he first sought to enter congress. Harkin ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1972, but lost. He ran again in 1974 and won.\n\n\u201cIn my first political campaign I spent $20,000. Now that was kind of a wave year. That was an anti-McGovern wave year. Two years later the wave went the other way with Watergate. I think in that year I spent a little over $100,000 in winning a congressional seat,\u201d Harkin said. \u201cThink about that compared to today.\u201d\n\nNearly $62 million was spent on this year\u2019s battle between Joni Ernst and Bruce Braley to claim Harkin\u2019s seat. After 10 years in the U.S. House, Harkin won the Iowa senate seat in 1984 and defeated three Republican congressman along the way to stay in the senate. He\u2019s served as chairman of the Ag Committee and lead drafting the Farm Bill and he\u2019s currently chairman of the committee that helped draft the Affordable Care Act, but Harkin called passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act the \u201cpremiere\u201d accomplishment of his political career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very blessed and the people of Iowa have given me the opportunity to stay there long enough to see what it has done to this country,\u201d Harkin said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing the changes that have been made.\u201d\n\nHarkin plans to take a two-month-long vacation, then return to Iowa in March for work at the Harkin Institute which was established at Drake University last year.\n\n\u201cThe Institute at Drake is totally bipartisan. We have a bipartisan board. In fact, I have a former chair of the Iowa Republican Party on the board. I have Republicans on the board,\u201d Harkin said. \u201cI want it to be a totally non-partisan entity and Drake has set it up that way.\u201d\n\nOne of the Harkin Institute\u2019s panel discussions this past summer featured both Harkin and Republican Governor Terry Branstad. Archivists from Drake University and the U.S. Senate have been working in Harkin\u2019s office over the past few months, starting the process of converting Harkin\u2019s work papers from 40 years in congress to a digital forum.\n\n\u201cOnce in a while they come across some very interesting tidbits, shall we say, of legislationa nnd letters and things like that that I had forgotten about long, long ago,\u201d Harkin said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some surprises.\u201d\n\nAll that material will be stored at Drake and a semi will transport between 400 and 500 boxes of documents from D.C. to Drake at the end of this year. The Iowa Democratic Party faces big decisions after election losses last month, but Harkin \u2014 who has been the party\u2019s top elected official \u2014 plans to focus on what he calls the \u201cbipartisan\u201d work at the Harkin Institute rather than steer selection of a new party chairman in January.\n\n\u201cI am a Democrat and I love my party and I want them to have good policies and good candidates, so I hope to be supportive in some way, but I don\u2019t intend to be any kind of \u2018godfather\u2019 or something like that,\u201d Harkin said.\n\nHarkin\u2019s annual \u201cSteak Fry\u201d fundraiser has been a launching pad for Democratic presidential candidates over the years. Bill and Hillary Clinton were the speakers this past September at what was billed at the time as the final Harkin Steak Fry.\n\n\u201cPeople are talking to me about maybe revisiting that, \u2018Never again,'\u201d Harkin said, laughing. \u201c\u2026Stay tuned on that one.\u201d\n\nIf Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016, Harkin believes she\u2019ll have competition from people like former Virginia Senator Jim Webb and Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley. Harkin\u2019s wife, Ruth, endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Harkin has offered Clinton some advice about running in the 2016 Iowa Caucuses.\n\n\u201cI said: \u2018Don\u2019t just go to Des Moines or Waterloo or Cedar Rapids or Dubuque. Go to the rural areas. Start out in smaller communities in Iowa,'\u201d Harkin said. \u201c\u2018Let them know you care about rural America and small towns and communities. You can get to the cities later on, but plant your flag in rural Iowa.'\u201d\n\nHarkin ran for president himself in 1992. The experience taught him what a \u201ccomplex country\u201d we live in and it made him a \u201cbetter senator.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I really wasn\u2019t prepared to run for president. I hadn\u2019t really spent a lot of time thinking about it before. I\u2019d thought about being a senator or being a congressman and I was really just focused on Iowa,\u201d Harkin said. \u201c\u2026I think I could have been a pretty decent president, but I wouldn\u2019t have had another happy day in my life.\u201d\n\nVideo of Harkin\u2019s weekend appearance on Iowa Public Television\u2019s \u201cIowa Press\u201d program is posted here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Radio Iowa", "description": "As congress faces a Thursday deadline to pass a federal budget plan, Senator Tom Harkin is in the middle of the negotiations, focused on health-care-related spending, but he\u2019s not regretting \u2026", "title": "Harkin: no regrets about retirement, but \u2018Steak Fry\u2019 might be revived", "url": "http://www.radioiowa.com/2014/12/08/harkin-no-regrets-about-retirement-but-steak-fry-might-be-revived/", "image": "http://cdn.radioiowa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Harkin-Clinton.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-08T13:30:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-08T18:10:53+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019d thought about being a senator or being a congressman and I was really just focused on Iowa,\u201d Harkin said.\nStart out in smaller communities in Iowa,'\u201d Harkin said.\nHarkin\u2019s annual \u201cSteak Fry\u201d fundraiser has been a launching pad for Democratic presidential candidates over the years.\nBill and Hillary Clinton were the speakers this past September at what was billed at the time as the final Harkin Steak Fry.\nAfter 10 years in the U.S. House, Harkin won the Iowa senate seat in 1984 and defeated three Republican congressman along the way to stay in the senate."}
