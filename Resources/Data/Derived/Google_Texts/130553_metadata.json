Trump spoke about immigration and Obamacare, among other topics, to around 14,000 supporters at the event.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump exaggerates his prescience on the 9/11 terrorist attacks when he claims he \u201cpredicted Osama bin Laden\u201d in a 2000 book.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim came during an interview on the Alex Jones Radio Show on Dec. 2 (starting at the 4:40-minute mark).\n\nTrump, Dec. 2: I wrote a very political book years ago in the year 2000, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d and I said in that book that we better be careful with this guy named Osama bin Laden. I mean I really study this stuff. I really find it very interesting, and even though I\u2019m a businessman I find it \u2014 I\u2019ve always found, I\u2019ve always been involved in politics \u2014 I said we better be careful with Osama bin Laden. There\u2019s a guy named Osama bin Laden. Nobody really knew who he was. But he was nasty. He was saying really nasty things about our country and what he wants to do to it. And I wrote in the book [in] 2000 \u2014 two years before the World Trade Center came down \u2014 I talked to you about Osama bin Laden, you better take him out. I said he\u2019s going to crawl under a rock. You better take him out. And now people are seeing that, they\u2019re saying, \u201cYou know, Trump predicted Osama bin Laden\u201d \u2013 which actually is true. And two years later, a year and a half later he knocked down the World Trade Center.\n\n\u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d which was published in January 2000, makes a single reference to bin Laden. It doesn\u2019t warn \u201cwe better be careful with this guy named Osama bin Laden.\u201d It doesn\u2019t say the U.S. \u201cbetter take him out.\u201d And Trump\u2019s reference to bin Laden as someone \u201cnobody really knew\u201d at the time is wrong, too.\n\nHere\u2019s the lone reference to bin Laden in Trump\u2019s:\n\nInstead of one looming crisis hanging over us, we face a bewildering series of smaller crises, flash points, standoffs, and hot spots. We\u2019re not playing the chess game to end all chess games anymore. We\u2019re playing tournament chess \u2014 one master against many rivals. One day we\u2019re all assured that Iraq is under control, the UN inspectors have done their work, everything\u2019s fine, not to worry. The next day the bombing begins. One day we\u2019re told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named Osama bin-Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jetfighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later it\u2019s on to a new enemy and new crisis.\n\nThe book\u2019s reference to bin Laden escaping U.S. jetfighters refers to an Aug. 21, 1998, attack ordered by then-President Clinton. The attacks were carried out in Afghanistan and Sudan in response to the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier that month. They were designed to \u201cdisrupt bin Laden\u2019s terrorist network,\u201d as Clinton explained in a radio address.\n\nClinton, Aug. 22, 1998: Our goals were to disrupt bin Ladin\u2019s terrorist network and destroy elements of its infrastructure in Afghanistan and Sudan. And our goal was to destroy, in Sudan, the factory with which bin Ladin\u2019s network is associated, which was producing an ingredient essential for nerve gas.\n\nSo, bin Laden was well known by the time Trump\u2019s book came out \u2014 even though Trump now says \u201cnobody really knew who he was.\u201d Also, the book doesn\u2019t say the U.S. needs to redouble its efforts to \u201ctake him out,\u201d as Trump now tells it.\n\nInstead, the book criticizes the Clinton administration for its \u201chaphazard\u201d handling of \u201cmultiple threats.\u201d Trump ends that section of the book by writing: \u201cYes, we do face multiple threats we didn\u2019t face before. But this isn\u2019t to say we are walking in the dark. Instead, we know who and what the threats are. The problem is that we\u2019re totaling mishandling them.\u201d\n\nIt does, in another part of the book, say that the U.S. is in danger of \u201cthe sort of terrorist attacks that will make the [1993] bombing of the World Trade Center look like kids playing with firecrackers,\u201d referring to an earlier, less deadly attack in 1993. But he was not alone in that concern. As Trump writes in his book, \u201cNo sensible analyst rejects this possibility.\u201d That was, after all, a reason why Clinton ordered the attack on bin Laden\u2019s terrorism network in 1998. Clinton said he ordered the strikes to \u201cprotect our citizens from future attacks.\u201d\n\nBut criticizing the Clinton administration for its handling of crises isn\u2019t the same thing as \u201cpredicting Osama bin Laden.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Eugene Kiely and Robert Farley\n\nFactCheck.org is a nonpartisan, nonprofit \u201cconsumer advocate\u201d for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in U.S. politics.
