He released the newest edition earlier this month. Here is a report from last year\u2019s.\n\nThe 2014 report is a reflection of the year prior, which capped with Tenet Health finalizing the acquisition of Vanguard in October and the humungous merger of Baylor Health Care System and Scott & White Health in September. Also, the Affordable Care Act had not yet completed its first open enrollment period. Methodist Health System had not paired with the Mayo Clinic, nor had Baylor and the Cleveland Clinic come to terms on their new cardiac alignment.\n\nSo, the numbers are a bit transitional. But, if you\u2019re interested in profits, they\u2019re certainly encouraging. Baumgarten notes that the state\u2019s hospital profitability remains \u201cvery strong,\u201d despite flat inpatient use. Indeed, three of the last four years have seen North Texas hospitals posting a cumulative profit margin of above 12 percent. In 2013, the region noted a 12.1 percent rate.\n\nAnd as we begin to see the impact of statewide mergers and acquisitions and strategic affiliations\u2014just look to Tenet\u2019s last few quarterly reports for evidence of its post-Vanguard successes\u2014the numbers will likely increase again going forward.\n\n\u201cI think the 2013 numbers will only hint at those things,\u201d Baumgarten says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to look a lot like the last two years, the same kind of trends with flat or declining inpatient days and strong profitability.\u201d\n\nJudging by total net income reported, Baylor Health Care System\u2019s reported $537 million\u2014a margin of 16 percent\u2014is the most profitable in North Texas. HCA trails at second, with a higher margin (18.5 percent) but a reported $383 million. Methodist Hospitals of Dallas is third, with $245 million and a 14.2 percent profit margin.\n\nBut inpatient rates are relatively stagnant and North Texas is in the midst of a healthcare building boom. Statewide, 65 percent of inpatient beds were in use on an average day. In 2007, it was 67.7 percent. Inpatient occupancy in Dallas-Fort Worth was even lower in 2013: 61.6 percent. HCA had the highest rate, with 67 percent, followed by Texas Health Resource\u2019s 61.3 percent.\n\n\u201cI suspect that there will come a time there will be some downsizing, but I think a big part of their strategy is to have as wide a geographic footprint as possible,\u201d Baumgarten said. \u201cYou may be constructing new hospitals in the further reaches of Denton County, or Waxahachie, where the new Baylor hospital went up. I think all these systems want to be out on the fringe of their home court metropolitan areas.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the increased access because of the Affordable Care Act\u2014About 740,000 Texans gained coverage during the first enrollment period, which wrapped in March 2014\u2014will increase the need for primary care services, but likely won\u2019t have an impact on the inpatient rates.\n\nThe hospital systems know this, and have begun increasing their presence in communities and neighborhoods, even going so far as partnering with big-box retailers and pharmacy stores like Walmart, Walgreens, and CVS.\n\nThe results from these strategies won\u2019t be evident until data from 2014 is released. But, it appears North Texas is in good shape heading into the disruption.
