But according to Georgetown law professor Randy Barnett, one of the architects of the legal challenge to Obamacare, those conservatives don't really understand what it is they're railing against. In the Obamacare case, Barnett writes in his new book, Our Republican Constitution: Securing the Liberty and Sovereignty of We the People, \"the chickens of the conservative commitment to judicial restraint [came] home to roost.\" For far too long, Barnett maintains, too many legal conservatives, from John Roberts on down, have championed judicial deference to majority rule at the expense of the judiciary's duty to enforce the Constitution and act as a check against the other branches of government. Barnett is now on a mission to upend that orthodoxy.
