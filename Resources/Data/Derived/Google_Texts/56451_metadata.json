James M. Taylor, a Senior Fellow with The Heartland Institute, a free market think tank, noted in January that \u201cNatural gas has high methane content, but the methane is converted to energy when natural gas is burnt.\u201d Citing U.S. Energy Information Administration data, Taylor noted \u201cThe ongoing decline in methane emissions supplements ongoing declines in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.\u201d Since 2000 both are down between 6% AND 9%.\n\nThe EPA is forever claiming billions in \u201chealth benefits\u201d that result from their regulations. The public never gets to see the data on which such claims are based. The regulations, however, cost billions.\n\nThe day before Thanksgiving, the EPA announced that it intends to propose an updated national standard for ground-level ozone, otherwise known as smog, based in part on the enforcement of rules concerning mercury. The previous day, the Supreme Court said it would review the agency\u2019s standards requiring reductions of mercury emissions and other elements the EPA regards as toxic air pollution.\n\nTo put all this in perspective, in August CNS News\u2019 Penny Starr reported on a study by the National Association of Manufacturers regarding the EPA\u2019s proposed regulation of ozone. It found that \u201cit could be the costliest federal rule by reducing the Gross National Product by $270 billion per year and $3.4 trillion from 2017 to 20140, and adds $3.3 trillion in compliance costs for the same period.\u201d NAM president, Jay Timmons, said \u201cThe regulation has the capacity to stop the manufacturing comeback in its tracks.\u201d\n\nConcurrently with NAM, the American Petroleum Institute released an analysis of the NAM study that said \u201cThe nation\u2019s air quality has improved over the past several years, and ozone emissions will continue to decline without new regulations.\u201d NAM\u2019s vice president of energy and resources policy, Ross Eisenberg, said, \u201cWe are rapidly approaching a point where we are requiring manufacturers to do the impossible.\u201d\n\nThat, however, is exactly what the ozone regulation is intended to do. This has nothing to do with health and everything to do with destroying the nation\u2019s power producers and manufacturers, reducing vital electrical energy, and forcing factories of every description to close.\n\nAt the upper levels of the atmosphere, the stratosphere, ozone is essential to the survival of life on Earth because ozone filters harmful ultraviolent (UV) radiation from sunlight. Otherwise the radiation would damage both plant and animal life. The reason you get sunburned is that too much UV radiation has caused it. Like everything else in nature, too much or too little determines the harm or benefit it provides, but that too is largely determined by nature.\n\nOzone is a form of elemental oxygen, but it\u2019s not something you want to breathe. As Wikipedia notes, \u201cIt is not emitted directly by car engines or by industrial operations, but formed by the reaction of sunlight on air containing hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides that react to form ozone directly at the source of the pollution or many kilometers down wind.\u201d The initial mandate of the EPA to clean the air and water has been achieved. That is why smog is relatively rare nationwide. Further regulation is regressive.\n\nAs for mercury, in 2011 the EPA issued 946 pages of new rules requiring U.S. power plants to sharply reduce their emissions of mercury even though they were already quite low. As with the proposed ozone rules, the EPA claimed that they would cost $10.9 billion annually to implement, but would save 17,000 lives while generating $140 billion in health benefits. This is all just hogwash. Such figures are just plucked out of the air or, worse, based on \u201cscience\u201d the public paid for but is not allowed to see!\n\nDoes anybody find it bizarre that, while the EPA is trying to remove the tiniest amounts of mercury in the environment, in 2011 Congress passed a law eliminate the incandescent light bulb and required their replacement by fluorescent lights that contain mercury?\n\nAs Willie Soon and Paul Driessen wrote in a 2011 Wall Street Journal commentary, \u201cMercury has always existed naturally in Earth\u2019s environment. Mercury is found in air, water, rocks, soil and trees, which absorb it from the environment.\u201d They noted that \u201cSince our power plants account for less than 0.5% of all the mercury in the air we breathe, eliminating every milligram of it will do nothing about the other 99.5% in our atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe fundamental EPA lies about ozone and mercury involve the issue of toxicity. Since both are a natural part of the Earth, and since the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, and since life expectancy has been increasing dramatically in recent decades, the likelihood that either represents a threat requiring the expenditure of billions to reduce tiny amounts of their emissions is based on environmental ideology, not on science.\n\nEven if it was based on alleged science we would, as noted, not be allowed to see the data. If this reminds you of the way ObamaCare was foisted on \u201cthe stupid voters\u201d, you\u2019re right. The EPA hopes you are stupid enough not to realize that it is engaged in the destruction of the economy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/12/take-your-pick-of-lies-about-ozone-methane-or-mercury/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AA-Blue-Skies.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Take Your Pick of Lies About Ozone, Methane or Mercury"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The previous day, the Supreme Court said it would review the agency\u2019s standards requiring reductions of mercury emissions and other elements the EPA regards as toxic air pollution.\nAs for mercury, in 2011 the EPA issued 946 pages of new rules requiring U.S. power plants to sharply reduce their emissions of mercury even though they were already quite low.\nAt the upper levels of the atmosphere, the stratosphere, ozone is essential to the survival of life on Earth because ozone filters harmful ultraviolent (UV) radiation from sunlight.\nEven if it was based on alleged science we would, as noted, not be allowed to see the data.\nAs Willie Soon and Paul Driessen wrote in a 2011 Wall Street Journal commentary, \u201cMercury has always existed naturally in Earth\u2019s environment."}
