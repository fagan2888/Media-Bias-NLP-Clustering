The guest became visibly choked up as he waxed on about how these carbon pollution standards would \u201ctriple\u201d the cost of energy for the poorest Americans while providing \u201cno environmental benefit at all.\u201d He also claimed that over the last 15 years Earth temperatures have stabilized (which obviously isn\u2019t true \u2014 seven of the top 10 warmest years on record have been since 1998).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about my coal miners,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m concerned about America, too.\u201d\n\nMurray Energy, in fact, has been fighting a regulation on coal dust that would help save 1,500 coal miners\u2019 lives per year. MediaMatters has more:\n\nOn April 23, the U.S. Labor Department announced a long-awaited rule to regulate coal dust, which causes the deadly black lung disease; the disease has reportedly killed over 76,000 miners since 1968. The new rule would restrict exposure to coal dust to half of the current limit, a move that is estimated to lower medical bills by about $37 million a year and help save hundreds of lives. Murray Energy announced that it would file a federal lawsuit against the regulation later that day\u2026 The EPA\u2019s carbon standards will reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by coal plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels and are an important effort to mitigate climate change. Their health benefits are expected to help prevent up to 6,600 premature deaths and 150,000 asthma attacks in 2030. Murray Energy is attempting to sue these regulations as well, and its effort has gained support from nine state legislatures.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CEO of Murray Energy is committed to giving poorer Americans cheaper electricity-- even if that means a worse life VIDEO", "title": "Coal CEO lionized by Fox News is no hero", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "CEO of Murray Energy is committed to giving poorer Americans cheaper electricity-- even if that means a worse life VIDEO", "title": "Coal CEO lionized by Fox News is no hero", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/01/coal_ceo_lionized_by_fox_news_is_no_hero/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/bob-murray.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CEO of Murray Energy is committed to giving poorer Americans cheaper electricity-- even if that means a worse life VIDEO", "title": "Coal CEO lionized by Fox News is no hero", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/bob-murray.png", "creator": "@@joannarothkopf", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joanna Rothkopf", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Coal, EPA, Fox News, murray energy, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Coal, EPA, Fox News, murray energy, Video, Sustainability News, News, Politics NewsThursday\u2019s edition of Fox News\u2019 \u201cYour World With Neil Cavuto\u201d welcomed Bob Murray, the CEO of America\u2019s largest privately owned coal company Murray Energy.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m concerned about America, too.\u201dMurray Energy, in fact, has been fighting a regulation on coal dust that would help save 1,500 coal miners\u2019 lives per year.\nMurray Energy is attempting to sue these regulations as well, and its effort has gained support from nine state legislatures.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about my coal miners,\u201d he said.\nThe new rule would restrict exposure to coal dust to half of the current limit, a move that is estimated to lower medical bills by about $37 million a year and help save hundreds of lives."}
