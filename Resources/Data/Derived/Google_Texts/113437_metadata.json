On the other, MMOPL, which has announced a promotional fare of Rs 10 for a month from Sunday, irrespective of distance, claims that the provisions of Metro Act, which overrules the concession agreement, entitles it to fix the fare. The operator has proposed to set fares at Rs 10, 20, 30 and 40.\n\n\n\nMMRDA, which holds a 26 per cent equity stake in MMOPL, has filed a writ petition in the against the company board\u2019s decision on fare fixation. Chief Minister told Business Standard: \u201cAccording to the tender, agreed to charge fares of Rs 9, 11 and 13 for the journey (depending on distance). But now, it is planning to charge between Rs 10 and Rs 40. This is totally unacceptable; has already approached the high court.\u201d He indicated he might not attend the Metro\u2019s inauguration, scheduled for 10 am on Sunday, if the company sticks to its decision on the new fare structure.\n\n\n\nChavan said the fare should have been fixed by the fare-fixation committee, comprising a sitting or retired judge and representatives of the Union and state governments. He alleged: \u201cThe Bharatiya Janata Party (which is in power at the Centre) is helping Reliance Infra in fare hike.\u201d He added BJP must make its stand clear on the issue of fares and take responsibility for any hike in ticket rates.\n\n\n\nDirector Debashish Mohanty, however, strongly defended the fare block of Rs 10 to Rs 40, saying it came to 1.5 times the bus fare charged by the BrihanMumbai Electric Supply & Transport (BEST) \u2014 Rs 6 to Rs 25 per trip \u2014 on the Versova-Ghatkopar route. \u201cThe Rs 10-40 fare, fixed in line with Section 33 of the Metro Act, is sustainable and affordable for people. MMOPL is duty-bound to fix the fare. The promoter is not going to get returns during the first year. We are in no way undermining the authority of the state government or MMRDA.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the chief minister\u2019s statement, Mohanty reiterated his stand that the Metro Act would prevail. To a question on whether the company would start services if the chief minister skipped the event, Mohanty said \u201call are invited at 9.45 am on Sunday\u201d.\n\n\n\nMohanty also said MMOPL would take a call on when to approach the fare-fixation committee for revision of rates and informed the Maharashtra government had yet to nominate its representatives on the committee.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, MMOPL CEO Abhay Mishra said the project cost had increased to Rs 4,321 crore from Rs 2,356 crore and the operation and maintenance cost had shot up to Rs 240 crore as on date (from the annual Rs 100 crore estimated in 2007). Mishra said MMOPL had all necessary clearances and the railway board had on Thursday given its final security clearance for the first phase of the Metro.\n\n\n\nThe Mumbai Metro is to run from 5.30 am to midnight every day, with a total of 16 rakes deployed on the sector, at an average speed of 80 kmph. Each of the colourful four-coach rakes will have a capacity to carry 375 commuters (1,500 commuters per service). \u201cThe number of coaches will be increased to six per train by 2017,\u201d said Mishra.\n\n\n\nAround 600,000 commuters are expected to travel by the Mumbai Metro daily, said Mishra, adding the total capacity would subsequently be scaled up to 1.5 million a day. \u201cThere will be 270-280 services both ways at intervals of around four minutes, covering the distance between Versova and Ghatkopar within 21 minutes.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt present, the Versova-Ghatkopar East-West corridor has no suburban train link. It is serviced by either BEST public buses or cabs, which take 90 to 120 minutes, depending on traffic density. The 12 stations are conveniently located, starting with Versova, DN Nagar, Azad Nagar, Andheri, Western Express Highway (WEH), Chakala, Airport Road, Marol Naka, Saki Naka, Subhash Nagar, Asalpha Road, Jagruti Nagar and terminating at Ghatkopar.\n\n\n\n\n\nSanjay Jog", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.business-standard.com", "rating": "General", "description": "Read more about Before Mumbai Metro hits tracks, a fare controversy on Business Standard.
