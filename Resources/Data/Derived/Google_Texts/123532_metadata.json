What is surprising is that Hallmark movies are also as addictive as sugar.\n\nAt first glance, the network\u2019s newest offering, \u201cMy Boyfriends\u2019 Dogs,\u201d seems like a retread of the 2005 film \u201cMust Love Dogs.\u201d Yet the movie has enough single-woman-who-wants-companionship-but-can\u2019t-find-the-right-guy angst to connect with a target audience weary of a culture that substitutes \u201cdating\u201d for \u201csex\u201d and depicts single women as mindless vixens interested only in the hunkiest guy they can con into a proposal.\n\nFrom the start, it\u2019s clear \u201cMy Boyfriends\u2019 Dogs\u201d is more Disney than \u201cSex in the City.\u201d It\u2019s set in an old-fashioned, G-rated world where the most risque twist involves two secondary characters deciding on a live-in romance.\n\nSound too sweet for your tastes? Don\u2019t judge this movie by its lack of adult physical situations. The plentiful adult psychological situations \u2014 which build to the lesson that a woman can find love without becoming a mirror to her boyfriends\u2019 hobbies, interests and belief systems \u2014 makes it stand out. Like it or not, many women still do just that.\n\nActress Teryl Rothery portrays the mother of main character \u2014 runaway bride Bailey Daly (Erika Christensen of NBC\u2019s \u201cParenthood\u201d) \u2014 and says the counsel her character gives her daughter is something Ms. Rothery hopes to one day instill in her real-life daughter.\n\n\u201cSo many friends of mine, both growing up and as adults, feel they need to change to suit certain men,\u201d Ms. Rothery said. \u201cSometimes women dumb it down a little, and that\u2019s just wrong. That\u2019s what I love about my character. She keeps reminding her daughter that she\u2019s an amazing young woman who shouldn\u2019t have to change to find love.\u201d\n\nAnd that, of course, is what Bailey discovers in the end.\n\nHallmark based the movie on the 2010 novel of the same name by Dandi Daley Mackall.\n\nAlthough the book is set in St. Louis, the movie seems to be in \u201cAnytown, USA,\u201d where the runaway bride finds herself in a diner on a rainy night explaining to its two owners (played by Joyce DeWitt of \u201cThree\u2019s Company\u201d and Michael Kopsa of \u201cFringe\u201d) why she walked away from three romances, but adopted her ex-boyfriends\u2019 dogs.\n\nAs the story unfolds, we see Bailey try to turn herself into an athlete, an intellectual and \u2014 for lack of a better term \u2014 a rich snob to win the hearts of the men she believes she loves.\n\nThe storyline might sound corny and some scenes may stretch credibility, there are plentiful scenes that ring hauntingly true in the face of loneliness.\n\nChecking and rechecking a cellphone to see if a message has arrived, sidestepping feelings of inferiority based on literary tastes, and even acquiescing to familial traditions that are wholly uncomfortable.\n\nMs. Christensen brings a sense of realism to the role, even when some dialogue seems a bit preachy and scenes might stretch credibility a tad far.\n\nLike Walt Disney\u2019s films, \u201cMy Boyfriends\u2019 Dogs,\u201d isn\u2019t going to make a huge impact on art, but it might show the best way to be true to one\u2019s heart.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From the start, it's clear \"My Boyfriends' Dogs\" is more Disney than \"Sex in the City.\" It's set in an old-fashioned, G-rated world where the most risque twist involves two secondary characters deciding on a live-in romance.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "From the start, it\u2019s clear \u201cMy Boyfriends\u2019 Dogs\u201d is more Disney than \u201cSex in the City.\u201d It\u2019s set in an old-fashioned, G-rated world where the most risque twist involves two secondary characters deciding on a live-in romance.", "title": "Downside of puppy love in Hallmark movie", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/19/downside-of-puppy-love-in-hallmark-movie/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/19/10192014_boyfriend38201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/19/10192014_boyfriend38201.jpg", "description": "From the start, it's clear \"My Boyfriends' Dogs\" is more Disney than \"Sex in the City.\" It's set in an old-fashioned, G-rated world where the most risque twist involves two secondary characters decidi", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Downside of puppy love in Hallmark movie"}, "Author": "Nancy Dunham - Special to the Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Walt Disney, Bailey Daly"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2936\"", "article_summary": "Like Walt Disney\u2019s films, \u201cMy Boyfriends\u2019 Dogs,\u201d isn\u2019t going to make a huge impact on art, but it might show the best way to be true to one\u2019s heart.\nHallmark based the movie on the 2010 novel of the same name by Dandi Daley Mackall.\nWhat is surprising is that Hallmark movies are also as addictive as sugar.\nDon\u2019t judge this movie by its lack of adult physical situations.\nThat\u2019s what I love about my character."}
