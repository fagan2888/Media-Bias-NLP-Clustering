Labor Day came and went. But pow wows are still in season.

This weekend, plan for one of the largest Native celebrations in the country. The Indian Summer Festival pow wow brings guests to Milwaukee’s beautiful lakefront where there will be a smorgasbord of excitement. In addition to celebrating the horses, this contest pow wow will feature the Native Pride Dancers, Phillip Whiteman Jr.’s Medicine Wheel Model, and the Native American Elvis.

In Manitoba, Canada, the Opikihiwawin Traditional Pow Wow is in it’s 11th year. Drummers, dancers and a traditional feast make the pow wow an exceptional event. The pow wow is only one day, September 6.

And on the East coast, in the lush state of Delaware, the Nanticoke Indian Powwow is celebrating its 37th year. The two-day pow wow features the Red Blanket Drummers from New Jersey, and the Strumptown drummers from Virginia.
