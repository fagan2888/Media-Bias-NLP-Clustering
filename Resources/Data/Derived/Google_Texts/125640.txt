A Jefferson County district judge has given the attorney general’s office until Wednesday to respond to a request for a hearing on the State Claims Board’s decision on the amount of damages it will recommend that the legislature award to a pair of Lower North Fork fire victims.

On Tuesday, the board said it would recommend that James and Jill Fildey receive $661,282 for losses they suffered as a result of the 2012 fire.

A member of a Judicial Arbiter Group had earlier recommended that the Fildeys receive $891,187 plus interest. On Wednesday, Judge Dennis Hall asked Attorney General John Suthers’ office for a response to the Fildeys’ request for a judgment based on the arbiter’s recommendation.

Over two days of hearings this week, the board agreed to recommend that legislators pay about $12 million to 26 claimants, including the Fildeys. The arbiters had recommended payouts totaling more than $16 million plus interest.

The arbiters recommended awards for noneconomic losses, including the deaths of three people, as well as for property loss and other economic losses.

Andrew Newcomb, a lawyer for 15 of the claimants, said his clients also will ask Hall for judgments.

By statute, the board cannot make recommendations on noneconomic losses.

That doesn’t stop the legislature from considering remedies for economic and noneconomic losses recommended by arbiters.

Even for economic losses, the panel’s recommendations were lower than those of arbiters by as much as 40 percent, Newcomb said.

“We all assumed they would honor the economic (damages), at least,” Newcomb said. “There is no rhyme or reason — that is one of the reasons we were so shocked.”

The Colorado State Forest Service set the fire, which was supposed to be a controlled burn but later roared into a wind-whipped inferno that scorched more than 1,400 acres.
