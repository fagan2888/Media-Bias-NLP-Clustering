Voters reportedly rejected a $1 billion tax increase for education in 2013.\n\nHowever, ColoradoCare may tap into the anti-Obamacare sentiment.\n\nT.R. Reid, a spokesman for ColoradoCareYES, told the newspaper:\n\nFor some people, I say, \"It gets us out of Obamacare,\" and some people cheer. It\u2019s a purple state, and we have this purple plan that can appeal to both sides. ... We\u2019re a rich, compassionate country. We should provide health care for everybody. We\u2019re not going to get there at the federal level. The federal government can\u2019t do much. They\u2019re gridlocked. So the way we\u2019re going to get there is state by state.\n\nJonathan Lockwood, executive director of the pro-business group Advancing Colorado, told the Coloradoan: \"[Early cost projections are] never accurate. That $25 billion is going to burn really fast when you open the floodgates for unrestrained [care].\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think what we\u2019ll see is a destabilization of what\u2019s already a very delicate health care system here in Colorado,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvancing Colorado plans to start a media blitz to stop ColoradoCare, but proponents of the plan are ready.\n\n\u201cNow that we\u2019re on the ballot, guess who\u2019s going to be coming for us?\u201d ColoradoCare spokesperson Katy Kohnen told supporters at a rally in Fort Collins on Oct. 23.\n\nThe crowd responded, \u201cInsurance companies!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\" Kohnen said. \"Big money, so they don\u2019t lose it.\u201d\n\nAdvancing Colorado, which opposes ColoradoCare, was reportedly funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, but Lockwood denied that claim to the Associated Press in September.\n\nLockwood refused to disclose the donors of Advancing Colorado to the news service.\n\nSources: Washington Times, Coloradoan, Associated Press / Photo Credit: YouTube Screenshot", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "Advocates of a single-payer universal health care plan in Colorado delivered 156,107 signatures to the secreta...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Colorado Initiative Would Replace Obamacare With Universal Health Care (Video)", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/health/coloradocare-would-replace-obamacare-universal-health-care-video", "image": "http://www.opposingviews.com/", "type": "article", "description": "Advocates of a single-payer universal health care plan in Colorado delivered 156,107 signatures to the secreta...", "title": "Colorado Initiative Would Replace Obamacare With Universal Health Care (Video)"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-26T20:52:05+00:00", "theme-version": "1.2.4", "publish_date": "2015-10-26T20:52:05+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#0e0e0e", "ov": {"id": 864506}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf42c\"", "article_summary": "Jonathan Lockwood, executive director of the pro-business group Advancing Colorado, told the Coloradoan: \"[Early cost projections are] never accurate.\nAdvocates of a single-payer universal health care plan in Colorado delivered 156,107 signatures to the secretary of state\u2019s office on Oct. 23 to get ColoradoCare, also known as Initiative 20, on the November 2016 ballot (video below).\nWe should provide health care for everybody.\nAdvancing Colorado plans to start a media blitz to stop ColoradoCare, but proponents of the plan are ready.\nReid, a spokesman for ColoradoCareYES, told the newspaper:For some people, I say, \"It gets us out of Obamacare,\" and some people cheer."}
