Dan Coats and Gov. Mike Pence.\n\nCruz advocated for abolishing the IRS, repealing the Affordable Care Act, instituting a flat tax, job creation through infrastructure projects, school choice and religious freedom legislation.\n\nAll three Republican primary candidates \u2014 Cruz, Donald Trump and John Kasich \u2014 were said to be invited.\n\nGov. Mike Pence met with Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner, Wednesday in Indianapolis, as well as with Cruz prior to Thursday\u2019s event.\n\nPence did not endorse either candidate, and said he would support whoever defeated Democrats in the general election.\n\nBecause Indiana\u2019s primary is much later compared to the majority of states\u2019, the votes cast are usually not as decisive to whom a party\u2019s candidate will be.\n\nBecause Republican and Democratic frontrunners are relatively close, however, Indiana will play a critical role in who will win either nomination.\n\n\u201cIndiana\u2019s a megaphone to the country will decide which path this party goes down, and which path this nation goes down,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nTrump and Cruz have 845 and 559 pledged delegates, respectively, while Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have 1,930 and 1,189 pledged delegates, respectively.\n\nCruz, Pence and Coats all discussed religious freedom, saying America will not be a great nation unless Judeo-Christian values are secured.\n\n\u201cIf you believe in religious freedom, if you believe in civil liberties, you are one liberal injustice away from it being stripped from you,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nOther speech themes included job security for manufacturing and coal industries and how to defeat Clinton in the general election. Cruz praised Pence for his support of religious freedom legislation and tax cuts, calling Pence an example of what Republicans should be like as policy makers.\n\nHe also promoted school choice, calling it the \u201csocial justice issue of the 21st century,\u201d and praised Pence for promoting school choice and voucher programs.\n\nA small group of anti-Pence protesters were outside the event and were relatively calm.\n\nCruz did not choose to criticize Trump for the way he has run his campaign, but rather for what he means to other Republicans.\n\n\u201cIf (Trump) wins, we will lose two-thirds of Congress, and then we have no chance of beating Hillary Clinton,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nHe did say, however, he was glad to be a part of an exciting election, for both parties.\n\nPence agreed, saying he is excited to see Indiana play a significant role in the election and is optimistic about Republican victories at the state and federal level.\n\n\u201cThe best days for Indiana, and for America, are yet to come,\u201d Pence said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz called Pence an example of what Republicans should be like as policy makers.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"url": "http://www.idsnews.com/article/2016/04/cruz-makes-stop-in-indianapolis-for-gop-spring-dinner", "image": "http://duvq7ua50whdw.cloudfront.net/20160412QJeR6mqyqZ/dist/img/IDS-fb-icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "Cruz called Pence an example of what Republicans should be like as policy makers.", "title": "Cruz makes stop in Indianapolis for GOP spring dinner"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ids/63199_cicruz_webf.jpg", "title": "Cruz makes stop in Indianapolis for GOP spring dinner", "description": "Cruz called Pence an example of what Republicans should be like as policy makers.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@idsnews"}, "keywords": "Indiana University, IU, Bloomington, Indiana, Monroe County, Indiana Daily Student, IDS, student newspaper, newspaper, news, students, college, university, campus, Ernie Pyle", "google-site-verification": "FkL7grEXumouo-bfJ89mrCvOGorioiCTNQ4t4X3bjjI", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Presidential candidate Ted Cruz promised tax cuts, job creation and religious freedom to a sold-out crowd at the Indiana Republican Spring Dinner on Thursday in Indianapolis.\nCruz, Pence and Coats all discussed religious freedom, saying America will not be a great nation unless Judeo-Christian values are secured.\nMike Pence met with Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner, Wednesday in Indianapolis, as well as with Cruz prior to Thursday\u2019s event.\n\u201cIf you believe in religious freedom, if you believe in civil liberties, you are one liberal injustice away from it being stripped from you,\u201d Cruz said.\nCruz praised Pence for his support of religious freedom legislation and tax cuts, calling Pence an example of what Republicans should be like as policy makers."}
