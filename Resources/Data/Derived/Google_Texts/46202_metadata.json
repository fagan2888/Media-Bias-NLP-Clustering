The value of global M&A hit $1.7 trillion in January-July 2015, 29 per cent higher than in the comparable 2014 period. At 12,450, the number of deals too is up 6 per cent compared with last year. This includes both completed and pending deals.\n\nNorth America and Asia Pacific, which account for three-fourths of the mergers and acquisitions worldwide, have seen deal-making (in terms of value) surge 36 per cent and 56 per cent, respectively, so far in 2015. The deal count too is higher (15 per cent up) for companies from the Asia Pacific region.\n\nChinese companies have been active deal makers in 2015, striking deals worth $164 billion in 2015, more than double that in 2014. The deal count too is a quarter more than last year. In India, on the other hand, the aggregate deal value of $6 billion until July 2015 has been only two-fifths of that in January-July 2014. The deal count, though, is up 39 per cent.\n\nSo, which sectors have been the hotbeds of activity in 2015? Pharma, oil and gas, real estate and food companies have accounted for a chunk of the deal making in 2015.\n\nThe $55-billion HJ Heinz Company and Kraft Foods Group merger, which has created one of the world\u2019s largest food and beverage companies, has been the biggest deal so far.\n\nThe merged entity is expected to be in a better position to stand up to the challenge of shifting consumer preferences, from processed foods to healthier options. On completion, energy giant Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s proposal to buy BG Group for $70 billion would create the world\u2019s largest liquefied natural gas company.\n\nBut, given the mammoth size of the combined entity, the acquisition needs the go-ahead from anti-trust bodies in several countries.\n\nHaving got the US Federal Trade Commission\u2019s nod, the proposed deal has already passed its first hurdle. As oil and gas producers worldover battle the impact of falling crude prices, the industry is predicted to see more consolidation.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical space, the $19.8-billion takeover of Pharmacyclics by AbbVie has been the largest so far.\n\nThe acquisition, also one of the year\u2019s most expensive, will help AbbVie reduce its dependence on a single product and diversify its product portfolio.\n\nThe healthcare services industry too has seen hectic activity; many deals are yet to be approved, though.\n\nWith ObamaCare (Affordable Care Act) bringing in more business for health insurance companies but at the same time forcing them to cut costs, many players have been engaged in merger talks. Aetna\u2019s proposed acquisition of rival insurer Humana for $37 billion, which is still awaiting regulatory approval, is one such deal.\n\nAnother industry which promises much action is media \u2014 here Charter Communications\u2019 $79-billion proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable is one deal to watch out for.\n\nWith Americans increasingly moving away from television to watching videos on the internet, cable companies have been scouting for M&As to gain scale. The deal, which will quadruple Charter Communications\u2019 customer base, is expected to bolster its bargaining position with television network companies.\n\n(This article was published on July 12, 2015)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pharma, energy and food have been the hotspots for merger deals", "application-name": "Business Line", "author": "Maulik Madhu", "og": {"site_name": "The Hindu Business Line", "description": "Pharma, energy and food have been the hotspots for merger deals", "title": "Action-packed year for global M&A activity", "url": "http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/global-investor/actionpacked-year-for-global-ma-activity/article7413863.ece", "image": "http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/multimedia/dynamic/02470/bl13_MnA_jpg_2470650g.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "thehindubusinessline.com", "description": "Pharma, energy and food have been the hotspots for merger deals", "title": "Action-packed year for global M&A activity", "url": "http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/global-investor/actionpacked-year-for-global-ma-activity/article7413863.ece", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Business Line for iPad", "iphone": "The Hindu BusinessLine for iPhone", "googleplay": "Business Line"}, "id": {"ipad": 661653851, "iphone": 855182339, "googleplay": "com.mobstac.thehindubusinessline"}}, "site": "@businessline", "image": {"src": "http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/multimedia/dynamic/02470/bl13_MnA_jpg_2470650g.jpg"}, "card": "summary"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-12", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=855182339", "google-site-verification": "Akq158WNNq9g5ztXSidkapCdpRs9AwLhCREkHyYQtgU", "keywords": "global M&A activity, merger and acquisition,company information ,merger, acquisition and takeover", "article": {"section": "Global Investor", "tag": "global M&A activity, merger and acquisition", "published_time": "2015-07-12T21:41:34+05:30", "modified_time": "2015-07-12T21:41:34+05:30", "author": "Maulik Madhu"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe to RSS; action-uri=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/global-investor/?service=rss; icon-uri=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "global M&A activity, merger and acquisition,company information ,merger, acquisition and takeover"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfef\"", "article_summary": "The value of global M&A hit $1.7 trillion in January-July 2015, 29 per cent higher than in the comparable 2014 period.\nPharma, energy and food have been the hotspots for merger dealsAfter a few years of tepid action, global merger and acquisition (M&A) activity boomed in 2014 and has sustained through 2015.\nHaving got the US Federal Trade Commission\u2019s nod, the proposed deal has already passed its first hurdle.\nAetna\u2019s proposed acquisition of rival insurer Humana for $37 billion, which is still awaiting regulatory approval, is one such deal.\nChinese companies have been active deal makers in 2015, striking deals worth $164 billion in 2015, more than double that in 2014."}
