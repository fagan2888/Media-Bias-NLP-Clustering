Bithlo is becoming less of a nightmare before the town of Christmas, but much work is left to be done, local leaders said during a meeting at 11th annual Health Care Symposium hosted by the UCF College of Health & Public Affairs on Wednesday.

"One of our central tenants is that we're not going to let you down," said Tim McKinney, executive vice president of United Global Outreach, which committed in 2009 to transforming this 12-square-mile community east of Orange County.

Since then, a new school has taken root in town. Residents have access to primary care at Community Health Centers. They have access to dental care and mental health services.

The project has won awards, including one this week, Roadmaps to Health Action Award, from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute

But it has a long way to go.

Many still wake up to yellow, smelly water. The nearest grocery store is across State Road 50. According to the latest U.S. Census Bureau data, of the nearly 10,000 residents of the community, 20 percent live below poverty level.

Many residents fall in the coverage gap -- they're the working poor who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

But community activists like McKinney, and partners like the University of Central Florida and its volunteers and Florida Hospital say that they aren't giving up.

"We want to transform Bithlo, keeping the same people in it," said McKinney. "Real lives depend on is. Real people depend on us to work faster."
