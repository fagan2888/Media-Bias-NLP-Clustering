If not, is there any way to check to see if a microwave is leaking? Or do you have to wait until cancer develops to be sure?\u201d\n\nThe above was actually sent by a co-worker of Mr. Fact soon after the newsroom\u2019s old, low-power microwave was replaced.\n\nThe new one is twice as big and had a button that would shoot out every time you closed the door. Fact Checker enjoyed this game of catch. But soon, the button got stuck one too many times and now a pencil sits atop the microwave with instructions to poke it in the hole where the button used to be to open the door.\n\nGiven this, it\u2019s not surprising someone would be concerned about the integrity of the microwave.\n\nThe fluorescent claim, though, seemed absurd, like one of those viral emails about cooking an egg between two cellphones (not true) or microwaving your cellphone to recharge it (really not true with the YouTube videos to prove it).\n\nBut this is one of those rare cases where the unlikely is true.\n\nBill Beatty, a research engineer in the University of Washington\u2019s chemistry department and human behind the Science Hobbyist website (amasci.com), has done numerous microwave experiments and written extensively about microwave myths.\n\nHe told Fact Checker a leak can be detected by holding a fluorescent bulb next to it \u2014 he suggests a long ceiling-light tube, even one that doesn\u2019t work with black ends, which he said is usually related to transistors being bad, not the light itself.\n\nBut, he said, only a large leak will be detected with a fluorescent bulb. \u201cSo if it doesn\u2019t light up, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not leaking,\u201d he said.\n\nA darkened room might help you better detect a faint glow. Hold or place the bulb close to a seal on the door that might leak while it\u2019s running. He said when the microwave\u2019s fan noise changes about three seconds after pushing start, that\u2019s when the microwave action begins and you should detect something if you\u2019re going to detect anything.\n\nHe suggests using a little orange bulb \u2014 called a neon pilot light or NE-2 bulb \u2014 that can be purchased at Radio Shack. \u201cThe metal electrodes in them concentrate the fields,\u201d he said.\n\nBeaty said old microwaves from the 1960s and some from the 1970s should not be turned on unless something is inside, but that with microwaves from the 1980s and later, you\u2019ll want to turn them on with nothing inside because this makes the amount of radiation emitted from any leaks greater.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re cooking something, most of the energy is going into the food so if nothing at all is in the oven, it can be hundreds of time more leakage than if you have huge block of frozen meat in there,\u201d he said.\n\nBeaty has a microwave with a slight leak at home. The leak is only detectable if nothing is in the microwave when in use and only then with very sensitive equipment. He\u2019s not worried about getting cancer.\n\nThat\u2019s because microwave radiation is made of radio waves and is basically the same frequency as that of cellphones.\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re horribly paranoid and won\u2019t use a cellphone, then you should start considering (ending any) microwave usage,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not concerned about putting a cellphone up to your face, then microwave leakage is often much smaller than that.\u201d\n\nIf you've got wi-fi in your home and you notice interference when the microwave is on \u2014 or dropped cellphone calls \u2014 then you might have a leak.\n\nSome websites suggest putting a laptop in the microwave or a cellphone in the microwave and trying to contact them \u2014 without turning on the microwave, which would destroy them. If the microwave\u2019s shield is working, then a signal won\u2019t get to them since they operate at a similar frequency.\n\nBeaty doesn\u2019t like this idea. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t ever put anything expensive in the microwave under any circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re asking for trouble. What if your roommate pushes the popcorn button? Or what if you remember the instructions wrong?\u201d\n\nBeaty said microwave leakage is rare and will only be of a sizable amount if there\u2019s been massive damage, such as after the whole microwave gets dropped and the frame is bent or the door closes but you can see a visible gap or that it\u2019s cockeyed.\n\nThe verdict\n\nLarge leaks of radiation from a microwave can be detected by a fluorescent light bulb. Smaller leaks can be detected with a small orange neon bulb, as might be used in a waffle iron. The radiation itself is little different than that emitted by a cellphone.\n\nTruthmeter: 9 (out of 10)\n\nMore microwave myths\n\nThe Food & Drug Administration\u2019s website addresses a number of common myths about microwave ovens. (Go to FDA.gov and look under the tab for \u201cradiation-emitting products.\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Food gets contaminated: \u201cMicrowaves are produced inside the oven by an electron tube called a magnetron. The microwaves are reflected within the metal interior of the oven where they are absorbed by food. Microwaves cause water molecules in food to vibrate, producing heat that cooks the food. That's why foods high in water content, like fresh vegetables, can be cooked more quickly than other foods. The microwave energy is changed to heat as it is absorbed by food, and does not make food \u2018radioactive\u2019 or \u2018contaminated.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2022 Food cooks from the inside out: \u201cAlthough heat is produced directly in the food, microwave ovens do not cook food from the \u2018inside out.\u2019 When thick foods are cooked, the outer layers are heated and cooked primarily by microwaves while the inside is cooked mainly by the conduction of heat from the hot outer layers.\u201d\n\n\u2022 A leaky microwave can cause sterility: \u201cMuch research is under way on microwaves and how they might affect the human body. It is known that microwave radiation can heat body tissue the same way it heats food. Exposure to high levels of microwaves can cause a painful burn. The lens of the eye is particularly sensitive to intense heat, and exposure to high levels of microwaves can cause cataracts. Likewise, the testes are very sensitive to changes in temperature. Accidental exposure to high levels of microwave energy can alter or kill sperm, producing temporary sterility. But these types of injuries \u2014 burns, cataracts, temporary sterility \u2014 can only be caused by exposure to large amounts of microwave radiation, much more than the 5mW limit for microwave oven leakage.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Proven cases of radiation injuries from microwave ovens: \u201cThere have been allegations of radiation injury from microwave ovens, but none as a direct result of microwave exposure. The injuries known to FDA have been injuries that could have happened with any oven or cooking surface. For example, many people have been burned by the hot food, splattering grease, or steam from food cooked in a microwave oven.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t use a pacemaker around a microwave: \u201cFDA does not specifically require microwave ovens to carry warnings for people with pacemakers. The problem has been largely resolved because pacemakers are now designed to be shielded against such electrical interference.\u201d\n\nPhoto above: Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reno Nevada News - rgj.com is the home page of Reno Nevada with in depth and updated Reno local news.
