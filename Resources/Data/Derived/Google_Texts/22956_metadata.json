From the economy to quality of life, to Obama\u2019s countless foreign policy mistakes, and the fact that there has never been a time when America has been less respected by the world, how can one not regret voting for President Barack Obama?\n\nAfter more than five years of serving as President, Barack Obama has been a complete and utter failure. Will liberals ever admit they were wrong? From the economy, which continues to stagger along, to the continuing raising of taxes and big government, when is enough enough? From the continued expansion of welfare, to the failed stimulus package, arrogant Obama has failed miserably. And let\u2019s not even get started on Obamacare, which has caused more uninsured than ever before and is a colossal failure.\n\nAnd while domestic policies are surely more important than foreign policy, in a dangerous world a secure America matters.\n\nIt is laughable to look back to the 2008 Democratic debate at University of Texas in Austin, when Barack Obama said,\n\nThe Bush administration has done so much damage to American foreign relations ... If we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned, that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time. It\u2019s important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years, for the president to be willing to take that extra step.\n\nThere is not one single country on planet Earth that America has better relations with today than under the previous Administration. From destabilizing allies in the Middle East to being emasculated by President Putin, Obama is a spineless and ineffectual leader. Whatever one thinks of him, under Bush, people at least feared and respected America.\n\nRemember, President Obama spoke at the General Assembly of the United Nations and, addressing Iran and Russia, urged them to wake up, as \u201cwe are no longer in a Cold War.\u201d He gave an interview on a national TV outlet and said, \u201cAnd so you know, this is not the Cold War. This is not a contest between the United States and Russia.\u201d Are you so sure, Mr. President? Not a cold war?\n\nThis Administration asked the Russians to \u201creset\u201d relations (although what was handed to Russia actually said \"overcharge\" on it) \u2013 and relations have indeed been \u201creset.\u201d The pendulum of power has swung towards Russia. Obama mocked Romney for claiming that Russians are our \"no. 1 geopolitical foe\" and retorted: \"The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.\"\n\nObama also took an \u201cAmerican Apology Tour.\u201d As Mitt Romney wrote in No Apology,\n\n[N]ever before in American history has its president gone before so many foreign audiences to apologize for so many American misdeeds, both real and imagined. It is his ways of signaling that foreign dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; Obama's words are kindling to them. In his first nine months in office, Obama ... issued apologies and criticism of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo.\n\nWhen one apologizes, one must realize there are consequences. America is in decline, and American leadership isn\u2019t felt in America, or overseas.\n\nObama said, \u201cYou've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean.\u201d Unfortunately, they are very clear. Our allies don\u2019t trust us, and our enemies know we are full of hot air. Welcome to Obama\u2019s America. America voted for Obama, as he promised change. From the economy to foreign policy, healthcare to social security, can anyone possibly claim that this Administration has succeeded?\n\nRegardless of where one stands on the political map, it is time to say that choosing Obama was terrible for the American people.\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.\n\nSubscribe to Frontpage's TV show, The Glazov Gang, and LIKE it on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "The man who promised to improve America's global image has made us more hated than ever.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "The man who promised to improve America's global image has made us more hated than ever.", "title": "Will Leftists Admit They Were Wrong about Obama?", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/220634/will-leftists-admit-they-were-wrong-about-obama-ronn-torossian", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:40:05-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/220634/will-leftists-admit-they-were-wrong-about-obama-ronn-torossian", "description": "The man who promised to improve America's global image has made us more hated than ever.", "card": "summary", "title": "Will Leftists Admit They Were Wrong about Obama?"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-09T20:14:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:40:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5a8a\"", "article_summary": "1 geopolitical foe\" and retorted: \"The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.\"\nFrom the economy to foreign policy, healthcare to social security, can anyone possibly claim that this Administration has succeeded?\nAfter more than five years of serving as President, Barack Obama has been a complete and utter failure.\nFrom destabilizing allies in the Middle East to being emasculated by President Putin, Obama is a spineless and ineffectual leader.\nAnd while domestic policies are surely more important than foreign policy, in a dangerous world a secure America matters."}
