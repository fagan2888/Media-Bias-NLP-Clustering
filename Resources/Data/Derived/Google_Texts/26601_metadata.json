Temperatures are predicted to drop to 54 degrees on Tuesday and then jump back up to 65 degrees Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThat 20-degree drop is closer to normal for us,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a yo-yo thing going on this week.\u201d\n\nDespite the heat, Cooper said there is not a heightened fire danger so far. \u201cGrasses are drying out in some places, but we\u2019ve been doing well with precipitation and haven\u2019t had that strong of winds,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile March has been fairly warm, Cooper said don\u2019t expect it to stay hot all month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like last month. We had a really warm February, and then everything changed in the last two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we still have some systems that might bring some precipitation in March.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Record heat in Denver with seasonable temperatures ahead", "title": "Record heat in Denver with seasonable temperatures ahead", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/15/record-heat-in-denver-with-seasonable-temperatures-ahead/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150315__BN20150315_Z00_BNCD16COWXp2.jpg", "height": 423}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150315__BN20150315_Z00_BNCD16COWXp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-15T15:10:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:45:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bc7\"", "article_summary": "Denver broke its record high temperature Sunday afternoon, topping out at 79 degrees at 3:45 p.m., officials said.\nWhile March has been fairly warm, Cooper said don\u2019t expect it to stay hot all month.\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be breaking down over the week, so we should get back to more seasonal temperatures in a few days,\u201d he said.\nThe previous record was set in 2013 at 76 degrees, said Frank Cooper, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder.\nTemperatures are predicted to drop to 54 degrees on Tuesday and then jump back up to 65 degrees Wednesday."}
