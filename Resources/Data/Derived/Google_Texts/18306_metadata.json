Rahall II has stayed away from Capitol Hill, except to occasionally sneak into the credit union in the Rayburn House Office Building. \u201cIf I saw a member, I ran,\u201d he boomed with a laugh.\n\nThat\u2019s because the 19-term West Virginia Democrat faced a yearlong ban on lobbying his ex-colleagues. But now the former appropriator has set up his own consulting company. \u201cI hope to renew a lot of relationships with my former colleagues,\u201d said Rahall, 66.\n\nMore than 50 House members who left at the end of the 113th Congress and were not elected to other positions, including Rahall, are now free of their restrictions on lobbying their former colleagues. Former senators, by contrast, must wait another year for their two-year bans to expire as stipulated under a 2007 law.\n\nAs of this month, the club of recent ex-lawmakers \u2014 which includes former committee chairmen Democrat Henry A. Waxman and Republicans Dave Camp, Spencer Bachus and Howard \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon \u2014 can now return to the Capitol complex to press the agendas of paying clients.\n\nIt also means the pressure is on.\n\nFresh from their trip through the revolving door and their \u201ccooling off\u201d periods, these former members will discover whether they can succeed on K Street. Not only do they need to earn their keep, they also must prove to clients they can still wield influence from the outside, where partisan politics yield to bottom-line practicality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a mix of excitement and trepidation,\u201d said former Rep. James P. Moran, a Virginia Democrat who joined the law and lobbying firm McDermott Will & Emery after a dozen terms. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for not making sure that what the firm is compensating me for is reimbursed.\u201d\n\nThe Lure of Big Bucks\n\nAlthough the K Street salaries for some former members can be epic \u2014 think of former Louisiana Rep. Billy Tauzin\u2019s nearly $12 million payout in 2010 at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America \u2014 compensation for ex-lawmakers varies widely. On the lower end, some may command $300,000 a year in base pay, according to headhunters and K Street executives. That\u2019s still a boost from congressional pay of $174,000.\n\nMoney is, of course, a major reason why a third of all departing members since 2001 have gone on to register as federal lobbyists, according to LegiStorm data. Then there are many who don\u2019t register but advise clients behind the scenes.\n\nMoney isn\u2019t the only factor. Those who\u2019ve left Congress say, in addition to bigger pay and a more manageable work pace, they want to stay relevant on the policy issues and political causes they championed in office.\n\nCamp, a Michigan Republican who held the Ways and Means Committee gavel, is a senior policy adviser at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the world\u2019s largest tax and accounting firm. Camp \u201chas no immediate plans to begin lobbying,\u201d said firm spokeswoman Maggie O\u2019Donovan-Bolton.\n\nBachus, an Alabama Republican who led the House Financial Services panel, set up shop in his home state to provide clients with \u201ccomprehensive legal strategies and solutions,\u201d according to Bachus Brom & Taylor\u2019s website.\n\nAllyson Schwartz, a Pennsylvania Democrat who said she pushed for Medicare improvements on the Hill, is now president of the Better Medicare Alliance. She said she doesn\u2019t plan to register as a lobbyist, but looks forward to being able to talk with sitting members \u201cabout the work I\u2019m doing and about the policy and implications for seniors.\u201d\n\nMcKeon, a former Armed Services chairman from California, operates the McKeon Group whose clients include Aerojet Rocketdyne Inc. and the Association of Catastrophe Adjusters.\n\nThe easy movement from Congress to lobbying firms and advocacy groups doesn\u2019t sit well with some critics.\n\nJeff Hauser, who runs the Revolving Door Project at the nonprofit Center for Effective Government, said the phenomenon \u201cis very disturbing and has corrosive consequences for our democracy. It encourages people to run for Congress as a stepping stone to being able to trade upon their status as a former member for wealth.\u201d\n\nLobbying in the \u2018Public Interest\u2019\n\nWaxman, a California Democrat, is arguably the biggest kahuna this year to walk through the revolving door. During his 40 years in Congress, he was the force behind some of the nation\u2019s most sweeping health and environmental laws. He chaired the House Energy and Commerce Committee during debate over the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHe joined his son\u2019s firm, Waxman Strategies, last year as chairman. \u201cHe made me chairman, which was a good deal, because I couldn\u2019t be chairman on the Hill any longer because of being in the minority,\u201d joked Waxman, 76.\n\nWaxman registered to lobby the executive branch last year for such clients as the National Association of Community Health Centers and T-Mobile, and he said he expects to advocate on Capitol Hill now that his ban expired Jan. 2.\n\nHe\u2019s aware of critics who have expressed surprise that the post-Watergate reformer would join the lobbying world. As chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform panel, Waxman investigated Jack Abramoff, the infamous K Street power player whose corruption scandal ushered in the most recent update to lobbying and ethics laws in 2007.\n\nWaxman said he\u2019ll only take on clients and causes he believes in and that are in line with those he championed while in Congress. And he admits that the revolving door raises concerns about former officials doing things that give some interests a leg up.\n\n\u201cNow I suppose somebody could say that about me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I look at those clients as much more public-interest clients.\u201d\n\nThe one-year ban, Waxman said, passed quickly, but, \u201cIt has inhibited me.\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t lobby former Hill colleagues over his health care clients\u2019 potential concerns about the 21st Century Cures bill, which would increase federal funding for medical research. Instead, he made his point to administration officials, who, along with his clients and other stakeholders, were free to discuss the bill with lawmakers.\n\nUnlike Waxman, Moran, 70, isn\u2019t yet a registered lobbyist but is likely to become one \u2014 even if it means he\u2019ll have to sacrifice his workouts at the House gym because lobbyists aren\u2019t allowed there. \u201cIn my district, lobbying was a major industry,\u201d Moran said during an interview in his new digs, which overlook Union Station and the Senate office buildings.\n\nWaxman, too, said he\u2019s eager to head up to Capitol Hill \u2014 if only to escape the high-calorie fare common in his new line of work.\n\n\u201cI miss the Rayburn House cafeteria; they have a wonderful salad bar,\u201d Waxman said from his office in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m tired of all these fancy restaurants downtown.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since leaving Congress one year ago, Nick J.
