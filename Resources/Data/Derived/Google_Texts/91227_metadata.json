On Saturday, he went and posted eight handmade warning signs around the lake, the Oregonian reported.\n\nLocal media turned out to cover Medill\u2019s public act, but once the reporters left, Medill told the newspaper, police detained him for an hour before slapping him with the criminal mischief ticket.\n\nMedill said locals have been lobbying for signs ever since a 2012 incident in which eight kids almost drowned in Hagg Lake. When an entire family \u2014 three generations deep \u2014 drowned in the lake last month, Medill was spurred to action.\n\n\u201cFor two years we\u2019ve been trying to get signs up.
