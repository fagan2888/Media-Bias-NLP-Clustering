Ryan (R-WI) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).\n\nAmong other things, the GOP bill that emerged from the Financial Services Committee last week on a straight party-line vote, would require the Fed to be more \u201ctransparent\u201d about the stress tests it requires the nation\u2019s largest banks to pass each year. It would require Fed employees to abide by the same ethical requirements as other federal financial regulators. And it would place new restrictions on the Fed\u2019s ability to make emergency loans during periods of financial crisis.\n\nRelated: 10 Ways the Fed\u2019s Looming Rate Hike Touches You\n\nBut by far the most dire and controversial measure would force Fed officials to adopt a mathematic or formulaic approach to setting interest rates in the future that essentially would put one of the Fed\u2019s most important tasks on auto-pilot. The bill would require Yellen and other Fed board members to choose a monetary policy strategy and communicate it to the public whenever it makes decisions regarding interest rates and the nation\u2019s money supply.\n\nInstead of basing the Fed\u2019s most critical monetary decisions on money supply, the relative strength of the dollar, the bond market, the latest unemployment figures and consumer-confidence indexes, Fed officials would essentially rely on a rule of thumb first devised by Stanford economist John Taylor in 1993.\n\nThe so-called Taylor Rule \u2013 which Fed officials and others have factored into their thinking over the years -- holds that if inflation is one percentage point above the Fed\u2019s goal, rates should rise by 1.5 percentage points, according to David Wessel of the Brookings Institution. And if \u2013 in a recession for example \u2013 an economy\u2019s total output is one percentage point below its fully capacity, rates should fall by half a percentage point.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically pretty simple,\u201d said Wessel, the director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy. \u201cIt says you look and make an estimate of what interest rates would be if things were normal. Then you look at how far you are from normal, both in terms of full employment and inflation. And you adjust some coefficient to allow to decide how much higher or lower interest rates should be.\u201d\n\nRelated: Fed's Williams Says Low Neutral Interest Rates a 'Warning Sign'\n\nUnder the GOP plan, the Fed would have to enunciate and closely follow a new strategy for deciding whether to raise interest rates. And any time they the policy makers vary from the formula, they would be subject to review \u2013 and second-guessing \u2014 by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Congress\n\n\u201cIt would elevate this rule to a much higher profile in Fed decision making than it is now,\u201d Wessel added. \u201cIt\u2019s widely used by the Fed in calculations\u2026. But this [bill] might make it harder for the Fed to be bold when it wanted to be bold, because it always would have to justify why it wasn\u2019t doing what it promised it would.\u201d\n\nBut Yellen and other staunch Fed defenders say the legislation would be a disaster that would hamstring monetary policy makers and destroy the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s fiercely guarded independence.\n\n\u201cHad the FOMC been compelled to operate under a simple policy rule for the past six and a half years, the unemployment experience of that period would have been substantially more painful than it already was, and inflation would be even further below the FOMC\u2019s 2-percent objective,\u201d Yellen said in her letter to the congressional leaders.\n\n\u201cIndeed, a recent study by Federal Reserve economists suggests that the current unemployment rate would still be above 6 percent and inflation would now be running somewhat below zero, if the FOMC had not taken the actions it did but rather had followed the reference rule and made it clear that it would do so in the future,\u201d she added.\n\nRelated: Will Yellen Give in to Wall Street\u2019s Interest Rate Tantrum?\n\nKaren Shaw Petrou, Managing Partner of Federal Financial Analytics, Inc., a private company, takes an equally dim view of the GOP legislation.\n\n\u201cI would concur with the Fed\u2019s concerns about the formulaic approach,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cAnd I think not only for the reasons they say\u2026. We learned during the 2008 near-death financial crisis that monetary policy has significant impact, not only on macroeconomic growth but also on financial stability, for good or ill.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Taylor Rule approach doesn\u2019t deal with that at all,\u201d she argued. \u201cIt\u2019s a very old-school way of thinking about what a central bank should do. And in my opinion that\u2019s the kind of central banking that may well sow the seeds of a systemic crisis.\u201d\n\nShe said that even if the rule works for macroeconomic growth, it could \u201cso distort market incentives as to create exactly the kind of conditions in which even just a small spark can lead to a market freeze.\u201d\n\nRelated: U.S. Economic Data Seen Supporting December Interest Rate Hike\n\nWessel agrees with other critics that some of the provisions, including second-guessing by the GAO, \u201ccould really make it hard for the Fed to be independent and creative.\u201d While the bill is likely to pass the GOP-dominated House, Democrats are certain to block the measure in the Senate. And the White House has issued a veto threat.\n\nBut Wessel suggested that Yellen and other Fed members might have been more diplomatic in responding to the Republicans\u2019 concerns.\n\n\u201cOn this [bill], I think what the Fed has done is say no to everything, and they\u2019re not willing to say, \u2018We hear you and how about let\u2019s do it this way,\u201d Wessel said. \u201cThe Fed must think that if you give them an inch they\u2019ll take a mile. And that critics of the Fed and Congress are not really interested in making the Fed more accountable, they\u2019re just interested in scoring political points \u2013 and so why bargain with them?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In the GOP\u2019s latest shot across the bow of the independent Federal Reserve, the House", "title": "The House GOP Is Trying to Cripple Fed Policy Making", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/19/House-GOP-Trying-Cripple-Fed-Policy-Making", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02252010_Fed_Reserve_Bldg_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/19/House-GOP-Trying-Cripple-Fed-Policy-Making", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02252010_Fed_Reserve_Bldg_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In the GOP\u2019s latest shot across the bow of the independent Federal Reserve, the House", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt says you look and make an estimate of what interest rates would be if things were normal.\nBut Wessel suggested that Yellen and other Fed members might have been more diplomatic in responding to the Republicans\u2019 concerns.\n\u201cThe Fed must not be allowed to shield its vast regulatory activities from the American people and congressional oversight by improperly cloaking them behind its traditional monetary policy independence,\u201d Hensarling said during a hearing.\nThe bill would require Yellen and other Fed board members to choose a monetary policy strategy and communicate it to the public whenever it makes decisions regarding interest rates and the nation\u2019s money supply.\nIt would require Fed employees to abide by the same ethical requirements as other federal financial regulators."}
