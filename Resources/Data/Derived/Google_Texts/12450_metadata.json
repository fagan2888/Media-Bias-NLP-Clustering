The EPA\u2019s claim that the $10 billion pricetag was \u201cirrelevant\u201d failed to withstand judicial review.\n\nThe ruling is not likely to deter the EPA from finalizing its even more costly regulations on carbon emissions from coal plants this summer. Thus, states must be ready to ask the courts to block the implementation of a regulatory scheme that, according to independent economic consultants, will cost energy consumers up to $479 billion, likely the most expensive in the history of the Clean Air Act.\n\nBut they will accomplish only a minute reduction of worldwide carbon emissions.\n\nThe rules will, however, produce double-digit electric rate increases in Colorado, according to NERA Economic Consulting. Rural Colorado \u2014 with mines already facing shutdown because of decisions and policies that push the envelope of climate activism \u2014 will suffer economic devastation. Jobs paying average wages and benefits exceeding $122,000 annually will be destroyed.\n\nAnd Colorado, which at one time ranked second only to Wyoming in the payment of federal coal royalties, will lose an important source of revenue for public schools and governments. Clean coal, which meets 60 percent of the state\u2019s electricity needs, would be displaced by more expensive sources.\n\nIn addition to these budget-blowing costs is the sheer impossibility of meeting the requirements in the allotted time. The EPA plan calls for emissions reductions of 35 percent below 2012 levels, with much of that achieved by 2020. Some politicians and state officials assure us that \u201cColorado is ahead of the curve\u201d in compliance. The plain language of the rules says otherwise. Many if not all of the carbon reductions from the legislatively mandated closure of Xcel\u2019s Denver area coal plants would not count toward the emissions target. Neither would many of the huge investments by utilities to acquire wind and solar generation. Incentives for rooftop solar and energy efficient appliances would also fail to qualify.\n\nThe rule fundamentally alters the way that states provide electric power through a series of \u201coutside the fence\u201d measures that the EPA itself lacks authority to implement. These include unrealistic directives to significantly expand the use of renewable energy and natural gas. It is this expansion of federal power, however, that may prove to be the rule\u2019s ultimate undoing. In its mercury rule decision, the Supreme Court challenged the EPA\u2019s claim to deference in the agency\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Air Act. The EPA\u2019s scheme to restructure the nation\u2019s electricity grid through the carbon rules will likely raise additional arguments on the degree to which courts should accept agency interpretations of law.\n\nThus, it comes as no surprise that more than 30 states have questioned the legal basis for the EPA\u2019s sweeping changes, and many are planning to file suit. Colorado must do the same. We cannot afford to rely on past assurances. Once the rules become final, Colorado must join other states in asking the courts to stop its implementation pending appeal.\n\nThe court only acted on the mercury rule after power plants had spent billions on unnecessary controls. The stakes are even higher here. Staying the rules will remove the EPA straitjacket, and avoid saddling Coloradans with higher rates, shuttered plants and a shattered economy.\n\nStuart Sanderson is president of the Colorado Mining Association.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: Stop the EPA\u2019s carbon power grab, Colorado", "title": "Guest Commentary: Stop the EPA\u2019s carbon power grab, Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/17/guest-commentary-stop-the-epas-carbon-power-grab-colorado/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__20150719_Z00_OP19G_SANDERSONp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__20150719_Z00_OP19G_SANDERSONp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-17T11:44:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T06:09:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d3e\"", "article_summary": "Many if not all of the carbon reductions from the legislatively mandated closure of Xcel\u2019s Denver area coal plants would not count toward the emissions target.\nThe ruling is not likely to deter the EPA from finalizing its even more costly regulations on carbon emissions from coal plants this summer.\nOnce the rules become final, Colorado must join other states in asking the courts to stop its implementation pending appeal.\nThe EPA\u2019s scheme to restructure the nation\u2019s electricity grid through the carbon rules will likely raise additional arguments on the degree to which courts should accept agency interpretations of law.\nThe rules will, however, produce double-digit electric rate increases in Colorado, according to NERA Economic Consulting."}
