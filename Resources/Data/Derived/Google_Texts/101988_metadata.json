Today\u2019s announcement is the product of the working group. The group said in a statement that it found there is a \u201csubstantial risk of misusing or overusing these items.\u201d\n\nThe White House is also adding new guidelines to the program to keep better track of the equipment, as well as how well police department\u2019s are prepared and trained to use it.\n\nThe group defended eliminating the program, saying that some of the equipment, including surplus body armor, \u201cenhances the safety of officers,\u201d who might be responding to dangerous situations.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Local police departments in America will no longer be able to \"declare war\" on a neigh", "title": "Obama to Pentagon: Stop Giving Grenade Launchers to Local Police Forces", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/18/Obama-Pentagon-Stop-Giving-Grenade-Launchers-Local-Police-Forces", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/08142014_Ferguson_Police.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/18/Obama-Pentagon-Stop-Giving-Grenade-Launchers-Local-Police-Forces", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/08142014_Ferguson_Police.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Local police departments in America will no longer be able to \"declare war\" on a neigh", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8cb2\"", "article_summary": "Now, the White House is placing a ban on the transfer of some surplus military equipment including grenade launchers, armored vehicles, aircraft, bayonets, and certain kinds of guns and ammo.\nLocal police departments in America will no longer be able to \"declare war\" on a neighboring town with grenade launchers, tanks and other armor from the Pentagon.\nThe White House announced this morning that it will begin scaling back a controversial Pentagon program that has doled out more than $4.5 billion worth of surplus military equipment to local police departments across the country.\nThe reports of lax oversight and potential abuse prompted the White House to form a working group tasked with making reforms to the program.\nA document obtained by The Fiscal Times from Sen.
