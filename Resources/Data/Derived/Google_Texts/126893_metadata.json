They rely on indispensable government website that had been \u201cpitched as a high-tech way\u201d to sort through available coverage options. They\u2019re encountering countless glitches and technical errors: the website freezes, displays incorrect plan information and sends insurers erroneous reports.\n\nAdministration officials \u2014 clearly caught off guard by the surge of technical difficulties \u2014 respond to \u201ctens of thousands of complaints\u201d from angry beneficiaries and promise to \u201cfix every problem as quickly possible.\u201d\n\nThis sounds like the familiar story of the last few days of the Obama administration\u2019s rollout of the exchanges. But, actually, those quotes, and that scenario, are taken from the Bush administration\u2019s efforts to implement the Medicare prescription drug benefit in 2005 and 2006.\n\nNot only was Bush\u2019s rollout \u201canything but smooth,\u201d but administration officials had \u201csome trouble getting the [online] tool up and running\u201d and had to delay its debut for weeks. What\u2019s more, computer glitches caused low-income beneficiaries to go without needed medications and sent pharmacies the wrong drug information. Before it was all resolved, Dr. Mark McClellan, Bush\u2019s head of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), appeared at hearings before the House Committee On Energy And Commerce, laying out the flaws in the law\u2019s implementation and detailing how the administration would address them.\n\nAs the House Energy and Commerce Committee holds its first hearing on the implementation of the the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, it\u2019s worth noting that some of the very same Republicans who are lashing out against Obamacare, arguing that the botched rollout is proof that the government cannot implement effectively and should repeal the law entirely, gave the Bush administration a pass and urged Americans not to pre-judge such a complicated process. At least four of the Republicans still on the committee had argued that early implementation hurdles should not taint the entirety of reform:\n\nREP. JOE BARTON (R-TX): \u201cThis is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. The committee will work closely with yourself and Dr. Mark McClellan at CMS to get problems noticed and solved.\u201d [Barton Statement via Archive.org, 2/15/2006] REP. TIM MURPHY (R-PA): \u201cAny time something is new, there is going to be some glitches. All of us, when our children were new, well, we knew as parents we didn\u2019t exactly know everything we were doing and we had a foul-up or two, but we persevered and our children turned out well. No matter what one does in life, when it is something new in learning the ropes of it, it is going to take a little adjustment.\u201d [Murphy Floor Speech via Congressional Record, 4/6/2006] REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R-TX): \u201cWe can\u2019t undo the past, but certainly they can make the argument that we are having this hearing a month late and perhaps we are, but the reality is the prescription drug benefit is 40 years late and seniors who signed up for Medicare those first days back in 1965 when they were 65 years of age are now 106 years of age waiting for that prescription drug benefit, so I hope it doesn\u2019t take us that long to get this right and I don\u2019t believe that it will. And I do believe that fundamentally it is a good plan.\u201d [\u201cMedicare Part D: Implementation of the New Drug Benefit,\u201d 3/1/2006] REP. PHIL GINGREY (R-GA): \u201cI delivered 5,200 babies, but this may be the best delivery that I have ever been a part of, Mr. Speaker, and that is delivering, as I say, on a promise made by former Congresses and other Presidents over the 45-year history of the Medicare program, which was introduced in 1965 with no prescription drug benefit. And what we have done here is add part D, the \u2018D\u2019 for \u2018drug\u2019 or, if you want, the \u2018delivery\u2019 that we have finally provided to our American seniors.\u201d [Gingrey Floor Speech via Congressional Record, 4/6/06]\n\nUltimately, the Bush administration fixed the law\u2019s technical glitches, but more than half of the beneficiaries who ended up signing up for insurance didn\u2019t do so until after the first of the year. Significantly, they signed up for coverage despite the Bush administration\u2019s well-publicized initial glitches in extending coverage to low-income beneficiaries. Whereas only 21 percent of seniors had a favorable impression of the law and 66 percent didn\u2019t know what was in it in April of 2005, by November of 2006, \u201chalf of the seniors polled said the program was working well or that just minor changes were needed.\u201d\n\nBridge Project provided research assistance for this post.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches,\" Rep.
