As three candidates in the four-way GOP gubernatorial primary continue to pump out the ads, Louisville investment manager Matt Bevin is branding himself a “real deal conservative.”

In his second TV ad of the campaign, Bevin promotes his economic plan, a seven-point position paper calling for right-to-work legislation, repealing common core and “dismantling” kynect — the state-based health exchange under the Affordable Care Act.

Bevin also says he will “protect us from Obama’s war on Kentucky.”

The ad is airing on cable and satellite in the Louisville, Lexington, Cincinnati and Bowling Green markets as well as in southeastern Kentucky, according to a press release from the Bevin campaign.

Bevin faces Agriculture Commissioner James Comer, former metro council member Hal Heiner and former Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Will T. Scott in the May 19 primary.
