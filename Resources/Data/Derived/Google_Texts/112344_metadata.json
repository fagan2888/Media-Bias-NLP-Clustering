Majorities of the 1,706 adults surveyed favor President Barack Obama, like Obamacare, support amnesty for illegal immigrants, favor high taxes, and say government should redistribute wealth. Yet a 54% of Californians\u2013and 44% of Democrats\u2013say that the Keystone XL pipeline should be built, contrary to Obama\u2019s veto.\n\nThe majority support for Keystone XL is similar to levels recorded last year. Why Californians support the pipeline is a mystery, given the state\u2019s far-left preferences on a variety of fiscal and social issues. The survey also found, for example, that 60% of Californians consider \u201cglobal warming\u201d\u2013not referred to by the euphemistic \u201cclimate change\u201d in the poll\u2013to be a \u201cvery serious\u201d problem. Even famously liberal millennials favor the Keystone XL pipeline by a margin of 49% to 43%.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOne reason that Californians may support the project is that the state currently imports much of its oil by rail, despite the fact that it has large, untapped petroleum reserves of its own. The oil trains, in turn, pose a risk of derailing\u2013a topic that has caused public alarm in recent weeks. Californians also pay higher prices for fuel than residents pay in the rest of the nation. The average price per gallon in California is currently $3.32, compared to $2.54 elsewhere, according to reports.\n\nThe strong local support for Keystone XL may disappoint local billionaire Tom Steyer, who has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Democratic Party campaign coffers in an attempt to stop the pipeline\u2013despite the fact that he owes some of his own wealth to investments in the fossil fuel industry. Steyer recently bowed out of contention for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Barbara Boxer. Perhaps the majority support for Keystone XL in California explains why.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Poll: Even Liberal California Favors Keystone XL Pipeline", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Poll: Even Liberal California Favors Keystone XL Pipeline", "title": "Poll: Even Liberal California Favors Keystone XL Pipeline - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/obama-pipeline-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-03-26T06:56:18-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/26/poll-even-liberal-california-favors-keystone-xl-pipeline/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Poll: Even Liberal California Favors Keystone XL Pipeline", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/obama-pipeline-AP.jpg", "title": "Poll: Even Liberal California Favors Keystone XL Pipeline - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Barbara Boxer, energe, Gas Prices, Keystone XL, polls, PPIC, public policy institute of california, tom steyer,Big Government, Breitbart California, Environment,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-03-26T05:39:47-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-03-26T06:56:18-07:00", "tag": "tom steyer", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,Environment"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15e9\"", "article_summary": "Yet a 54% of Californians\u2013and 44% of Democrats\u2013say that the Keystone XL pipeline should be built, contrary to Obama\u2019s veto.\nEven famously liberal millennials favor the Keystone XL pipeline by a margin of 49% to 43%.\nPerhaps the majority support for Keystone XL in California explains why.\nThe majority support for Keystone XL is similar to levels recorded last year.\nWhy Californians support the pipeline is a mystery, given the state\u2019s far-left preferences on a variety of fiscal and social issues."}
