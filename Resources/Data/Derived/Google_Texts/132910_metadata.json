Wearing jeans and a black hoodie, Zuckerberg spoke in a disarming, colloquial street language. He said solving the immigration issue \u201cis a really big deal\u201d and hearing that an undocumented student would not be able to go to college, \u201cjust blew my mind.\u201d\n\nInterviewed by James Bennet, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, the 29-year-old billionaire was careful where he stepped in the minefield of power politics of Washington. He gave the appearance of an open-minded techie with inclusive community values, whose primary wish was to provide a \u201cfundamental service\u201d for people.\n\nNotwithstanding his casual appearance and speech, Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook is a remarkable achievement. Facebook has 1.15 billion users, \u201cthe largest connected community in the history of the species,\u201d said Bennet. On average, 699 million people use Facebook every day.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s said his personal goal in life is to bring more people to share and access more information, and help build a \u201cbetter social fabric.\u201d He sees Facebook and other social media as having a lot of potential to grow. Currently, just over one\u2013third of the people of the world have Internet access, leaving 5 billion without.\n\n\u201cFrom the world we live in, we would assume it is everyone [with access], but it\u2019s not,\u201d he said.\n\nZuckerberg is cautiously nonpartisan in his approach as he promotes his cherished ideas. He says he neither identifies with the Democrats nor the Republicans. \u201cI\u2019m pro-knowledge economy,\u201d he said, which drew a lot of laughter from the audience.\n\nArticle Continues after the discussion. Vote and comment\n\n[tok id=7d17d7b4011cfac16b8ccc4842071f67 partner=1966]\n\nFacebook and NSA\n\nZuckerberg seemed uncomfortably on the defensive as he explained Facebook\u2019s relationship with the National Security Agency (NSA). At the same time, he criticized the way the federal government has spoken to the press regarding businesses handing over of confidential information.\n\nZuckerberg said due to NSA\u2019s policy, the public has no idea of the extent to which Facebook honors government information requests. It could be anywhere from 1,000 to 100 million, he said. Facebook is suing the government to be able to release the aggregate number of requests. He implied that the number is a lot smaller than people realize.\n\n\u201cI think the more transparent in communicating with the government to do with about how they are requesting data from us, the better everyone would feel about it,\u201d he said.\n\nZuckerberg said that Facebook tries to protect its users from surveillance. \u201cWe look at every request individually and we push back on the ones that either we think are overly broad or not legal.\u201d\n\nSaying that some of the government\u2019s statements are \u201cprofoundly unhelpful,\u201d Zuckerberg perceives the NSA\u2019s statements as throwing a monkey wrench in Facebook\u2019s goal to widen the Internet community.\n\n\u201c\u2019We only spy on non-Americans,\u2019 [says NSA]. Gee thanks. We are trying to provide an international service and not get crushed in any of those places either,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nImmigration and Politics\n\nThe primary reason Zuckerberg was in Washington, he said, was to meet with lawmakers on the immigration issue. He had met with both Republican and Democratic leaders in the House before the interview.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic. But I\u2019m an entrepreneur\u2026 Folks in both parties seem to want to move things forward,\u201d he said.\n\nZuckerberg gave two reasons for why the country needs to enact comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nFirst, Facebook has an interest in hiring high-skilled immigrants, as do other high tech companies. But current U.S. immigration policy \u201ckicks out\u201d 40 percent of foreign math and science graduate students, and makes far too few H-1B visas available for \u201ctalented specialists,\u201d he wrote in an April 10 editorial in the Washington Post.\n\nThe second motive is humanitarian. He was taught entrepreneurship in E. Menlo Park, Calif. to some middle school kids after school. He said he was shocked to discover that the brightest had doubts about college. Even going to high school was problematic for some of these undocumented migrants.\n\n\u201cThe more I looked into it, the more unfair it seemed,\u201d he said. He concluded, \u201cEleven million people is a lot of people being treated unfairly now.\u201d\n\nTo promote comprehensive immigration reform, his ideas on education, and scientific research, Zuckerberg co-founded a bipartisan lobbying group, Fwd.us. Bennet asked him about the organization\u2019s early advertising. It ran political attack ads, supported conservative candidates who attacked Obamacare, and promoted oil drilling.\n\nZuckerberg said that that Fwd.us has a \u201cnovel structure\u201d which has never been tried before, and that there were still \u201ckinks to work out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg articulated his views on immigration reform, NSA surveillance, and the future of Facebook in a candid interview.", "og": {"site_name": "The Epoch Times", "description": "Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg articulated his views on immigration reform, NSA surveillance, and the future of Facebook in a candid interview.", "title": "Facebook Founder Speaks on Immigration Reform and NSA", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2013/09/Zuckerberg+048M-1024x696.png", "updated_time": "2013-09-23T06:55:19-04:00", "url": "http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/294679-facebook-founder-speaks-on-immigration-reform-and-nsa/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Epoch Times", "description": "Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg articulated his views on immigration reform, NSA surveillance, and the future of Facebook in a candid interview.", "title": "Facebook Founder Speaks on Immigration Reform and NSA", "image": {"src": "http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2013/09/Zuckerberg+048M.png"}, "creator": "@EpochTimes", "site": "@EpochTimes", "card": "summary"}, "date": "September 23, 2013 6:55 am", "fb": {"admins": 10205921529470972, "pages": 92239399265}, "keywords": "Facebook, immigration, Mark Zuckerberg, NSA, US, US Features", "article": {"section": "US Features", "tag": "Facebook,immigration,Mark Zuckerberg,NSA", "published_time": "2013-09-22T05:33:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-23T06:55:19-04:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd94ee\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON\u2014Founder and CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, articulated his views on immigration reform, NSA surveillance, and the future of Facebook in a candid interview Sept. 18 at the Newseum.\nImmigration and PoliticsThe primary reason Zuckerberg was in Washington, he said, was to meet with lawmakers on the immigration issue.\nFacebook has 1.15 billion users, \u201cthe largest connected community in the history of the species,\u201d said Bennet.\nZuckerberg gave two reasons for why the country needs to enact comprehensive immigration reform.\nZuckerberg said due to NSA\u2019s policy, the public has no idea of the extent to which Facebook honors government information requests."}
