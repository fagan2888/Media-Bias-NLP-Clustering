On New Year's Day, a kite spectacle

For 28 years, Milwaukeeans have been gathering at the lakefront on New Year's Day without plunging into icy water at high noon like your basic polar bear. Instead, the dry ones have been going to the Cool Fool Kite Festival at Veterans Park.

Kites go aloft starting at 11 a.m. Thursday, when the pros launch their stacks of kites. Look for the giant kites as well, like the popular octopus.

Spectators are welcome to fly their kites until 5 p.m. Kites will be sold at the park, and hot chocolate, coffee and snacks are free while they last, as are parking and admission.

Visitors also can get a lesson in ice carving or just watch the Quiet Ice Carvers at work, transforming blocks of ice into figures. Horse-drawn carriages will be available for rides around the park for a fee.

The festival is sponsored by Gift of Wings kite store, WLDB-FM (93.3), WLUM-FM (102.1) and WMCS-AM (1290), Bella Caffe and the Kite Society of Wisconsin and Illinois.
