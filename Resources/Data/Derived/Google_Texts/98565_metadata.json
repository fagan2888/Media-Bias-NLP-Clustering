In addition to Denver, he holds the post with the Minnesota Orchestra\u2019s Sommerfest and Norway\u2019s Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra, though his Bergen job ends next year.\n\nLike many contemporary conductors who forego the tradition of linking their reputations to a single orchestra, Litton has developed his career through smaller jobs. He guest conducts around the world, seemingly non-stop, and records regularly with the Swedish label BIS.\n\nThough his music director positions put him in charge of the overall playing and hiring of musicians, his actual podium time in each place is limited. Currently, he is conducting eight of the Colorado Symphony Orchestra\u2019s weekend-long Masterworks programs each season.\n\nHe is popular with both musicians and management in Denver, where his contract was extended two more years this week and now runs through 2018.\n\nCSO executive director Jerry Kern said Wednesday that Litton\u2019s New York City Ballet appointment is a plus for Denver because it means Litton likely will do less traveling abroad and have more time for conducting and fundraising here.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great we have somebody who will be in the states more and doesn\u2019t have a second orchestra in Timbuktu,\u201d he said.\n\nLitton grew up in Manhattan near the New York City Ballet\u2019s home at Lincoln Center and attended its annual performances of \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d as a child. He now lives on Long Island and the ballet work will allow him to spend more time with his family\n\nLitton will have plenty of back up on his new gig, as well. The ballet also has an associate music director and two resident conductors on staff.\n\nRay Mark Rinaldi: 303-954-1540, rrinaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/rayrinaldi", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Andrew Litton adds post with New York City Ballet, re-ups in Denver", "title": "Andrew Litton adds post with New York City Ballet, re-ups in Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/17/andrew-litton-adds-post-with-new-york-city-ballet-re-ups-in-denver/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141217__AE31CMLITTON_1__CM23862p1.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141217__AE31CMLITTON_1__CM23862p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-17T08:44:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T06:25:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1484\"", "article_summary": "Andrew Litton, the Colorado Symphony Orchestra\u2019s star conductor, has added another job to his busy resume, music director of the New York City Ballet.\nLike many contemporary conductors who forego the tradition of linking their reputations to a single orchestra, Litton has developed his career through smaller jobs.\nLitton grew up in Manhattan near the New York City Ballet\u2019s home at Lincoln Center and attended its annual performances of \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d as a child.\nCurrently, he is conducting eight of the Colorado Symphony Orchestra\u2019s weekend-long Masterworks programs each season.\nThe ballet also has an associate music director and two resident conductors on staff."}
