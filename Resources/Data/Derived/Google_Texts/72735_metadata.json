Evidently my thinking and his align in important ways. It\u2019s made me mildly interested in reading him, though time constraints (or time mismanagement) have not yet allowed it.\n\nMy minor affinity with Taleb caused me to focus just a little more than I otherwise would have on a tweet of his the other day.\n\nBig corporations are vastly more dangerous to the citizenry than big government, but with good news: corps end up committing suicide. \u2014 Nassim Nichol\u0646Taleb (@nntaleb) April 15, 2015\n\nThat premise really caught my eye. What is the relative danger posed by governments and corporations? Are corporations \u201cvastly more dangerous\u201d?\n\nI\u2019d thought that the jury was pretty much in on that question. With hundreds of millions killed outright by government action in the 20th century alone, the quantum of death and destruction wrought by governments is almost certainly greater than corporations\u2019 destructive work.\n\nLike any tool, corporations are dangerous. Death and injury is a byproduct of their delivery of food, shelter, transportation, entertainment, and every other want and need of consumers, because they often miscalculate risk or just make stupid mistakes.\n\n(I should note that corporations are just a way of organizing people. Their existence isn\u2019t demanded by any principle, and they arguably violate libertarian principle by acting as government transfer of risk from owners to consumers. But by historical accident they do exist, and they are an organizational conduit through which much productive human action passes.)\n\nGovernments are dangerous, too, to the point where it sometimes appears that unpleasant byproducts are the intended product. According to liberal theory, we enter into political society for protection from each other and outsiders. The day-to-day operation of government in the United States is pretty good relative to other countries and other historical eras. But Americans today are caged in droves and killed with regularity as a byproduct of the war on drugs, for example. People around the world are episodically slaughtered in the millions by literal wars entered into by governments.\n\nIs there any comparable danger produced by corporations?\n\nThere are ways of attributing the acts of governments to corporations. The lamentable military-industrial complex is responsible for a vastly greater war-making machine than our society needs, I think. That\u2019s just an extreme example of crony capitalism. But an essential condition of such violent potential and actual violence is government. Corporations cannot and do not tax, conscript, and kill under claim of legal authority to do so. Only governments do that. That\u2019s somewhat definitional, and in practice I think it\u2019s nearly beyond dispute that governments are the more dangerous for it.\n\nIt could be that Taleb is thinking in terms of a stylized sense of \u201cdanger\u201d rather than literal risk of mortality and morbidity. So I was being genuine when I tweeted:\n\nCan\u2019t fathom how @nntaleb concludes \u201cBig corporations are vastly more dangerous to the citizenry than big government.\u201d \u2014 Jim Harper (@Jim_Harper) April 15, 2015\n\nTaleb responded by calling me a lover of big corporations, dishonest, and a lobbyist/prostitute. I have personal foibles, though I think they\u2019re different from the ones in Taleb\u2019s catalog, and my character issues reveal nothing about the relative danger posed by corporations and governments. The question is important because it implies which institution we should more urgently seek to fetter for purposes of public protection.\n\nThe good evidence about the danger of governments is not an argument that they don\u2019t supply some benefits. The utter absence of evidence that corporations are more dangerous leaves as an ineluctable conclusion, I think, that governments are the more dangerous of the two social institutions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I can\u2019t fathom how Nicholas Nassim Taleb concludes otherwise.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "I can't fathom how Nicholas Nassim Taleb concludes otherwise.", "title": "Big Governments Are Vastly More Dangerous to the Citizenry than Big Corporations", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/proven-big-governments-are-vastly-more-dangerous-citizenry-big-corporations", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/proven-big-governments-are-vastly-more-dangerous-citizenry-big-corporations", "creator": "@CatoInstitute", "description": "I can't fathom how Nicholas Nassim Taleb concludes otherwise.", "card": "summary", "title": "Big Governments Are Vastly More Dangerous to the Citizenry than Big Corporations"}, "site": "Cato Institute", "robots": "noodp", "node_creation_date": "2015/4/16", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "publication_date": "2015/4/17", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-17T10:46:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2d5\"", "article_summary": "Big corporations are vastly more dangerous to the citizenry than big government, but with good news: corps end up committing suicide.\nSo I was being genuine when I tweeted:Can\u2019t fathom how @nntaleb concludes \u201cBig corporations are vastly more dangerous to the citizenry than big government.\u201d \u2014 Jim Harper (@Jim_Harper) April 15, 2015Taleb responded by calling me a lover of big corporations, dishonest, and a lobbyist/prostitute.\nIt\u2019s hard to prove or disprove statements of broad social sweep, but we do know one thing: Nicholas Nassim Taleb will not defend his assertion that big corporations are \u201cvastly more dangerous\u201d than big governments.\nAre corporations \u201cvastly more dangerous\u201d?\nThe utter absence of evidence that corporations are more dangerous leaves as an ineluctable conclusion, I think, that governments are the more dangerous of the two social institutions."}
