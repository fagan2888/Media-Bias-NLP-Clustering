He didn\u2019t recall their names.\n\nThe two were part of a tour when they became separated from a group headed to a mountain meadow Friday afternoon. They were about five hours overdue when they were rescued, said Sgt. Kurtis Luster of the Routt County sheriff\u2019s department.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of scary,\u201d Luster said. \u201cThey were lost in a mountainous, forested area. It gets really cold at night.\u201d\n\nLuster said Classic Air Medical has been a great local resource.\n\n\u201cThey are prepared to land almost anywhere at any time,\u201d he said.\n\nWorstell said it was a cool, clear night.\n\nThey were able to locate the missing people in an area about 8,700 feet in elevation within an hour after beginning the search.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Father, 5-year-old daughter rescued near Steamboat Springs", "title": "Father, 5-year-old daughter rescued near Steamboat Springs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/21/father-5-year-old-daughter-rescued-near-steamboat-springs/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-21T10:16:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T10:16:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb7f\"", "article_summary": "A father and his 5-year-old daughter were rescued late Friday night after they became separated from a snowmobile tour group in a mountainous area north of Steamboat Springs, officials say.\n\u201cThey were a little cold but none the worse for wear,\u201d said Barry Worstell, a helicopter pilot with Classic Air Medical, a rescue business that opened a satellite office in Steamboat Springs last year.\nThe man and girl who were rescued were on vacation from their home in London, Worstell said.\nThe two were part of a tour when they became separated from a group headed to a mountain meadow Friday afternoon.\nThey were able to locate the missing people in an area about 8,700 feet in elevation within an hour after beginning the search."}
