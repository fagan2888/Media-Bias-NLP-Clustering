Individuals can choose from 29 plans offered by three companies: Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, AmeriHealth New Jersey and Health Republic Insurance of New Jersey. Federal subsidies may help pay for a portion of premiums.\n\nInsurance companies such as Aetna are still offering plans but not on the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvocates of the new law hail the change as a win for consumers, arguing that all plans\n\nmust now meet minimum standards \u2014 that even if these new plans cost a bit more, they will provide much better coverage.\n\n\u201cIn the end it could be a net positive for people,\u201d said Linda Schwimmer, vice president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute.\n\nShe pointed out that preventive care, such as blood pressure screening, will now be covered for free.\n\n\u201cYou got to think about somebody relatively healthy and pretty good about getting their primary care needs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might actually cost less out of pocket. I think it\u2019s an opportunity.\u201d\n\nCritics, however, say the changes belie the president\u2019s often-repeated claim that if you like your insurance plan, you can keep it.\n\nBut state Sen. Joe Vitale (D-Middlesex) said it\u2019s a nuanced promise.\n\n\u201cThe president also said he won\u2019t tolerate benefit plans that don\u2019t meet the basic needs of our citizens,\u201d Vitale said.\n\nThose in the individual and small-employer markets aren\u2019t the only ones receiving letters because of the Affordable Care Act. There are changes coming to some Medicare Advantage plans as well, which are due, in part, to the new law.\n\nHorizon sent notices to 50,000 of its New Jersey members explaining to seniors that their current plans will not be available next year.\n\n\u201cDue to increasing health care costs and continued federal government cuts to Medicare Advantage, Horizon BCBSNJ had to discontinue certain MA plans, create new plans, and increase premiums, in order to continue to be the only carrier offering MA plans in all 21 counties of New Jersey,\u201d Vincz said. \u201cWe are working with all impacted MA members to help them understand their options, which include new Horizon MA plans, traditional Medicare paired with one of our Medicare Supplemental plans, or even other carriers\u2019 plans.\u201d\n\nOne reason for the change is that Obamacare cut about $200 billion from the Medicare Advantage program, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service. Some of that money was used to pay for other parts of the law, including provisions that benefit seniors, such as closing the infamous \u201cdoughnut hole,\u201d which will reduce the percentage seniors must pay for prescription drugs.\n\n\u201cWe have advised members, in our letters, of other Medicare plans we may have\n\navailable to them in their area and we have provided them resources at CMS who can help them choose their new plan,\u201d Millerick said.\n\nBrian McGuire, associate state director for AARP New Jersey, said these changes may be frustrating to seniors forced to change plans, but it is an overall benefit for Medicare recipients. That\u2019s because the Affordable Care Act provides financial incentives to insurance plans that are ranked highest for quality of care and customer service.\n\n\u201cAny time a senior has a plan they like and have to change, that\u2019s not a positive, but we have a much better assurance that there are higher-quality plans being offered,\u201d he said.\u201c\n\nMaryann White, 74, of Toms River said she was frustrated by the news. She liked the plan she had and is worried that whatever new plan she buys will cost more. Though she is engaged in the process, she said, many seniors find it difficult to understand their options.\n\n\u201cThis is really a shame,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not criticizing. I\u2019m just saying, \u2018Give us a break.\u2019\u201d\n\nMcGuire reminded seniors looking for a new plan they can call 1-800-MEDICARE for assistance.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','health-news','obamacare','ocean-county','toms-river'", "title": "Obamacare causes insurance companies to scrap some plans, create new ones", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare causes insurance companies to scrap some plans, create new ones\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/obamacare_forces_insurance_companies_to_scrap_some_plans_create_new_ones.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2013/09/13465632-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11377253\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-06T13:15:09Z\", \"author\": \"Dan Goldberg | The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"health-news\",\"obamacare\",\"ocean-county\",\"toms-river\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2013/09/13465632-small.jpg", "description": "The changes will impact more than 800,000 people in New Jersey who purchase insurance on the individual and small-employer markets", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, October 06, 2013,  9:15 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2013/09/13465632-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dgoldberg\", \"author_nickname\": \"Dan Goldberg | The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"8007378\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The changes will impact more than 800,000 people in New Jersey who purchase insurance on the individual and small-employer markets", "title": "Obamacare causes insurance companies to scrap some plans, create new ones", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/obamacare_forces_insurance_companies_to_scrap_some_plans_create_new_ones.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, October 06, 2013,  9:15 AM", "article_author": "Dan Goldberg | The Star-Ledger", "Description": "The changes will impact more than 800,000 people in New Jersey who purchase insurance on the individual and small-employer markets"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca947\"", "article_summary": "Insurance companies such as Aetna are still offering plans but not on the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.\nThat\u2019s because the Affordable Care Act provides financial incentives to insurance plans that are ranked highest for quality of care and customer service.\nThose in the individual and small-employer markets aren\u2019t the only ones receiving letters because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cIn the end it could be a net positive for people,\u201d said Linda Schwimmer, vice president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute.\nI think it\u2019s an opportunity.\u201dCritics, however, say the changes belie the president\u2019s often-repeated claim that if you like your insurance plan, you can keep it."}
