GuideSpark Inc. wants to make dull employee handbooks, seminars and brochures a thing of the past by turning these materials into more engaging video, mobile and interactive content.

The Menlo Park startup just raised $15 million in a Series B round of venture funding led by New Enterprise Associates, with participation by GuideSpark’s earlier backers Storm Ventures and IDG Ventures.

GuideSpark Chief Executive Keith Kitani, who co-founded the company with John Wolff and Joseph Larocque, said that a workforce preference for video, mobile and interactive content over paper, text-based websites and email is driving his startup’s growth. So is national health care reform that has affected just about every business in the U.S. this year, he said.

Clients of GuideSpark range from large employers to growing startups including: 7-Eleven Inc., Adobe Systems Inc., L’Oréal SA, Box Inc. and News Corp. (owner of The Wall Street Journal), he said.

GuideSpark takes old training materials and files from its clients and uses a proprietary content creation platform to turn these into videos and interactive materials, quickly.

The company charges for a year-long subscription to its software-as-a-service, and assigns internal, creative experts to help employers customize their materials.

GuideSpark’s system also gives human resources teams the ability to see when and where employees have watched their videos, for example, or taken their online and mobile polls or quizzes.

Lori Brown, an assistant vice president of human resources with L’Oréal USA in Berkeley Heights, N.J., said she used GuideSpark to reach “a very diverse workforce in terms of functions, geographies and cultural backgrounds.”

Before using GuideSpark, her team delivered health and retirement benefits information via an “employee portal,” a call center, plasma screens, an internal website, and in break rooms, emails and printed materials for employees.

When L’Oréal began to use GuideSpark in 2013, she says, it helped the team save money and time on research, graphic design, printing, legal review of benefits materials and more. More importantly, she said, “about half [of L'Oréal USA's employees] watched the videos in the first year of the program.”

NEA’s Peter Sonsini said his firm backed GuideSpark because of the pedigree of its founding team–veteran tech executives who worked together before at Adobe Systems Inc.– and GuideSpark’s traction.

The startup’s software-as-a-service is “not about paving the way to a new market, or changing behavior,” he said, but “replacing an existing business…with something better.”

In 2013, he noted, GuideSpark grew from 60 clients to 240.

Storm Ventures Managing Director Ryan Floyd said that GuideSpark’s success so far reminds him of one of his firm’s earlier portfolio companies, Marketo Inc. The marketing automation software business held an IPO in April 2012 and boasts a $1.59 billion market cap today.

Mr. Floyd said, “We invested in Marketo in July 2008, and GuideSpark in April 2013. Marketo tripled its revenue in 2008, 2009 and 2010, reaching $14 million then. GuideSpark tripled in 2013, will triple in 2014 and we are investing in the Series B round to help them scale and triple revenue again in 2015. They’re also growing [by number of employees] at a similar pace.”

Executives and investors declined to comment on valuation and other terms of the deal. However, Mr. Kitani said that GuideSpark planned to use its new capital on hiring, especially in the sales and marketing department, and to develop new technology, improving the speed of content creation and its analytics platform in 2014.

The company competes with traditional HR consultancies like Mercer LLC, startups that offer workplace training online, like Open Sesame Inc., and tech firms helping employers create their own videos, like Kaltura Inc.
