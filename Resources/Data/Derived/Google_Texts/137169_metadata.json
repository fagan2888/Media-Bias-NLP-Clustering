Holly Brady (right) is a Fort Wayne labor and employment attorney. The two have different views on how a new religious freedom law will impact Hoosiers.\n\nRelated Coverage Gov. Pence signs Religious Freedom bill into law\n\nFORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) \u2014 It\u2019s not just politicians who disagree on the religious freedom bill Gov. Mike Pence signed into law Thursday. Legal experts differ on the impact it may have on the community.\n\nThe new law is said to prevent state and local laws from infringing on religious rights. Opponents say it opens the door for discrimination.\n\nHolly Brady is a labor and employment attorney at Haller & Colvin PC and deals with discrimination issues on a daily basis. She doesn\u2019t think the new religious freedom law will have a major impact on Hoosiers.\n\n\u201cThe people of Indiana will continue to apply their own values to how they operate their businesses,\u201d Brady said. \u201cAre there some bad apples that will try to use this as some sort of a sword, perhaps. But I don\u2019t see it having any dramatic change whatsoever.\u201d\n\nBrady called the uproar against the bill \u201ca lot of hoopla\u201d and doesn\u2019t think it will open the door to new discrimination. She pointed to a similar federal law and first amendment rights that already protect religious freedoms.\n\n\u201cI think that, quite frankly, this law was passed because in recent times, people are feeling more and more like their religious beliefs are under attack,\u201d Brady said. She referenced the Affordable Care Act\u2019s attempt to require the Catholic Church to provide medical services contrary to their religious beliefs.\n\nNancy Marcus, on the other hand, believes the religious freedom law could have huge implications for discrimination against the LGBT community. She\u2019s a constitutional law professor at Indiana Tech Law School.\n\nMarcus said legislators proposed several amendments trying to specifically outlaw discrimination in the bill. But those were shot down, which she thinks reveals the true motive behind supporters.\n\n\u201cTo me, what is suspect, is not just the bill on its face but the fact that they refused to amend it to protect children, to protect people from discrimination,\u201d Marcus said.\n\nMarcus said it opens the door for more people to use religion to shield themselves from the law, resulting in religious freedom coming head to head against civil rights.\n\n\u201cThe problem, like I said, is when you have local ordinances that enact civil rights protections for people based on sexual orientation. This (the religious freedom law) could be interpreted as trumping that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf even one person is denied public services from a public employee, it\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\n19 other states currently have similar legislation. A federal version was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in the 90\u2019s.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court used that federal law to say Hobby Lobby, as a religious organization, didn\u2019t have to provide certain contraceptives through their health care plan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One attorney thinks the new religious freedom law won't have much effect on the community.
