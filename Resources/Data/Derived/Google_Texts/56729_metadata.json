The FDA estimates it will affect 10,800 operators that control between 4 and 5.6 million machines. Each company will pay an estimated $2,400 to comply.\n\nAmerican Action Forum Director of Regulatory Policy Sam Batkins said the regulation is redundant, and primarily affects small businesses.\n\nAccording to the regulation, 97 percent of the companies that will be affected fall under the Small Business Administration\u2019s definition of a small business. \u201cTherefore, the [FDA] believes that the proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,\u201d the agency said.\n\nIn a newly released video, Batkins attempts to make his own office compliant with the rules.\n\nBatkins covers the front of a vending machine with 18 calorie notices that block the snacks from view. \u201cRedundant, that\u2019s one way to describe the calorie labeling requirements for vending machines,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also really expensive,\u201d Batkins said. \u201cThe administration admits the proposal could cost roughly $40 million annually. Burdensome. Ninety-seven percent of the affected entities are small businesses.\u201d\n\nBatkins noted that the regulation could increase prices by 3 to 5 percent for small businesses. \u201cBeneficial?\u201d he asked. \u201cEven the administration doesn\u2019t know the full health benefits of the proposal.\u201d\n\nBatkins then asks his iPhone helper Siri \u201chow many calories are in a Snickers bar?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe answer is about 278 dietary calories.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore calorie labeling: redundant, expensive, and unnecessary,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov\u2019t wants consumers to make \u2018healthier choices when consuming food away from home\u2019", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The Obama administration finalized its regulation to require vending machines to post calorie information on all of its items on Thursday, a rule that will cost businesses as much as $40 million to co", "title": "Obama Administration Finalizes Regulation to Post Calories on Vending Machines", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/obama-administration-finalizes-regulation-to-post-calories-on-vending-machines/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Vending-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration finalized its regulation to require vending machines to post calorie inform", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Vending-150x150.jpg", "title": "Obama Administration Finalizes Regulation to Post Calories on Vending Machines", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc8ae\"", "article_summary": "\u201cRedundant, that\u2019s one way to describe the calorie labeling requirements for vending machines,\u201d he said.\nBY: Follow @LizWFBThe Obama administration finalized its regulation to require vending machines to post calorie information on all of its items on Thursday, a rule that will cost businesses as much as $40 million to comply.\nThe FDA estimates it will affect 10,800 operators that control between 4 and 5.6 million machines.\nThe regulation, which is mandated under Obamacare, requires virtually all vending machines to post nutrition fact signs in \u201cclose proximity to each article of food or the selection button.\u201d The rule will go into effect in 2015.\n\u201cConsumers will benefit from having this important nutrition information to assist them in making healthier choices when consuming food away from home.\u201dThe regulation applies to any company that owns 20 or more vending machines."}
