Oh, good. Donald Trump has a take on Jonathan Gruber.

During his regularly-scheduled Monday Fox & Friends appearance, the Apprentice star was asked for his thoughts on the MIT professor and Obamacare advisor who once said the law only passed because of a “lack of transparency” along with “the stupidity of the American voter.”



We needn’t dwell too much on the specifics, but here’s a primer on Trump’s response: Gruber is the real “dummy” here because he didn’t think someone would videotape his remarks.

Oh, and Obamacare is a hoax.

Also, the president and all those involved in the law’s formation are “shady” or perhaps even just “bad” people.

By the way, Donald might run for president.

Though he won’t say whether he’s actually running. But if he does, he’d undoubtedly be better than any other candidate.

The world would “respect” America again, okay?

Also, Mexico is the new China, “taking our money like it’s coffee” or something.
