A former Denver Public Schools administrator who was hired two months ago as deputy superintendent of the Albuquerque school district resigned Thursday after revelations he faces child sex assault charges in Colorado.

Jason Martinez, 50, had previously worked for a publishing house and was an instruction and technology administrator at DPS.

Denver police arrested Martinez in Denver in July 2013 on six child molestation-related charges — including sexual assault on a child, pattern of abuse — according to Colorado Bureau of Information records.

Then on Jan. 25, Denver police charged Martinez with felony assault with a deadly weapon and misdemeanor assault. On Feb. 11, he was charged with failure to appear in court.

While all the charges were winding their way through various courts, Martinez applied for the position of deputy superintendent at Albuquerque Public Schools.

When he worked for DPS, Martinez won a districtwide award for spearheading a technology project in 2011. He helped design The Digital Door Project, which gathers instant data for teachers and principals, including data about each student’s past CSAP scores with an item-by-item breakdown of answers, according to a Denver Post article.

In June, the Albuquerque district hired Martinez with a salary of $160,000.

School officials subsequently learned that Martinez, whose given name is Timothy Jason Martinez, had failed to complete a background check, including having his fingerprints taken, according to published reports.

KOB-TV in Albuquerque reported the pending sexual assault charges Friday.

Martinez submitted a letter of resignation Thursday, citing personal and family commitments as reasons for quitting.

Albuquerque Superintendent Dr. Luis Valentino said Martinez would not have been hired if authorities had known of the charges.

A trial against Martinez is scheduled in Denver District Court for Oct. 16.
