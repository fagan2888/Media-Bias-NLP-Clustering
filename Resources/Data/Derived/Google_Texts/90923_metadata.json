Only one thing: the Republicans,\u201d Sowell wrote.\n\n\u201cBy making a futile and foredoomed attempt to defund ObamaCare, Congressional Republicans have created the distraction that Obama so much needs,\u201d he continued. \u201cAlready media attention has shifted to the possibility of a government shutdown.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sowell, the fact that Republicans are not looking to shut the government down does not matter. The real issue is that they have created a distraction large enough to give Obama cover, he said.\n\nWhile the respected economist wrote harshly about the Republican effort to defund Obamacare, he agreed with the premise, saying the law \u201cis an economic disaster and will be a medical disaster, as well as destroy the Constitution\u2019s protections of American citizens from the unbridled power of the federal government.\u201d It should \u201cabsolutely\u201d be defunded, he said.\n\nHe added that both Obama and Chief Justice John Roberts deserve impeachment for \u201carbitrarily waiving laws\u201d and \u201chis decision upholding Obamacare\u201d respectively.\n\nHowever, Sowell noted, \u201cfor the same reason that it makes no sense to impeach either President Obama or Chief Justice Roberts, it makes no sense to attempt to defund ObamaCare. That reason is that it cannot be done. The world is full of things that ought to be done but cannot in fact be done.\u201d\n\nFollow Caroline on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caroline May", "description": "Hoover Institution senior fellow Thomas Sowell argued Tuesday that the defund Obamacare effort is serving as a helpful distraction.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Hoover Institution senior fellow Thomas Sowell argued Tuesday that the defund Obamacare effort is serving as a helpful distraction from President Obama's low approval ratings and the controversies fac", "title": "Thomas Sowell: \u2018Defund Obamacare\u2019 effort \u2018futile and foredoomed\u2019", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/24/thomas-sowell-defund-obamacare-effort-futile-and-foredoomed/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sowell-e1380032630936.jpg", "height": 275}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Congressional Republicans have created the distraction that Obama so much needs'", "creator": "@c_maydc", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/24/thomas-sowell-defund-obamacare-effort-futile-and-foredoomed/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sowell-e1380032630936.jpg"}, "title": "Thomas Sowell: \u2018Defund Obamacare\u2019 effort \u2018futile and foredoomed\u2019 Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-24 11:12:58", "sailthru.title": "Thomas Sowell: 'Defund Obamacare' effort 'futile and foredoomed'", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "obamacare,thomas sowell", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,caroline-may", "sailthru.description": "Hoover Institution senior fellow Thomas Sowell argued Tuesday that the defund Obamacare effort is serving as a helpful distraction from President Obama's low approval ratings and the controversies fac", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sowell-e1380032630936.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0921\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBy making a futile and foredoomed attempt to defund ObamaCare, Congressional Republicans have created the distraction that Obama so much needs,\u201d he continued.\n3873164Hoover Institution senior fellow Thomas Sowell argued Tuesday that the defund Obamacare effort is serving as a helpful distraction from President Obama\u2019s low approval ratings and the controversies facing the administration.\nOnly one thing: the Republicans,\u201d Sowell wrote.\nHowever, Sowell noted, \u201cfor the same reason that it makes no sense to impeach either President Obama or Chief Justice Roberts, it makes no sense to attempt to defund ObamaCare.\nHe added that both Obama and Chief Justice John Roberts deserve impeachment for \u201carbitrarily waiving laws\u201d and \u201chis decision upholding Obamacare\u201d respectively."}
