Orrin Hatch, Monday marked the final day without the security detail that comes with his role as the new Senate president pro tempore.\n\nThe Republican, in office for nearly four decades, will be third in the line of presidential succession behind the vice president and the House speaker, and preside over the Senate in the vice president's absence.\n\nHatch provided a visitor with an impromptu tour of the Capitol, including his spacious new office as president pro tempore that overlooks the Washington Monument and a special, \"hideaway\" office once used by Thomas Jefferson as a library.\n\nAlong the way, Hatch greeted everyone from interns to staff, and ignored a suggestion that incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, was in a meeting and couldn't be disturbed.\n\n\"Enjoy your last day of freedom before we follow you around,\" a Capitol security officer told Hatch. One of several calls Hatch fielded was from a member of his new security detail, informing him that he would now be driven everywhere, like it or not.\n\nA member of the Senate for 38 years, Hatch will also be chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, that will handle much of the legislation dealing with the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, in addition to spending issues.\n\nWhile Hatch said a repeal of President Barack Obama's signature health care law is likely not an option because it would be vetoed, there can be reforms made, at least until there is a new president and a new opportunity for an overhaul.\n\nHatch said he hopes to bring \"some settling influence\" to the Senate as president pro tempore. \"It won't be a matter of trying to be a big deal or anything like that,\" he said. \"I don't intend to act like I'm more important than I am.\"\n\nLove may be new to Washington, but the first black Republican woman elected to Congress has been in the national spotlight since her close 2012 race against now-retired Rep. Jim Matheson, a Democrat.\n\nTwo years ago, national GOP leaders, including House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio campaigned for Love in Utah and she had a prime speaking spot at the Republican National Convention that nominated Mitt Romney for president.\n\nShe kept her focus on Utah in her 2014 race against Democrat Doug Owens but never lacked for attention. Even before officially taking office, Love was a guest Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos.\u201d\n\nDespite her prominence among the 57 new members of Congress, Love said she had to push hard to get what\u2019s considered an \u201cA\u201d list committee assignment, on House Financial Services.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t just handed over to me. I had to work for it,\u201d Love said. \u201cWhile everybody else was doing their White House tours \u2014 they have all these new member things, these programs \u2014 I was actually out knocking on doors of steering committee members.\u201d\n\nShe had initially hoped for a spot on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, but said Utahns will benefit from her being on the committee that oversees the financial services industry, including banking, housing and insurance.\n\n\u201cWe think about the American dream and we think about the things that Utah really wanted and that was financial security,\u201d Love said, the ability to buy big ticket items like homes and cars while building savings.\n\nShe said she wants \u201cto do everything I can to not put the focus on helping banks, helping industrial banks, helping credit unions. I want to be able to focus on making sure we can help people in the 4th District try and achieve some financial security.\u201d\n\nOther goals include repealing and replacing Dodd-Frank, the Wall Street reform and consumer protection act signed into law by Obama in 2010, and auditing the Federal Reserve, a favorite target of the tea party movement.\n\nLove will join the all-Democratic Congressional Black Caucus on Tuesday. She has repeatedly defended House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, who reportedly spoke to a white supremacist group in 2002.\n\nThat pleased Hatch, who praised Love for having \"stuck up\" for the House leader and said she adds a new dimension to the Utah delegation as a conservative black woman that will be good for the state and for the GOP.\n\n\"She has the opportunity of becoming a real spokesperson in the Republican Party and becoming a real bona fide leader,\" Hatch said. \"She's not afraid of work. Nor is she afraid of anybody back here, which I find to be delightful.\"\n\nEmail: lisa@deseretnews.com, Twitter: DNewsPolitics", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "Dressed in sleek running gear with her hair tucked under a cap, Rep.-elect Mia Love stopped briefly by her new congressional office Monday to check in with her staff.", "title": "Orrin Hatch and Mia Love ready for new roles", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "iphone": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "googleplay": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deseretnews.android"}, "name": {"ipad": "Deseret News", "iphone": "Deseret News", "googleplay": "Deseret News"}, "id": {"ipad": 425758986, "iphone": 425758986, "googleplay": "com.deseretnews.android"}}, "creator": "@dnewspolitics", "site": "@deseretnews", "card": "summary"}, "datePublished": "2015-01-05", "vr": {"category": "utah", "type": "article"}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"recommendable": "false"}}, "speare-timestamp": "2015-01-06 11:58:53", "copyright": "\u00a9 2016 Deseret News Publishing Company", "title": "Orrin Hatch and Mia Love ready for new roles", "image": "http://www.deseretnews.com/media/photos/web-1465614.jpg", "dsk": "utah", "tout": {"article": {"id": 865618998}}, "thumbnail": "http://www.deseretnews.com/media/photos/web-1465614.jpg", "medium": "news", "description": "Dressed in sleek running gear with her hair tucked under a cap, Rep.-elect Mia Love stopped briefly by her new congressional office Monday to check in with her staff.", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": 683545112, "app_id": 320112201431112, "pages": 16317479654}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-05T23:05-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=1024, initial-scale=0.1", "GOOGLEBOT": "ARCHIVE", "og": {"url": "http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865618998/Hatch-and-Love-ready-for-new-roles.html?pg=all", "type": "article", "image": "http://img.deseretnews.com/images/article/hires/1465614/1465614.jpg", "site_name": "DeseretNews.com", "title": "Orrin Hatch and Mia Love ready for new roles"}, "author": "Lisa Riley Roche", "dateModified": "2015-01-06", "articleid": 865618998}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1243\"", "article_summary": "For the longest-serving member of Utah's congressional delegation, Sen.
