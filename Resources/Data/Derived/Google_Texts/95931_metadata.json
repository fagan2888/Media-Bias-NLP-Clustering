Trunp\u2019s statements have been ruled 8 percent \u201cTrue\u201d and \u201cMostly True\u201d and 60 percent \u201cFalse\u201d and \u201cPants on Fire.\u201d\n\nSo if you are thinking of dumping the Democratic party for Trump because you can\u2019t stand Clinton\u2019s lies, maybe you should take a closer look at your own gender bias.\n\nThere are a lot of valid reasons not to vote for Clinton, and I support anyone who expresses them.\n\nI don\u2019t support thinly veiled sexism or stereotypes about women in power. And I don\u2019t support anyone voting for Trump.\n\njordrile@indiana.edu\n\n@RiledpIDS", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the Indiana primary gets closer, the decision about who to vote for becomes more and more crucial.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"url": "http://www.idsnews.com/article/2016/04/column-sexism-in-politics-surprise-surprise", "image": "http://duvq7ua50whdw.cloudfront.net/20160412QJeR6mqyqZ/dist/img/IDS-fb-icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "As the Indiana primary gets closer, the decision about who to vote for becomes more and more crucial.", "title": "COLUMN: Sexism in politics, surprise, surprise"}, "twitter": {"site": "@idsnews", "description": "As the Indiana primary gets closer, the decision about who to vote for becomes more and more crucial.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "COLUMN: Sexism in politics, surprise, surprise"}, "keywords": "Indiana University, IU, Bloomington, Indiana, Monroe County, Indiana Daily Student, IDS, student newspaper, newspaper, news, students, college, university, campus, Ernie Pyle", "google-site-verification": "FkL7grEXumouo-bfJ89mrCvOGorioiCTNQ4t4X3bjjI", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "I believe there are a lot of valid and unavoidable reasons not to vote for Clinton, and I don\u2019t plan to.\nHowever, there are also some completely invalid reasons to vote against Clinton \u2014 namely, that she is a woman.\nThere are a lot of valid reasons not to vote for Clinton, and I support anyone who expresses them.\nA Hart Research Associates survey found 7 percent of Sanders voters could see themselves voting for Trump and 8 percent gave Trump a positive likeability rating.\nAnd I don\u2019t support anyone voting for Trump."}
