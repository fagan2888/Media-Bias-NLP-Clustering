They were also distributed to a Whole Foods center in Connecticut.\n\nThe Food Safety and Inspection Services (FSIS) found that during production, the dorsal root ganglia tissue had not been removed from cattle that were older than 30 months old, which is a violation of federal regulations. The particular tissue is considered a risk as it may contain the protein causing mad cow disease.\n\nContrary to popular belief, mad cow disease \u2014 also referred to as bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cows \u2013 is not caused by a bacterium or virus. It\u2019s the result of an unusual protein known as a \u201cprion,\u201d which eats holes in a cow\u2019s nervous tissue. When humans eat beef that contain this protein, they can develop a degenerative brain disorder known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). The disease was discovered about 2 decades ago, and so far there have been 220 recorded cases of vCJD worldwide since 1996. Most of these cases were in France and the U.K. Four cows in the U.S. have been diagnosed with bovine spongiform encephalopathy since 2003, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "beef recall, mad cow disease", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Amid fears of a potential mad cow disease outbreak, a Missouri slaughterhouse is recalling over 4,000 pounds of beef after a risky tissue wasn't removed during production.", "title": "Mad Cow Disease Scare: Missouri Slaughterhouse Recalls 4,000 Pounds Of Beef", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/concerned-over-mad-cow-disease-missouri-slaughterhouse-recalls-over-4000-pounds-beef-288190", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/13/cows.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Amid fears of a potential mad cow disease outbreak, a Missouri slaughterhouse is recalling over 4,000 pounds of beef after a risky tissue wasn't removed during production.", "title": "Mad Cow Disease Scare: Missouri Slaughterhouse Recalls 4,000 Pounds Of Beef", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/concerned-over-mad-cow-disease-missouri-slaughterhouse-recalls-over-4000-pounds-beef-288190", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/13/cows.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/13/cows.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-13T23:40:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-13T23:58:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Amid fears of a potential mad cow disease outbreak, a Missouri slaughterhouse is recalling over 4,000 pounds of beef after a risky tissue wasn't removed during production."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc1aa\"", "article_summary": "A Missouri slaughterhouse has recalled over 4,000 pounds of fresh beef over the possibility of the meat being contaminated with \u201cmad cow disease,\u201d a deadly and degenerative brain disorder that first originated in cows.\nThe particular tissue is considered a risk as it may contain the protein causing mad cow disease.\nContrary to popular belief, mad cow disease \u2014 also referred to as bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cows \u2013 is not caused by a bacterium or virus.\nThere have only been four confirmed cases of mad cow disease in U.S. cattle in recent years, with most of the cases originated in the U.K. or Middle East.\nWhen humans eat beef that contain this protein, they can develop a degenerative brain disorder known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)."}
