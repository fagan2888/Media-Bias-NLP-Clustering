The legislation sets federal funding levels for the next year and extends several tax breaks.\n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski played a major role in crafting the final deal. She says Alaska can claim a number of victories, including provisions pertaining to national defense, veterans benefits, and language mandating the labeling of genetically-engineered salmon.\n\n\u201cThe FDA shall not allow the introduction or delivery into inter-state commerce of any food that contains genetically-engineered salmon, until FDA has published final labeling guidelines for informing consumers of this content,\u201d Murkowski said.\n\nEssentially, no genetically-engineered salmon would be on store shelves until the Federal Food and Drug Administration develops and implements a labeling process.\n\nDownload Audio\n\nOther fisheries provisions clear up issues in the naming of products like \u201cAlaskan Pollock,\u201d and another supporting the J-1 and H-2-B visa programs, to ensure the state\u2019s fisheries industry is able to fill its large number of seasonal jobs.\n\nMurkowski says commitments to the Alaska Native community were also fulfilled through funding to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service.\n\n\u201cWe also have, for the first time ever, included funding for tribal courts in Alaska,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see funding substance and drug abuse. Funding within BIA that will not only work to deal with issues related to substance abuse, but domestic violence, suicide.\u201d\n\nMurkowski says $10 million is appropriated toward the nation\u2019s tribal courts and $25 million to BIA to strengthen programs combating domestic violence and substance abuse.\n\nShe also says contract support costs \u2013 which are the operational costs for tribes to deliver federal programs \u2013 are fully funded.\n\nFlat funding is on the horizon for the Environmental Protection Agency, but Murkowski says there will be funding for the agency\u2019s back-haul program to remove solid waste and garbage from rural Alaska.\n\nThe deal also delays for two years the implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cCadillac Tax,\u201d which taxes high-cost insurance plans that are especially prevalent in Alaska\u2019s market.\n\nThe crude oil export ban is also lifted, though Alaska\u2019s oil was already exempt.\n\nThe entire package is expected to be out of the House and into the Senate on Friday for consideration.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "Congress has agreed on a year-end spending and tax package, though the final votes in the House and Senate have yet to be taken.
