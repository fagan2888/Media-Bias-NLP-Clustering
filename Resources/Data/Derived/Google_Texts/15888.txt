Bill de Blasio has been the mayor of New York City for barely more than a month, but he’s already facing a crisis of epic proportions, one that threatens to not only mar his first term but also guarantee he fails to win a second.

That’s right: He’s pissed off Al Roker.

Roker’s in Sochi for the Olympics, but that doesn’t mean he’s unaware of the tidal wave of snow that engulfed New York City on Thursday. He knows about de Blasio’s controversial decision to keep schools open, too.

Roker unleashed a torrent of critical tweets on Thursday morning, slamming de Blasio’s decision and predicting that the negative consequences of making the city’s children brave the snow to get to school will be so bad that they’ll sink the mayor’s chances of winning a second term.

From start to finish, here’s Roker’s rant:

Why are schools all around NYC closed? It's going to take some kid or kids getting hurt before this goofball policy gets changed — Al Roker (@alroker) February 13, 2014

So now my daughter's NYC public school is being let out early. @NYCMayorsOffice @NYCSchools Is it worth putting kids' safety at risk? — Al Roker (@alroker) February 13, 2014

And how about all the parents and caregivers who have to scramble to get their kids home? Is there no one there with any common sense? — Al Roker (@alroker) February 13, 2014
