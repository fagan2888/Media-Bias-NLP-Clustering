Poor study habits and not getting any playing time at OSU led McGee to make one of the best decisions he could have made: to enroll at Haskell.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t really raised traditionally. I started learning when I got to Haskell, which turned out to be a real blessing,\u201d said McGee, who is a descendent of Chief Red Bird Smith. \u201cI met other tribal members who were distant relatives, who started teaching me.

McGee held the record for longest touchdown run from scrimmage (86 yards); most touchdowns in a single game (4); most touchdowns in a season (19); and most career touchdowns (36), among others.\n\nIn 1992, McGee was the leading NJCAA rusher in the nation, as well the national leader in scoring.
