At a campaign stop on Wednesday, GOP also-ran Jeb Bush was asked whether it was just and right to remove “Confederate fixtures” because of “anybody killing any other entity because of one basis or not.”

Bush said it should be “a state-by-state decision,” and noted that “I moved all of the flags off the state premises, into the Florida museum, where they would be honored, because it was part of our heritage, but it would not be a visible sign of what Florida is about.”

“There’s a way to find the right balance, as you’re bringing up, because, look, the Confederacy is a part of our heritage, and it should be respected like other parts,” he continued.

“It doesn’t have to define who we are either. Because that symbol — the problem with the Confederate flag isn’t the Confederacy, the problem with the Confederate flag is what it began to represent later. And that’s what we have to avoid to heal those wounds.”
