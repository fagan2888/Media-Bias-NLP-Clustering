Jason Chaffetz fired off a letter to ICE Director Sarah Salda\u00f1a Thursday, telling her to divulge everything she knows about federal contractor GEO Care giving fully equipped smartphones to some illegal aliens after their release from Texas detention facilities.\n\nGEO Care runs the detention centers and gives illegal immigrants the smartphones so they can contact case managers and navigate their way through the U.S., according to the Los Angeles Times, which broke the story.\n\n\u201cA critic of the program suggested that providing free phones to detainees may counteract a public awareness campaign in Central America that is designed to discourage migration because it creates an incentive to enter the United States legally,\u201d Chaffetz wrote. \u201cFurthermore, smartphones are an expensive technology.\u201d\n\nGEO Group, of which GEO Care is a subsidiary, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation Friday. Since the smartphones are being lent, it\u2019s not clear how GEO Care expects to retrieve them.\n\nGEO Group describes itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s leading provider of correctional and detention management and community reentry services to federal, state and local government agencies.\u201d\n\nThe company has a $26 million annual contract with the federal government to hold immigrants at 15 ICE detention centers in six states, according to NPR.\n\nSalda\u00f1a has until March 1 to hand over the policy ICE or federal contractors use to distribute phones and monitor their use, along with the program\u2019s full cost and history.\n\nClick here for reuse options!
