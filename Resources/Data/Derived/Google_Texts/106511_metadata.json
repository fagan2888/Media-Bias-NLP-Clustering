However, according to Eugene Litvak, Ph.D., president and CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Optimization (IHO) and Harvard University Professor, post-discharge planning is only half the battle.\n\nAt IHO\u2014an independent research, education and service organization focused on bringing the science and practice of operations management to healthcare delivery\u2014the goal is to develop new theory to simultaneously reduce cost and improve quality of care, contradicting the notion that improving quality and cost of healthcare has to involve trade-offs. Dr. Litvak recently spoke with HCI Associate Editor Rajiv Leventhal about what else hospitals could be doing to lower readmissions, and the most significant elements that came out of the Kaiser Health News report. Below are excerpts of that interview.\n\nWhat was your initial reaction to the readmissions numbers that Kaiser Health News reported?\n\nI wasn\u2019t surprised in the least, just like I\u2019m not surprised when it\u2019s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. You can\u2019t predict the numbers, but it\u2019s not difficult to predict the trend. Most hospitals concentrate on the patient\u2019s exit from the hospital, and properly, so long as the patient gets all of the necessary information when leaving. Hospitals try to do their best to make sure of this, though they\u2019re not always successful. I think it is the right thing to do when done correctly; by no means am I critical of it. What I disagree with is that hospitals are missing the elephant in the room.\n\nWhat is the elephant in the room?\n\nThe way patients are admitted to the hospital. If you look at bed occupancy at most hospitals, you will find significant changes from peaks to valleys on a daily basis. During the peak in inpatient demand, your resources are stretched thin. And during a valley, you have a [situation] where resources are being wasted. It\u2019s not like you can put it in the freezer for the next day when you have a peak; if you have a valley today, those resources are gone. During peak days, you will hear that the hospital is overcrowded and doesn\u2019t have beds, but needs more patients. Messages are being sent left and right to discharge. You hear, \u201cSleep faster, someone else needs your blanket.\u201d You cannot sleep faster. Even if you free up beds, patients are being discharged prematurely, and then the chances that the patient is readmitted increase.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t just theory. Research at Johns Hopkins Hospital revealed that unplanned readmissions to the neurosciences ICU and readmissions risk increased dramatically for patients discharged as a result of increased admissions to the ICU. This study shows that expediting discharges is not the right way to manage peaks in admissions; unnecessary peaks in scheduled admissions need to be addressed directly. Further research has shown that excessive patient demand for nurses during peaks in hospital census has a significant impact on readmissions, and hospitals with higher nurse staffing had 25 percent lower odds of being penalized compared to otherwise similar hospitals with lower staffing.\n\nEugene Litvak, Ph.D.\n\nSo what can hospitals do to better manage this problem?\n\nOne possible solution is to provide more nurses for these peaks. However, no one can afford to do that. And the waste will be huge, because every time there is no peak, there will be waste. So that solution, while it sounds great, is not feasible.\n\nThe second solution, and this is at core of what we\u2019re doing, is to ask the question, \u201cWhy do we have these peaks and valleys in first place?\u201d Well, patients break legs and come to the hospital, and we don\u2019t have the power to change that. The main contributor to availability in bed occupancy is not patients coming into the ER, but patients being admitted electively. I know that sounds counter intuitive, but elective admissions get scheduled based on doctors\u2019 preferences. For example, if I\u2019m a surgeon and I want to operate today, I will, because it\u2019s my decision. If you and I are heavy-volume surgeons, and we have our block time, or the operating room is available to us on the same day, you have a huge patient volume come into the hospital. Given that those patients are privately insured, they will always get beds.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde86a\"", "article_summary": "In an effort to lower avoidable readmissions, many patient care organizations have been implementing post-discharge planning programs, ranging from telehealth initiatives to follow-up care plans to patient engagement strategies.\nDr. Litvak recently spoke with HCI Associate Editor Rajiv Leventhal about what else hospitals could be doing to lower readmissions, and the most significant elements that came out of the Kaiser Health News report.\nThis study shows that expediting discharges is not the right way to manage peaks in admissions; unnecessary peaks in scheduled admissions need to be addressed directly.\nMost hospitals concentrate on the patient\u2019s exit from the hospital, and properly, so long as the patient gets all of the necessary information when leaving.\nWhat I disagree with is that hospitals are missing the elephant in the room."}
