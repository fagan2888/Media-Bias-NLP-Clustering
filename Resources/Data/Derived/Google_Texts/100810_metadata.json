They say they were terminated because they were trying to form an independent union. The company says they were fired because they caused a \u201cworkplace disruption.\u201d Now, the workers protest by occupying a makeshift shack outside the factory, still advocating for a raise and for a union, even though they no longer have jobs. Outside, a spray-painted banner reads \u201cJusticia A La Clase Obrera\u201d meaning \u201cJustice for the Working Class.\u201d Inside, a wood stove burns as they make coffee and cook tortillas and wait for someone to hear what they have to say. \u201cWe are hungry. Our children are hungry,\u201d Blanca Estella Moya, one of the fired workers, tells me. \u201cYou cannot live on these wages in Juarez.\u201d More From Our Partners Where Is All the World\u2019s Money Going?\n\nRevisiting a Jim Crow-Era Guide for Traveling While Black\n\nThe Unfair Opacity of Credit Cards Peddled to the Poor In the Lexmark maquiladora, or factory, Moya made 112 pesos, or roughly six U.S. dollars, a day. Her shifts were nine-and-a-half hours long, her lawyer, Susana Prieto Terrazas, says. That\u2019s about 39 cents an hour. That wage is a legal one in Mexico, but Terrazas argues it shouldn\u2019t be. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to live on these wages. It\u2019s not human,\u201d said Terrazas, who has dark, curly, dyed-red hair, and was wearing a plaid checkered blouse and jeans. \u201cThey are creating generations of slaves.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Lexmark: Workers at Mexican subsidiaries of FoxConn, Eaton, and CommScope in Juarez have all protested working conditions and compensation in recent months. Women tell of sexual harassment at the factories and of working multiple shifts to make ends meet. The devaluation of the peso has meant their money buys less than it once did. The protests come at an inopportune moment for Mexico. Many companies, especially automakers, are moving production to Mexico after deciding that the costs and logistical headaches of manufacturing in Asia are too great to bear. Mexico is trying to welcome them with open arms. But workers, especially those on the border, aren\u2019t making that easy. \u201cThis is a historic thing that\u2019s happening here. In 50 years, there hasn\u2019t been this level of labor discontent,\u201d says Oscar Martinez, a professor at the University of Arizona who spends time in Juarez and has written numerous books on the border, including Border People: Life and Society in the U.S.-Mexico Borderlands. \u201cWe could be seeing the beginning of a larger movement that spreads to other parts of Mexico and challenges the whole system that has been created for these multinationals.\u201d The protests come at an inopportune moment for the U.S. as well. When Congress gets around to debating the Trans Pacific Partnership, it will surely look at NAFTA and the promises that treaty made for American and Mexican workers. The situation of the workers in Juarez makes it clear that NAFTA didn\u2019t improve conditions as promised, and implies that TPP won\u2019t work, either, said Cathy Feingold, the director of the International Department at the AFL-CIO. In addition, with little hope for U.S. immigration reform, the U.S. will have to recognize that it creates its own migration problems by allowing companies to treat workers so poorly just across the border, she said. When workers can\u2019t make a decent wage in their own country, they\u2019ll try to cross the border, she said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have an economy that\u2019s this out of whack. It\u2019s just not good for business,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you have a global economy that\u2019s this unequal, you have insecurity, and you have people moving for better opportunities.\u201d Other factors may continue to draw attention to the issue in upcoming months. The pope is visiting Juarez on February 17th, and many hope he will speak there about economic inequality, and perhaps specifically about the factory workers. There are elections in Juarez and the state it sits in, Chihuahua, later this year, putting additional pressure on politicians to address the concerns of the 250,000 factory workers of Juarez. \u201cIt\u2019s this perfect moment for really highlighting the intersection of failed trade policies, increased poverty, and then migration on the border,\u201d Feingold said. \u200b* * * The maquiladoras, or border factories, have been around for more than 50 years. In 1965, after the U.S. ended the Bracero program, which had allowed Mexican laborers to work seasonally in the U.S., the Mexican government created the Border Industrialization Program. It essentially allowed foreign-owned (typically this meant American) companies to set up factories on the Mexican side of the border, import tariff-free raw goods for manufacturing and then export the finished products, employing low-cost Mexican workers along the way. The number of factories in border areas such as Juarez and Tijuana boomed in the 1980s, as U.S. companies facing wage competition from China saw Mexico as an easy option. There are now about 330 maquiladoras in Juarez alone, according to the Borderplex Alliance. When NAFTA was ratified 1995, it opened the potential for companies to open factories anywhere in Mexico and still avoid tariffs, said Tony Payan, the director of the Mexico Center at Rice University. Regions across Mexico built up their roads, their airports, and their railways, and foreign companies began to realize that they could locate their factories throughout much of Mexico just as easily as they could on the border.\n\nThat\u2019s led to downward pressure on wages. Indeed, while workers in countries such as China, Brazil, and Russia have seen wage increases in recent years, Mexican workers have seen almost no change. In 2011, hourly wages in China surpassed those in Mexico; now they\u2019re 40 percent higher, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The Juarez workers have suffered the most as factories there competed with others throughout Mexico for business. The average monthly wage for production workers in Juarez was $422 a month in December of 2014, compared to $582 a month for all Mexican workers, according to a report from the Hunt Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Texas at El Paso. But, while the wage for Juarez production workers was the lowest out of all the regions surveyed, the wage for managers was the highest, at $2,238 a month, compared to $2,045 for all Mexico, the Hunt Institute found. Average Monthly Wages at Export-Oriented Manufacturing Firms in Juarez by Region, in U.S. Dollars The wage disparity is likely because many managers in the Juarez maquiladoras live in El Paso, and thus require higher salaries, and also because factories needed to pay a premium to attract managers during a violent period between 2008 and 2011, when tens of thousands of people in the region were killed, said Patrick Schaefer, the director of the Hunt Institute. In addition, the Juarez/El Paso region, called Paseo del Norte, is traditionally a magnet for migrants from Mexico and Central America who are heading north for a better life, creating a pool of low-skilled workers who compete for manufacturing jobs. \u201cThese are products produced by people who are a couple steps above wage slavery,\u201d said Kathy Staudt, a professor at the University of Texas at El Paso who has worked with a binational workers group, the Social Justice Education Forum, which is advocating for the striking workers. \u201cIt should bother people who have a conscience, but I think too many people don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe Lexmark workers decided to try and form a union because they wanted better working conditions. Blanca Estella Moya, for example, was responsible for putting metal parts in a plastic cartridge, a job that made her wrists sore and caused tendonitis, according to Terrazas. The machine she worked with constantly broke, she says, and supervisors were unsympathetic, expecting her to continue to produce 1,700 parts a day, even with a broken machine. The workers called one manager \u201cThe Dog\u201d because of his record of sexual harassment, according to Terrazas. When coworkers asked Moya if she wanted to join a group advocating for better working conditions, she said she was interested. Her husband works in construction, and together they make about 28,000 pesos a month\u2014about $1,500 dollars. Families in Juarez need about 58,000 a month in order to buy the basics to survive, Terrazas, the lawyer, says. Moya has five children, three of whom live with her, and she also provides for her grandson. Her family often needs to get loans just to pay the rent, and, like many other families working at the maquiladoras, they steal electricity and water because they can\u2019t afford to pay for it. At first, the company said orally that they would give workers the 35-cent raise they\u2019d been asking for, Moya said. Then, they reneged on that, Terrazas, the lawyer said. When the workers came to her asking what they could do, she explained there was very little recourse. All they could do, she said, was join an independent union and try to advocate for better pay. When I asked Lexmark about this version of events and other questions about wages and working conditions in Juarez, they insisted on getting written questions rather than talking on the phone. They then declined to answer most of the questions I sent. \u201cWe meet or exceed the standards of all laws for manufacturing facilities in Juarez, Mexico,\u201d Jerry Grasso, the vice president of corporate communications at Lexmark International wrote, in response to one question, the only of six that he agreed to answer. (He later followed up to answer another question about why the workers were fired by specifying that they were \u201clet go for workplace disruption in our Juarez plant.\u201d)\n\nA 35-cent raise may seem like a pittance for a company with billions in revenue, but Lexmark may feel squeezed by falling profits. In October, the company reported lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings, which have fallen from $350 million in 2010 to $79 million in 2014, according to Lexmark\u2019s annual report. A representative for Foxconn gave a more detailed response, writing that Foxconn\u2019s Mexican subsidiary pays wages that are \u201cin excess of statutory requirements\u201d and benefits that are competitive with peer businesses. It holds salary reviews and performance reviews frequently, according to a statement sent to me from a PR firm representing Foxconn Technology Group. \u201cIt is unfortunate that a small number of the company\u2019s employees have chosen to try to disrupt its operations to promote their personal agendas outside of the law and the approved and recognized company channels of communication,\u201d the statement said. * * * Technically, there are unions in Mexico. But they\u2019re not unions in the American sense of the word, according to Feingold, the AFL-CIO International director. Most so-called unions are what the AFL-CIO calls protection contracts, which are essentially collective-bargaining contracts signed between an employer and an employer-backed union, often without the knowledge of the workers. Only about 1 percent of the workforce in Mexico is organized in independent unions that give more of a voice than protection contracts, she said. Protection contracts are hard to change because they are created between private companies and unions that purport to represent workers, Feingold said. Mexican labor laws protect the unions that sign the protection contracts, said Staudt, the UTEP professor, even if they don\u2019t protect the workers. At a meeting of labor ministers of the Americas in Cancun last month, Mexican representatives said they were interested in making sure that workers had better working conditions. But the government has not seemed interested in helping effect change for the Juarez workers, Terrazas said. On December 30, representing the workers, she went to the \ufefflocal labor authority, the Conciliation and Arbitration Board, and filled out the paperwork to form an independent union. The request was denied, she said, because the labor board said the workers did not establish the conditions needed for a union, such as an official union building and fundraising committee. The workers presented their position for a second time on January 2 and are now waiting for a second decision.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Labor unrest is spreading through the factories on the border, where people say they deserve more than $6 a day.", "author": "Alana Semuels", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Labor unrest is spreading through the factories on the border, where people say they deserve more than $6 a day.", "title": "Upheaval in the Factories of Juarez", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/01/24_image/facebook.jpg?1453396129", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/01/upheaval-in-the-factories-of-juarez/424893/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "But the government has not seemed interested in helping effect change for the Juarez workers, Terrazas said.\nThe Juarez workers have suffered the most as factories there competed with others throughout Mexico for business.\n\u200b* * * The maquiladoras, or border factories, have been around for more than 50 years.\nThere are elections in Juarez and the state it sits in, Chihuahua, later this year, putting additional pressure on politicians to address the concerns of the 250,000 factory workers of Juarez.\nThe number of factories in border areas such as Juarez and Tijuana boomed in the 1980s, as U.S. companies facing wage competition from China saw Mexico as an easy option."}
