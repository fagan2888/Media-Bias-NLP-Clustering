And he hit President Obama and John Kerry on their \u201cweak\u201d foreign policy. He mocked former New York governor George Pataki for raising \u201czero money.\" And he criticized former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for accepting donations from millionaires and billionaires.\n\nBut nowhere in his 60-minute stump speech to an estimated 10,000 people gathered at the Knoxville Convention Center was any mention of his less-theatrical foil Ben Carson, who has emerged as his chief rival for front-runner status in national polls. That was a drastic change in tune since last week when Trump ignited critics when, during a highly unusual 95-minute speech in Fort Dodge, Iowa, he called Carson's biography into question and said he has a \"pathological disease.\"\n\n\"A child molester, there's no cure for that,\" Trump told the Iowa crowd Thursday, which grew quiet as the attacks became more personal. \"If you're a child molester, there's no cure. They can't stop you. Pathological? There's no cure.\"\n\n[Donald Trump begs Iowans not to believe Ben Carson: \u2018Don\u2019t be fools, okay?]\n\nTrump toned down his attacks against all his rivals Monday \u2014 but in particular Carson \u2014 instead homing in on Obama and Clinton, tying their foreign policy approach to the terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday and criticizing the administration for its plans to accept Syrian refugees displaced by their country\u2019s bloody civil war.\n\n\u201cWe have a president that wants to take hundreds of thousands of people and move them into our country. And we don\u2019t even know who they are,\u201d said Trump, eliciting huge boos. \u201cThere\u2019s no paperwork. There\u2019s no anything. And all they have to do is look at the Web site for Obamacare to know we\u2019re never going to figure it out.\u201d\n\n(For its part, the administration has said it will accept as many as 10,000 refugees in the next year and will require a screening process.)\n\nBut although the flamboyant businessman showcased the unique brand of political discipline he has honed since he announced his White House bid in June, he was at no risk of being boring or traditional.\n\n\"I predicted Osama bin Laden,\" Trump told the energetic crowd. \u201cIn my book, I predicted terrorism. Because I can feel it. I can feel it like a good location.\"\n\nThe real estate mogul also repeated his previous suggestion to build a \"safe zone\" in Syria for the would-be refugees rather than allowing them to emigrate to various different countries: \u201cWhat I like is: build a safe zone in Syria. Build a big, beautiful safe zone. And you have whatever it is so people can live, and they\u2019ll be happier,\" Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019ll cost you tremendously much less, much less, and they\u2019ll be there and the weather\u2019s the same.\"\n\nIn another instance, he cited the attacks in Paris to speak about his support for the Second Amendment.\n\n[With torrent of attacks, Donald Trump moves back into center of race.]\n\n\u201cLet me give you an example: France, they have a horrible attack \u2014 and by the way Paris is one of the places in the world that\u2019s toughest on guns,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you had all of these people sitting in this different places, no protection whatsoever, there was nothing they could do. I know in this room that\u2019s a different story.\u201d\n\nTrump also recycled one of his most forceful applause lines from Thursday on how he would handle the Islamic State terrorist organization:\n\n\u201cSomebody criticized me the other day because they asked me what I\u2019m gonna do,\u201d he recounted. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m going to bomb the s--t out of them.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nowhere in his 60-minute stump speech to an estimated 10,000 people was any mention of Carson, who has emerged as Trump's chief rival for front-runner status.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jdelreal/", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Nowhere in his 60-minute stump speech to an estimated 10,000 people was any mention of Carson, who has emerged as Trump's chief rival for front-runner status.", "title": "Something was missing from Donald Trump\u2019s stump speech Monday night.
