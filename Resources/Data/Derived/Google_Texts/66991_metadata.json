Robert Bentley, R-Ala., ordered that the state end its Medicaid contract with Planned Parenthood after the Center for Medical Progress released a series of undercover videos that raised allegations that the organization is trafficking the body parts of aborted babies. The most recent video was released on Tuesday.\n\nProfiting from the sale of human organs\u2014including those of the unborn\u2014is a felony in the United States.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has denied illegal conduct, and recently announced it will no longer accept \u201creimbursement\u201d for donations of aborted babies\u2019 body parts to researchers.\n\nAccording to the AP, U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson issued a preliminary injunction on Wednesday that temporarily prevented Bentley and the state of Alabama from ending Medicaid contracts with Planned Parenthood, arguing that ending the contracts \u201clikely violated a free-choice-of-provider provision of the federal Medicaid Act.\u201d\n\nIn a recent op-ed, Sarah Torre, a policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, called the argument that defunding Planned Parenthood \u201ccould run afoul\u201d of the Medicaid statute \u201cflawed.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood does not have a right to the hard-earned money of American taxpayers,\u201d Torre wrote.\n\nIn a statement, Bentley said:\n\n\u201cFor the last two months, Alabama has denied payment to Planned Parenthood Southeast. The good news is that as a result of the strong opposition by Alabama and a few other states to the practice of accepting reimbursement for harvesting fetal organs, the national Planned Parenthood organization has changed course and will no longer continue this deplorable practice. I am disappointed, and vehemently disagree with the court\u2019s ruling today. We are reviewing the opinion and will determine the next legal steps within the appeal period.\u201d\n\nStaci Fox, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast, told the AP, \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a victory for the women who rely on Planned Parenthood for quality, compassionate affordable health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that Governor Bentley is trying to take care away from women and families in our communities who need it the most,\u201d Fox added.\n\nRep. Martha Roby, R-Ala., criticized the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cNo taxpayer should be forced to fund an organization that aborts more than 350,000 unborn babies every year, and no state should be forced to contract services through the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider,\u201d Roby said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why my pro-life colleagues and I in Congress must fight to make sure states like Alabama have the legal tools necessary to sever contracts with Planned Parenthood or any organization that performs abortions,\u201d she added.\n\nRoby also encouraged the Senate to consider the Women\u2019s Public Health and Safety Act, which was passed by the House earlier this month and would allow states to terminate Medicaid contracts with Planned Parenthood or other abortion providers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal judge has temporarily blocked Alabama from terminating Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood on Wednesday, the Associated Press reported.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A federal judge has temporarily blocked Alabama from terminating Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood on Wednesday, the Associated Press reported.", "title": "Federal Judge Temporarily Blocks Alabama From Defunding Planned Parenthood", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151029_AlabamaPP_Scanlon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NaUAft"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A federal judge has temporarily blocked Alabama from terminating Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood on Wednesday, the Associated Press reported.", "title": "Federal Judge Temporarily Blocks Alabama From Defunding Planned Parenthood", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151029_AlabamaPP_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-10-29T15:58:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Alabama, Robert Bentley, Planned Parenthood Southeast, Planned Parenthood videos, Center for Medical Progress, prolife, pro-life"}, "article_summary": "A federal judge has temporarily blocked Alabama from terminating Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood on Wednesday, the Associated Press reported.\nIn a statement, Bentley said:\u201cFor the last two months, Alabama has denied payment to Planned Parenthood Southeast.\nPlanned Parenthood has denied illegal conduct, and recently announced it will no longer accept \u201creimbursement\u201d for donations of aborted babies\u2019 body parts to researchers.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why my pro-life colleagues and I in Congress must fight to make sure states like Alabama have the legal tools necessary to sever contracts with Planned Parenthood or any organization that performs abortions,\u201d she added.\nRoby also encouraged the Senate to consider the Women\u2019s Public Health and Safety Act, which was passed by the House earlier this month and would allow states to terminate Medicaid contracts with Planned Parenthood or other abortion providers."}
