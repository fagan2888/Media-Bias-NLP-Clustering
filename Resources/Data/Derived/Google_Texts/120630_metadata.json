Ted Cruz (Photo: U.S. Senate Photographic Studio-Frank Fey, U.S. Senate Photographic Studio-Frank Fey)\n\nName:\n\nRafael Edward \"Ted\" Cruz\n\nBirth date:\n\nDec. 22, 1970\n\nEducation:\n\nBachelor's degree, public policy, 1992, Princeton University.\n\nLaw degree, 1995, Harvard Law School.\n\nFamily:\n\nWife: Heidi, managing director at Goldman Sachs.\n\nTwo children: Caroline and Catherine.\n\nCurrent home: Houston, Texas.\n\nWebsites:\n\nTedcruz.org\n\nCruz.Senate.gov\n\nTwitter.com/Tedcruz\n\nTwitter.com/SenTedCruz\n\nFacebook.com/SenatorTedCruz\n\nFacebook.com/tedcruzpage\n\nElective office:\n\nU.S. senator representing Texas, 2013-present: He won the open Senate seat vacated by retiring Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison after beating the favored candidate, Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, in a GOP primary runoff election. His victory has been called the biggest upset of the 2012 election cycle.\n\nOther career highlights:\n\nWas a law clerk for then-U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist.\n\nWas the first Latino solicitor general of Texas.\n\nDuring his time as solicitor general and in private practice, he authored 80 U.S. Supreme Court briefs and argued nine oral arguments before the High Court.\n\nWorked at the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Justice during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nWas a policy adviser to Bush's 2000 presidential campaign.\n\nKey Iowa allies:\n\nBryan English, long-serving conservative activist in Iowa. Serving as state director of Cruz campaign.\n\nJeff Roe, Missouri-based political consultant; worked on Mike Huckabee's 2008 campaign. Serving as campaign manager.\n\nMatt Schultz, former Iowa Secretary of State and current Madison County attorney. Serving as campaign chair.\n\nSteve Deace, talk radio host\n\nKnown for:\n\nHis sharp conservatism, his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, his intelligence and his rhetorical skills as a lawyer who has argued many cases in front of the nation's highest courts.\n\nSpoke from the Senate floor for 21 hours in September 2013 in a move that had no procedural effect but brought national attention to his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, the health care law also known as Obamacare.\n\nCruz and his hard-line opposition to the Affordable Care Act were also at the center of the political stalemate that led to a two-week government shutdown in late 2013. When the government reopened, Democrats and Republicans alike blamed Cruz for the shutdown, although many agreed he was not politically damaged by the incident.\n\nCruz was the first candidate from either party to jump into the 2016 presidential race. Cruz formally announced his candidacy on March 23, 2015.\n\nTop issues:\n\nRepealing Obamacare: Cruz has made \"repealing every word of Obamacare\" a cornerstone of his stump speeches and campaign. Barring a full repeal of the health care law, Cruz has said states should be given the choice whether to opt into the system.\n\nTax reform: Cruz has called for abolishing the Internal Revenue Service and installing a flat tax. He has said the tax system should be simple enough that Americans can fill out their taxes on a postcard.\n\nReligious liberty: Cruz has said a radicalized left is attacking freedom of religion in the U.S. and has generally criticized members of his own party for backing down from supporting religious rights. He has also disparaged the Supreme Court decision that permits same-sex marriage across the United States.\n\nThings you might not know:\n\nCruz's father, Rafael Cruz, is an immigrant from Cuba who fled the 1959 revolution there and is now an evangelical pastor who often appears as a speaker at social conservative political events.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1IIy1bK", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A profile on Rafael Edward \"Ted\" Cruz", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "A profile on Rafael Edward \"Ted\" Cruz", "title": "Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/candidates/2015/01/13/ted-cruz-iowa-caucus-candidate-profile/20169965/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A profile on Rafael Edward \"Ted\" Cruz", "title": "Ted Cruz", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a7d3845f3dfbcd52f3a98ced8ba5e67c1658bbbd/c=0-0-1998-1998&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/01/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635564946542706375-TedCruzOfficialPortrait.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/Goldman Sachs Group", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Companies/Goldman Sachs Group", "title": "Ted Cruz", "author": "Register staff", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/elections/presidential/candidates", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c1cf45c6bb81af522161b1bd82c62ab0d17c75b/c=62-0-1937-2500/local/-/media/2015/01/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635564946542706375-TedCruzOfficialPortrait.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb1f40d3408422bfd5ae4deef37b630d8ccf4359/c=0-0-1998-1998/local/-/media/2015/01/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635564946542706375-TedCruzOfficialPortrait.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/36dc88dcc75d47150c0964077e9c83f5e3dc41a3/c=0-102-1998-1604/local/-/media/2015/01/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635564946542706375-TedCruzOfficialPortrait.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c213c75549964ff41363faef55f2babf48667629/c=0-116-1998-1245&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/01/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635564946542706375-TedCruzOfficialPortrait.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-09-09T18:31:19.030000-05:00", "shorthed": "Caucus bio: Ted Cruz", "articleid": 20169965, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1b81e93a4a735a8f4a8c13ef870a7d8137eb14dd/c=0-116-1998-1245/local/-/media/2015/01/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635564946542706375-TedCruzOfficialPortrait.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e653c68228d2f137c6289e003bed31a037f0befb/c=242-0-1642-2500/local/-/media/2015/01/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635564946542706375-TedCruzOfficialPortrait.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd73e1\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
