A Marine sniper veteran featured in a local California News series was shot multiple times early Friday.

Brandon Del Fiorentino, a 32-year-old, Purple Heart recipient was found near a golf course in Antioch, Calif., when Police responded to a report of gunfire, the Contra Costa Times reported Saturday.

Police said Mr. Del Fiorentino was taken to a hospital, where he was in serious condition but expected to survive.

Mr. Del Fiorentino was previously profiled by the Contra Costa Times, in a series that captured his military service and his struggles upon returning home to a cramped house he shared with his grandmother.

He was awarded the Purple Heart for his service in Iraq. An explosive detonated by insurgents threw Mr. Del Fiorentino from a Humvee, causing major head injuries. He continued to struggle with back and spine injuries and post-traumatic stress syndrome after his return home.

In June 2012, a military support foundation, “Homes 4 Wounded Heroes,” moved him and his wide and two children into their 2,719-square-foot Antioch home, according to the newspaper.

The home is just three blocks from where Mr. Del Fiorentino was shot.

No arrests had been made as of Friday night. Police said they are trying to determine whether there was one gunman or multiple shooters.
