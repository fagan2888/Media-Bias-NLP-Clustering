Bush years, was raised 23.8 percent under President Obama, and Mrs. Clinton would jack up the rate to as high as 42 percent \u2014 with the rate falling the longer the asset is held.\n\n\u201cThis is the worst economic idea of I\u2019ve heard in years,\u201d marvels Larry Kudlow of CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s a wrecking ball to the economy.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan reveals such a deep an disturbing ignorance of the effects of the capital gains tax and its impact on growth that it\u2019s time to bust some of the key myths about ow this tax affects the economy:\n\n1. The tax on capital gains income is much lower than the tax on wages and salaries of the working class.\n\nMrs. Clinton says she would merely tax income from capital at the same rate as middle class Americans have taken from their paychecks. She would tax capital gains as ordinary income for those who make over about $450,000 a year. But this would make taxes on capital income punitive and here\u2019s why. First, most capital gains come from the sale of financial assets like stock. But publicly held companies have to pay corporate income tax at a rate of 35 percent. Capital gains is a second tax on that income when the stock is sold. So the actual tax rate on capital gains income is closer to 40-50 percent and Mrs. Clinton would raise that to 60 percent.\n\nSecond, capital gains is a tax on the increase of the valuation of a stock, but is not adjusted for inflation. So when inflation is high, the capital \u201cgain\u201d can be mostly due to inflation. In other words the gain can be illusory and the tax rate can even rise above 100 percent.\n\nFinally, although we require investors to pay tax on all of their capital gains, they only get to deduct a small share of their losses. So this skews the tax code against risk taking.\n\n2. Raising the capital gains tax will raise billions of dollars for the government.\n\nThe Hillary plan is almost all pain with no gain. It\u2019s highly unlikely the tax hike will raise any money for the Treasury and if history is a guide it will lose revenue. After the capital gains tax hike in 1986 from 20 percent to 28 percent, capital gains revenues actually fell from $44 billion a year to $27 billion a year by 1991. After Bill Clinton cut the capital gains tax down to 20% again, capital gains revenues surged from $54 billion in 1996 to $99 billion in 1999. Lower rates, more revenues.\n\n3. Raising the capital gains tax is a good way to make the rich pay their \u201cfair share\u201d of taxes.\n\nDespite Mrs. Clinton\u2019s assurances that her plan is meant to discourage \u201cshort termism\u201d in the boardroom, the real agenda here is hardly a secret: she wants to sock it to the rich. But the irony of this is it won\u2019t hurt the Warren Buffett\u2019s and the Wall Street hedge fund managers much. They might have to pay a higher tax bill \u2014 but more likely they will simply hold on to their stock longer to avoid the higher tax penalty. But the people who will get hurt are the middle class, minorities, and young people \u2014 the same group that has been clobbered during this so-called recovery.\n\nWages rise when workers can produce more, and they can produce more when they get smarter, better trained, and have more capital to work with. A tax on capital is thus an invisible tax on wages. When Ronald Reagan and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s husband Bill Clinton cut the capital gains tax, wages and productivity surged.\n\n4. Raising capital gains taxes won\u2019t reduce investment.\n\nMrs. Clinton herself says that businesses aren\u2019t investing enough \u2014 and she\u2019s right \u2014 so it\u2019s a head scratcher that she has come to believe that more investment will come from higher tax rates on investment. Back in the 1980s even Democrats like Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt appreciated that high tax rates have a negative effect on the economy. Then in the last decade the orthodoxy on the left became tax rates don\u2019t matter at all. Now they think higher tax rates are good for us \u2014 which may explain why Bernard Sanders of Vermont wants a 70 percent tax rate on the rich.\n\nFor at least 40 years, funding for venture capital in new enterprises, and the rate of new business start ups has been inversely related to capital gains taxes. The higher the penalty on risk capital, the fewer new entrepreneurial ventures get started. If we want to accelerate the next generation of Ubers, Groupons, Home Depots, and Googles, we need investors willing to put their money at risk and if they are going to be taxed at 50 or 60 percent, they are more likely to take a pass.\n\n5) Raising the capital gains tax will help the economy.\n\nThe American Council for Capital Formation finds that the Hillary Rodham Clinton plan would raise the capital gains tax to nearly the highest in the industrial world. The U.S. already has the highest corporate tax rate in the world, so this would be a double whammy. The Tax Foundation finds that bang for the buck, lowering the capital gains tax rate is one of the most pro-growth measures Congress could adopt. The optimal capital gains tax is zero.\n\nBy contrast, raising the capital gains rate will hurt small businesses, workers, and American competitiveness \u2014 and it won\u2019t raise any money. How this is fair, is beyond me.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Moore is a Fox News commentator and an economics contributor to Freedom Works.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The late, great Jack Kemp, an architect of the Reagan tax cuts, used to say \"without capital, capitalism is just another ism.\" Capital is the plant, the machinery, the computers, and trucks that businesses invest in to become productive and efficient providers of goods and services.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The late, great Jack Kemp, an architect of the Reagan tax cuts, used to say \u201cwithout capital, capitalism is just another ism.\u201d Capital is the plant, the machinery, the computers, and trucks that businesses invest in to become productive and efficient providers of goods and services.", "title": "STEPHEN MOORE: Five myths about capital gains taxes", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/2/stephen-moore-five-myths-about-capital-gains-taxes/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/02/8_2_2015_b1-moore8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/02/8_2_2015_b1-moore8201.jpg", "description": "The late, great Jack Kemp, an architect of the Reagan tax cuts, used to say \"without capital, capitalism is just another ism.\" Capital is the plant, the machinery, the computers, and trucks that busin", "card": "summary", "title": "STEPHEN MOORE: Five myths about capital gains taxes"}, "Author": "Stephen Moore", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Business Finance, Politics, Hillary Rodham Clinton"}, "article_summary": "After the capital gains tax hike in 1986 from 20 percent to 28 percent, capital gains revenues actually fell from $44 billion a year to $27 billion a year by 1991.\nAfter Bill Clinton cut the capital gains tax down to 20% again, capital gains revenues surged from $54 billion in 1996 to $99 billion in 1999.\nThe tax on capital gains income is much lower than the tax on wages and salaries of the working class.\nRaising the capital gains tax is a good way to make the rich pay their \u201cfair share\u201d of taxes.\nThe Tax Foundation finds that bang for the buck, lowering the capital gains tax rate is one of the most pro-growth measures Congress could adopt."}
