Scott Walker responded to a recent dig against him by President Obama by saying Mr. Obama should spend more time trying to figure out how to work with other politicians and reiterating his criticism of ongoing negotiations over a deal on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\n\u201cThis is a president who should spend more time trying to figure out how to work with governors and members of Congress instead of attacking them,\u201d Mr. Walker said Wednesday evening on Fox News\u2019 \u201cHannity\u201d program.\n\n\u201cThis is a guy in the last year who called ISIS the jayvee squad, who called Yemen just last fall, his administration continues to call them a success story, who had a secretary of state under Hillary Clinton that gave Russia a reset button and then they ultimately went into the Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cThis is a guy who [has] the audacity to be talking about schooling anyone when it comes to foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe White House says it\u2019s not personal, but President Obama has gone after Mr. Walker recently by suggesting the governor needs to \u201cbone up\u201d on foreign policy in an interview with NPR and criticizing Mr. Walker for signing right-to-work legislation in the state.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s singling out Mr. Walker has offered the possible 2016 presidential candidate with somewhat of a head-to-head platform to hit back at the president \u2014 which he did again Wednesday evening. Mr. Walker has criticized Mr. Obama over the potential deal the administration is negotiating on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, saying he\u2019d immediately invalidate it if elected president.\n\nMr. Walker said the Iranians are not coming to the negotiating table \u201cout of the good nature of their hearts trying to push for world peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming to the table because they were being brought to their knees because of the sanctions from the United States and from our allies particularly in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd right at the time when they\u2019re working think about this kind of negotiation. We should have been saying here\u2019s the deal: you take it or if not we\u2019re going to go back to our allies and push for even stronger sanctions because we know they\u2019re working and the deal is you got to get out of terrorism and you got to prove you don\u2019t have any nuclear weapons and that\u2019s the only deal we\u2019re negotiating.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wisconsin Gov.
