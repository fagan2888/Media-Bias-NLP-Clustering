The first eight auctions brought in almost $3 billion in sales, according to the agency.\n\nEven so, the most recent lease sale was one of the least productive in years. In August, five companies spent only $22.7 million on drilling leases, the New York Times reported then, making it the smallest lease sale since 1986.\n\nEnergy analysts blamed the low turnout on declining crude oil prices, which are expected to remain low through next year.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management will hold a lease auction next March.", "description": "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management will hold a lease auction next March.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Devin Henry", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management will hold a lease auction next March.", "title": "Feds to auction up to 40 million acres in Gulf of Mexico for drilling", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/253439-feds-to-auction-up-to-40-million-acres-in-gulf-of-mexico-for", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/253439-feds-to-auction-up-to-40-million-acres-in-gulf-of-mexico-for", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-11T17:24-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Devin Henry", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "oil, Offshore oil drilling,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-11T17:24:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/253439-feds-to-auction-up-to-40-million-acres-in-gulf-of-mexico-for", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management will hold a lease auction next March.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds to auction up to 40 million acres in Gulf of Mexico for drilling"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds to auction up to 40 million acres in Gulf of Mexico for drilling"}, "article_summary": "The Obama administration will look to lease up to 40 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico for new offshore oil and gas drilling next year, officials announced Friday.\nEven so, the most recent lease sale was one of the least productive in years.\nIn August, five companies spent only $22.7 million on drilling leases, the New York Times reported then, making it the smallest lease sale since 1986.\nEnergy analysts blamed the low turnout on declining crude oil prices, which are expected to remain low through next year.\nThe space, off the coast of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, will be sold at an auction in New Orleans next March, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) said Friday."}
