Obama is also expected to discuss some of the problems with HealthCare.gov, the insurance marketplace that was supposed to work like the Massachusetts Connector.\n\n\u201cOur focus 24/7 right now is just on fixing this website, throwing everything we have at it,\u201d said Simas, who is a Taunton native and former aide to Governor Deval Patrick. \u201cThat\u2019s what the president\u2019s demanded, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials increasingly are citing the Massachusetts experience as an example of how consumers waited months before they enrolled in health care plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen they began their open enrollment period, a grand total of 123 people signed up during the first month of open enrollment in Massachusetts,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Friday. \u201cObviously, the pace of enrollments increased dramatically as it got closer to the deadline. We expect to see a similar trend in those enrollment figures related to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials expect to have the bugs cleared out of the system by the end of November. The enrollment deadline is March 31.\n\nObama\u2019s trip to Boston is part of a broader push to bolster public opinion and encourage people to sign up.\n\nWhite House and Cabinet officials are traveling to the 10 cities with the highest rates of uninsured. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack is going to Atlanta on Tuesday, and Cecilia Munoz, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, heads to Detroit Monday.\n\nWhile in Boston, Obama will attend a fund-raiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which raises money for House campaigns around the country. The fund-raiser, which will also include House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, will be at the Weston home of Alan Solomont, Obama\u2019s former ambassador to Spain.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "2.2.188624114", "eomportal-id": 1691377, "description": "President Obama is planning to travel to Boston on Wednesday to defend his mandatory health insurance program, a visit to the intellectual birthplace of the law as the White House attempts to recover from computer problems that have plagued the new marketplace website.
