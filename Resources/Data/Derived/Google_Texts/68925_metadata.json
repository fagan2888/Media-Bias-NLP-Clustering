The law sought new ideas for fixing the \"complex food code with jurisdiction spread between multiple departments and levels of government\" and addressing the \"growing movement to support locally sourced and community-based food production[.]\"\n\nThe law mandated a trio of listening sessions\u2014which recently wrapped up\u2014and opened up the process to public comments, which are expected to help the legislature's Economic Affairs Interim Committee draft a series of new reform bills next year.\n\nHB 630 provides a welcome opportunity for Montanans\u2014and those in other states\u2014to consider the ways that regulations can impede agricultural and food entrepreneurship. That problem is national in scope.\n\nMany Montanans appear pleased that the state may release its grip on their purses and plates.\n\n\u201cIf there was some kind of streamlining of regulations, that would have a real value in our business,\u201d said Eric Bergman, an organic vegetable, pork, and poultry farmer, in a recent Great Falls Tribune piece on the legislation.\n\nBut others have expressed reservations.\n\nMatt Kelley, a Montana health department director, \"expressed reservations about [an existing] law and any expansion that would add more products to the exemption,\" reports the Bozeman Daily Chronicle.\n\nWhile at least some of the conversation appears to revolve around Cottage Foods, according to a comprehensive 2013 report by Harvard Law School's Food Law & Policy Clinic, Montana already has a Cottage Food law on the books.\n\nThe fifty-state report, Cottage Food Laws in the United States, notes that Montana permits Cottage Food operations; allows a \"limited list\" of approve foods; has no \"registration, permit, or licensing requirements\"; has no dollar limit on sales; and is one of only three states with no labeling requirements.\n\nIn short, the Harvard report indicates Montana's Cottage Food law is already a reasonably good one. In looking to tweak the law, I'd love to see Montana increase the number and type of foods covered under the law. I'd also like to see the state implement some minimum, basic labeling requirements\u2014including requiring that the name and address of the producer and the list of all ingredients appear on any packaging. (And yes, note in that latter sentence that I'm suggesting adding a new food regulation.)\n\nBut beyond Cottage Foods, Montana has many areas where it can and should improve the regulatory climate in the state for agricultural and food entrepreneurs.\n\nFor example, Montana regulators have needlessly hindered poultry farmers in the state.\n\n\u201cChicken farmers, in particular in this state, were hard pressed getting started because we kept getting resistance from several different regulatory agencies,\" said Montana farmer Mark Rehder, in a 2013 Chronicle report. \"It makes it difficult for emerging farmers to get a foothold.\"\n\nAnd when farmers have tried to take advantage of federal rules that permit small poultry farmers to process their own chickens, Rehder told the Chronicle, the Montana Department of Livestock has scoffed at the federal rule.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Agriculture has told us to sue to get that recognized,\u201d Rehder said. \u201cIt's largely why there aren't any chicken farmers in the state.\u201d\n\nIn the same report, Montana rancher Jenny Sabo lamented that the Department of Livestock has actively opposed raw milk sales in the state.\n\nAnd Nate Brown, an organic farmer and dairyman, told the Chronicle that thanks to a tangled web of Department of Livestock licenses and permits (and related fees). Brown estimates he holds up to 20 licenses from the Department of Livestock alone.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Montana is looking to loosen some food regulations in the state.
