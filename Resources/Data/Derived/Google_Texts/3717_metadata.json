Along with the paltry enrollment numbers released this week, officials in a handful of states said those who had managed to sign up were generally older people with medical problems \u2014 those with the greatest incentives to get coverage.\n\nIt's unclear whether that will persist. Young, healthy people may be more inclined to procrastinate, especially given doubts about the law's technically flawed online signup system. They have until Dec. 15 to sign up if they want to be covered on Jan. 1.\n\nInsurers have warned that they need a wide range of people signing up for coverage because premiums paid by adults in the younger and healthier group, between 18 and 35, are needed to offset the cost of carrying older and sicker customers who typically generate far more in medical bills than they contribute in premiums.\n\nThe first set of enrollment data revealed that 106,000 people signed up for coverage nationwide, far short of the 500,000 initial sign-ups the Obama administration had expected. In states where officials discussed more detailed information, it also became apparent that the people who flocked to the exchanges after they opened Oct. 1 were those who were desperate for coverage.\n\nIn California, the state with the largest uninsured population, most of those who applied were older people with health problems. In Kentucky, nearly 3 of 4 enrollees were over 35. In Washington state, about 23 percent of enrollees were between 18 and 34. And in Ohio, groups helping with enrollment described many of those coming to them as older residents who lost their jobs and health coverage during the recession.\n\n\"They have been putting off treatment for a long time, just praying they live until they turn 65 and qualify for Medicare,\" said Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, which received federal grant money to help people establish coverage.\n\nJanelle Arevalo (R), an insurance agent with Sunshine Life and Health Advisors, makes a house call to sign up Sandra Berrios for an insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act on November 14, 2013 in Miami.

But that direction must shift.\n\nIn general, someone in his 60s uses $6 in health care services for every $1 tallied by someone in his 20s, said Nicole Kasabian Evans of the California Association of Health Plans. That makes younger adults a coveted group on industry balance sheets.\n\nIf those signing up trend to the elderly and sickly \"your insurance is going to cost more and that will discourage those younger people from coming in,\" warned Lisa Folberg, a vice president with the California Medical Association. Faced with steep prices, younger people could opt to pay a government fine rather than purchase coverage.\n\nThe potential for rising monthly premiums and higher policy deductibles is just one deterrent to convincing young people to sign up for coverage on the exchanges. The technological problems that have plagued the federal exchange, which is running in 36 states, and many state-run online marketplaces are slowing enrollment. And scattered reports of data breaches have the potential to scare off even more people.\n\nEfforts to attract adults younger than 35, often referred to as \"young invincibles,\" include multimillion dollar advertising campaigns, which have launched in several states.\n\nIn California, Peter Lee, director of the state-run health exchange, said his state's outreach effort taps social media, radio and TV ads, and events at churches, community centers and other venues. To emphasize the point, Covered California included a 27-year-old man who had signed up for coverage during its news conference this week. The focus aims to counter the current trend in the state. Lee described October enrollees in California as \"older people or people who have health conditions.\"\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius speaks about the Affordable Care Act during her visit to Community Health and Social Services Center (CHASS) Nov.r 15, 2013 in Detroit.

One targeting women combines the promise of free birth control pills with the notion of casual sex. Another ad shows women with a contraption made of alcohol shot glasses glued to an old snow ski. \"Saving money on flu shots leaves us more money for fun shots,\" the ad reads. The day the health exchange launched, male and female models wearing nothing but underwear and \"Get Covered\" signs passed out fliers on a downtown Denver street.\n\nIt's not clear whether the campaign is working. Colorado's exchange has yet to release a demographic breakdown of the 3,700 people who selected an individual policy last month.\n\n\"We are making an extra push to reach young adults, and we do expect they're going to take a lot of encouraging because they tend to wait until the last minute,\" said Myung Kim, spokeswoman for Colorado's exchange.\n\nIf such efforts fail and insurance companies end up with too many sick or expensive customers, they might need to increase premiums or eventually leave markets to avoid taking heavy financial losses.\n\n\"It's going to be very messy for the next couple of years, until we figure out who is buying insurance,\" said Glenn Melnick, director of the Center for Health Financing, Policy and Management at the University of Southern California. \"There are a lot of pieces of this that are just black boxes right now.\"\n\nAetna Chairman and chief executive Mark Bertolini said last month that it was \"incredibly important\" to get the exchange websites running properly because \"the younger, healthier people aren't going to give them more than one shot.\"", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "Young and healthy Americans are not signing up for the health exchange, sparking fears that premiums and deductibles will rise for others under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Premiums could rise if young Americans don't enroll", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/premiums-rise-young-americans-don-enroll-article-1.1519095", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1519093.1384614300!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/187987793.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "United States, California, Peter Lee, Colorado, Barack Obama", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.tags": "United States, California, Peter Lee, Colorado, Barack Obama", "news_keywords": "United States, California, Peter Lee, Colorado, Barack Obama", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-11-16T15:22:31", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/premiums-rise-young-americans-don-enroll-article-1.1519095", "parsely-title": "Premiums could rise if young Americans don't enroll", "sailthru.date": "2013-11-16T10:22:31-0500", "sailthru.title": "Premiums could rise if young Americans don't enroll", "nydn_section": "Politics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1519093.1384614300!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/187987793.jpg", "description": "Young and healthy Americans are not signing up for the health exchange, sparking fears that premiums and deductibles will rise for others under the Affordable Care Act.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Young and healthy Americans are not signing up for the health exchange, sparking fears that premiums and deductibles will rise for others under the Affordable Care Act.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Young and healthy Americans are not signing up for the health exchange, sparking fears that premiums and deductibles will rise for others under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Premiums could rise if young Americans don't enroll", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/premiums-rise-young-americans-don-enroll-article-1.1519095", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1519093.1384614300!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/187987793.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "sailthru.credits": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1519093.1384614300!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/187987793.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ea5\"", "article_summary": "The day the health exchange launched, male and female models wearing nothing but underwear and \"Get Covered\" signs passed out fliers on a downtown Denver street.\nYoung, healthy people may be more inclined to procrastinate, especially given doubts about the law's technically flawed online signup system.\nAnd in Ohio, groups helping with enrollment described many of those coming to them as older residents who lost their jobs and health coverage during the recession.\nIn California, the state with the largest uninsured population, most of those who applied were older people with health problems.\nThe potential for rising monthly premiums and higher policy deductibles is just one deterrent to convincing young people to sign up for coverage on the exchanges."}
