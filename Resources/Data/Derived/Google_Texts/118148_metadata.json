I\u2019ve long believed that one of the best ways to get people to care about the environment is to get them into it to see why it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nGiving more\n\nFamily members, including husband Steve Livingston and 21-year-old son James Tillman Bradley, say her love of nature also extends to supporting an array of local, regional and national conservation organizations.\n\nThey say she has donated tens of thousands of dollars over the years to groups such as Coastal Conservation League, The Nature Conservancy, The Birds of Prey Center, Sierra Club, East Cooper Land Trust and Keeper of the Wild, among others.\n\nKeeper of the Wild founder and Director Janet Kinser says Livingston has been helping her organization, which helps injured and orphaned mammals, for years.\n\nKinser says that if Livingston\u2019s annual paddle doesn\u2019t raise $2,000 for her group, Livingston will make up the difference out of her own pocket.\n\nIn fact, between her donations, reinvesting money into the business and paying her staff well (including annual Christmas bonuses), Livingston didn\u2019t actually pay herself until a year and a half ago. The only reason she did that was because she felt like she needed to start a nest egg for retirement.\n\nAdmittedly, Livingston says she was only able to not pay herself after she and husband Steve, who shares her love of nature, \u201ckind of made a pact to live off one (his) salary\u201d in the late 1990s. He made enough as city of Charleston\u2019s parks director, with oversight over projects that are now landmarks, such as Charleston Waterfront Park and the S.C. Aquarium, to support the family. He retired five years ago and is enjoying retirement by practicing fiddle and restoring old tractors.\n\n\u201cWe started a business at a time when I was working,\u201d he says. \u201cThe business was able to grow because she put money back into it \u2014 equipment, employees and training \u2014 along with supporting the nonprofit organizations that support the same missions we do.\u201d\n\nConnecting with nature\n\nThe intimate relationship that Kathie Livingston has had with nature all her life also has made her sensitive to tangible threats to it.\n\nHer biggest concern is climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge and it\u2019s happening. It was brought to my attention in 1970s when nobody believed it. I believe it\u2019s both natural and man-made and I believe we have got to do something as a people to curtail it,\u201d says Livingston, noting the impacts on wildlife.\n\nAmong the local signs of climate change, she notes, are \u201ccrazy tides.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe paddled in the parking lot (at Shem Creek) twice last year. The exponential high tides are flooding nesting areas that normally would have had their young develop. We\u2019ve noticed pelican drownings. We\u2019re seeing overwintering species that don\u2019t normally overwinter. The manatees hanging out longer.\u201d\n\nShe also notices that water temperatures continue to be warmer longer every year.\n\n\u201cToday is Oct. 23 and it\u2019s still 73 degrees in the water. I remember that in the past, we weren\u2019t able to do in-water instruction at Labor Day because the water was so chilly.\u201d\n\nYet she underscores an increasing theme of climate change: that it\u2019s not just about warming but the \u201cexponential of everything going,\u201d notably the severity of storms, droughts, fires, winds and temperatures.\n\nA Midwestern girl\n\nKathie Livingston is a native of the Midwest who quickly naturalized to her Lowcountry environs immediately after college.\n\nShe was born a Peacock (her maiden name), in Flint, Mich., in August 1962 and developed her love of nature while growing up on a farm in Indiana, where she regularly rode horses.\n\nShe attended the University of Michigan in the early 1980s with the desire to \u201csave the Earth.\u201d She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in natural resource planning with a minor in ecology.\n\nDespite having attention deficit disorder, which was not labeled at the time, she graduated in 1984 with honors. She helped support herself by playing guitar and singing.\n\nA first job at the Audubon Society\u2019s Francis Beidler Forest brought to her the South Carolina Lowcountry. It was a perfect launch for her.\n\n\u201cThat swamp, Beidler Forest, is very special and it just immersed me in the world I wanted to be in as a naturalist. I learned about the wetlands of South Carolina and decided this is exactly where I wanted to be,\u201d she recalls.\n\n\u201cBeing there was like getting a masters and doctorate, almost, by being immersed in that environment with Mike Dawson (the center\u2019s director) and Norman Brunswig (Audubon South Carolina director).\u201d\n\nFrom there, though, she went through a series of jobs, including the head park naturalist for the city of Charleston parks department where she eventually met and married Livingston in 1995.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know him for five years (while working for the city). When I first met him on a canoeing trip, it was like meeting the Wizard of Oz. He was the big dog on the porch.\u201d\n\nAfter \u201ca brief romance,\u201d they wed with Steve becoming the stepfather of Kathie\u2019s 3-year-old son, James Tillman Bradley.\n\nBirth of NAO\n\nThe marriage came at about the same time she was being transferred to the city\u2019s recreation department and when she started hearing the call of starting her own business.\n\nSteve and Kathie Livingston had searched and found a place to create their eventual homestead, a 12-acre \u201cin holding,\u201d or private tract, within the Francis Marion National Forest. Initially, the family lived in 460-square-foot cabin on the property as they studied the property for their eventual 3,000-square-foot home, built with plenty of sweat equity.\n\nLiving deep in the woods, where male bobcats can be heard fighting and owls have \u201choot-outs,\u201d further inspired Kathie to pursue her own path.\n\n\u201cAs an ecologist and naturalist, I wanted to get people in the wilderness to see the natural side of Charleston, for people to know there\u2019s more to Charleston than a beautiful city ... I wanted to get people into the national forest to horseback ride, kayak, canoe, hike and bike,\u201d recalls Livingston, noting that they had 16 horses.\n\nThey started by buying $3,000 worth of kayaks and using a 1986 Ford pick-up to haul a horse trailer and kayaks.\n\n\u201cWe realized really quick that kayaks don\u2019t have vet bills,\u201d says Livingston, of their eventual gravitation to paddling.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, we got a lot of laughs from competitors, but now we have over 130 kayak seats (single and tandem) and do canoes. We own 40 SUPs (stand-up paddleboards), and employ 25 people, of which three are full-time and year-round.\u201d\n\nExtended family\n\nLivingston feels fortunate to have staff members who not only share her devotion to a greater mission but who have backgrounds steeped in natural history.\n\nAmong them are long-time McClellanville residents Eddie Stroman and John Dupre, kayak guides in their 60s, who offer extra charm to adventurers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very lucky to have them,\u201d says Livingston, adding that her younger staff offer similarly interesting backgrounds. One young woman called for a job while hiking in Bolivia and is now considering a hike across Africa.\n\nA job of leading paddling and hiking trips isn\u2019t easy. From March to September, many work 70 to 80 hours a week, often seven days a week.\n\n\u201cA lot of the times during the season we have to ask ourselves when was the last day you had off? That\u2019s how busy we are. Our full-time people are incredible. They never ask for days off. We have to make ourselves take days off. Everybody is so dedicated and they care so much.\u201d\n\nPart of that work ethic involves consciously practicing \u201ckaizen,\u201d a Japanese practice that means \u201cchange for the best.\u201d So despite the long days, Livingston say some staffers will come in an hour or two before work, go on solo paddle, and meditate before actually working.\n\nThe hand-off\n\nAnother Eastern concept may be at work in Livingston\u2019s life and business: karma.\n\nNature Adventure Outfitters appears to have a life after Kathie and Steve decide to start exploring the world in retirement.\n\nHer son, James Tillman Bradley, wants to take it over and is studying small business entrepreneurship in preparation for it. He plans to continue her mission.\n\n\u201cHer passion for the environment has definitely rubbed off on me,\u201d says Bradley, adding that her compassion for the environment and wildlife also extends to people.\n\nReach David Quick at 937-5516 or dquick@postand courier.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Kathie Livingston spreads conservation message on paddling tours, Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The executive director of Audubon South Carolina calls Kathie Livingston a \u201cone-woman conservation enterprise,\u201d a description that she would probably be embarrassed about on many levels.", "title": "Kathie Livingston spreads conservation message on paddling tours", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20131109/131109415/kathie-livingston-spreads-conservation-message-on-paddling-tours", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20131109/PC12/131109415/AR/0/AR-131109415.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20131109/PC12/131109415/AR/0/AR-131109415.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The executive director of Audubon South Carolina calls Kathie Livingston a \u201cone-woman conservation enterprise,\u201d a description that she would probably be embarrassed about on many levels.", "title": "Kathie Livingston spreads conservation message on paddling tours", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20131109/PC12/131109415/AR/0/AR-131109415.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 131109415}}, "keywords": "Kathie Livingston spreads conservation message on paddling tours , Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-09T07:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2013-11-08T13:59:00Z", "author": "David Quick"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The executive director of Audubon South Carolina calls Kathie Livingston a \u201cone-woman conservation enterprise,\u201d a description that she would probably be embarrassed about on many levels."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3659\"", "article_summary": "The executive director of Audubon South Carolina calls Kathie Livingston a \u201cone-woman conservation enterprise,\u201d a description that she would probably be embarrassed about on many levels.\nSteve and Kathie Livingston had searched and found a place to create their eventual homestead, a 12-acre \u201cin holding,\u201d or private tract, within the Francis Marion National Forest.\nFor Livingston, creating Nature Adventure Outfitters 15 years ago was more about advancing the cause of conservation than anything else.\nA first job at the Audubon Society\u2019s Francis Beidler Forest brought to her the South Carolina Lowcountry.\nI learned about the wetlands of South Carolina and decided this is exactly where I wanted to be,\u201d she recalls."}
