They all are unnecessary. What we need instead are better anti-discrimination laws.\n\nWASHINGTON, April 5, 2015 \u2212 If sued, should a business that discriminates against gays be allowed to use religion to defend itself? The judicial analysis is not clear.\n\nBad or unnecessary laws are often passed in reaction to sensational or outrageous events. Such was the case in 1993, when Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). After two Native Americans in Oregon were fired from their jobs at a rehabilitation clinic because they had consumed the hallucinogenic cactus peyote, they were denied unemployment benefits. They sued the state, claiming that peyote was part of their religious culture. They lost. Outrage followed, and the law was enacted as a remedy, specifically envisioning that it would address the rights of minority religions.\n\nThe 1993 law provided that \u201cthe government [emphasis added] shall not substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion.\u201d In order to \u201cburden\u201d \u2212 meaning the government can impose on an individual\u2019s religious beliefs \u2212 the specific burden must be necessary for the \u201cfurtherance of a compelling government interest.\u201d A compelling interest relates directly to core constitutional issues. If a law does burden, it can only do so in the least restrictive way possible in order to further the government interest.\n\nNot needed.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution already provides all of the protections for religious freedom that are needed, particularly when these protections are coupled with anti-discrimination laws.\n\nNonetheless, over the last 22 years, 19 states have followed that lead by enacting laws similar to the 1993 federal law. The gist of these laws is to assure that in carrying out its work, the government does not prohibit the practice of individual religious beliefs. Stated in another manner, these laws were designed to provide protection for the practice of religion undeterred by government policy.\n\nEnter Indiana, which recently became the 20th state to fashion a \u201creligious freedom\u201d law. The Indiana law was even broader in scope, adding private businesses to the protected class. Indiana\u2019s law protected private businesses if they discriminated against gays.\n\nAgainst all logic and straight legal analysis, however, four United States Circuit Courts of Appeals have ruled that federal law can be used as a defense in cases involving private parties. Two other circuits, following the language and construction of the federal law and without contorting its meaning, have said \u201cno\u201d: private businesses are not protected by their religious beliefs if they discriminate.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court offered a narrow ruling allowing a closely held corporation to discriminate based on religion. Burwell and others sued Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., an arts and crafts company owned by the Evangelical Christian Green family because the company refused to provide health insurance that included contraception coverage for its employees, as required in the provisions of the Obamacare legislation.\n\nIn its defense, the company cited its owners\u2019 religious beliefs. The court ruled in Hobby Lobby\u2019s favor, stating that, in certain situations, a private for-profit business could deny to its employees a specific health insurance benefit (contraception) otherwise required by the law. In other words, the company could discriminate against the employees because the company\u2019s owners\u2019 religious beliefs did not comport with the use of the specific coverage.\n\nIndiana\u2019s law, before its hasty revision and amending last week, would have allowed businesses to use religion as a defense against discrimination lawsuits filed by gays. If this logic seems convoluted, it is.\n\nYou can discriminate, and, if sued, you can defend yourself by saying what you did offends your religious beliefs. Again, four appellate courts and the U.S. Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby seem to agree. The uproar surrounding Indiana\u2019s law prompted Indiana to make the aforementioned revisions to its original RFRA act, enacting protections based on sexual orientation. Indiana stopped short, however, because it did not include sexual orientation as a protected class in its anti-discrimination law.\n\nA review of the \u201creligious freedom\u201d court cases shows that in fact, some have benefited (when the entity said to be discriminating is the government). Most often, however, private parties who have used religion to excuse discrimination have lost.\n\nA Muslim prisoner was allowed to grow a short beard. A Santeria priest was allowed to sacrifice a goat on special religious occasions. A Native American boy was allowed to wear long hair to school. These \u201cvictories\u201d were all government-connected.\n\nIn 2006, a lesbian woman in New Mexico sued a photographer she had contracted with, but who later refused to photograph her commitment ceremony. The photographer did so citing the company owner\u2019s religious beliefs as the reason.\n\nThe discrimination suit against the photographer was successful, despite the photographer\u2019s arguments that the religious freedom law applied. The court ruled the law did not apply, and the case never made it to trial, because the dispute existed between two parties and not a government entity. This judge should have been the sole decider in the Hobby Lobby case.\n\nIf the New Mexico case had been brought before the court in Indiana under the first version of that state\u2019s RFRA, it would have been allowed to proceed to trial.\n\nIndiana\u2019s law, as first passed, actually justified discrimination in the name of religion.\n\nThe federal government, and all of the states with religious freedom laws, should repeal those laws. They are unnecessary; and, as seen most recently in Indiana, the wording of the laws can lead to unnecessary angst, anger and debate. Every state should pass comprehensive laws that prohibit discrimination in all of its forms, including sexual orientation.\n\nAgain, the revised Indiana law, while technically an improvement to the original law, still does not include sexual orientation in its anti-discrimination coverage.\n\nThe United States was the first country in history to recognize that religion and government needed to be separate. The phrase \u201cseparation of church and state\u201d is a familiar one endorsed by most (where church means religion). That is because history has shown that when a particular religion is officially established or endorsed by the government, others who practice different religions, or those who do not practice any religion, become second-class citizens.\n\nThe Constitution of the United States provides for freedom of religion. It says \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\u201d and it provides that \u201cno religious test shall ever be required for holding office in the United States.\u201d Nonetheless, many candidates for public office at every level talk about their \u201cfaith,\u201d often to signal their positions against gays, abortion and other concepts dear to their perceived voting base.\n\nDespite the absence of explicit language, it is clear our framers believed in the separation of church and state.\n\nCertain influential individuals, nonetheless, believe church and state should not be so separate. In 2012, Rick Santorum, who was running for president, said the absolute concept of separation \u201cmakes me want to throw up.\u201d\n\nDuring his 1984 re-election campaign, President Ronald Reagan had to be reminded that our elected officials are \u201cdefenders of the Constitution,\u201d not \u201cdefenders of the faith.\u201d\n\nAlan Dershowitz, writing in his book \u201cTaking The Stand,\u201d says:\n\n\u201c\u2019Faith\u2019 has become synonymous with \u2018values\u2019 in the minds of many, although there is absolutely no correlation. Indeed, the \u2018values\u2019 espoused by some of the people who would impose their faith on others are highly questionable. They include denying gays the equal protection of the law; denying women (and young girls) the right to choose abortion, and sometimes contraception, even in compelling cases; and, often, other conservative political \u2018values\u2019 that have nothing to do with religion, such as low taxes, the right to bear arms, the death penalty and widespread censorship.\u201d\n\nDershowitz then hits the nail on the head:\n\n\u201cThe debates over these issues, especially gay rights and the right to choose abortion, have become wedge controversies that are unduly influenced by the churches in violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of our Constitution.\u201d\n\nIt comes as neither a surprise nor a coincidence that on the cusp of our country\u2019s complete legal acceptance of gay rights and gay marriage, there is more deployment of religious freedom laws to deny services to same-sex couples. Such denials are not religious, despite all the rhetoric. They are purely and simply discriminatory.\n\nTim Holbrook, a law professor at Emory University, says:\n\n\u201cMany states are using the laws to carve out exceptions to allow the denial of services to same-sex couples. The timing is beyond a coincidence. We are seeing an interest at the same time same-sex marriage is coming forward.\u201d\n\nComprehensive anti-discrimination laws are needed in every state. Contrariwise, \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws should be repealed everywhere. Besides accomplishing nothing legally, they promote litigation. In an interview on CNN, Bill Levin, the founder of the First Church of Cannabis, said he planned to test the law, believing that it protects his right to smoke pot. Convoluted? See Burwell v.
