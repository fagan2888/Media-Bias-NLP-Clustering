Troy Tulowitzki walked around Rockies batting practice Monday at Coors Field, but not in a Rockies jersey. Instead he was wearing a navy blue and red National League all-star jersey — and with a “C” on the chest.

Tulowitzki was named captain of the NL team for the Home Run Derby, scheduled for July 14th at Target Field in Minneapolis, one day before the All-Star Game.

“It’s something you dream of as a kid, to participate in it,” Tulowitzki said. As captain — he is joined by Toronto’s Jose Bautista — Tulowitzki is charged with picking a team of five hitters, including himself, for the derby.

“To be the captain, I don’t know if that’s something I’m looking forward to because of how tough the decisions are going to be,” Tulowitzki said. “You can’t put everybody that wants to participate on your team.”

Tulowitzki said he will start by considering Miami’s Giancarlo Stanton, the Dodgers’ Yasiel Puig and Colorado teammate Justin Morneau, a former long-time player for the Twins.

“I have to talk to Justin and see if he’s interested in doing that,” Tulowitzki said. “For him to be in Minnesota, that would be great for him, for what he’s done for that town.”

Tulowitzki’s 18 home runs ranks second in the NL behind Stanton’s 20. Cincinnati’s Todd Frazier is third with 17.

Tulowitzki said he’s not considering bowing out of the contest to rest.

“I think it’s an excuse for players at times who have a bad second half, to say, ‘Oh, I had a bad Home Run Derby,'” he said. ” You take a look during BP, sometimes I’ll go out there and try to hit a home run on every single pitch, so it’s no different from being in Home Run Derby.”
