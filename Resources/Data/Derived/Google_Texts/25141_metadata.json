In the wake of the swine flu pandemic, however, its audience has become more consumer-based.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nNot to cheapen HealthMap's importance in the crisis in West Africa, but there are significant implications here for the domestic U.S. With ACOs on the rise and the interest in population health as high as it has ever been, online tools that can accurately predict population health are at a premium. So far, refining a digital tool that draws on social media outlets has been an imperfect science, but as HealthMap demonstrates, the algorithms are only going to get better. Expect to see more of these tools whose focus is less on devastating infectious diseases and more on the prediction of things like the incidence of diabetes.\n\nThe Ebola crisis has claimed almost 1,000 lives to date. WHO is convening a panel to discuss policies for the use of experimental drugs on disease victims.\n\nWant to read more?
