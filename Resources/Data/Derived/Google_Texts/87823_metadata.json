You know those quirky, hipster ads with the \u201cLive Long in Oregon\u201d jingle you can\u2019t get out of your head? They\u2019re going away\u2026 for now.\n\nBruce Goldberg, acting executive director of Cover Oregon, said during a Monday press conference that the ads will be on hold while the agency focuses on getting people enrolled.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s appropriate to hold off on any further advertising,\u201d he said, noting the agency has pulled most of the ads while keeping some billboards.\n\nCritics of the quirky, vague and expensive ads will likely rejoice. The ad campaign was originally slated for about $10 million, but then officials doubled it to $21 million in October.\n\nNorthwest Watchdog has requested information on how much money pulling the ads might save. Goldberg said Cover Oregon will readjust later to see what type of advertising is necessary.\n\nAs for the rest of it, well, it\u2019s still a scramble to get things fixed at Cover Oregon, the website that was supposed to enroll Oregonians in health care coverage.

To date, the agency has enrolled 7,500 Oregonians in private insurance and 13,374 in the Oregon Health Plan (for low income Oregonians).\n\n(for low income Oregonians). 30,000 applications still need to be processed and about half of them have mistakes. The deadline for enrollment to get insurance by Jan. 1 has been pushed to Dec. 27. Goldberg said 100,000 Oregonians will have health care coverage by Jan. 1, most of them in the expanded Medicaid program.\n\nprogram. The state is withholding about $20 million from the website contractor, Oracle. The state also might go after Oracle to pay for the more than 400 employees needed to fix the site.\n\nGov. John Kitzhaber has called for an independent review. Meanwhile, the Oregonian reports a slew of technology problems and mismanagement is to be blame for the snafus.\n\nSeveral insurance companies have extended coverage that was going to be dropped at the end of the year.\n\nContact Shelby Sebens at Shelby@NorthwestWatchdog.org\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
