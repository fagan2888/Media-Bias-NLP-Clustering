That\u2019s before the tax bill comes in, and that\u2019s before these new, higher healthcare premiums are due\u201d during this week\u2019s GOP Address.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTranscript as Follows:\n\n\u201cEvery day, in the smallest towns and biggest cities across this country, about one in three Americans gets up and goes to work at a small business.\n\nMaybe they have coworkers, or maybe, for now, it\u2019s just them. Maybe it\u2019s their first job, or maybe they\u2019ve been lucky enough to build a lifelong career in the very place they started.\n\nThat\u2019s why, when we talk about supporting our small businesses, we aren\u2019t talking about buildings on Main Street or bottom lines on spreadsheets.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about millions of people, families, and futures.\n\nToday wraps up National Small Business Week. Since 1963, Democrats and Republicans alike have recognized this week as a time to celebrate the contributions of small businesses to every community in America. Times have changed, business models have changed, but the enduring spirit of American innovation continues to breathe life into our economy and create the jobs no government program can.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot in Washington that divides us, but in my time in Congress, I\u2019ve not met one person who believes our small businesses should carry the burden of excessive regulations and complicated taxes. Still, that\u2019s what happens.\n\nOn average, small businesses have to pay more than $11,000 for each employee in federal regulatory costs alone. That\u2019s before the tax bill comes in, and that\u2019s before these new, higher healthcare premiums are due.\n\nThese are hard realities for small businesses that we want to change.\n\nRepublicans know there\u2019s no effort too big or too small when it comes to encouraging small businesses. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve done things like making the research and development tax credit permanent. Getting rid of the oil export ban. Waiving upfront loan fees for veterans who want to be entrepreneurs. Strengthening and empowering local small business development organizations.\n\nAnd we\u2019re just getting started.\n\nWe know that every business, product, and job\u2014big or small\u2014started with an idea. That\u2019s why small business owners, employees, and entrepreneurs everywhere should be energized by our reform agenda for the future. We\u2019re bringing bold new ideas to the table\u2014and that will challenge the way Washington does business, not just today, but for years to come. We know the biggest obstacles we face won\u2019t just go away overnight. Instead of accepting that these are challenges we\u2019ll have to live with, we\u2019re building long-term solutions to fix them.\n\nIn a way, Congress is learning to do what American entrepreneurs do best: take care of today, and plan for tomorrow.\n\nIf we want a confident America, we need confident Americans. Top-down regulations and higher taxes don\u2019t inspire confidence. Job creation, innovation, and the courage to try and fail until you succeed\u2014those are the building blocks of a future we can all get excited about.\n\nAs chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I get to hear small business stories from all over the country every day. If we\u2019re looking for bold ideas for building the future, look no further than America\u2019s small businesses.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP Rep Chabot: Small Businesses Pay More than $11K For Each Employee In Regulatory Costs Alone", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "GOP Rep Chabot: Small Businesses Pay More than $11K For Each Employee In Regulatory Costs Alone", "title": "GOP Rep Chabot: Small Businesses Pay More than $11K For Each Employee In Regulatory Costs Alone - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Chabot-57-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/05/07/gop-rep-chabot-small-businesses-pay-more-than-11k-for-each-employee-in-regulatory-costs-alone/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP Rep Chabot: Small Businesses Pay More than $11K For Each Employee In Regulatory Costs Alone", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Chabot-57-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "GOP Rep Chabot: Small Businesses Pay More than $11K For Each Employee In Regulatory Costs Alone - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "regulations, Small Businesses, Steve Chabot,Breitbart TV, Economics,small businesses", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Steve Chabot", "published_time": "2016-05-07T06:22:06-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I get to hear small business stories from all over the country every day.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHouse Small Business Chairman Representative Steve Chabot (R-OH) stated, \u201csmall businesses have to pay more than $11,000 for each employee in federal regulatory costs alone.\nOn average, small businesses have to pay more than $11,000 for each employee in federal regulatory costs alone.\nSince 1963, Democrats and Republicans alike have recognized this week as a time to celebrate the contributions of small businesses to every community in America.\nRepublicans know there\u2019s no effort too big or too small when it comes to encouraging small businesses."}
