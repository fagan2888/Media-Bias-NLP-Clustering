They call it the \"clipper clinic.\"\n\nThe salon's owner, Karina Cardoso, says 90 percent of her customers are Hispanic. She says most are like her \u2014 self-employed with no health insurance.\n\n\"When I talk to the clients, there is a huge thing now with Obamacare, and I don't think that a lot of us know exactly what Obamacare is,\" she says.\n\nAn Ongoing Conversation\n\nSouthside Community Health Services worker Miguel Rivera is training to help people sign up for coverage. He says confusion about the federal health care law is common among the people he sees.\n\ntoggle caption Elizabeth Stawicki for NPR\n\n\"They're totally confused. There's still a lot of information \u2014 the client has to get into it and navigate the system \u2014 but people can do it,\" he says.\n\nWhen the five-hour clipper clinic is over, no one has signed up for health insurance.\n\nOn board the bus, health worker Heidi Benson isn't discouraged. She says up to 40 percent of Latino patients at Southside's health clinics are in the country illegally, so even people who qualify for coverage may not sign up to protect an undocumented family member.\n\nBenson says the clinic at Karina's is only the first step in a continuing conversation about MNsure.\n\n\"I think it opens up the ability for the conversation to broaden,\" she says, \"so people who've been afraid or don't know what questions to ask, when they hear more information, start to understand that it's OK to ask any questions ... and hopefully get the answers that they need, to go forward and take care of themselves.\"\n\nCuidado De Salud\n\nThroughout the country, about 10.2 million Latinos are expected to qualify for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOutreach through trusted networks in the community \u2014 like the beauty salon \u2014 is critical to help reach them, says Mayra Alvarez, who works in health policy for the federal Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\"I think that's why you see that this first open-enrollment period is six months is to allow people the time to ask those questions, to become familiar with the marketplace, to make an educated decision about health insurance,\" she says. \"For a lot of people, this is going to be the first time they have access to health insurance.\"\n\nAlvarez says she hopes the Spanish version of HealthCare.gov, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, will be open to accept enrollment in a few weeks.\n\nThis story is part of a collaboration among NPR, Minnesota Public Radio and Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "Latinos are three times as likely to be uninsured than white Minnesota residents, making them a key demographic for the state's new online health insurance marketplace.
