James Madison, a Montesquieu admirer and the principal figure of the Constitutional Convention, argued that the Congress, the president and the Supreme Court were separate, with distinctly different powers, but necessarily interrelated. He argued that the constant tension among the three departments would work to prevent any one of them from overriding the others and creating a despotism.\n\nAll of America\u2019s founders rejected monarchy. Most of them were concerned not so much with tyrants, as with runaway legislatures. Alexander Hamilton, in particular, argued for energy in the executive, to restrain invasions of the people\u2019s liberties by irresponsible majorities in the Congress.\n\nBut not long after the founding of the union, presidents found themselves compelled to take extra-constitutional actions. Thomas Jefferson, an outspoken advocate for a strictly limited and largely invisible federal government, nonetheless ordered the construction of gunboats for which there was no congressional appropriation of funds. He at least honored the spirit of the Constitution by appealing to Congress to vote the funds after the fact, which it did.\n\nDuring the desperate early days of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln took a number of actions, such as suspending the constitutional right of habeas corpus, that he deemed unavoidable if the Union were to be preserved. Congress and the Supreme Court largely acquiesced in Lincoln\u2019s sweeping assumption of powers, although the court did strike down his use of military commissions to try seditionists in the North.\n\nOn Oct. 26, 2011, President Obama opened a new chapter in unconstitutional executive power grabs. He issued an executive order known as \u201cWe Can\u2019t Wait.\u201d\n\nThe extra-constitutional executive grew under Woodrow Wilson and blossomed under the 13 years of Franklin Roosevelt. In 1941 he decreed an \u201cunlimited national emergency,\u201d and relied on his war powers to do whatever he wanted for the next four years.\n\nIn 1942, for instance, Roosevelt told Congress that he personally would repeal a farm law provision unless Congress did it first. \u201cIn the event that Congress should fail to act, and act adequately, I shall accept the responsibility and I will act.\u201d Even the strongly pro-executive Hamilton would have been horrified.\n\nBy his Executive Order 9066 of 1942 Roosevelt stripped Japanese-American citizens of the West Coast states of their right to due process of law, and packed them off to resettlement camps until the war\u2019s end. He justified this by invoking the war power, and the Supreme Court supinely accepted his argument.\n\nA decade later President Truman, annoyed by labor-management deadlock, simply seized the nation\u2019s large steel mills by executive order. The Supreme Court declared this unconstitutional and reversed.\n\nOn Oct. 26, 2011, President Obama opened a new chapter in unconstitutional executive power grabs. He issued an executive order known as \u201cWe Can\u2019t Wait.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t wait if Congress fails to do its job. So where they won\u2019t act, I will.\u201d A week later he added, \u201cWe decided to take matters into our own hands.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s subsequent administration of the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d) has now given us dozens of examples of arbitrary rewriting of the laws by an executive.\n\nFor instance, Obama expanded the law to allow ineligible illegal immigrants to receive benefits if they were part of a family group where one member was eligible. He directed that the employer mandate be postponed a year beyond the law\u2019s requirement, to prevent a political outcry before the 2014 elections. He exempted U.S. territories from burdensome insurance requirements despite the law\u2019s clear statement that they were included.\n\nMost notoriously, Obama allowed the ACA premium subsidies to flow through a federal insurance exchange, although the law clearly said that the credits were to flow only through an exchange \u201cestablished by a state.\u201d In an embarrassingly wrong opinion, six Supreme Court justices rewrote the law, on the ground that the purpose of the ACA could not be achieved unless the plain words of the act were ignored.\n\nMontesquieu, as adapted by Madison, had it right. Especially when not in a war, the Constitution bars the executive from simply writing his own laws for his own political advantage. When he continues to do so, the legislative and judicial departments must rein him in. Otherwise we no longer have a Constitution that sets forth the government\u2019s powers, specifies the limitations on those powers, and declares the rights of the people that cannot be infringed.\n\nThis piece was first published by the Ethan Allen Institute.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Montesquieu had it right.
