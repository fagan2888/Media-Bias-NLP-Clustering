That\u2019s what the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation learned from a survey of more than 1,200 uninsured adults last summer. The foundation hired PerryUndem Research/Communication to find out why they remain uninsured. What they learned:\n\nAffordability is the barrier. Those who have looked at their exchange options have calculated the cost of premiums and their out-of-pocket cost sharing and determined they cannot afford coverage. Many do not understand the fines associated with not having health insurance. One fourth of the uninsured are unaware of the tax credit that could subsidize their coverage, and another 34 percent do not understand how the tax credit works. \u201cThe marketplace is not tapped out,\u201d says Michael Perry, a partner in the firm. But convincing the remaining uninsured to enroll in coverage requires a different level of engagement than was needed for those who signed up in the first few open-enrollment periods, he says. They need detailed information about their options and exactly how the tax credit works \u2014 but they also need someone who listens to their individual story and understands where health insurance can fit in.\n\n\u201cThe conversation needs to look like more of a dialogue, more of a negotiation, than it was before,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more about listening to what\u2019s going on in their lives, hearing some of the complicated things they are weighing, providing information, having them ask questions, giving more information.\u201d Individuals have different preferences about whom they are willing to have that conversation with. Federally hired navigators, privately employed assisters and insurance brokers are key because the remaining uninsured are unlikely to find the answers they need on a website. \u201cBased on what I\u2019ve learned, they are becoming even more important because they need to spend time, one-on-one, with individuals,\u201d Perry says. Good touch points are: Hospital emergency departments: \u201cWhen someone is at the ER, there is a good opportunity to have a conversation about enrolling,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWhen someone is at the ER, there is a good opportunity to have a conversation about enrolling,\u201d he says.
