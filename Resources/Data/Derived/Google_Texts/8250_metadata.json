She responded by saying she thinks it\u2019s a smarter tactic to stick with the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I believe,\u201d the former Secretary of State said. \u201cThe Democratic Party in the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed. We finally have a path to universal health care. We\u2019ve accomplished so much already, I do not want to see the Republicans repeal it, and I don\u2019t want to see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.\u201d\n\nSanders also used Truman and the history of liberal values in the country in his response.\n\n\u201cWhat a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man woman and child as a right,\u201d the Vermont Senator said.\n\n\u201cNow, the truth is that Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman \u2026 they believed that health care should be available to all of our people. I\u2019m on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act \u2026 I voted for it. But right now what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. We are paying the highest price in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off. And here\u2019s the important point: we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country.\u201d\n\nBut Clinton didn\u2019t give any ground on her view that the Affordable Care Act itself is the best realization of liberalism, rather than Sanders\u2019 more radical idea.\n\n\u201cWe have the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party and of our country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Bernie Sanders forced Hillary Clinton into a full-throated defense of the Affordable Care Act during the fourth Democratic debate.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "\"I don't want to see us start over again with a contentious debate,\" Clinton said", "title": "Sanders Forces Clinton Into Strong Defense of Obamacare", "url": "http://time.com/4183990/democratic-debate-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-obamacare/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/democratic-debate-clinton-sanders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/democratic-debate-clinton-sanders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Sanders Forces Clinton Into Strong Defense of Obamacare", "description": "\"I don't want to see us start over again with a contentious debate,\" Clinton said", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "2016 election, bernie sanders, hillary clinton", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "bernie sanders, hillary clinton, democratic debate, affordable care act, obamacare, bernie sanders health care, hillary clinton health care"}, "article_summary": "+ READ ARTICLEBernie Sanders forced Hillary Clinton into a full-throated defense of the Affordable Care Act during the Democratic debate Sunday night, as they sparred on health care and Democratic ideals.\nClinton was asked about Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care proposal.\nShe responded by saying she thinks it\u2019s a smarter tactic to stick with the Affordable Care Act.\nI\u2019m on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act \u2026 I voted for it.\n\u201cWe have the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said."}
