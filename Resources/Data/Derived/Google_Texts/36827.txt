PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP) — Jordan Spieth and his world-class short game paid off big Sunday in a playoff victory in the Valspar Championship.

Spieth holed a 12-foot par putt on the 18th hole to join a three-man playoff with Patrick Reed and Sean O’Hair. He won on the third extra hole by making a 30-foot birdie putt.

Reed made a 30-foot birdie on the last hole that got him into a playoff, and he made two improbable par saves in the playoff until Spieth beat him at Innisbrook. O’Hair was going for his first win since 2011 and had a 12-foot birdie putt on the second playoff hole that caught the lip.

Spieth saved par on his final three holes for a 69. He goes to No. 6 in the world.
