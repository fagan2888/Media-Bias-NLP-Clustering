The powerful lesson for some Papillion-La Vista High School students came with a realistic approach Friday. The school district and law enforcement hope the message hits home.

A frantic father called for his daughter when he arrived on the scene of an accident.

The chaplain tried to hold him back as crews cover up Jazymn's body. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

This accident is a fake example, meant to show the Papillion-La Vista School District and local public safety agencies the kind of powerful message this fake crash can show. A message meant to speak to these high school students so that they don’t drink and drive.

A Papillion-La Vista senior said the message came across loud and clear.

“I’d convince all my friends, everyone, everywhere, don’t drink and drive and don’t text and drive,” said a senior at Papillion-La Vista High School.

Jazymn Yates, a Drama Club student at Papillion-La Vista High School, played the deceased daughter in the faux crash with her father, Brendon Yates. Although Friday’s example was just an act, Yates said he knows exactly how it feels to lose a loved one.

“It was very heavy, only because my wife and I have already suffered the loss of a child in real life,” said Yates, who lost his own son six years ago.

Yates hopes the mock crash is a lesson learned for anyone thinking about getting behind the wheel drunk.

“I pray no parents have to grieve or deal with this type of loss in any way, loss of a child in any way is hard,” Yates said.

Prom is this weekend for Papillion-La Vista High School students so the timing of the mock crash is essential. The Papillion Police and Fire Department, Sarpy County Sheriff and CHI Midlands Hospital all helped make this event possible.
