It has been corrected since it first published.\n\n1. Mike Huckabee had a very difficult week.\n\nSensing the tide of history and the Supreme Court going against him, Mike Huckabee called on conservative Christians to engage in a massive \u201cBiblical disobedience\u201d campaign against the \u201cfalse god of judicial supremacy,\u201d in advance of the Supreme Court decision in favor of gay marriage this week. Not clear what exactly constitutes \u201cbiblical disobedience,\u201d but whatevs.\n\nThe GOP presidential aspirant went on to compare the gay marriage act to the Dred Scott case that upheld the Fugitive Slave Act, which is odd to say the least, since legalizing gay marriage is a step forward for civil rights, saying in a way that gay people are fully human, and Dred Scott was, of course, a terrible distortion of justice that said black people were not.\n\nSo, huh? But then again, the ideological conservative Christian brain does not trouble itself with such logical inconsistencies.\n\nAfter the ruling, Huckabee reacted in a Fox News segment with Megyn Kelly with another completely insane comparison, \u201cI will not acquiesce to an imperial court any more than our Founders acquiesced to an imperial British monarch. We must resist and reject judicial tyranny, not retreat.\u201d\n\nThis was too much even for Kelly, who tried to give the Huckster a brief lesson in Constitutional Law. \u201cHow do you not accept it?\u201d she asked incredulously. \u201cLike it or not, the (Supreme Court) gets the final say.\u201d\n\nBut lest you think there\u2019s been some breakout of sanity and humanity on Megyn Kelly\u2019s show, she also invited her pal Tony Perkins, head of the anti-LGBT hate group Family Research Council, to discuss the decision. Shockingly, he too was glum about it.\n\n2. Everything has gone dark for Ted Cruz.\n\nSo many Texas politicians are despairing about the Supreme Court decisions this week, a massive pity party might be in order. Ted Cruz was definitely crying in his beer. At least the poor fella found a sympathetic ear on Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show.\n\n\u201cToday is some of the darkest 24 hours in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Cruz said without any regard to subject verb agreement. \u201cYesterday and today were both naked and shameless judicial activism.\u201d\n\nHannity concurred. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say it more eloquently.\u201d (Unless, of course, he injected grammar into the statement.)\n\nAs we all learned in school, judicial activism is when you don\u2019t agree with the high court\u2019s decision. This is a universal truth. \u201cIt is lawless, and in doing so, they have undermined the fundamental legitimacy of the United States Supreme Court,\u201d Cruz continued portentously and nonsensically.\n\n3. Louie Gohmert completely freaks out, recommends fleeing country since that\u2019s what God did.\n\nGod is going to be very very mad at us, according to Texas tea partier Louie Gohmert. He predicts a noticeable drop-off of God\u2019s protection of the good ol\u2019 U.S. of A. now that we\u2019ve gone and legalized gay marriage.\n\n\u201cFounders and leaders including George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and most all of the Presidents have noted that it is God who has been the source of this nation\u2019s unfathomable blessings,\u201d Gohmert stated. \u201cBut if Moses, Jesus, and contributors to the Bible were correct, God\u2019s hand of protection will be withdrawn as future actions from external and internal forces will soon make clear. I will do all I can to prevent such harm, but I am gravely fearful that the stage has now been set.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Kristol believes we're on our way to polygamy, while Bobby Jindal shows that GOP is still the party of stupid", "title": "The 6 most hysterical right-wing responses to SCOTUS\u2019 same-sex marriage ruling", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bill Kristol believes we're on our way to polygamy, while Bobby Jindal shows that GOP is still the party of stupid", "title": "The 6 most hysterical right-wing responses to SCOTUS\u2019 same-sex marriage ruling", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/29/the_6_most_hysterical_right_wing_responses_to_scotus_same_sex_marriage_ruling_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/bill_kristol.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bill Kristol believes we're on our way to polygamy, while Bobby Jindal shows that GOP is still the party of stupid", "title": "The 6 most hysterical right-wing responses to SCOTUS\u2019 same-sex marriage ruling", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/bill_kristol.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Janet Allon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Bill Kristol, Bobby Jindal, Louie Gohmert, Mike Huckabee", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b59\"", "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Bill Kristol, Bobby Jindal, Louie Gohmert, Mike Huckabee, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNet .\nHe predicts a noticeable drop-off of God\u2019s protection of the good ol\u2019 U.S. of A. now that we\u2019ve gone and legalized gay marriage.\nSo many Texas politicians are despairing about the Supreme Court decisions this week, a massive pity party might be in order.\n\u201cIt is lawless, and in doing so, they have undermined the fundamental legitimacy of the United States Supreme Court,\u201d Cruz continued portentously and nonsensically.\nMike Huckabee had a very difficult week."}
