Yes, he used to be great with crafting messages, but the Republican party has left his excellent advice in the dust as they\u2019ve jumped the reality shark.\n\nIn 2013, Luntz tried to warn Republicans about the negative impact of their shock jocks, to no avail. Mother Jones exposed Luntz with a secret recording, when he thought he was speaking privately to students. He said:\n\nAnd they get great ratings, and they drive the message, and it\u2019s really problematic. And this is not on the Democratic side. It\u2019s only on the Republican side\u2026[inaudible]. [Democrats have] got every other source of news on their side. And so that is a lot of what\u2019s driving it. If you take\u2014Marco Rubio\u2019s getting his ass kicked. Who\u2019s my Rubio fan here? We talked about it. He\u2019s getting destroyed! By Mark Levin, by Rush Limbaugh, and a few others. He\u2019s trying to find a legitimate, long-term effective solution to immigration that isn\u2019t the traditional Republican approach, and talk radio is killing him. That\u2019s what\u2019s causing this thing underneath. And too many politicians in Washington are playing coy.\n\nSo Luntz, while sort of an evil genius for tricking people into ignoring climate change, is not stupid. And once again he\u2019s warning Republicans and once again, their hubris will ignore him because the conservative media refuses to broker any kind of criticism or call to reality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Frank Luntz, the guy who crafts talking points for Republicans and does polls, has a warning for Republican candidates after Saturday night's Democratic debate: Hillary Clinton will not be easy to beat.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Frank Luntz, the guy who crafts talking points for Republicans and does polls, has a warning for Republican candidates after Saturday night's Democratic debate: Hillary Clinton will not be easy to beat.", "title": "After Strong Iowa Debate GOP Pollster Warns That Hillary Clinton Will Not Be Easy to Beat", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/11/15/republican-pollster-warn-gop-hillary-clinton-easy-beat.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hillary-clinton-laughing.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-15T00:05:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "2016 Elections,Editors' Picks,Featured News,Hillary Clinton,Frank Luntz,Hillary Clinton is a threat to Republicans,Hillary Clinton will not be easy to beat,who won the Dem Debate in Iowa,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2015-11-15T00:05:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-15T00:05:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Frank Luntz, Hillary Clinton is a threat to Republicans, Hillary Clinton will not be easy to beat, who won the Dem Debate in Iowa"}, "article_summary": "Frank Luntz, the guy who crafts talking points for Republicans and does polls, has a warning for Republican candidates after Saturday night\u2019s Democratic debate: Hillary Clinton will not be easy to beat.\nIowa Focus Group: Among 33 undecided Iowans, HRC clearly wins debate by 23 to 10, and moves 11 undecided to her camp versus 3 for Sanders.\nIn 2013, Luntz tried to warn Republicans about the negative impact of their shock jocks, to no avail.\nSo Luntz, while sort of an evil genius for tricking people into ignoring climate change, is not stupid.\nMother Jones exposed Luntz with a secret recording, when he thought he was speaking privately to students."}
