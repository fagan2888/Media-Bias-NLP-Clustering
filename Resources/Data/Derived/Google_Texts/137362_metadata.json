It was TubaChristmas in Skyline Park.\n\nAlthough this was the 39th annual tuba gathering, the group was composed almost entirely of new acquaintances.\n\nSome players show up year after year, play their part, and disperse without a word, players said.\n\nDerek Leroux, a 14-year-old baritone player, braved the new experience on his own after his father dropped him off at the Auraria Event Center rehearsal.\n\n\u201cWe all just came and played Christmas music, and now we\u2019re going to perform,\u201d Derek said.\n\nA freshman at Horizon High School, Derek plays in the marching and jazz bands.\n\nTubaChristmas was fun, he said, because he had the opportunity to play a lead role, which he is not usually offered in band.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool when we have the important part,\u201d Derek said.\n\nThe performance Sunday included players from six elementary, 10 middle and 38 high schools as well as 15 colleges and 19 community band groups.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s their day,\u201d said Rick Davis, who lives in Denver and has attended the Christmas performance for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cTuba players sit in the back of bands and play oompah parts all the time, the background music,\u201d said Bill Clark, founder of the Denver event. \u201cOne day a year, they get to play the melody.\u201d\n\nClark conducted the 220 players on Sunday. Forty years ago, as a professor of music at the University of Denver, Clark led his first group of tuba carollers around the city.\n\nIn New York, Harvey Phillips conceived and organized TubaChristmas\u2019s first performance on Dec. 22, 1974, at the Rockefeller Plaza Ice Rink.\n\n\u201cAbout 10 years later, I realized what he was doing, and I joined with him,\u201d Clark said.\n\nThis month, TubaChristmas will be held in 274 cities across the United States, as well as in Canada, Costa Rica, Switzerland and New Zealand.\n\nAlison Noon: 303-954-1223, anoon@denverpost.com or twitter.com/alisonnoon", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hundreds of tuba-playing strangers delight with Christmas music", "title": "Hundreds of tuba-playing strangers delight with Christmas music", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/22/hundreds-of-tuba-playing-strangers-delight-with-christmas-music/", "image": {"width": 1023, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131222_055948_tubaxmas.jpg", "height": 579}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131222_055948_tubaxmas.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-22T17:28:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T15:07:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Forty years ago, as a professor of music at the University of Denver, Clark led his first group of tuba carollers around the city.\n\u201cTuba players sit in the back of bands and play oompah parts all the time, the background music,\u201d said Bill Clark, founder of the Denver event.\n\u201cToday\u2019s their day,\u201d said Rick Davis, who lives in Denver and has attended the Christmas performance for more than a decade.\n\u201cWe all just came and played Christmas music, and now we\u2019re going to perform,\u201d Derek said.\nSome players show up year after year, play their part, and disperse without a word, players said."}
