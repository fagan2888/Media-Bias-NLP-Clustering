Panama City, FL --- You can call the Gulf Coast Lady Commodores road warriors.

They've started the year winning their first seven games, all of which took place away from Panama City.

Saturday afternoon, they played their long awaited home opener.

In the video attached at the top, we start the action in the first half. Lady Commodores swing the ball around to Chelsey Rosier, who pulls up from three and swishes it. That ties the game at 11.

Destini Feagin gets the pick and drives to the hoop, lays it in. We're all squared at 17.

Off the steal from Jessica Morton, Lady Commodores push it on the fast break. Taylor Shaw finishes at the hole to take a two point lead.

But after a Jones County rally, Morton starts to get going from the field, takes the long two and knocks it down.

Morton would lead the team with 34 points and lead Gulf Coast to victory 79-65 Lady Commodores now 8-0 on the campaign.

Rosier also reached double digits with 11 points.

GC returns to action Friday and Saturday in Decateur, GA, taking on Chattanooga State and Southwest.
