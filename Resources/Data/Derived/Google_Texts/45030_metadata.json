Getty Images/PhotoAlto\n\nStudies have revealed that coverage for treatment of mental illness often does not match that provided for other medical conditions, causing advocates to pressure Capitol Hill to enforce laws and pass new ones to reduce disparities in care.\n\nBut advocates this week took a different route: Targeting doctors, teachers, parents and others in the general public who know someone with a mental illness, with the release of a guidebook offering details on mental disorders and how to get help treating them.\n\n\u201cAs culture changes, we value things differently,\u201d Barbara Van Dahlen, a licensed clinical psychologist and founder of Give an Hour \u2013 an organization that works with veterans who struggle with mental health issues \u2013 said during a publicity event for the book Tuesday at the National Press Club in Washington. \u201cThat drives policy, money and emphasis.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstanding Mental Disorders: Your Guide to DSM-5\u201d \u2013 DSM-5 is the abbreviation for the latest edition of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \u2013 was released by the association this week, with endorsements from the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, the National Alliance on Mental Illness and Mental Health America.\n\nThe federal government in recent years has overhauled insurance coverage for treatment of mental health and substance abuse \u2013 jointly referred to as behavioral health. President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law extended the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, passed in 2008, which requires mental health benefits in some employer-sponsored plans be provided on the same terms as other medical care.\n\nObamacare also expanded coverage of behavioral health through private health plans sold on state and federal marketplaces, where Americans can buy tax-subsidized plans based on their income. Mental health care is one of 10 benefits required to be provided in all plans sold, just like maternity care and vaccines.\n\nHowever, a recent analysis by the National Alliance on Mental Illness found that significant barriers to care and to paying for care still exist.\n\n\u201c[The law] won\u2019t be enforced unless people fight for it,\u201d Patrick Kennedy, a former Democratic U.S. congressman from Rhode Island who was the lead sponsor of the parity bill, said at Tuesday's event. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to be as effective as we make it \u2026 We\u2019re never going to change the system unless there is public demand. We need to increase the total volume of people that are demanding that these services be available.\u201d\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness also has found that funding for mental illness at the state level has lagged. And meanwhile, many people still perceive mental health issues as different from other conditions.\n\nAdvocates have been working to change the public perception of mental illness from conditions historically surrounded by mystery and fear \u2013 often hidden from public view \u2013 to illnesses that can be treated in the mainstream of modern medicine.\n\n\u201cIf someone has [a mental illness] it\u2019s not because of character weakness, it\u2019s not because they decided to have it, it\u2019s not because their parents did a bad job,\u201d said Dr. Jeff Borenstein, president and CEO of the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation and a member of an advisory panel for the book. \u201cThese are conditions of the body \u2013 and the brain happens to be the organ we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nThe misperceptions and disparity in services related to mental health issues are attributable to stigma and misunderstanding, advocates say, not to a lack of people who suffer from their consequences. A quarter of Americans experience some form of mental disorder or substance abuse problem at some point in their lives, according to the American Psychiatric Association.\n\n\u201cMental health makes us very uncomfortable,\u201d Van Dahlen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a vulnerability.\"\n\nVan Dahlen noted that her mom was schizophrenic, but that Van Dahlen herself didn\u2019t talk about it until a few years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a psychologist and I didn\u2019t talk about it openly because the message from the culture to me was, \u2018Don\u2019t do that \u2013 people are going to judge you,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nUntreated, mental illness can cause someone to become unemployed or homeless, or to turn to substance abuse. Some turn to suicide, and many are taken to prison instead of receiving care. The economic cost of untreated mental illness is more than $100 billion each year in the U.S., according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\nMore attention is being paid to the criminal justice side of the issue, as state governments are suffering from the cost of caring for mentally ill inmates, who cycle through the system and often do not get the care they need. Diversion programs have emerged in cities like New York and Miami.\n\nBut often, mental illness isn\u2019t addressed until a national tragedy arises, such as a school shooting by someone who is mentally ill, even though there is little connection between mental illness and violence.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have historically thought \u2013 and unfortunately our public policy has promoted this \u2013 that mental illness is just one thing, and that it equates to violence, danger and threat,\u201d said Paul Gionfriddo, president and CEO of Mental Health America.\n\nHe called the relationship between mental illness and violence one of the most common cultural myths. In fact, people with mental illness are more likely to be dangerous to themselves than others. In the U.S., suicide is the third-leading cause of death among young people ages 10 to 24. Every day, 22 American veterans kill themselves.\n\n\u201cOften we ignore or dismiss these illnesses in their earliest, most treatable stages, and respond only when they have escalated to critical and potentially life-threatening conditions,\u201d Kennedy wrote in a foreword to the book.\n\nGionfriddo, whose son began to show signs of schizophrenia at age 5, said families don\u2019t know what to do or where to turn when they face such a situation.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "American Psychiatric Association", "title": "Mental Health Advocates Push for Cultural Understanding", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The goal: influence public policy by changing the way Americans view mental health.", "title": "Mental Health Advocates Push for Cultural Understanding", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/05/01/mental-health-advocates-push-for-cultural-understanding", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/61/4c/778435a24cc788b5673c61d4eed6/150501-mentalhealth-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The goal: influence public policy by changing the way Americans view mental health.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Mental Health Advocates Push for Cultural Understanding"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "May 1, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kimberly Leonard,Pulse,picks,public health,mental health,American Psychiatric Association", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The goal: influence public policy by changing the way Americans view mental health."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb713\"", "article_summary": "Insurance coverage for mental health care has taken strides under President Barack Obama's health care law, but problems still exist.\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s health care law extended the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, passed in 2008, which requires mental health benefits in some employer-sponsored plans be provided on the same terms as other medical care.\nThe economic cost of untreated mental illness is more than $100 billion each year in the U.S., according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\nThe federal government in recent years has overhauled insurance coverage for treatment of mental health and substance abuse \u2013 jointly referred to as behavioral health.\nMental health care is one of 10 benefits required to be provided in all plans sold, just like maternity care and vaccines."}
