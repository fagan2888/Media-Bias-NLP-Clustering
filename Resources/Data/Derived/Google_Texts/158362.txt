President Obama discusses the part of his executive order on gun control relating to mental health.



"Nearly two in three gun deaths are from suicide," the president said. "So a lot of our work is to prevent people from hurting themselves."



"That's why the Affordable Care Act... made sure that mental health treatment was covered the same as treatment for any other mental illness," he explained. "We will ensure that federal mental health records are submitted to the background check system."



"We're going to do more to make sure those suffering from mental illness get the help that they need," the president said, drawing applause from the crowd at the White House.





PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: High profile mass shootings tend to shine a light on those few mentally unstable people who inflict harm on others, but the truth is that nearly two in three gun deaths are from suicide, so a lot of our work is to prevent people from hurting themselves.



That's why we made sure the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), finally... that law made sure that treatment for mental health was covered the same as treatment for any other illness. That is why we're going to invest $500 million to expand treatment across the country.



It is also why we will ensure that federal mental health records are submitted to the background check system and remove barriers that prevent states from reporting relevant information.



If we can destigmatize mental health issues, and get people proper care, and fill gaps in the background check system, we can spare more families the pain of losing a loved one to suicide.



For those in Congress who so often rush to blame mental illess for mass shootings, as a way of avoiding taking action on guns, here's you chance to support these efforts -- put your money where your mouth is.
