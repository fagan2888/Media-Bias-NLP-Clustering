Bill Maher closed Real Time on Friday by throwing a serious — “Rob Ford in rehab” serious, even — challenge to the Republican Party, daring conservatives to follow through on their threat to impreach President Barack Obama over the fatal September 2012 U.S. consulate bombing in Benghazi, Libya.

“When the Republicans impeached [Bill] Clinton, his approval ratings shot up 10 [percentage] points, to 73,” Maher argued. “Obama’s approval is at 41. He could use a little of that impeachment mojo. So go ahead, haters. Make Benghazi your big issue, please. Put Barack Obama back on the ballot in 2014, so he can kick your ass a third time.”

The fact that Republicans are seizing on the attack as a talking point again, Maher said, meant that the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as “Obamacare”) was working.

“Logic, however, not as much,” Maher said. “Because if you ask [conservatives] to explain what the Benghazi crime is, they still can’t. It’s just some blather about ‘Don’t you see? If it was terrorists, instead of what he said, act of terror, then Obama is weak and Mitt Romney gets to be retroactive president.'”

But logical arguments don’t matter in today’s GOP, Maher explained, attributing their rhetoric to the party catching syphilis in 1994, leaving it untreated and reducing it to “the drooling and frothing stage today.”

“It’s like trying to relate to someone who’s tripping when you’re not,” Maher said. “Sorry, we don’t see the spiders.”
