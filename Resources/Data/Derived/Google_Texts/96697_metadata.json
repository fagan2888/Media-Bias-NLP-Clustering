It\u2019s the sort of description that might have come right out of the executive summary of the Senate torture report released last December. In this case, however, the testimony was not about a \u201cblack site\u201d somewhere in the Greater Middle East, nor was it a description from Abu Ghraib, nor in fact from this century at all.\n\nThe testimony came from Vietnam; the year was 1968; the witness was Anthony J. Russo, one of the first Americans to report on the systematic torture of enemy combatants by CIA operatives and other U.S. agents in that long-gone war. The acts Russo described became commonplace in the news post-9/11 and he would prove to be an early example of what also became commonplace in our century: a whistleblower who found himself on the wrong side of the law and so was prosecuted for releasing the secret truth about the acts of our government.\n\nDetermined to shine a light on what he called \u201cthe truth held prisoner,\u201d Russo blew the whistle on American torture policy in Vietnam and on an intelligence debacle at the center of Vietnam decision-making that helped turn that war into the nightmare it was. Neither of his revelations saw the light of day in his own time or ours and while Daniel Ellsberg, his compatriot and companion in revelation, remains a major figure for his role in releasing the Pentagon Papers, Russo is a forgotten man.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThat\u2019s too bad. He shouldn\u2019t be forgotten. His is, unfortunately, a story of our times as well as his.\n\nThe CIA Interrogation Center, Saigon\n\nBefore him sat the enemy. VC. Vietcong. He was slender, a decade older than the 28-year-old American, and cautious in his initial responses. The American offered him a cigarette. \u201cSmoke?\u201d\n\nAnthony Russo liked to befriend his subjects, finding that sharing a cigarette or a beer and congenial conversation could improve an interview\u2019s results.\n\nThis man\u2019s all right, Russo thought \u2014 unlike the one he had interviewed when he first arrived in Saigon. That prisoner had sat before him, quivering in fear, pleading for his life. \u201cAre you going to kill me?\u201d the distraught man had said repeatedly, his thumbs red and bulbous from being strung up.\n\nTorture was not something Russo had anticipated when he took the job. A civilian with a rank equivalent to major working for the RAND Corporation, he had arrived in the South Vietnamese capital on February 22, 1965, and was briefed on his mission. Russo was to meet the enemy face-to-face and figure out what made them tick. On that first day, he could hear General Richard Stilwell, chief of staff of Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV), barking orders from the next room: \u201cYou get every goddamn plane in the air that you can!\u201d\n\nRusso thought the war would be over in a few weeks, months at worst.\n\nInstead of the limited conflict he expected, years slipped by. Bombs fell, villages were decimated, the fabric of Vietnamese life assaulted. Russo persisted with his interviews of Vietcong prisoners, witnessing the after-effects of torture in nearly every instance.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint just when the shift occurred in the young man who came to Southeast Asia to \u201cpromote democracy.\u201d But as one tour of duty extended to two, contact with the enemy changed not their hearts and minds, but his. On the eve of the 1968 Tet Offensive, he returned to the United States intent on challenging the war, a chance he would get, helping his friend and RAND co-worker Daniel Ellsberg with the Pentagon Papers.\n\nThat secret history of U.S. decision-making in Vietnam, a massive compilation of internal government memoranda and analyses, had been quietly commissioned by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in 1967 to assess what had gone wrong in Vietnam. Ellsberg leaked the Papers to the press in mid-1971, setting off a political firestorm and First Amendment crisis. He would be indicted on charges of espionage, conspiracy, and theft of government property, and would face a maximum penalty of 115 years in prison. Charges were also brought against Russo, who was suspected of complicity, after he refused to testify before a grand jury. He was jailed for 47 days for contempt and faced a possible sentence of 35 years in prison if convicted.\n\nEllsberg\u2019s leak led to a Supreme Court decision on prior restraint, a landmark First Amendment case. Though all the charges were ultimately dropped, the leak and its aftermath had major political fallout, contributing to the demise of the presidency of Richard Nixon and forming a dramatic chapter on the path to U.S. defeat in Vietnam.\n\nEllsberg became a twentieth-century hero, applauded in print and film, his name nearly synonymous with the Pentagon Papers, but Russo, the young accomplice who goaded Ellsberg to go public, has been nearly forgotten. Yet he was, according to Ellsberg, the first person to document the systematic torture of enemy combatants in Vietnam. If no one knows this, it\u2019s because his report on the subject remains buried in the vaults of the RAND Corporation, the think tank that did research for the Pentagon in Vietnam. Similarly, while the use of unprecedented airpower against the civilian populations of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia inspired international calls for war crimes trials in the 1970s, Russo\u2019s exposure of the fabrication of data that propped up that air war remains but a footnote in Vietnam War historiography, unknown to all but a handful of academics.\n\nHe has remained \u201cthe other conspirator.\u201d Ellsberg later conceded that he probably wouldn\u2019t have thought of releasing the Papers if Russo hadn\u2019t prodded him to \u201cput that out\u201d and helped copy them in a series of all-night sessions. But Russo would take a backseat to Ellsberg, who had snuck the massive set of documents out of RAND headquarters and released them to the New York Times, the Washington Post, and 18 other news organizations.\n\nThe two of them would become the antiwar movement\u2019s odd couple. Ellsberg was articulate, suave, and fashionable; Russo opted for hippie attire, long hair, and impossibly bushy sideburns, a style of dress that fit with his growing political radicalism. Russo and his attorney, Leonard Weinglass, devised a bold \u2014 some said reckless \u2014 defense strategy focused on using expert witness testimony to put the U.S. prosecution of the war on trial. Weinglass would emerge as a star attorney on the case, even \u2014 in the opinion of some observers \u2014 eclipsing Ellsberg\u2019s senior lawyer, Leonard Boudin. But his client kept getting into trouble: scrawling a wiseacre comment on evidence before the court, handing a prosecution witness a press release that accused him of war crimes, peppering his statements to the press with movement jargon. In the end, Russo\u2019s leftwing antics would help marginalize him and bury the story he had to tell.\n\nThe Think Tank\n\nIt all started in a nondescript mid-century building on Main Street in sunny Santa Monica, California. There, the RAND Corporation, a quasi-private think tank with a cozy relationship with the Air Force and Washington power brokers, dreamed up study projects for the Department of Defense.\n\nRAND, an acronym for \u201cresearch and development,\u201d was launched in 1946 as a private research arm of the Army Air Forces, whose successor, the Air Force, would remain its primary financial backer and client for years to come. The think tank\u2019s work ranged from weapons development to advanced strategic thinking on how to wage \u2014 or avert \u2014 nuclear war. RAND theorists would set the parameters for strategic defense thinking for decades, with the likes of Herman Kahn, once dubbed the \u201cheavyweight of the megadeath intellectuals\u201d; Thomas Schelling, Nobel laureate in economics for his work on game theory and the originator of \u201ctacit bargaining\u201d; and Albert Wohlstetter, the godfather of RAND\u2019s nuclear strategists who devised the concepts of \u201csecond strike,\u201d \u201cfail safe,\u201d and what he called the \u201cdelicate balance of terror\u201d (aka \u201cdeterrence\u201d).\n\nIn 1961, as President John F. Kennedy launched a counterinsurgency effort that would see its first expression in Vietnam, the think tank took on the study of guerilla war, falling into an easy alliance with the Department of Defense and Robert S. McNamara, the numbers man at its head. Thinking he could apply a systems analysis approach to national defense, Secretary of Defense McNamara had turned to the leader in the field for ideas and manpower. From RAND, he recruited heavily to help lead the counterinsurgency charge in Vietnam, creating a team popularly known as \u201cMcNamara\u2019s Whiz Kids.\u201d And he turned to RAND for an answer to an essential strategic question: \u201cWhat makes the Vietcong tick?\u201d\n\n\u201cM&M\u201d would become the institution\u2019s shorthand for the Vietcong Motivation and Morale Study that resulted, an attempt to apply social science to the study of enemy motivation. Russo was eager to join the effort. Elizabeth Gibbs, who married him in 1964, said that her young husband was preoccupied with the threat of guerilla war and wanted to see action on the front lines of the counterinsurgency effort.\n\nFascinated by flight, Russo had pursued aeronautical engineering in a cooperative work-study program run by Virginia Polytechnic Institute and NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center, where he worked on the first Mercury space capsule. He then went to graduate school at Princeton, specializing in plasma physics. After just a year there, however, he took up the study of national defense policy at its Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, receiving master\u2019s degrees in both engineering and public affairs in 1964. An ambitious academic, he also exhibited an unruly, prankster side. In one of his moments of youthful excess \u2014 a story he liked to tell \u2014 he cemented a commode to a Virginia war memorial, an act that might be considered a foreshadowing of things to come.\n\nAt Princeton, Russo studied under four men he called \u201cheavyweights\u201d: Oskar Morgenstern, an originator with Schelling of game theory; Cold War theorists Klaus Knorr and George Kennan; and Richard Falk, an expert on international law and the lone dove among Russo\u2019s mentors. Falk argued against the move to RAND. But Russo, impressed by the think tank\u2019s influence in the highest echelons of U.S. policymaking, jumped at the opportunity. Within six months he had secured an assignment to Vietnam.\n\nRusso arrived in Saigon in February 1965 and met Leon Goure, his boss and future nemesis, just as the U.S. bombing campaign against North Vietnam was beginning and only two weeks before the first United States Marines landed at Danang. His job was to meet the enemy.\n\nThe M&M\n\n\u201cHow many people in your village work for the Front?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone in the village works for the Front,\u201d the prisoner responded in Vietnamese, translated by the young man at Russo\u2019s side. His village was in the Cu Chi district, an area near Saigon under Vietcong control. Russo would later describe it as the birthplace of southern resistance to the French and then American armies. Despite their vastly superior arms, the South Vietnamese Army and its American allies rarely ventured into the prisoner\u2019s village for fear of the VC\u2019s deadly resistance methods.\n\n\u201cHow was your village defended?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cIt had pit traps with bamboo spikes, grenade booby traps. It was surrounded by bamboo hedges,\u201d the prisoner responded and then explained in detail how the villagers organized their resistance.\n\nPhysically fit and tall, Russo towered over the former cadre. He felt anything but complacent, however, about the enemy he faced, having barely escaped a bomb that had recently exploded in a Saigon restaurant where he was planning to have dinner.\n\n\u201cWhy does the Vietcong use terrorism against women and children?\u201d Russo asked. Until now, he had been careful to call the enemy military by its homegrown name, \u201cthe Front,\u201d rather than the pejorative \u201cVietcong.\u201d Emotion must have caused him to break protocol.\n\nHe was part of the second M&M study team. Joseph Zasloff and John Donnell, analysts from the initial team, had reported their results in Washington at a meeting attended by Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs John T. McNaughton and Henry Rowen (who would later head RAND). They described the Vietcong as a unified, disciplined army that already acted as an alternative government in large swaths of South Vietnam with widespread support from the population, prompting a shocked McNaughton to comment that it sounded as if the U.S. had signed up with the wrong \u2014 and losing \u2014 side. Daniel Ellsberg, who then worked for McNaughton, witnessed the exchange.\n\nThe Zasloff-Donnell report, however, came too late for an audience that had already made up its mind. The previous March, President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy had urged an expanded war even as the president campaigned for a full term in office with a promise to keep American soldiers out of Vietnam. Meanwhile, within the military, a struggle for dominance was underway, with Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay, instrumental in the founding of RAND, agitating for a bigger role for air power.\n\nThen came the Tonkin Gulf incident in August 1964. As presented by President Lyndon Johnson, the destroyer USS Maddox was innocently sailing through the Gulf of Tonkin when attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats followed, two nights later, by a second attack on the Maddox and the USS Turner Joy. Johnson ordered military action \u201cin reply,\u201d and Congress quickly passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution giving the president carte blanche to repeatedly intensify the war. The claim of two separate attacks would, however, prove untrue, as Daniel Ellsberg would attest. It had been his first night on the job in the Pentagon.\n\nAt RAND, the stage was set for Leon Goure, an analyst acclaimed for his work on Soviet civil defense preparations. Goure had toured Vietnam and visited RAND\u2019s Saigon operation in 1964. Upon his return to the U.S., he proposed that the M&M project be redefined with a critical twist. No longer would it focus solely on an assessment of enemy motivation and morale. It would now identify what kinds of weaponry would be most likely to demoralize that enemy, with an emphasis on air power.\n\nA meeting with his friend LeMay cemented the deal. He would later report that \u201cby the strings he pulled, LeMay assured continuation of the project\u201d under Goure\u2019s lead. At that time, the Air Force still provided two-thirds of RAND\u2019s funding, a connection the new lead analyst made no attempt to hide.\n\nThe Answer Is Always Bombing\n\nSusan Morrell could scarcely believe it. As RAND\u2019s Saigon-based administrative assistant, it fell to her to pick up her new boss at the airport on his arrival. Making the Vietnam version of small talk on the way back to town, she asked Goure if he planned to use the existing protocol for enemy interviews or wanted to start over from scratch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the answer right here,\u201d he responded with a pat on his briefcase.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Morrell.\n\n\u201cWhen the Air Force is footing the bill, the answer is always bombing.\u201d\n\nDecades later, Morrell told RAND historian Mai Elliott that it was a moment seared into her memory and in those early days she wasn\u2019t the only RAND staffer to observe Goure\u2019s special affinity for the Air Force. At their first meeting, for instance, Russo remembered Goure commenting on that service\u2019s unhappiness with the Zasloff-Donnell study. Zasloff himself was still in Saigon when Goure arrived and would soon accuse his successor of pandering to the Air Force. Half a century later, in a phone interview just before his death, Zasloff still lamented that his intelligence data hadn\u2019t changed the course of the war and Goure\u2019s had.\n\nGoure\u2019s work on Soviet civil defense was then widely known. In 1961, he claimed that the Soviets had trained 50 million citizens in civil defense procedures, were readying a massive system of bomb shelters to ride out a nuclear conflagration, and so were preparing to absorb a preemptive nuclear strike. His research seemed to have frightening implications: U.S. reliance on what was then called mutual assured destruction, or MAD, to stop a nuclear war suddenly appeared insufficient. The Soviets could strike preemptively if they thought national survival after a nuclear attack was possible. Kennedy stepped into the heated debate in July 1961 with a call for a $207 million appropriation for civil defense. That October, he began to encourage Americans to build their own private shelters for protection from nuclear fallout. Goure became a sought after expert.\n\nIn fact, his work would be challenged by New York Times journalist Harrison Salisbury, who questioned Goure\u2019s sources, found observers who vigorously challenged his conclusions, and made his own 12,000-mile trip across the Soviet Union and found them unsubstantiated. But nothing, it seemed, could crack Goure\u2019s reputation in Washington.\n\nThe year 1961 had been a seminal moment for Russo, too. His lifelong friend and future technology consultant William Grossmann recalled them driving to their NASA jobs together, one day in Russo\u2019s white 1959 Ford convertible, the next in Grossmann\u2019s white Chevy convertible \u2014 and on weekends, sharing heady conversation and wooing girls. The two like-minded Southerners had each taken stands against segregation, while worrying about the bomb, totalitarianism, and the \u201ccontainment\u201d of Communism. They were impressed that Kennedy had forced the Russians to stand down in the Cuban missile crisis. The same, both believed, could happen in Vietnam. On arrival in Saigon, Russo wrote Grossmann that the Vietnamese \u201care going to have to get used to it. We\u2019re going to have to be the policemen for a while.\u201d\n\nRusso found himself at the epicenter of American intelligence-gathering in Vietnam. RAND\u2019s Saigon villa became the requisite \u201cprestige stop\u201d for anyone with an interest in the war. By day, it served as a command center; at night, it hosted dinner parties for visiting luminaries, high-ranking figures in the military, the CIA, and members of the press. Goure was the star attraction. In that initial critical period of massive escalation, he provided the perfect mix of optimistic analysis and an engaging personality and so became the \u201cgo to\u201d intelligence man in town.\n\nThough Goure wrote research memoranda, RAND\u2019s usual stock in trade, it was on the briefing circuit that he truly shone. His message, reported directly to Westmoreland, the top military commander in Vietnam, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of Defense McNamara, and others at the Pentagon, was unambiguous: the Vietcong were losing their resolve in the face of U.S. military might, especially airpower. Goure quickly established himself as the Air Force\u2019s best pitchman.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate his influence. McNamara was so enamored of his message that, on first hearing him in June 1965, he offered to up the M&M budget on the spot from $100,000 to $1,000,000. As one analyst later quipped, the secretary of defense \u201clapped up Goure\u2019s analysis like good scotch.\u201d Journalists repeated his claim that the Vietcong were heading for defeat as the daily body count became a staple of war coverage.\n\nRusso, who attended some of Goure\u2019s Saigon briefings, remembered how he liked to brag that RAND had \u201cthe best damned intelligence in Saigon.\u201d It would take some time for Russo to realize that his boss\u2019s prescription for military success didn\u2019t match the data.\n\nThe Cadre from Cu Chi\n\nIntent on answering McNamara\u2019s question about what made the Vietcong tick, Russo focused on his interviews with enemy prisoners. With full access and a small team of Vietnamese interviewers under his supervision, he visited detention sites all over South Vietnam, including the CIA\u2019s National Interrogation Center in Saigon. Of all the interviews he conducted, the one with that cadre from Cu Chi would most deeply challenge his assumptions about Vietnam. He kept a copy of it, which he published in the left-leaning magazine Ramparts in October 1972, and spoke about it whenever he could, including at his Pentagon Papers trial.\n\nHe never knew the prisoner\u2019s name; he was identified in the transcript only as AG132. Over the course of two days in May 1965, Russo sat in his cell listening to his views on Vietnamese history, the political forces at play in his country, and Vietcong organizing strategy and tactics. When the cadre blamed the Americans for the deaths of women and children, Russo took a new tack, initiating what he called a \u201cfriendly chat\u201d about world politics, the American role in Vietnam, and the civil rights movement in the U.S.\n\n\u201cEven though I don\u2019t know first hand what it means to be burned out, pillaged, and raped, I grew up knowing it had happened to my ancestors,\u201d Russo would later say. While there is no record of how Russo described his personal history to that cadre, his comments to me years after in private interviews and public conversation provide a window onto what he might well have said. Unemployed and with time on his hands in 1990, Russo held daily court at the Boulangerie, a cafe on Main Street in Santa Monica, just blocks from the RAND Corporation. There, he regaled a small audience with old stories and political analysis.\n\nWith a twinkle in his eye, he would say that the short answer to why he got involved with the Pentagon Papers was that the British had burned his hometown of Holland, Virginia, to the ground. He was proud to call it a hotbed of sedition.\n\nWhile he liked to portray himself as the descendent of America\u2019s first revolutionaries, his Civil War heritage was harder to reconcile. Race was the first issue to challenge his personal worldview. Russo attended a segregated high school and then hung out with black friends he had met working at the local golf course. By the time he got to Virginia Polytechnic, the battle over court-mandated school integration had engulfed the state, with Senator Harry F. Byrd leading the segregationist charge. When Russo got Lionel Hampton to play for a school dance he organized, the university dean, anticipating that a black musician would attract a mixed crowd, demanded that the audience be segregated. Russo defied the order and black and white attendees packed the event.\n\n\u201cWe integrated Burrus Hall,\u201d Russo would say. \u201cI see that as my first political act. We stood up for justice.\u201d\n\nHe had a way of telling and retelling the stories that were most important to him, so I suspect that he told the Cu Chi cadre of his own experience with civil rights in the South. And perhaps, even under those circumstances \u2014 and even through a translator \u2014 made the prisoner laugh, as he had a way of telling a spirited tale.\n\nWhatever he said, it appeared to affect the cadre as he hoped it would for he scribbled in the margin of his notebook, \u201cThe chat proved to be very successful and the subject\u2019s attitude changed visibly.\u201d Their talk then turned back to the situation at hand and the cadre accused the Americans and their South Vietnamese allies of blocking the election, agreed upon in the 1954 Geneva Accords that ended the French War, an election which would almost assuredly have brought Communist leader Ho Chi Minh to power and reunified Vietnam. A group of schoolteachers from his village, AG132 told Russo, had been imprisoned simply for writing a petition demanding those elections and peace.\n\nThe prisoner added that local government officials were, in his opinion, directed and controlled by the Americans who had the same intentions as the French colonialists before them. \u201cThe concrete evidence,\u201d said the cadre, \u201cmakes the Americans identical to the French. But much more clever.\u201d He summed the situation up this way: \u201cThe aims of the Americans are very nice. They fight for freedom and equality. It is very nice to talk about a free world, but I have not seen any good deeds. All I saw was evil.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the interview, AG132 had confronted every issue that would later prove troublesome to Russo, including the indiscriminant bombing campaigns, the use of chemical defoliants, and torture.\n\nThe cadre\u2019s analysis clearly unsettled the young American, who saw himself as a liberator, not an occupier. In an interview with filmmaker Peter Davis, he would later acknowledge how disturbed he was when the prisoner insisted that the Vietnamese hated the Americans and admitted that he then tried to defend his country, to show that \u201ceverything about America wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was very disdainful of me, but I was fascinated by him,\u201d Russo said. By the end, \u201cI had a great deal of admiration for him. He recited a poem for me. It was very moving to hear him recite this poem right in the middle of this interrogation room in a jail where I knew people had been tortured, if not killed.\u201d\n\nAG132, Russo later testified, had been tortured on multiple occasions. Historical research, including the work of Alfred McCoy, an expert on CIA torture practices, buttresses Russo\u2019s statements about the brutal treatment of Vietcong prisoners. McCoy, for instance, quotes a military intelligence veteran who told a 1971 House subcommittee that, during his 18-month stint in Vietnam, not a single Vietcong suspect had survived the interrogations he witnessed.\n\nRusso\u2019s interview with AG132 took place only three months after he landed in Saigon. Though he would return to it again and again in the ensuing years, some time would pass before he became convinced that he was actually on the side of the aggressor.\n\nHis wife remembers him still defending U.S. intentions in Vietnam in the spring of 1965. By that summer, however, Russo and other RAND analysts were questioning their boss\u2019s methodology and intentions. They still found themselves reaching conclusions nearly identical to those of Zasloff and Donnell: that the Vietcong represented peasant aspirations and weren\u2019t likely to be bested by air power or any other kind of U.S. military action.\n\nOn a sweltering June day in 1965, Russo and Goure were together when word came in that the most powerful bombers in the U.S. arsenal, B-52s, had been approved for use in Vietnam. Russo knew airplanes and understood full well the kind of destruction B-52s would bring with them. For Goure, the decision was advocacy put into action and he would extol the B-52\u2019s power to destabilize the enemy in his next report. In it, he was careful to note that civilians should be warned of such bombings by leaflets dropped in advance of a raid to insure against any popular backlash.\n\nA month later, Russo would meet an old man at a detainment center clutching one of those warning leaflets. His village had been warned, just as Goure had said, but the bombers came a day early, wiping out nearly all of its inhabitants. \u201cWhy?\u201d he cried. It was a moment Russo would not forget.\n\nBreaking the Enemy\n\nTorture hadn\u2019t been part of the job description when Russo signed on at RAND. Of the first victim he met, he said, \u201cI never will forget. He was washed out, looked very sad. He told the translator that he had been hung up by his thumbs and that they beat him real bad. They thought he had thrown a bomb,\u201d though he proclaimed his innocence.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the first interviews that I did. It was very sobering. I saw that a person could be broken badly.\u201d The interview tape then goes silent for more than a minute as Russo struggled to regain his composure.\n\nHe reported the incident to the American captain who was his contact there only to experience the first of many official brush-offs when it came to torture. Russo said prisoners were tortured \u201cas a matter of course\u201d and reported specific forms of abuse including men being hung by the feet or thumbs, waterboarding, electric shocks to the genitals, and solitary confinement in \u201ca dark cell, a dark, dank, dirty \u2014 very dirty cell.\u201d\n\nIt is no accident that the torture methods he documented are strikingly similar to those revealed in the December 2014 Senate torture report. Vietnam was the first testing ground for what historian McCoy termed a new paradigm in the practice of torture developed by the CIA. The Agency had launched a multi-billion dollar research program on human cognition in search of techniques to protect U.S. forces in the event of capture by the Soviets. Finding that a potent combination of sensory deprivation and \u201cself-inflicted pain\u201d was more effective than centuries-old methods of physical torture and produced profound psychological regression in their test subjects, the CIA applied the same techniques to enemy interrogation. While they emphasized destruction of the psyche, physical brutalization was also employed. In Vietnam, this included electric shocks, beatings, rape, and the deaths of prisoners in \u201cpump and dump\u201d procedures, named for the process of pumping detainees for information and then dumping their bodies. Russo was witnessing the beginnings of what would become institutionalized CIA torture practices that would span four decades and four continents.\n\nWhen asked about torture performed by Americans, Russo said a \u201cCIA man\u201d at the National Interrogation Center in Saigon told him in great detail on numerous occasions about the Agency\u2019s torture techniques, including in one case the hanging of a man by his feet while a \u201cpiano wire noose was slipped around his genitals.\u201d The CIA operative, he said, grinned as he told him that the prisoner never talked.\n\nRusso documented every instance of torture he encountered. He later wrote that the interview reports were full of \u201cembarrassing stories of atrocities and crimes against humanity\u201d and he argued bitterly with Goure over his boss\u2019s order to \u201csanitize\u201d the interview transcripts by removing all mention of abuse. Though Russo defied the order, Goure controlled the final drafts.\n\nThen there was the torture paper that Ellsberg has repeatedly said was the first to document American complicity in the routine use of torture and one of three papers that would ultimately get Russo fired. That document was either squashed in internal review or it remains classified, presumably buried somewhere in the think tank\u2019s archives.\n\nThere is no reliable information on how much of RAND\u2019s Vietnam-era work still remains off limits to the public. The think tank responded to a 2013 request of mine for Russo\u2019s and other missing reports by saying that the \u201cdocuments you have requested have not been cleared for public release and are not available.\u201d\n\nMaking Russo\u2019s missing torture report public, if it still exists, would provide eyewitness data supporting the burgeoning body of evidence that CIA torture practices have a long and sordid history beginning in Vietnam.\n\nTrouble with the Data\n\nGoure had fabricated his data to emphasize the efficacy and importance of air power and his analysts knew it. At the RAND villa, an open split developed, with Russo leading the group who wanted to expose their boss. He and his roommate, analyst Douglass Scott, spent long nights discussing \u201cwhat to do about Leon.\u201d Finally, with a third analyst, Russell Betts, they wrote the head of RAND\u2019s Social Science department in the spring of 1966 about the improprieties they had found in Goure\u2019s research methodology.\n\nA succession of three RAND envoys came to Saigon to investigate and by summer a controversy raged on both sides of the Pacific. Russo and Scott had been particularly incensed that Goure signed their names to a February 1966 memorandum that again cited the benefits of air power, which was increasingly targeting rural villages, and proposed that the refugee crisis offered \u201ca major opportunity to pacify\u201d the population. It also pointed out that the chemicals that came to be known as Agent Orange could control movement of the population while also denying food to the guerillas. Russo and Scott fought to get their names removed without success. Around the time their whistleblowing letter hit Santa Monica, Goure amplified his arugument, proposing that the U.S. adopt a deliberate program to generate refugees.\n\nMeanwhile, Goure\u2019s prescriptions for success were being passed up the chain of command. The president\u2019s phone records show McNamara using the February report to offer encouragement to Johnson that the American counterinsurgency operation was working. Influential Washington columnist Drew Pearson would capture Goure\u2019s effect on the president in his famous May 1966 comment: \u201cFor the first time [he] sees light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\n\nAt this point, RAND\u2019s leadership knew that Goure\u2019s data, relied upon by both the Pentagon and President Johnson, was questionable at best and decided to pull Goure from the M&M study. The think tank couldn\u2019t, however, get rid of him. He had secured his position with a direct line to the White House through National Security Adviser Walt Rostow, a hawk, architect of Vietnam policy, and staunch Goure supporter. Thanks in part to him, President Johnson, who reportedly sometimes carried a summary of Goure\u2019s conclusions in his pocket for discussions with journalists, would continue to ride a wave of optimism in this period.\n\nThough Russo never let his wife in on his conflict with Goure \u2014 he was, Gibbs said, too conscious of his secrecy oath to disclose such problems \u2014 she saw a changed man when he visited her in Bangkok on leave in November 1965. He was morose and withdrawn. When they returned to Santa Monica at the end of his first tour of duty in September 1966, Russo set to work at RAND headquarters trying to counter the most pernicious aspects of what he\u2019d witnessed. Off work, he took to the hills of Topanga Canyon on his motorcycle, leaving Gibbs home alone. They would soon divorce.\n\nOutside of RAND, the flaws in Goure\u2019s analysis would gradually be noted. Westmoreland expressed his first doubts in late 1965 and McNamara began to worry when the general upped his request for new ground troops to 410,000 that winter. In February 1966, the secretary of defense confided to a few journalists that \u201cno amount of bombing can end the war,\u201d though he continued to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of confidence in the war effort.\n\nThe bombing levels were by then unprecedented in the history of air power. From March 1965 through November 1968, Operation Rolling Thunder unleashed 800 tons of munitions a day on North Vietnam, a total of a million bombs, rockets, and missiles. Even more bombs were dropped in the South with estimates ranging from seven million to eight million tons of them, not to mention 70 million liters of defoliants, as well as napalm and other anti-personnel weapons. Then, of course, there was the massive bombing of neighboring Laos and later Cambodia.\n\nYet victory never came into view. Instead of drawing down, the administration only intensified the air war, sidelining the doubters, including \u2014 as he grew ever more disillusioned \u2014 McNamara himself. In August 1967, he testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the air raids had not broken Vietcong morale and that, short of the \u201cvirtual annihilation of North Vietnam and its people,\u201d the air war could not succeed. Johnson quickly forced him out of the administration. At his farewell luncheon, a Johnson aide reported that the secretary of defense\u2019s voice broke and there were tears in his eyes as he spoke of the futility of the air war. Later, he would acknowledge more than two million Vietnamese deaths.\n\nKnowing the cause was lost, McNamara had by then ordered the production of the Pentagon Papers, the secret history that he hoped would avert future such disasters.\n\nThe Second Tour of Duty\n\nBack in Santa Monica, Russo wrote a critical evaluation of the Motivation and Morale Study, which is still classified. He was also drafting an argument against the defoliation program, already in its sixth year, when, in September 1967, he was called back to Vietnam for a six-month tour of duty.\n\nHe found Saigon changed \u2014 Americanized, overrun with prostitution and corruption, expensive and dirty. Goure at least was gone, removed from the M&M crew in April by RAND\u2019s new president Henry Rowen, who had been at that Zasloff and Donnell debriefing years earlier.\n\nOnce again, Russo felt hopeful that fact-based intelligence could rule the day. His cost analysis of defoliation, written in what he called \u201cRAND systemspeak,\u201d showed that while the chemicals sprayed did little to deprive revolutionary forces of food, they were having a profoundly destructive impact on the civilian population. He estimated that for every pound of food that defoliation denied a guerilla, 100 pounds were denied to civilians. But when he got his moment to brief Westmoreland\u2019s scientific advisor on the subject, he was dismissed in under 15 minutes. Frustrated but undeterred, he set to work disproving a RAND socio-economic study that claimed widespread peasant support for the U.S. backed South Vietnamese army. Again, his work would not be well received.\n\nRusso left Saigon just as the Tet Offensive, a vivid demonstration of the enemy\u2019s resilience, began to unfold on January 30, 1968. He said he could see wrecked planes beneath him as he passed over Danang Air Base.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that he wrote the missing torture report in the early months of 1968, a period when the CIA\u2019s use of torture expanded dramatically under the notorious Phoenix Program.\n\nDuring Russo\u2019s stint in Vietnam, the CIA actually oversaw three separate operations that employed torture: its own interrogation centers, 40 provincial interrogation centers run by Vietnamese with CIA training and supervision, and a training program that schooled 85,000 Vietnamese police in torture techniques, part of a worldwide operation. Russo left Vietnam shortly after the Agency brought the three operations under one counterinsurgency umbrella. The Phoenix Program, designed to destroy the \u201ccivilian infrastructure\u201d of the National Liberation Front, would be one of its major operations.\n\nWilliam Colby, the chief of \u201cpacification\u201d in Vietnam who would later become the CIA\u2019s director, informed a House Operations Subcommittee in July 1971 that the Phoenix Program had killed 20,587 Vietcong suspects. Other sources quote figures as much as four times higher. Russo\u2019s paper had done nothing to stop the carnage.\n\nIn May 1968, the new head of RAND\u2019s economics department fired him. Associates were told to keep their distance from him during the six-month grace period he was given to find other employment. Ellsberg was the only RAND associate who argued for his reinstatement.\n\nMeanwhile, though relieved of leadership of the M&M, Goure held onto a job at RAND, even returning to Vietnam in 1968 as head of a new study of enemy infiltration rates. He would finally leave in 1969 to become the director of Soviet studies at the University of Miami. There, he would contribute his \u201cexpertise\u201d to another front in the war against Communism: Cuba.\n\nIn fact, Goure\u2019s \u201cbest damned intelligence\u201d had proved to be an intelligence debacle for the ages. After Ellsberg and Russo took the Pentagon Papers public, Russo was eager to expose one thing that mammoth document hadn\u2019t: how a single think tank under contract to the government and far from the public eye, along with its highly touted expert in counterinsurgency warfare, had disastrously affected policy from behind the scenes.\n\nHis two Ramparts expos\u00e9s (one aptly titled \u201cThe RAND Papers\u201d) and his testimony at his trial were generally ignored by the mainstream media. Goure\u2019s reputation remained remarkably unsullied and he would continue to be a player in the formulation of foreign policy. In 1980, for example, he was invited onto a panel of advisers to presidential hopeful Ronald Reagan. In 1991, by then the director of Soviet studies at Science Applications International Corporation, he participated in an International Security Council round table discussion of future Russian military policy. Past and future Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in attendance.\n\nMuch of his work, however, was conducted in the shadows. He died in 2007. Stanford University holds the Goure Papers collection, a testament to his enduring legacy. Anthony Russo would not fare so well.\n\nCharged With Espionage\n\n\u201cRusso weeps as he tells jury about change in views on war,\u201d read the New York Timesheadline on the 66th day of the Pentagon Papers trial when Russo told the story of the Cu Chi cadre to the jury.\n\nHe had already published the cadre interview in Ramparts. Now, he again turned to the Vietcong prisoner who had come to symbolize for him all that was wrong with U.S. policy in Vietnam. As he would confide to filmmaker Peter Davis, the memory of that prisoner never left him. He was convinced that if other Americans met their enemy, if he could give that enemy a human face, the public would fully abandon Washington\u2019s efforts to destroy them.\n\nHe compared the depersonalization of the Vietnamese to the Nazi depiction of the Jews. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know who the Vietnamese people are, it is much easier to be racist. It\u2019s much easier to kill them. This really is a lesson from World War II. Racist attitudes made it possible to manifest hatred and to undertake the extermination campaigns. Well, this really is what the United States is doing in Vietnam. The United States is exterminating the Vietnamese. And the United States couldn\u2019t do this, no American, no human being could do this, if he really knew who the Vietnamese are.\u201d\n\nIn the trial\u2019s aftermath, Russo would be progressively marginalized, his claims about the M&M study ignored or written off as the ravings of a leftwing radical. But in its heady days, he reveled in his whistleblower role. Ten months after it began, prosecutor David Nissen\u2019s case was in shambles. Revelations that the government wiretapped the defendants had resulted in a Supreme Court-ordered stay and then mistrial in its first round. And it had only got worse.\n\nSoon enough, the press revealed that President Nixon\u2019s right-hand man, John Erlichman, had introduced presiding trial judge William Byrne, Jr., to the president in his home and had discussed his possible appointment as FBI director \u2014 a clear impropriety in the middle of an espionage case. And then it hit the news that convicted Watergate conspirators G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt, Jr., had burglarized the office of Daniel Ellsberg\u2019s psychiatrist.\n\nOn April 30, 1973, just days after the first news of that burglary, which tied the Pentagon Papers case to Watergate, a set of dominoes lay on the prosecution table. Each domino was labeled \u2014 Hunt, Liddy, Erlichman, Byrne, and so on \u2014 the last domino had Nixon\u2019s name. It was Russo\u2019s prank.\n\nOn May 1st, Erlichman\u2019s domino fell when the news broke that he had admitted to the FBI his knowledge of the break-in at the office of Ellsberg\u2019s psychiatrist. On May 2nd, the last domino did indeed fall. It was revealed that President Nixon had been informed of that break-in at least a week before the court knew about it.\n\nOn May 11th, Judge Byrne dismissed all charges against Ellsberg and Russo.\n\nPostscript: Validation by RAND\n\nSeventeen years later, Russo told me that a single realization had changed his mind about the war. He had, he said, been misinformed about the Vietcong. \u201cThey were not the enemy we were told they were.\u201d\n\nI asked what had most surprised him in his interviews with Vietnamese prisoners.\n\n\u201cThe extent to which they cared about principle,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe extent to which they had legitimacy, every reason in the world to be fighting. They were very admirable and very likeable. Very likeable. Natural friends of Americans.\u201d\n\nAs for his participation in the release of the Pentagon Papers, he summed up his reasons in a single sentence: \u201cIt would have been un-American not to do it.\u201d\n\nRusso died in 2008 before RAND verified his claims about the Motivation and Morale Study in an extensive history written by Mai Elliott (herself a former M&M interviewer and interpreter) under contract to RAND and published in 2010. Her book, RAND in Southeast Asia: A History of the Vietnam War Era, forms a fitting sequel to the Pentagon Papers, with a carefully documented tale of how intelligence can go terribly wrong.\n\nElliott\u2019s book validates nearly all of Russo\u2019s claims. It confirms, for instance, that Goure did act as a pitchman for the air war, selling a prescription for military success that didn\u2019t faintly match the data at hand. It details Goure\u2019s outsized influence on policymakers and Russo\u2019s claim that evidence of torture by U.S. forces and allies was systematically removed under Goure\u2019s orders. She even quotes former RAND President Gus Shubert\u2019s admission that the assignment of Goure to the Motivation and Morale Study appeared to represent collusion between his RAND predecessor and the Air Force, which he termed a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Elliott, and by extension RAND, corroborate and elaborate on nearly every claim Russo made in his 1972 Ramparts articles. Only one of Russo\u2019s charges was rejected: that the think tank was complicit in war crimes.\n\nNever one to mince words, Russo called the M&M a \u201cwhitewash of genocide\u201d and \u201ca justification of genocide cloaked in the mantle of RAND social science,\u201d accusations that echoed growing popular sentiment for war crimes trials and that must have held terrible personal resonance for a man whose name is there in black and white, attached to the call for the ever greater use of air power, defoliation, and the displacement of rural populations as tools of war.\n\nToday, Anthony Russo is gone, his report on torture disappeared, and his legacy perhaps doomed to obscurity. RAND, meanwhile, continues to churn out studies for the military; the Air Force continues to drop bombs and fire missiles from Iraq to Afghanistan, Pakistan to Yemen; the CIA continues to cover-up its torture policies. But Russo\u2019s spiritual descendants, whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning of WikiLeaks fame, John Kiriakou who exposed CIA torture, and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden live on, each putting his freedom on the line just as Russo did. Whether or not any of the whistleblowers of the post-9/11 era knew Russo\u2019s story, they benefitted from a tradition he, Ellsberg, and others of their generation had helped to pioneer.\n\nIt\u2019s a testament to the explosive nature of Russo\u2019s revelations that, almost 50 years later, RAND still keeps his report on CIA torture in Vietnam a secret \u2014 as the Pentagon Papers might be today if he had not convinced Daniel Ellsberg to make them public. It\u2019s a tribute to Russo that his critical evaluation of the Motivation and Morale Study remains classified as well.\n\nCall it an irony, but Dwight D. Eisenhower, the president who articulated the domino theory that brought Russo to Vietnam, crafted the words that might be most fitting for his epitaph years before he arrived in Vietnam. In his 1961 farewell address, Eisenhower focused on twin internal threats: \u201cthe military-industrial complex,\u201d which he first named, and its forgotten corollary: that public policy could become the captive of a \u201cscientific-technological elite.\u201d Russo, who railed against RAND\u2019s secret and deadly influence until his dying day, couldn\u2019t have said it better.\n\nBarbara Myers is a journalist, educator, and activist.
