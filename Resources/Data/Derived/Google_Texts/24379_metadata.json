It\u2019s sponsored by St. Paul-based Beacon Interfaith Housing Collaborative, a group of 50 congregations working to end homelessness in the Twin Cities.\n\nBut the result is no surprise, said Anne Mavity, Beacon\u2019s director of new projects. Other projects were further along in development, and Beacon didn\u2019t really expect state funding this year for 66 West. The group\u2019s focus this year was Prior Crossing, an affordable-housing development in St. Paul, which received $5 million in state money.\n\n\u201cWe play the long game on these projects,\u201d Mavity said Friday. \u201cIt often takes several years [to secure funding]. We think we\u2019re very well positioned for next year.\u201d\n\nSpecific land use approvals and zoning changes for 66 West need to be worked out over the next year, she said: \u201cWe are on the way, but there\u2019s still work to do.\u201d\n\nMavity said projects like 66 West are crucial as new development crowds out affordable housing in many areas of the metro region.\n\n\u201cThe people who are working at restaurants, grooming dogs or working as cashiers may be fully employed and still not able to access affordable housing in their communities,\u201d she said. \u201cAs the governor pointed out at the funding announcement, despite the record amount of money available [for affordable housing], we still had three times as many applications as they were able to fund.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 66 West project, approved by the Edina City Council last month, wasn't included in a record $162 million pot of state funding for affordable housing announced this week.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The 66 West project, approved by the Edina City Council last month, wasn't included in a record $162 million pot of state funding for affordable housing announced this week.", "title": "Edina housing project for homeless youths won't go forward this year", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/edina-housing-project-for-homeless-youths-won-t-go-forward-this-year/280321082/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/10005981+dd08+558775+7edina090314.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/10005981+dd08+558775+7edina090314.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 66 West project, approved by the Edina City Council last month, wasn't included in a record $162 million pot of state funding for affordable housing announced this week.", "title": "Edina housing project for homeless youths won't go forward this year", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/edina-housing-project-for-homeless-youths-won-t-go-forward-this-year/280321082/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/10005981+dd08+558775+7edina090314.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/10005981+dd08+558775+7edina090314.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "homeless youth"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "66 West,Beacon Interfaith Housing Collaborative,Edina,homeless youth"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf7c\"", "article_summary": "A much-debated affordable housing project for homeless youth in the western suburbs won\u2019t get underway any time soon.\nThe 66 West project, approved by the Edina City Council last month, wasn\u2019t included in a record $162 million pot of state funding for affordable housing announced this week.\nThe $9 million development would create 39 studio apartments in an existing TCF Bank building off W. 66th Street in the Southdale area.\nOther projects were further along in development, and Beacon didn\u2019t really expect state funding this year for 66 West.\n\u201cThe people who are working at restaurants, grooming dogs or working as cashiers may be fully employed and still not able to access affordable housing in their communities,\u201d she said."}
