This morning on “Fox and Friends,” hosts discussed the killing of unarmed teen Michael Brown, and the release of surveillance video from a convenience store. The tape shows a young man, allegedly Michael Brown, involved in a “strong-arm” robbery, where a pack of cigars was taken.

The “Fox and Friends” hosts, rather than discuss this young man’s death, or racism, or any of the other important issues surrounding the death of this 18-year-old, questioned the federal government’s involvement in the investigation. They took issue with the 40 FBI agents canvassing the streets, and the recent news that the Department of Justice did not want the tape released, fearing that it might incite more violence.

“Why would the Justice Department pressure them not to?” Tucker Carlson demanded. “Obviously it’s not to keep the situation under control … [The FBI] refused to intervene when people were looting stores. So if you had an interest in keeping the situation under control, you would control the situation by preventing people from stealing wigs.”
