Veteran defenseman Erik Johnson, who can be an unrestricted free agent next July if he hasn’t re-signed with the Avalanche, said Friday he won’t talk about his contract situation. At least not after this.

“I’ve maintained a very, very strong desire to stay in Colorado,” Johnson said. “I really love playing in Denver and I love my teammates. I love the coaching staff and I love playing for Patrick (Roy), and having Joe (Sakic) in charge is awesome.

“It’s my desire to stay here, but it has to work for both sides and I’m all for working with the team and trying to fit into the structure. I’m not out to get something over my value on the market. I’m going to work with them and I hope they work with me and we can get something done.”

He added, “I’m a big believer that you have to think about hockey and hockey only. If you have other stuff, that can distract you. I think it’s only detrimental and you don’t want that distraction, with reporters just coming in after practice and just talking about your contract. You want to talk about the team, and I’d like to get it done as soon as possible so it’s not a distraction.”

Johnson, 27, was having a career year when he underwent arthroscopic knee surgery during the all-star break and didn’t play again last season. He skated and seemed to be trying to get back in the lineup, but never did.

“After today I’m very pleased with how I feel,” he said after practice at training camp. “I feel like I’ve taken my game to another level as far as conditioning, and as far as my knee injury there’s no issue whatsoever.”
