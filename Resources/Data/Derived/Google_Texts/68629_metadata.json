The problem, however, is that he lacks authority to justify the unilateral actions he is planning, which include \u201ca systematic campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists.\u201d\n\nAny campaign against ISIL needs to be planned carefully. History shows us that fighting against admittedly terrible actors can lead to bad, though unintended, consequences. ISIL itself would not exist if the U.S. had not invaded Iraq in 2003 under false pretenses.\n\nBut even before we address this question\u2014how to plan a fight against ISIL\u2014we must confront the question of legitimacy.\n\nCongress has the sole authority to declare war under the Constitution. The President possesses limited emergency power to unilaterally order military action when necessary for self-defense\u2014for instance, to respond to a sudden attack against the U.S. when there is no time to consult Congress.\n\nIn all other cases, it is necessary for the President to obtain advance congressional authorization for military action. In 2007, then-candidate Obama acknowledged this, conceding that \u201c[t]he President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.\u201d\n\nAs President, Obama has deviated from this principle.\n\nThree years ago in Libya, the Obama administration claimed authority to unilaterally order military action outside the self-defense context so long as the President was acting in the national interest and military action did not rise to the level of war or \u201chostilities.\u201d\n\nLast month, President Obama claimed the authority to act unilaterally in ordering air strikes against ISIL forces in Iraq.\n\nIn last week\u2019s speech, the President failed to make clear why he believes he has authority to order air strikes against ISIL in Syria. He did, however, make clear that he believes he can act now without specific authorization from Congress, saying that \u201cI have the authority to address the threat from ISIL\u201d and describing congressional support for his actions as \u201cwelcome\u201d but presumably not necessary.\n\nThis is puzzling, and it is dangerous, in part because Obama\u2019s successors might cite it as precedent for unrestrained action.\n\nIt is puzzling because President Obama did not take the opportunity to clearly explain why he believes he has authority to act. An unnamed \u201csenior administration official\u201d has suggested that the President\u2019s authority stems from the 2001 AUMF, passed a few days after the 9/11 attacks, and authorizing the President \u201cto use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons.\u201d\n\nThe 2001 AUMF clearly provided authority for military action against al Qaeda and the Taliban. But citing the 2001 AUMF to apply to ISIL, a group that did not exist on Sept. 11, 2001 and is a rival of al-Qaeda is \u201cquite a stretch,\u201d as Wells Bennett observed. In other words, the 2001 AUMF is a mere fig leaf that fails to conceal the reality that President Obama is once again acting alone.\n\nSome members of Congress have expressed concern about presidential overreach\u2014but they generally have limited their criticisms to the domestic sphere.\n\nMost notably, Speaker Boehner is organizing a lawsuit against President Obama, charging him with exceeding his constitutional authority by delaying implementation of the Affordable Care Act. That lawsuit is misconceived\u2014the President has solid reasons for defending his unilateral actions in the domestic context.\n\nIf Speaker Boehner and other members of Congress are serious about confronting the problem of presidential overreach, now is their time to act. President Obama\u2019s plan for military action in Syria is a real example of presidential overreach, unlike the ginned-up concerns about implementation of the ACA. Though the President claims a statutory basis for acting, in reality he is acting alone, without congressional authorization\u2014just as he did in Libya and Iraq.\n\nIt is essential for members of Congress to reject the President\u2019s unilateral action and to debate the matter themselves. If Congress specifically authorizes action against ISIL in Syria, then the President will have the authority he needs under U.S. law. Right now, he does not have that authority, and the action he announced is simply illegitimate.\n\nChris Edelson is an assistant professor of government in American University\u2019s School of Public Affairs.
