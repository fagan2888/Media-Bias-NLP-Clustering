After three bush flights, I found myself at an airstrip in Northern Tanzania\u2019s Serengeti National Park, where the flights to Rubondo originate.\n\n\u201cIs this your first visit to the island?\u201d my young, RayBan-sporting South African pilot, Denise Ellinas, asked me as we walked to the plane ahead of the handful of other visitors. \u201cYes,\u201d I nodded, wondering if she could possibly be mistaking me for the sort of adventurer who makes a habit of returning to one of Africa\u2019s remotest corners.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve flown all across Africa and I can tell you that Rubondo is special\u2014a really unique spot,\u201d Captain Ellinas said.\n\nThe wild and unlikely tale of Rubondo dates to the 1960s, when the Tanzanian National Park service turned over the keys to this densely forested Nantucket-size island in southwestern Lake Victoria to famed German zoologist and Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker Bernhard Grzimek.\n\nQuickly seeing the deserted island\u2019s potential as a protected habitat for endangered wildlife, Mr. Grzimek began to introduce a number of species to the island, including elephants, giraffe and gray parrots. Somewhat surprisingly, all of the newcomers established habitats on the island without upsetting its native wildlife, which includes vervet monkeys, spot-necked otters, crocodiles, hippopotamus and sitatungas (a cousin of the antelope).\n\nBut Mr. Grzimek\u2019s greatest coup remains his successful population of Rubondo with chimpanzees from zoos and circuses across Europe roughly 45 years ago. Unwanted by their previous owners because of aggressive behavior toward humans, the eight males and nine females he brought to the island rapidly adapted to their new home. Today, the colony is thriving and has more than doubled in size.\n\nENLARGE Lake Victoria from Rubondo Island's shoreline Photo: Asilia\n\nAs our plane descended in the fading light after the two-hour flight, Captain Ellinas offered up a quick aerial overview of the island. Just south of the airstrip, on a small beach, sits Rubondo Island Camp, the island\u2019s only guest accommodation, comprised of eight luxury huts, a sprawling open-air main public area and a luxury tree house. To the north of the camp is the ranger station and, at the very top of the island, Africa\u2019s newest\u2014and possibly best-protected\u2014colony of chimpanzees live in the forest under a thick canopy of trees.\n\n\u201cThe chimps are settling into their nests for the night just about now,\u201d Captain Ellinas told us just before we landed. (Chimpanzees, it turns out, literally make their beds almost every night.)\n\nSigning in at the open-air hut that functions as the island\u2019s airport, I felt we\u2019d landed in an otherworldly place. There was no cell service and we were clearly outnumbered by the wildlife. \u201cI\u2019m expecting Mr. Rourke to appear any moment and say \u2018Welcome to Fantasy Island!\u2019\u201d said Jeff Graper, who, along with his wife, Janet, was visiting from Eugene, Ore. Moments later, our guide, a Tanzanian 20-something named Elisante William, greeted us with Champagne on the airstrip.\n\nLater that evening in the open, breezy, public area of the camp, which has an old-school Mexican-resort vibe (shades of \u201cNight of the Iguana,\u201d but in a good way), I met with Mr. William and Milton Mpuche, the camp\u2019s general manager, to talk about tracking the chimpanzees the following day.\n\nI\u2019d read that the odds of actually spotting Rubondo\u2019s chimps, who are naturally wary of humans, are low, and Mr. Mpuche did not offer false hope. \u201cThe rangers have been staying close to the chimpanzees for more than a year to habituate them to humans,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it takes time. Right now you have no more than a 40% chance of seeing them up close.\u201d\n\nEver the optimist, I signed on for a demanding all-day hike deep into the lush, unspoiled forest the next day.\n\nENLARGE Guests fishing in Lake Victoria Photo: Asilia\n\nLake Victoria, nearly the size of Lake Superior, has the sort of imposing white caps you see in the ocean, which made for a bumpy, hourlong speedboat ride to the northernmost tip of the island. When we arrived, Mr. William, two armed park rangers, Mr. Mpuche and I waded to the shore past a few hungry-looking crocodiles and into the thick of the chimpanzee habitat.\n\nThe dark, humid forest streaked with vines seemed prehistoric. Thick fig trees and evergreens created a heavy canopy that made my sunscreen entirely unnecessary. During our grueling five hours of nonstop hiking and bushwhacking, we startled several wide-eyed sitatunga and saw a couple of elephants ambling down a nearby path. We had one \u201cwhoa-that-was-close!\u201d moment with a Great Dane-size monitor lizard and came across dozens of chimpanzee nests, which the animals make from branches. But no matter how hard we strained our eyes in the dimness of the forest, we could not make out a single chimp.\n\n\u2018The dark, humid, vine-streaked forest seemed prehistoric\u2019\n\nAfter pushing our way through bush and shrub, climbing up and down hillsides and through at least a dozen small valleys, our guide told us we were getting close to the chimps. Mr. William radioed ahead, the rangers radioed back; we ran in one direction, the chimps ran in the other. Able to swing from the vines hanging from the fig trees and completely at home on their own turf, the chimps remained consistently just out of sight. Exhausted, we admitted defeat and headed back to camp on the boat. We motored through the lake more slowly this time to watch the white-headed African fish eagles hunting for a meal, crocodiles slipping in at the water\u2019s edge and hippos lazily grazing on the shore.\n\nI spent the remainder of my three days on Rubondo taking shorter hikes in the forest and boating on Lake Victoria to birdwatch while others fished for Nile Perch and tilapia. Oh, and I spent plenty of time by the pool.\n\nENLARGE Jason Lee\n\nWhile wildlife is the highlight of any trip to Rubondo, my night in the Robinson Crusoe-style treehouse was a close second. Perched in a tall tree overlooking Lake Victoria, the open platform with a copper tub and a bed draped in mosquito netting might actually have been my closest chimp encounter: I heard plenty of rustling all through the night, but I can\u2019t say with any certainty which of the noises were made by chimpanzees.\n\nThough I didn\u2019t see any chimps, I agree with fellow guest Mr. Graper, who said, \u201cWould I come back? In a heart beat! It\u2019s worth a second trip even without the chimpanzees.\u201d\n\nSo, Captain Ellinas, I will be returning to Rubondo. I\u2019ll see you next year when, according to Mr. Mpuche, the chimps should be a little more used to human visitors.\n\nThe Lowdown // Chasing Chimpanzees on Rubondo Island\n\nGetting there: KLM flies daily from New York to Tanzania\u2019s Kilimanjaro International Airport. Transfers to Rubondo involve several short flights and average $500 each-way. Contact Hippo Creek Safaris (hippocreeksafaris.com) or another safari specialist for specific routings.\n\nStaying there: Rubondo Island Camp offers luxury accommodations while minimizing impact on the environment.The camp was taken over last year by Asilia, a high-end African-safari camp operator, which upgraded its guiding program and renovated the rooms and public areas. Asilia is working to responsibly habituate the island\u2019s chimpanzee population to human visitors. The camp was recently designated as one of National Geographic\u2019s 38 \u201cUnique Lodges of the World,\u201d which means that it embodies the National Geographic Society\u2019s values of sustainability, authenticity, enrichment and excellence (from about $700 per person per night, including all meals and activities; asiliaafrica.com).\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nElisante William is Mr. William on subsequent references.
