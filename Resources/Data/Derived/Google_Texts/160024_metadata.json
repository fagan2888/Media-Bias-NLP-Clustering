He had missed the previous 18 months after tearing his ACL, undergoing surgery and then having two additional surgeries.\n\n\u201cRight after the game I was talking to the coaches about the bad things that I did,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even focus on the good things that I did.\u201d\n\nBut Gallinari certainly could have. There were a great many of those.\n\n\u201cOther than the points, what I liked was the fact that I didn\u2019t see any hesitation or any timidness on his part at all,\u201d Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said. \u201cHe jumped right in and he was game speed and he threw himself around. So at least initially it looked like he got over that mental block we were talking about.\u201d\n\nShaw went with a Gallo-heavy game plan in the first half, running multiple actions designed to get his versatile scorer good looks. Gallinari also took a couple of opportunities to barrel down the lane, showing no fear of how his knee would react.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I thought I would think about my knee a lot more,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t. I thought about it a couple of times when I was running back on defense\u2026but other than that I didn\u2019t think about it.\u201d\n\nWith the first hurdle cleared, Gallinari will now focus on settling into his role in Shaw\u2019s offense. He had no soreness in his knee Saturday and said he\u2019d be ready to play on Monday against the Bulls in Chicago. His participation will ultimately be a decision the Nuggets\u2019 medical staff makes as they monitor his progress and look to bring him along gradually to be ready for a heavy workload when the regular season begins at month\u2019s end. If Gallinari does play Monday, he\u2019ll be on a similar 15-minute time limit as he was for the Phoenix game.\n\nNo matter what, Gallinari\u2019s start was good news.\n\n\u201cI was feeling good,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cI was trying to be aggressive in order to let it all out and to try to break the ice a little bit, have the right mentality. When you are coming back from a knee injury (you have to) be aggressive and try to not think about it too much and do the things that you\u2019ve been working all summer on the things the coach tells us to do. I thought it was a good beginning.\u201d\n\nFootnote: Kenneth Faried participated in a full practice Sunday after sitting out the Nuggets\u2019 game at Phoenix, partly for rest and partly to rest a sore ankle, which he twisted last week.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Danilo Gallinari not satisfied after first game back with Nuggets", "title": "Danilo Gallinari not satisfied after first game back with Nuggets", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/12/danilo-gallinari-not-satisfied-after-first-game-back-with-nuggets/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141012__gallop1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141012__gallop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-12T16:36:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:11:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "If Gallinari does play Monday, he\u2019ll be on a similar 15-minute time limit as he was for the Phoenix game.\nCall Danilo Gallinari pleased with his first game in 18 months, but just don\u2019t call him satisfied.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even focus on the good things that I did.\u201dBut Gallinari certainly could have.\n\u201cI was feeling good,\u201d Gallinari said.\nThe Nuggets forward scored 17 points in 14 minutes against Phoenix in an exhibition game late Friday."}
