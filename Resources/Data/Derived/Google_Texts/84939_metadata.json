Coastal areas of New Hampshire and Maine could get a little more, up to 8 inches.\n\nPlymouth nurse Kathy McKee was pleasantly surprised when the storm didn\u2019t dump as much snow as predicted. When she left her home, only 3 to 4 inches of snow had fallen, compared to some forecasts that had predicted as much as 10 inches.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relieved now and back looking forward to spring again,\u201d she said.\n\nGreg Crawford, manager of a rental car company in Buzzards Bay, was unimpressed. He took a shot at forecasters who overestimated the storm\u2019s impact.\n\n\u201cI think their ratings are down compared to last year, so they needed something,\u201d he said.\n\nLess snow was expected in New York. A little more than 3 inches had accumulated in Nassau County. New Jersey and Pennsylvania had slight accumulation on cars and grassy surfaces.\n\nSchools across New England either closed for the day or delayed opening by two hours.\n\nPolice in New England reported several morning accidents, likely caused by slick roads.\n\nPower outages were minimal, but dozens of flights in and out of Logan International Airport in Boston were canceled.\n\nKathy Fernandez was unfazed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s New England. No big deal,\u201d said the Providence, Rhode Island, resident, briskly walking to work as flurries fell. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little flurry. For the amount of snow we\u2019ve had this year, I can\u2019t complain.\u201d\n\nThe snow is expected to taper off around midday and then quickly melt as temperatures rise into the 50s by midweek.\n\n___\n\nDenise Lavoie in Whitman, Massachusetts; William Kole in Bourne, Massachusetts; Matt O\u2019Brien in Providence, Rhode Island; Kathy McCormack in Concord, New Hampshire; and Ulana Ilnytzky in New York City contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Feed to Post 3.6", "og": {"site_name": "WCBI.com", "description": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Steady snowfall made for a sloppy Monday morning commute across much of New England, yet many residents were relieved that the spring storm wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as first forecast.
