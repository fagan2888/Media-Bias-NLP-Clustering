A Denver turkey trot has been named one of America’s top 10 turkey trots in the country and one of the nation’s best Thanksgiving events.

The 41st annual Mile High United Way Turkey Trot fundraiser in Denver was ranked in the top 10 turkey trots by Shape Magazine out of 1,300 and was named one of the best Thanksgiving events by Forbes travel blog, according to a news release by Mile High United Way.

The four-mile, family-friendly race will take place at 10 a.m. Thanksgiving morning in Denver’s Washington Park. It is expected to attract more than 10,000 walkers and runners and an additional 10,000 spectators.

“The Mile High United Way Turkey Trot is our largest fundraising event of the year,” said Christine Benero, president and CEO of Mile High United Way. “It’s become a true Thanksgiving tradition for so many, bringing families and friends together to give back to our local community in a fun and meaningful way.”

Entertainment at the race will include live music, booths and a beer garden, the release said.

There is a four-mile course and a quarter-mile family fun run.

Registration costs $45 for adults with discounts for seniors and kids under 12. Participants can register online or beginning at 8 a.m. Thanksgiving morning at South High School’s north lawn across from the event.
