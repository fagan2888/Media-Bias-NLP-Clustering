I just turned 65 and wondered if I can keep it or if I need to quit this plan and enroll in Medicare to avert a late-enrollment penalty? I do not have workplace health insurance.\n\nPhil Moeller: Yes, you must switch onto Medicare. Your enrollment period includes the month you turn 65 and the three months after. But the sooner you switch the better. You don\u2019t want to have a big health care expenses in, say, March, only to discover that your exchange plan is refusing to pay, because it says you\u2019ve turned 65 and should be covered by Medicare. The first thing I\u2019d do is call your current insurer and see what types of Medicare policies it offers. If you like your current plan, I\u2019m betting your insurer would be delighted to move you into a comparable Medicare offering. However, this is also the right time for you to take a broader look at Medicare offerings to make sure you\u2019re making the choice that best fits your health needs. Good luck!\n\nAnn \u2013 Okla.: Is there a schedule of benefits for Medicare like we got from our workplace group insurance plans? I hope this is not a stupid question \u2014 I didn\u2019t know where to look.\n\nPhil Moeller: This is anything but a stupid question. And I bet there are millions of people like you who would love to see a schedule of Medicare benefits. The fact that this information is so hard to compile, let alone find, is an enormous failing on the parts of Medicare and the private insurance companies that sell various Medicare policies. Sure, they each have their own guides. But there is no mechanism to put together all the possible pieces into a complete picture. Maybe someone will write a book about this, and, wait, I just have! It will be out in the fall, by which time you may need to file a Medicare claim, because of how sick you\u2019ll get from reading all of my shameless book plugs.\n\nSeriously, here are some of the Medicare guides produced by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services: \u201cMedicare & You,\u201d \u201cYour Medicare Benefits,\u201d \u201cEnrolling in Medicare Part A & Part B,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s a Medicare Advantage Plan,\u201d \u201cYour Guide to Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage,\u201d \u201cChoosing a Medigap Policy,\u201d \u201cYour Guide to Medicare\u2019s Preventive Services,\u201d \u201cMedicare\u2019s Coverage of Diabetes Supplies & Services\u201d and \u201cYour Guide to Medicare\u2019s Durable Medical Equipment.\u201d\n\nIf you have more detailed questions, odds are there is a Medicare guide. Then, as you get closer to buying private Medicare policies \u2014 for Medigap, Medicare Advantage or Part D prescription drug plans \u2014 insurance companies will have their own detailed guides to what their policies cover.\n\nWilliam: I\u2019m in the process of planning for retirement and finding Medicare coverage for my wife and myself. Could you review my cost calculations and let me know if they\u2019re accurate?\n\nPart B premium: $104.90 a month times 12 months times two persons = $2,517.60 a year.\n\nMedigap Plan F premium: $114.00 a month times 12 months times two persons = $2,736.00 a year.\n\nAnnual deductibles for Parts A and B: $1,260 (A) plus $147 (B) times two persons = $2,814 a year.\n\nEstimated annual out of pocket cost for Part D of $5,000 a year.\n\nThe total would be $13,067.60. Am I missing something?\n\nPhil Moeller: William is close, but not quite there. In part, this is because he based his calculations on a mistaken answer I provided in an earlier Ask Phil column (later corrected). As my wife reminds me regularly, please check any notions of infallibility at the door.\n\nWilliam is correct about Part B premiums. I\u2019m assuming he also checked Plan F Medigap premiums where he lives using Medicare\u2019s Medigap Policy Search tool. So, he\u2019s two for two so far.\n\nHis figures for the Part A and B deductibles are out of date. For 2016, they have increased to $1,288 for Part A and $166 for Part B. However, if he and his wife have Plan F Medigap policies, these annual deductibles would be covered. So he can take these possible expenses off the board (and deductibles, of course, only come into play if you need care).\n\nLastly, he presented a ballpark out-of-pocket estimate for two Part D drug plans. This is a fine starting point, but I\u2019d suggest he do some more homework. He should use Medicare\u2019s Plan Finder, set up accounts for himself and his wife, enter the specific prescription drugs that each of them take, and get a more accurate estimate of what each of them might need to spend. This should include whatever Part D premiums they pay plus a separate annual deductible for Part D. It can be up to $360 in 2016, and unlike deductibles for Parts A and B, the couple\u2019s Medigap plans would not cover this.\n\nCharlene \u2013 Miss.: Is it too late to get a supplementary Medicare plan such as Medicare Advantage? I only have Original Medicare and Part D now. Will I have to pay a penalty forever?\n\nPhil Moeller: Good news. There is no late enrollment penalty for switching from Original Medicare to Medicare Advantage. The penalties for late enrollment involve signing up for Original Medicare (Parts A and B) and Part D in the first place. Normally, you would need to wait to sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan until the annual open enrollment season begins this fall. It runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7. However, if there is a 5-star plan you like (Medicare\u2019s highest quality rating) you can sign up for it right away. These plans have something like a 51-week open enrollment period, which in practical terms means you can sign up for them pretty much any time. However, you can do this only once a year.\n\nKent \u2013 Ga.: I am a retired Federal employee with Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) insurance. I am currently in my initial enrollment period for Medicare and already signed up for Medicare Part A. I am employed with a large company (over 10,000 employees) and can sign up for their health insurance, which can help me avoid any monthly premium penalties when I decide to enroll in Medicare Part B later. However, I turned 65 between open seasons to enroll in my company\u2019s health insurance plan and won\u2019t be able to sign up for it until after my IEP is over. Will I be able to avoid future Medicare Part B premium penalties if I am not currently enrolled in my company\u2019s health plan before my initial enrollment period ends?\n\nPhil Moeller: The answer depends on how long you are without health insurance. However, rather than going that route, why don\u2019t you just keep your Federal Employee Health Benefits coverage until your new employer coverage takes effect? Unlike virtually every other retiree health plan, Federal Employee Health Benefits coverage may be retained in place of Medicare, thus avoiding the issue of late enrollment penalties altogether. So, I\u2019d explore continuing that plan. Once your new coverage is in effect, you can switch to it. You should talk about this with the administrator of your current Federal Employee Health Benefits plan. Also, find out whether you could go back to it once you retire from your new position. It might be a superior solution to your Medicare options.\n\nNora \u2013 Fla.: If you have a health savings account and you enroll in Medicare, I understand that you can no longer make contributions to it. But can you still take health savings account distributions from your health savings account account to pay for COBRA and Medicare premiums and other qualifying health expenses and put these distributions on your IRS Form 8889 when filing your tax return if you are 65 years old?\n\nPhil Moeller: Yes.\n\nElliott \u2013 Ala.: I will turn 65 in March 2016 but do not plan to retire until 66 1/2. I am a contractor with COBRA coverage from a previous employer. It will expire in June 2016. Can I receive Medicare \u2013 Part A, Part B, Medigap and Part D drug coverage \u2013 to take the place of the COBRA even if I\u2019m not retired? Or do I have to be retired and taking my Social Security to receive Medicare?\n\nPhil Moeller: If you are 65 and do not have workplace coverage (and COBRA does not count as workplace coverage) you are eligible for Medicare. In fact, if you don\u2019t sign up for Medicare during your initial enrollment period (a seven-month period with your birth month in the middle), you would incur nasty late-enrollment penalties. Whether or not you are taking Social Security benefits has no bearing on your Medicare eligibility or timely enrollment obligations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicare expert Philip Moeller answers your Medicare questions.", "pubdate": 20160203, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Medicare expert Philip Moeller answers your Medicare questions.", "title": "If I'm covered by the Affordable Care Act, do I have to switch to Medicare?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RTX16N05.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/if-im-covered-by-the-affordable-care-act-do-i-have-to-switch-to-medicare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Medicare expert Philip Moeller answers your Medicare questions.", "title": "If I'm covered by the Affordable Care Act, do I have to switch to Medicare?", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RTX16N05.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "retirement"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Ask Phil, health care, Making Sen$e, medicare, retirement"}, "article_summary": "William: I\u2019m in the process of planning for retirement and finding Medicare coverage for my wife and myself.\nAnd I bet there are millions of people like you who would love to see a schedule of Medicare benefits.\n: Is it too late to get a supplementary Medicare plan such as Medicare Advantage?\nYou should talk about this with the administrator of your current Federal Employee Health Benefits plan.\nHowever, rather than going that route, why don\u2019t you just keep your Federal Employee Health Benefits coverage until your new employer coverage takes effect?"}
