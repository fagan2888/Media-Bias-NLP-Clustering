That\u2019s when authorities went to an upstairs neighbor to get a key into the apartment.\n\nIt made breaking news bulletins and headlines across the country when a reputed gang member allegedly shot a firefighter who came to rescue him:\n\nWhen they opened the door, they saw smoke inside and called firefighters to the scene, Boyce said. FDNY Lt. James Hayes spoke briefly with Tyree then the suspect went silent. Thinking perhaps the man became unconscious from the smoke filling his apartment, Hayes went inside and was shot twice in his lower body, Boyce said. The 53-year-old father of two was taken to a hospital and listed in stable condition, police said. His injuries are not life-threatening, FDNY Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said.\n\nThe ensuing six hour standoff ended in a shootout that left the suspect, Garland Tyree, 38, dead. The late Mr. Tyree had an extensive criminal record.\n\nSoopermexican of The Right Scoop took a look at his website and discovered that Mt. Tyree apparently was a Young Democrats activist (in addition to being a member of the Bloods street grang). Here are some of the images he found:\n\nNow it\u2019s time to apply the Tea Party Test \u2013 you know, the one where whenever somebody shoots up a school or a movie theatre, MSM reporters immediately look for that name somewhere on a tea party site. As Brian Ross did at the Aurora, CO theatre shooting and reported that a tea party activist was responsible.\n\nAsk yourself if the MSM would ignore this evidence if it were the tea party, not the Democratic Party, involved.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/08/ny_man_who_wounded_a_fireman_died_in_shootout_with_police_apparently_was_a_democrat_activist.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2015-08/195128_5_.jpg", "title": "Blog: NY man who wounded a fireman, died in shootout with police, apparently was a Democrat activist"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As Brian Ross did at the Aurora, CO theatre shooting and reported that a tea party activist was responsible.\nAsk yourself if the MSM would ignore this evidence if it were the tea party, not the Democratic Party, involved.\nFDNY Lt.
