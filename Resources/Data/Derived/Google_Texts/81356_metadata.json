(J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)\n\nIn the twilight of the 113th Congress, numerous people told me that everything would be different with the 114th Congress. Things would be better. The self-destructive battles that turned John Boehner into the Stockholm Syndrome-suffering speaker of the House would end. The shrill minority that controlled his raucous caucus would be diluted by a wave of even more Republicans with a reasonable disposition.\n\nAnd then yesterday happened.\n\nThe House voted to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). That\u2019s the 2012 executive action taken by President Obama that gave temporary protection from deportation to the children of undocumented immigrants. The chamber also approved legislation that would strip funding from the Department of Homeland Security that would be used to implement the president\u2019s executive action that would defer deportation for nearly five million undocumented immigrants.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, \u201cRepublicans who supported the legislation said there was nothing cruel about their intentions.\u201d Yeah, okay. Can\u2019t wait to see the Republican candidates for president explain the Republican-controlled Congress to the Latino community. A community where 50,000 young people will turn 18 (voting age) every month for the next 20 years. A 2013 report from the conservative outfit Resurgent Republic pointed out that while 51 percent of the 10.9 million Latinos registered to vote are Democrats, 54 percent of them identify as \u201cconservative.\u201d So, Republican antics on immigration are turning away what appears to be a natural constituency. Meanwhile, a Gallup survey from late last year showed that 64 percent of Hispanics \u201cstrongly approve\u201d or \u201capprove\u201d of Obama\u2019s immigration plans. His current approval rating among Hispanics on Gallup sits at 63 percent.\n\nAs for the stripping of DHS funding, well, that just takes me back to the good ol\u2019 days when Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) convinced some of the Republican rabble in the House to shut down the government over the plainly impossible goal of defunding Obamacare. Folks insist neither DHS nor the government will shut down over immigration. But my \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it\u201d attitude comes from watching years of harrowing battles over ceilings and cliffs.\n\nThe difference this time is that Republicans have complete control of Congress. When Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was majority leader, Boehner could depend on Democrats to thwart the extremes of his caucus. That duty now falls to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who not only must show that his party is not \u201cscary,\u201d but who also must also come up with legislative victories to prove to the nation that the GOP can be trusted to govern.\n\nGod bless him. He\u2019s going to need it.\n\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj", "article_metadata": {"description": "The shrill minority of the GOP majority was supposed to be diluted by a wave of more Republicans with a reasonable disposition.
