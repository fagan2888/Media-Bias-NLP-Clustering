The stem is for gripping the banana\u2014not peeling it!\n\nHold the stem, pinch the top and then peel. Another little secret\u2014bananas naturally split into three perfect wedges. No need for a knife.\n\nOne of the benefits of living in Costa Rica is the amazing (and cheap) access we have to bananas. We can get 20 pounds of bananas for $3-$4. Yep. And they aren\u2019t the Cavendish bananas that are most commonly sold in The States. The bananas we get are small and extremely sweet and creamy. By comparison, the Cavendish bananas are bland. In fact most Costa Ricans don\u2019t buy the Cavendish bananas when given the option.\n\nOf course, one of the down falls to being able to buy so many bananas so cheaply is that often we can\u2019t eat them all before they start to get mushy. And since there is only so much banana bread one needs in one\u2019s life, I\u2019ve started making banana pudding every few weeks. And this last time, I made chocolate banana pudding. Oh my heavens. Decadence to the roof.\n\nChocolate Banana Pudding\n\n-- 3 cups whole milk\n\n-- \u00bd cup sugar\n\n-- \u00bc cup cornstarch or flour\n\n-- 6 oz semisweet chocolate or similar, shaved (I used 6 oz of Dove Silky Smooth Dark Chocolate\u2014yum!)\n\n-- 1 tsp vanilla extract\n\n-- 1 Tbsp butter\n\n-- 8 oz heavy whipping cream\n\n-- 2 Tbsp sugar\n\n-- 6 bananas\n\n-- 1 box of vanilla wafers or cookie of choice (I used graham crackers. Oreos would be amazing, I\u2019m sure)\n\nIn a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the milk and sugar until the sugar dissolves. Whisk in your thickening agent (cornstarch or flour) and stir constantly until well blended. Add in your shaved chocolate and continue to stir constantly until the chocolate is melted and the pudding begins to thicken\u2014about 4 or 5 minutes.\n\nRemove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla and the butter. Set aside to cool, about an hour.\n\nWhip the heavy whipping cream with the 2 Tbsp of sugar until soft peaks begin to form, another 4 or 5 minutes.\n\nSlice your bananas and open the box of cookies (it\u2019s okay, you can eat one).\n\nLayer the bottom of a large bowl or glass dish with cookies. Add about 1/3 of the cooled chocolate pudding. Layer \u00bd of the whipped cream on top of pudding and sprinkle with two sliced bananas (or more, if you\u2019re so inclined and have a lot of bananas). Top the bananas with another layer of cookies and repeat the entire layering process, ending with a top layer of chocolate pudding, sprinkled with bananas.\n\nDig in!\n\nDarla Antoine is an enrolled member of the Okanagan Indian Band in British Columbia and grew up in Eastern Washington State.
