As Obama continues to pitch his signature presidential “achievement” to the dwindling number of Americans dumb enough to believe a word he says — Zach Galifianakis fans, Ryan Seacrest listeners, etc. — the real world keeps kicking the hell out of it.

Elise Viebeck, The Hill:

Health industry officials say ObamaCare-related premiums will double in some parts of the country, countering claims recently made by the administration…

The industry complaints come less than a week after Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sought to downplay concerns about rising premiums in the healthcare sector. She told lawmakers rates would increase in 2015 but grow more slowly than in the past…

Areas of the country with older, sicker or smaller populations are likely to be hit hardest, while others might not see substantial increases at all.

Don’t worry, it’s only the old, sick rednecks who’ll suffer. That means Obama didn’t lie his ass off after all. Whew!

Just make sure you stop calling it the “Affordable Care Act,” Dems. That no longer polls well. And “Obamacare” went right out the window with his poll numbers. Stick with “ACA.”

All the chirpy TV ads and Twitter hashtags in the world can’t polish the turd that is Obamacare. This needless debacle is going to hurt a lot of people, and the idiots who are subjecting us to it have no plan except to keep telling us outrageous lies.

As November approaches, millions of Americans are itching to vote for the repeal of Obamacare. And Democrats are panicking. As well they should. This is all on them.

P.S. Don’t worry, NASA isn’t in charge of sending things into space anymore. Now it’s focused on telling us that society is going to collapse unless we stop fueling the economy that, um, pays for NASA.
