Updated at 8 p.m. with the names of the victim and suspect.

A grandmother was killed and her five family members were injured Christmas Day by a hit-and-run driver on U.S. 75, Richardson police said.

Atheer Latif, 23, of Plano, who fled the scene, later called police and confessed, said Sgt. Kevin Perlich. He will be charged with criminal negligent homicide.

All lanes of 75 southbound were closed from the time of the 11:30 a.m. crash until 6:30 p.m., Perlich said.

The grandmother, Madhavi Meharunkar, 63, of Plano, was traveling in a Honda Odyssey minivan being driven by her son along with her husband, her son’s wife and their two toddlers. The grandmother died at the scene. All the surviving victims were taken to a hospital with injuries, and their conditions weren’t available Friday.

Latif was driving a Scion in the 2300 block of Highway 75, just north of the Campbell exit. For unknown reasons, he struck the high-occupancy vehicle lane’s pylons, then over-corrected, drifting to the right into the minivan’s lane, police said.

The suspect’s vehicle struck the minivan. The minivan driver lost control of his vehicle, which struck the concrete median, causing it to roll over at least once, police said.

Latif fled the scene, police said. Other drivers who had seen the crash chased him, but he tried to lose them and eventually did, Perlich said.

About an hour and a half later, a man called Richardson police saying he was involved in the wreck. Latif came into the station and confessed to investigators, Perlich said.

Citing the ongoing investigation, Perlich declined to say whether police suspect the driver was intoxicated or distracted while driving.
