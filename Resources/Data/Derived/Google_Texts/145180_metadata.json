Franklin Graham sent Christians a blunt message during a recent Oklahoma State Evangelism Conference, telling them in no uncertain terms that they need to get more involved in politics \u2014 that those with unbiblical views need the pushback.\n\n\u201cGet involved in politics,\u201d he said, Tea Party News Network reported. \u201c[The] gays and lesbians are in politics [and] all the anti-God people are.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham went on to say that Christianity and politics do mix and that a church that involves itself in the political matters of the day isn\u2019t violating any biblical principles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to tell you, church, God loves each and every one, and Christ died for our sins, and we\u2019ve got a responsibility to take this message to the ends of the Earth,\u201d Mr Graham said, TPNN reported. \u201cAnd I want to encourage you to take a stand in your communities. Get involved in government. Get involved in politics. Who says we can\u2019t be in politics? The gays and lesbians are in politics, I can tell you that. All the anti-God people are in politics. They\u2019re there.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham also said that communism and progressivism are godless political belief systems that put faith in government before faith in God.\n\n\u201cSecularism and communism are the same thing,\u201d Mr. Graham said, TPNN reported. \u201cThey\u2019re godless. They\u2019re anti-Christ. So now we have the secularists who\u2019ve taken control of our country. They\u2019ve taken control of Washington.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Rev.
