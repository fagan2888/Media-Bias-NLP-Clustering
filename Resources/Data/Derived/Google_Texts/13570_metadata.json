(AP) \u2014 Perhaps it\u2019s the fresh-baked cookie that\u2019s offered to guests as they check into the Mirror Lake Inn, the village\u2019s crown jewel of lodging. Or perhaps it\u2019s how just about every quaint store and restaurant in town has some sort of reminder that miracles can, and have, happened there.\n\nEither way, it doesn\u2019t take long upon arriving in Lake Placid to realize there\u2019s something unique about the place.\n\nKnown for decades as a winter wonderland and where the U.S. Olympic hockey team stunned the unbeatable Russians in 1980 in perhaps the most-celebrated sporting event ever, Lake Placid is not just for snowy fun anymore. The vacation haven in the Adirondack Mountains is a town for all seasons now, though the sights this time of year are nothing short of Rockwellian.\n\nPHOTOS: Lake Placid isn't just for winter lovers anymore\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the place you never really think about coming to, and then you get here and you never want to leave,\u201d said Scott Natter, a vacationer from Philadelphia who was touring the Olympic Center \u2014 the arena where the 1980 Miracle On Ice happened \u2014 with two of his children on a recent snowy day. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s an annual thing now. We say \u2018vacation\u2019 and our kids say \u2018Placid.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith a year-round population of about 2,500, Lake Placid has remained small but bustling. Tourism and continuing to tell the Olympic tales of 1932 and 1980 are the backbone of the little community, where cell service can still be a touch spotty and few seem to mind.\n\nBut with a mix of classic and new attractions and amenities, there\u2019s more to the place now than ever before. Whiteface Mountain still packs in skiers and snowboarders with arguably the best terrain in the East. Thrill-seekers can get their fix for speed and danger by taking a bobsled ride at Mount Van Hoevenberg. And those just looking to unwind can enjoy a maple sugar body scrub \u2014 yes, it is what it sounds like \u2014 at Mirror Lake Inn.\n\nHikers looking to scale any or all of the 46 Adirondack peaks that stand 4,600 feet or higher tend to start visiting in the spring. In the summer, there\u2019s a full-scale Ironman triathlon and a renowned horse show (which takes place in the shadow of the 1980 Olympic cauldron). Leaf-peepers pack the region in the fall, getting a look at the brilliant hues before the trees fall barren again for the inevitable winter.\n\nBookstores, a little theater, an arts center that lures kids from 100 miles (160 kilometers) away, fishing, golfing \u2026 some of those might not all be available 12 months a year, but they\u2019re all there. And many of those places are connected by brick sidewalks where people can walk about unbothered and unworried, even after nightfall.\n\n\u201cIt is beyond a year-round destination,\u201d said Lisa Weibrecht, who owns and operates the Mirror Lake Inn with her husband, Ed. \u201cWinter is such a small part of Lake Placid. I would say definitely summer is the most recognized season here between the lakes, the mountains, people leaving the city. This started as a summer resort and our population swells by three times during the summer. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any place more beautiful to be than in Lake Placid in the summer and the fall.\u201d\n\nStill, its calling card might be winter, as evidenced by the two Olympic medals that hang behind the front desk at Mirror Lake.\n\nThose medals were won by the Weibrecht\u2019s son, Andrew \u2014 at the last two Olympic Winter Games.\n\n\u201cPeople always say, \u2018Can you swim in the lake?\u2019 \u201d Ed Weibrecht said. \u201cAnd I tell them, here, you can drink the lake. It\u2019s a wonderful place.\u201d\n\n___\n\nIf You Go \u2026\n\nLAKE PLACID: http://www.lakeplacid.com/. Events highlights: http://www.lakeplacid.com/events.
