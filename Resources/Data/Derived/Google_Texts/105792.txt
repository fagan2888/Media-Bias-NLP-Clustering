How many years have you been in the St. Vrain Valley? 22

What brought you here? What has kept you here? I was living in the Chicago area and had a chance to move here with my company. I decided to stay because I love the weather and the mountains.

What organizations do you volunteer for and why? St. John the Baptist Food Bank. The food bank is staffed by wonderful volunteers. The food bank also offers delivery service for those who cannot come to the food bank.

Homeless Outreach Providing Encouragement. HOPE is great organization with great volunteers and staff. I like that HOPE helps those in the most need every day of the year.

Knights of Columbus. I joined the Knights to meet people and give back to the community. I have met a lot of great guys in the process. Many of the Knights volunteer at HOPE and the food bank.

What do you find most rewarding about volunteering? I enjoy giving my time to help those in need. I like the variety of work and every day is a new experience. There is always something new to learn and new people to meet. Everyone I meet is very appreciative of the help they receive. You can make someone's day by giving them a pair of socks, a meal, or just talking to them for a few minutes. I have met a lot of great people and all the volunteers make the system work. I want to thank all the volunteers out there for taking the time to volunteer. If you have been thinking about volunteering, now is the time to get started. There are a lot of organizations out there that could use your help and you won't regret it.
