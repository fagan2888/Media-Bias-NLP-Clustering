Out of elevators, blanket-lapped four-wheelers are still emerging. Some trail tubes. They station themselves in peloton-like rows down the center\u2019s hallway to the caf\u00e9, where multiple mop-wielding orderlies hoof back and forth at the front of the lunch line, demarcated by a cautioning yellow placard. It is 10 past 10. The semi-private room of 54-year-old Von Brunson is at the far end of the second floor, above the patio where a young girl brushes sand off the tennis-balled bottoms of her grandmother\u2019s rhinestoned walker. The Beacon\u2014known as Ocean Promenade until Hurricane Sandy sent floodwaters up its rampways in 2012\u2014is a newly renovated rehab facility in the beachy part of Brooklyn: Far Rockaway, the neighborhood where Brunson lives with his wife.\n\nBack-to-back Steve Harvey reruns blare from a blinking 15-inch set; there is an immense amount of panning. Brunson leans on elbows over a chipboard table reminiscent of the design of a middle-schooler\u2019s desk\u2014only, the brown metal legs, instead of going straight down, bracket out, allowing a wheelchair to pull up to the edge. Brunson\u2019s right foot sits in a protective boot (\u201clest I stub toes,\u201d he jokes), while the left (the left is why I am here) is, in fact, in absentia, having been divorced from the New Yorker\u2019s body one month ago. A sock squeezes the sutured skin at the stump\u2019s end, which someone has covered further with what looks like a baby\u2019s knit cap.\n\n\u201cMy daughter made two\u2014one for my grandson, one for me,\u201d says Brunson. \u201cIt\u2019s itchy yarn, but that\u2019s good because sometimes I forget what happened\u2026 I heard of a woman who\u2019d fall out of bed every morning not remembering her foot wasn\u2019t there\u2026 just this sickly moment of surprise, y\u2019know like when you\u2019re climbing stairs in the dark and you think there\u2019s one more step than there is\u2026 the itching helps me readjust the way I think of things.\u201d\n\nBrunson is, tragically, a poster child for diabetes: black, overweight, legally blind, renally inert, dialysis-dependent, and now one-legged. He alternates periods of imperceptible breathing with deep, shuddering catch-up breaths. If there is any incongruity, it is his cheerfulness, which he wields generously in the form of anecdotes and epigrams. Brunson, who turns 55 in November, enthusiastically tells me he has only had one birthday party in his whole life\u2014in 2012, just less than a year before he injured his foot. By September 2013, after weeks of flashing fevers, he was admitted to St. John\u2019s Hospital, where doctors found he had a diabetic ulcer midfoot. In no time at all, unstoppable bruising had permeated up to his lateral malleolus\u2014the funny knob thing on the ankle\u2014and searing pain, previously masked by neuropathy, soon became unyielding. An ER doctor cut a hole the size of a pencil eraser through three layers of skin on his heel, and ominous yellow fluid began pouring out. Brunson\u2019s kidneys were tested: 6 percent renal functionality\u2014infection had eviscerated them. Brunson was put on dialysis, and over the next few months half of his foot was scooped out through his heel. No attempts were made to revascularize, or surgically restore blood flow. Brunson\u2019s wife, dissatisfied with her husband\u2019s treatment at St. John\u2019s, contacted ProHealth and was referred to Andrew Metzler, a vascular surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. Metzler, within two minutes of examining Brunson, determined what those at St. John\u2019s were unwilling or unable to: Brunson\u2019s leg was not salvageable\u2014things had progressed too far.\n\nFact No. 1: In the US, roughly one out of every 200 people has undergone primary (above or below-knee) amputation, according to the National Limb Loss Info Center: 45 percent due to trauma (unseen trains, for example), 54 percent due to peripheral arterial disease , and 1 percent other.\n\nFact No 2: Of persons with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) who have a lower-extremity amputation, up to 55 percent require amputation of the second leg within two or three years.\n\nFact No. 3: In the US, black Americans are up to four times as likely as other racial groups to lose a leg\u2014or three times, controlling for the disproportionate diabetes rates among them.\n\nFact No. 4: If diabetes and PAD continue to rise at the rate they have been for the last several decades, in just a few years, PAD\u2014not trauma\u2014will be the overwhelming reason for amputation. By then, our usual associations with amputees\u2014with reckless boxcar hoppers, laurelled para-athletes, uniformed heroes (Lt. Dan, father and son Skywalker, etc.), and malformed children overcoming the odds\u2014will need to be somatically adjusted, more or less, to the image of Brunson.\n\nAmputation due to trauma is misfortune, but due to PAD is blameworthy negligence, because, as Metzler, Brunson\u2019s surgeon, explains, \u201cin theory 100 percent of [PAD-related amputations] are preventable, absolutely\u201d\u2014not only because their primary mainsprings, smoking and type II diabetes, are avoidable with the right lifestyle choices, but also because, once developed, PAD is fairly manageable with everyday dietary changes, diligent check-ups, and a half-decent pair of sneakers. And even if things do get bad, Metlzer continues, \u201cI can stent the artery with something like an autogenous saphenous vein conduit [he loves to say it: autogenous saphenous], or put a balloon in\u2026 [which] are your minimally-invasive options: endovascular, they\u2019re called. Or I can do bypass\u2026 which is where we try to revascularize by rerouting blood flow around blockages\u2026 Only if bypass risk is too high, [or the] arteries are too calcified or too small for stents, or say gangrene has totally set in, would I amputate.\u201d\n\nMetlzer performs about one below-knee amputation per month, of the 73,000 or so legs lost to PAD in the US each year. Because PAD primarily emerges due to poor primary care or misinformation among patients, and because it typically results in amputation only when providers fail to intervene at the right time with the right resources, Metzler, like many others in his field, considers this number to be the quintessential measure of how flawed health care is today\u2014\u201cthe canary in the coal mine if you will,\u201d agrees Philip Goodney, a vascular surgeon based out of Lebanon, NH.\n\nBlack Americans, for reasons not totally understood, are significantly more likely to have a leg amputated than whites, Asians, and Hispanics.\n\nMarshall Chin, a general internist at the University of Chicago Medical Center, relates amputation to skewed financial incentives at play in the fee-for-service payment plan employed by most US health facilities, which are typically paid based on the volume, not the value, of services performed. \u201cWe make money out of complications. We are told that if we perform more surgery, run more tests, regardless of how it affects actual quality of health, we will be rewarded for it,\u201d says Chin, who is optimistic about certain provisions in the Affordable Care Act that support the more value-oriented financial models. PAD, he argues, is largely an issue with insufficient primary-care coverage: \u201cIt gets to this idea that we ought to create strong links between primary-care doctors and their patients, so they can work together to prevent things like amputation from happening.\u201d\n\nBut what PAD persistence reflects even more poignantly is something even more treacherous. A study, published last October, by Goodney and the Dartmouth Atlas Project confirmed nationwide what has been found among sample groups for the past decade: Black Americans, for reasons not totally understood, are significantly more likely to have a leg amputated than whites, Asians, and Hispanics.\n\nBrunson covers his right eye with one hand and tells me all he sees is a wash of ceiling, floor, and walls, made entirely of light, but no sign of my face. But not to worry: If he swaps and covers his left, there I am, back again, \u201cpretty blurry but looking young,\u201d he says. In 2002, when flecks of black started showing up in his vision, Brunson was referred to a retina specialist, who\u201a during the exam apparently gasped and stepped back:\n\n\u201cDid you drive yourself here?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Brunson. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you shouldn\u2019t be able to see the road.\u201d\n\nIn the course of examination, the specialist found hemorrhaging behind Brunson\u2019s eyes: retinal deterioration. It is hardly an unusual diagnosis for diabetics (up to 80 percent of people who have diabetes for more than 10 years experience some degree of retinal degeneration\u2014in fact, diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in the US), nor was it surprising that Brunson had not noticed himself (until late stages, the patient\u2019s vision goes unaffected). No, what surprised the specialist was\u2014one\u2014that based on the extent of damage, Brunson\u2019s eyes had likely been bleeding since 1996, and\u2014two\u2014that Brunson had not been immediately referred to a retina specialist when he was first diagnosed with diabetes in 1991, as is standard procedure.\n\n\u201c[My primary diabetes doctor] had nothing to say when I told him,\u201d says Brunson. \u201cHe knew he should\u2019ve referred me.\u201d\n\nEighteenth-century guide to amputation. Credit: Wikipedia\n\nAsked about his decision to specialize in vascular surgery, Metzler reads me a quote from Cid Dos Santo, the Lisbon physician who helped establish the field: \u201cVascular surgery is peculiar because above all it is mainly a surgery of ruins.\u201d\n\nIn a conference room library across from Metzler\u2019s office is a copy of The Atlas of General Surgery by Schumpelick et al., Thieme Press, 2006. On pages 506-09, in dark photographs, it portrays the piece-by-piece removal of a dying leg. A long, circling knife slashes the putrefying meat, which has been swaddled in towels, yellowed in iodine, and manipulated through the rubberized whole of a paper drape so as to obscure the greater extremity. An asterisk notes that this aspect of the procedure has not changed since Neolithic times: a hand uncurls, its knife draws deeply, the way one slices a peach or a mango, the way husk leaves husk just as your cleaver finishes orbiting the nut. Next, a gigli saw is brandished, oscillating fast as it can up through the tibia, the fibula, flecking pure white until it hits marrow, until the toothed wire splatters up, and what is left is a gorgeous, exploded cross-section of nerve, bone, muscle, artery\u2014but oddly there is little liquid to spill from the shrivelness. I think of the surgeon, whose face is not pictured, and the moment it takes him to find the limb\u2019s point of balance before objectlessly uttering to an assistant to take it away. Soon, the bone is sanded, muscle and skin wrapped over its new end, and the surgeon, undone, catches his breath before dressing the fleshy nowhere.\n\n\u201cDifficulty: Easy,\u201d says the caption.\n\nIt has long been known that diabetes disproportionately affects black Americans (13.2 percent of blacks are diabetic vs. 7.6 percent of whites), a fact that has largely been attributed to a lower average socio-economic standing (if you are poor, it is harder to eat healthy, to find time to exercise or go to the doctor, etc.). The violent 2014 asphyxiation of Staten Islander Eric Garner in the plainly clothed arms of the police, for instance, was catalyzed in large part by his poor health, according to the medical examiner. Garner was a hulking, 350-pound diabetic-slash-asthmatic with a heart condition.\n\nBut the Dartmouth Atlas Project found significant racial disparity in amputation rates even after controlling for disproportion in diabetes prevalence. According to 2007-11 data, black Medicare patients with PAD are 2.8 times as likely as other patients to have a leg amputated. In certain areas, particularly in the rural South, this disparity can be as great as 5.3 times (Monroe, La.). In New York, where Von once worked as a conductor on the F subway line, the disparity is 4.2 times.\n\nStill, however, the very same socio-economic argument can be used to explain away the discrepancy, rendering it economic disparity, not racial. As Goodney explains: \u201cIn my clinical practice as well as when I looked at our data, I see that patients of low socio-economic status\u2014patients on welfare\u2014often do not know to take care of themselves, or maybe the clinics are far away, or they feel they cannot afford the care\u2026 not to mention they are statistically more stressed, which can contribute to worse cardiovascular health\u2026 or maybe because of family burdens, they lack time to take care of themselves; they will say, \u2018I\u2019ll get by with this pair of shoes even though they do not totally fit.\u2019 We see it everyday: a pair of ill-fitting shoes can cause a sore or blister, and that\u2019s the start of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have a white person and a black person go into the same hospital, see the same doctor about the same problem, and one walks out and the other is wheeled out.\u201d\n\nBut then, even more jarring, is a 2013 study out of New Haven published in JAMA Surgery\u2014one of two similar studies that almost every physician I interviewed independently cited . In it, researchers controlled for things like progression, severity, co-morbidity, patient income, hospital rating, practitioner experience, and just about everything else that would correlate with socio-economic statuses in the treatment of PAD, and still blacks were 1.7 times as likely than non-blacks to undergo amputation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have seen such depressing data,\u201d says Samantha Minc, a vascular surgeon who works at safety net clinics in Chicago\u2019s South Side. \u201cIt basically shows that you could have a white person and a black person go into the same hospital, see the same doctor about the same problem, and one walks out and the other is wheeled out\u2026 I mean it\u2019s possible\u2014maybe the data misses something, a genetic difference maybe \u2014but that aside, there are only a few conceivable factors: one, black patients actually opt for amputation over revascularization, or, two\u2014and this is the one no one wants to talk about\u2014providers are making unfounded decisions based on race.\u201d In the case of the former, Minc speculates that patient preference could arise out of a sense of fatalism, mistrust, or confusion.\n\nMetzler concurs: \u201cI mean, it should never be surprising that, if you\u2019re just looking at the crude rates, African Americans have more amputations. I mean, African Americans have more diabetes, that\u2019s a known issue itself\u2026 But what\u2019s concerning is that even when you control for these things[,] even when you\u2019re controlling for the institutional environment where they are being treated, there is less likelihood of undergoing these heroic revascuarization efforts before proceeding to amputation. That\u2019s what is concerning.\u201d\n\nIn March this year, JAMA published another study\u2014one of many like it that have been published over the years\u2014that found that while race did not ultimately impact clinical decisions, implicit racial biases were present in nearly all of the 215 clinicians surveyed. One startling finding was that clinicians were more likely to diagnose a young black woman with pelvic inflammatory disease rather than appendicitis when presented with the same set of symptoms for black and white patients. The data speaks strongly to a 2002 Institute of Medicine study\u2019s finding that \u201cfor almost every disease studied, black Americans received less effective care than white Americans, [controlling] for socioeconomic and insurance status.\u201d\n\nImplicit Association Tests, which the JAMA researchers used, are available online for anyone to take, and have been around since 1998. For unsurprising reasons, they remain controversial in both their reliability and implication.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to believe that you could possibly be making snap decisions that might in the end be hurting people,\u201d said Minc, who expressed embarrassment when describing how hard it actually was to remain totally impartial when she tried the test. \u201cI think it would be good if more doctors took it\u2014if anything, just so they are more aware of their unconscious proclivities,\u201d she said, recommending medical education focus on shared decision-making between informed patients and providers as a possible course of remediation.\n\nOf course, if there is bias, it is not necessarily malicious, explains Monica Peek, an assistant professor in general internal medicine at University of Chicago: \u201cA doctor making a clinical decision may be thinking, well, this person is coming from a more disadvantaged background, so they may not be able to adhere to the medical regimen to help keep their vessels open, or may not have the social support, physical therapy, or wound care that they would need after a revascularization procedure, as opposed to an amputation, which is easier to care for after. We know that physicians make assumptions about people\u2019s social support, their use of drugs and alcohol, and other things that they have not actually asked about. Such assumptions can color decisions, and race can be the proxy to them.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, speaking of his personal experience, Brunson described reverse-biases\u2014white doctors acting almost paternalistically toward him: \u201cI find I get treated better by people that are not of my race, but I\u2019ve never known why,\u201d he says.\n\nStill, if the residual discrepancies in health care are explained, even just somewhat, by implicit racial biases, it is hard to have that discussion about amputations, an act which is itself so violent and painful for a surgeon to perform, especially when they have been working with the same patient over the course of many years. When I first spoke to Minc, even before she knew what I was calling about, she told me she was at Mount Sinai \u201ctrying to avoid performing amputations.\u201d Later, when I reminded her of what she had said, she elaborated, \u201cI amputate because I have failed\u2014failed as a vascular surgeon, failed as a doctor\u2026 there are few words to describe seeing the patient after the procedure, disfigured\u2026 just shame.\u201d\n\nI asked Minc if she feels this way even when the patient came in so last minute, it was beyond her power to help.\n\n\u201cIs it possible,\u201d she responded, \u201cto spend decades removing parts of people, and emerge whole yourself?\u201d\n\nOur usual image of the non-ambulant is misplaced. We encounter monopedal panhandlers and are still immediately vulnerable to the suggestion that previous chapters of their lives unfolded unluckily in the Gulf or even Vietnam. But as one man reveals, sitting down and out on the corner of 95th and 2nd in Manhattan, propping his prosthetic as a stump-rest: \u201cI ain\u2019t no veteran\u2014fact is, a few guys genuinely are, but most of \u2018em you see out here, missing legs, only say it because it\u2019s a better pitch than just saying diabetes took \u2018em.\u201d That\u2019s Roy Griffin, 64, a type II diabetic, who did 24 years on crutches after a winning jump shot sent part of his fibula through his femoral artery. After bypass surgery he was told to keep off his feet, but when his kid brother went missing, he went out looking for him and botched the whole jig. A second bypass failed and amputation became necessary. Incapacitated, he could not find work, and spent the next several decades telling passersby that New York summers remind him of Kuwait.\n\nBut perhaps it is apt to keep the conversation of amputation in the realm of warfare, for the history of the procedure is the history of battle: Is it a coincidence that the operating room is called a theater? Although we cannot say for sure the extent to which something like implicit biases play into PAD amputation discrepancies, those discrepancies do definitively exist, and they are social, economic, institutional.\n\nIn the South Side of Chicago, Chin, Minc, and Peek have spent the last few years laying the groundwork for an integrated, grassroots initiative to improve the quality of provider services and patient self-care among low-income minority diabetic patients. \u201cAt the heart of the program is a community education effort meant to teach and encourage members to share in the responsibility of their own health,\u201d says Peek. \u201cBut, even as we do see improvements here, there\u2019s a growing diabetes epidemic, our inequitable health care systems persist\u2026 I\u2019m hopeful these new policies might change that, but maybe not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it possible to spend decades removing parts of people, and emerge whole yourself?\u201d\n\nOn floors above and below us in the Beacon, men and women are dying with dead limbs: their hearts seize, give out, or clatter; their kidneys fail; their lungs harden; their brains jam and die for blood; their legs flicker black and flake off like lamp wicks.\n\nA scrub-suited nurse arrives with a cup of something vicious, smelling faintly of fennel, and guides Brunson\u2019s hand, which swipes the air innocently, to it. And when Brunson asks which medication it is, the nurse says it is the one that boosts the rate at which the new lips at his knee will seal.\n\nBrunson tells me he\u2019s looking forward to dancing, to showing off every classic move but the waltz. In many cases of PAD, the amputee is too old, too frail to ever use a prosthetic. Many will never walk or dance or spend a day alone again. But Brunson is younger than average, and has muscle and faith. I ask him if there is anything he will really miss. No, not really, he says, \u201cGod gives just as much as he takes.\u201d I do not ask if he has realized his inability to achieve the kneeling stance of prayer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An online magazine, published weekdays.", "author": "Noah Pisner", "og": {"site_name": "The Morning News", "description": "To understand everything wrong about health care in America today, look to a horrifying trend in amputation.", "title": "The Loss - The Morning News", "url": "themorningnews.org", "image": "http://www.themorningnews.org/images/content/articles/amputations-sm.jpg", "type": "shares:object"}, "twitter": {"description": "To understand everything wrong about health care in America today, look to a horrifying trend in amputation.", "title": "The Loss - The Morning News", "url": "http://www.themorningnews.org/article/the-loss", "image": {"src": "http://www.themorningnews.org/images/content/articles/amputations-cover.jpg"}, "site": "@themorningnews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "800480,821458"}, "viewport": "user-scalable=yes,width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Although we cannot say for sure the extent to which something like implicit biases play into PAD amputation discrepancies, those discrepancies do definitively exist, and they are social, economic, institutional.\nAccording to 2007-11 data, black Medicare patients with PAD are 2.8 times as likely as other patients to have a leg amputated.\nIf there is any incongruity, it is his cheerfulness, which he wields generously in the form of anecdotes and epigrams.\nBut the Dartmouth Atlas Project found significant racial disparity in amputation rates even after controlling for disproportion in diabetes prevalence.\n), and malformed children overcoming the odds\u2014will need to be somatically adjusted, more or less, to the image of Brunson."}
