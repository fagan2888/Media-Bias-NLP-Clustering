In 2006, the exemption was expanded to include disabled veterans.\n\n\u201cTo us it was this very interesting and obvious question: Why is the state paying for the exemption with no controls over it?\u201d deputy state auditor Monica Bowers said.\n\nCounties validate initial property tax exemption applications but aren\u2019t required to verify ongoing eligibility. Nor are they on the hook to pay the state back for improper exemptions.\n\n\u201cCounties have no financial motivation to ensure they only approve fully qualified exemptions,\u201d according to the audit.\n\nWhen the state finally conducted its first audit of the homestead exemption, the size of questionable payments proved a big surprise: the eligibility of up to $25.3 million out of the nearly $117 million the state paid counties in 2014 couldn\u2019t be verified independently.\n\nWhile most of those exemptions might still be valid, some fraction of that large number likely reflects improper payments.\n\nTaxpayers could game the system in a variety of ways, the chief being not letting the state know when the property owner who qualified for an exemption has died.\n\nThe state auditor found 10,335 exemptions worth $5.1 million paid last year to applicants who were deceased. State law allows a surviving spouse to continue to claim the exemption but it also requires an updated application be filed, something the audit said most counties aren\u2019t requiring.\n\nArapahoe County, which has a full-time worker dedicated to overseeing the homestead exemptions, is an exception.\n\n\u201cWe do check death certificates,\u201d said assessor Corbin Sakdol.\n\nSurviving spouses are mailed a new application, and the county unlinks an exemption whenever a property transfer occurs.\n\nAmong the properties with deceased owners, about 2,436 claims representing $1 million of exemptions involved property owners who listed no other occupant, according to the audit.\n\nThat makes it likely someone not qualified to claim the exemption took it.\n\nLogan County Treasurer Patty Bartlett ran a check after reading the auditor\u2019s report and found two instances where deaths in 2013 didn\u2019t show up in Logan County property records until 2014.\n\nGiven that claiming a property is almost always more valuable to heirs than maintaining a property tax break, Bartlett suggested those gaps could reflect the time it takes to clear an estate.\n\nOne solution might involve sending notifications out each year on exempted properties asking, under the penalty of perjury, about continued eligibility, she said.\n\nA taxpayer must make a home his or her primary residence for the previous 10 years to qualify for the exemption. But the auditor found 430 cases representing $234,800 in tax exemptions from applicants who described themselves on tax returns as full-time nonresidents.\n\nMarried couples are allowed to claim only one property between them, but the auditor found at least 196 cases worth $110,000 in improper exemptions where each spouse claimed a property.\n\nExcluding those who were deceased, there were an additional 43,138 applicants who claimed $20 million in exemptions but didn\u2019t file a state tax return in 2013.\n\nSomeone may not file a state tax return for a variety of reasons, including income that falls below reporting requirements. But the lack of a return could indicate a property owner who has relocated to another state, which is a disqualifier.\n\nSakdol and Bartlett said counties don\u2019t have access to state tax records, so they can\u2019t cross-check against those. And Bowers said one of the questions that needs to be answered is whether eligibility cross-checks are better handled on the state or local level.\n\nAs Colorado\u2019s population ages, improving quality controls on the property tax exemption program will become more critical.\n\nAbout one in nine Colorado residents is at least 65 years old. But by 2040, nearly one in five will be, according to state projections.\n\nTo motivate county officials, the auditor recommends the legislature allow the state to recover non-qualifying payments.\n\n\u201cThe Colorado County Treasurers Association would go along with the state getting a clawback to claim funds that are improperly paid out,\u201d said Bartlett, president of the group.\n\nCounties will get their money, whether it comes from a state reimbursement for an eligible exemption, or directly from the taxpayer making a full tax payment, she said.\n\nBut unwinding a payment in larger counties isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds, said Sakdol, who favors putting in more safeguards on the front end.\n\nThe Arapahoe County Treasurer collects taxes on behalf of 355 taxing entities, and any involved in a disputed exemption would need to reimburse the county so it could reimburse the state.\n\nAldo Svaldi: 303-954-1410, asvaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/aldosvaldi", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado may be losing millions in bogus senior property tax breaks", "title": "Colorado may be losing millions in bogus senior property tax breaks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/01/colorado-may-be-losing-millions-in-bogus-senior-property-tax-breaks/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150602__20130124__capitol-dome-horizontal-p1p1-1.jpg", "height": 413}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150602__20130124__capitol-dome-horizontal-p1p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-01T09:24:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T17:46:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3cb\"", "article_summary": "As Colorado\u2019s population ages, improving quality controls on the property tax exemption program will become more critical.\nSomeone may not file a state tax return for a variety of reasons, including income that falls below reporting requirements.\nCounties validate initial property tax exemption applications but aren\u2019t required to verify ongoing eligibility.\nBut the auditor found 430 cases representing $234,800 in tax exemptions from applicants who described themselves on tax returns as full-time nonresidents.\nGiven that claiming a property is almost always more valuable to heirs than maintaining a property tax break, Bartlett suggested those gaps could reflect the time it takes to clear an estate."}
