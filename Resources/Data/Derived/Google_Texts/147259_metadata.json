The Senate\u2019s bill also would almost double the current population of 750,000 university-trained foreign guest workers who compete for jobs sought by America\u2019s annual class of 800,000 university-trained technical professionals.\n\nThe House\u2019s GOP leaders have denounced the Senate bill, but have not deep-sixed the immigration push. Instead, they\u2019re weighing plans to pass a series of small bills that can later be combined with the Senate bill that is being supported by Obama and the Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe GOP will cease to exist as a party of limited government unless it stands up for wage earners and stands against this massively unpopular business-led push to deluge our nation with unskilled foreign workers,\u201d said a GOP congressional aide.\n\n\u201cThe majority of Americans think thing this is right thing to do,\u201d Obama insisted Oct. 17. In fact, polls show few Americans support the Senate\u2019s immigration plan, especially its increased inflow of foreign blue-collar and university-trained workers.\n\nProgressives are supporting the immigration expansion. The additional immigrants would increase public dependence on government by shifting more of the nation\u2019s income from wage-earners to investors, according to a June report by the Congressional Budget Office, and would also boost the number of Democratic-leaning immigrant citizens by 10 million within a decade.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "'Let's not leave this problem to continue festering'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The next potential government shutdown is a little over 12 weeks away and President Obama using the time to\u00a0push for passage of the stalled immigration reform bill, plus approval of higher taxes and", "title": "With next possible shutdown 90 days away, Obama pushes immigration rewrite", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/17/with-next-possible-shutdown-90-days-away-obama-pushes-immigration-rewrite/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2a72295f1a434d00b6bd780c379ec6bd-e1376879325133.jpg", "height": 275}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Let's not leave this problem to continue festering'", "title": "With next possible shutdown 90 days away, Obama pushes immigration rewrite Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/17/with-next-possible-shutdown-90-days-away-obama-pushes-immigration-rewrite/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2a72295f1a434d00b6bd780c379ec6bd-e1376879325133.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-17 11:26:40", "sailthru.title": "With next possible shutdown 90 days away, Obama pushes immigration rewrite", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,immigration,neil-munro", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "barack obama,government shutdown,immigration", "sailthru.description": "The next potential government shutdown is a little over 12 weeks away and President Obama using the time to\u00a0push for passage of the stalled immigration reform bill, plus approval of higher taxes and", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2a72295f1a434d00b6bd780c379ec6bd-e1376879325133.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Even before the House approved the plan, Obama and his aides promised a renewed campaign to advance his agenda.\nHe\u2019s also pushing the Senate\u2019s immigration rewrite, which would triple legal immigration over 10 years to 33 million.\nIn fact, polls show few Americans support the Senate\u2019s immigration plan, especially its increased inflow of foreign blue-collar and university-trained workers.\nObama\u2019s alliance successfully hammered the GOP\u2019s public support, and prompted GOP leaders to accept the Democratic-drafted budget plan Oct. 16.\n\u201cThe majority of Americans think thing this is right thing to do,\u201d Obama insisted Oct. 17."}
