Featured at the expo were dozens of student organizations and community partners, including representatives from the Biology Club, the Pre-Professional Health Society, Oakwood Healthcare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, ACCESS, and the Wayne County Health Department.\n\nRobert Ficano, chief executive of Wayne County, was also present.\n\n\u201cPart of the new aspect of the Health Expo is the new national healthcare act. It\u2019s mandated that by next March you have to have a policy\u2026 So we\u2019re fortunate to have these companies here to help you sign up,\u201d Ficano said about this year\u2019s expo in comparison to last year\u2019s. \u201cWe look forward to doing it again next year!\u201d\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act, mandating that all citizens must choose from different qualified plans offered in the Marketplace, has been highly controversial, it\u2019s important for students to learn about their options under the new mandate, even if they personally disagree with the government\u2019s concept of health care.\n\nIn addition to information about how to sign up for a health insurance policy under the new Affordable Care Act, health services such as influenza vaccinations, blood pressure tests, glucose screenings, and confidential HIV testing were available at the event, which was attended by students from both UM-Dearborn and Henry Ford Community College.\n\nStudents also enjoyed healthy lunch options, frozen yogurt from Yogurtown, and a DJ from WUMD.\n\nThe expo took over two months of planning by students in the Public Health Student Society in partnership with the student organizations and community partners that attended.\n\nProfessor Larry Radine, director of Health Policy Studies at UM-Dearborn, outlined the importance of having a healthcare expo on campus: \u201cThe big issues in healthcare are access, cost, quality of care, and prevention of disease. Everyone we have here, the student clubs, the community partners of healthcare studies, all are working towards addressing these issues,\u201d he said.\n\nThrough presentations by the local nonprofit ACCESS and the country\u2019s largest nonprofit health insurers, Blue Cross Blue Shield, students learned about their healthcare options under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile many students will remain covered under the ACA, which allows young adults up to age 26 to remain on their parents\u2019 healthcare plans, students over age 26 or that are not on family plans were able to find out about the 13 qualified health plans available in the state of Michigan.\n\nWhile the expo was planned and sponsored by various health-related organizations, it was open to the public, and was attended by students from many different communities, cities, and backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something wonderful our community does,\u201d said Sareen Hider, pre-med student at UMD, who represented the Biology Club at the expo. \u201cRight now there are people inside getting flu shots that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to afford them.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from Blue Cross Blue Shield summed up the real impact of the event: \u201cWe\u2019re all here as part of the same mission\u2014helping you learn about your healthcare options.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Michigan Journal", "description": "The Public Health Student Society of the University of Michigan-Dearborn hosted the 2013 Healthcare Expo in Kochoff Hall on Monday, October 14.", "title": "Health Expo brings Healthcare, Ficano, and Froyo to UM-Dearborn", "url": "http://michiganjournal.org/2013/10/22/health-expo-brings-healthcare-ficano-and-froyo-to-um-dearborn/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://michiganjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Health-Expo-2-PAPER.jpg", "height": 668}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://michiganjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Health-Expo-2-PAPER.jpg?w=640", "site": "@MichiganJournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://michiganjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cropped-The-Michigan-Journal-logo-270x270.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-22T15:57:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-21T20:59:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0901\"", "article_summary": "By AMANDA GHANNAM, Staff WriterThe Public Health Student Society of the University of Michigan-Dearborn hosted the 2013 Healthcare Expo in Kochoff Hall on Monday, October 14.\n\u201cPart of the new aspect of the Health Expo is the new national healthcare act.\nFeatured at the expo were dozens of student organizations and community partners, including representatives from the Biology Club, the Pre-Professional Health Society, Oakwood Healthcare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, ACCESS, and the Wayne County Health Department.\nProfessor Larry Radine, director of Health Policy Studies at UM-Dearborn, outlined the importance of having a healthcare expo on campus: \u201cThe big issues in healthcare are access, cost, quality of care, and prevention of disease.\nThe expo took over two months of planning by students in the Public Health Student Society in partnership with the student organizations and community partners that attended."}
