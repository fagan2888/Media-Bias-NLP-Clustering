The study findings were published in the most recent online edition of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nNLST compared two ways of detecting lung cancer: low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) and standard chest X-ray. The study findings revealed that participants who received low-dose CT scans had a 15 to 20 percent lower risk of dying from lung cancer than participants who received standard chest X-rays. This is equivalent to approximately three fewer deaths per 1,000 people screened in the CT group compared to the chest X-ray group over a period of about 7 years of observation. In the light of these results, it is now recommended that LC screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) be performed on at-risk patients.\n\nARC recently released Lung-RADS, its own classification system for LDCT lung cancer screening. The study retrospectively applied the Lung-RADS criteria to the NLST by secondary analysis of a group from a randomized control trial taking place at 33 US-based screening centers. The findings showed that CT screening resulted in a 20 percent reduction of LC deaths among heavy smokers at high risk of LC. In a results comparison, the investigators found that 1 in 10 screenings would have been called positive using Lung-RADS, compared to 1 in 4 under the NLST. The false-positive rate was also lower under Lung-RADS, at 13 percent, compared to NLST at 27 percent. The cancers that Lung-RADS missed were considered to be slow-growing or minimally invasive. This means that they would have in all likelihood been found on a follow-up routine screening with little effect on survival.\n\nIn a recent press release, senior study author Dr. Ella Kazerooni, M.D., M.S., director of cardiothoracic radiology at the University of Michigan Health System, stated that, \u201cLung-RADS was designed to reduce the percentage of positive lung screenings and thereby fewer false-positives, without missing clinically significant cancers. And in fact our analysis found it did. Which means fewer positive screenings and less follow-up testing for patients, which should further improve on the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening that was already demonstrated with NLST.\u201d\n\nThe study findings were released just as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services came to an agreement that lung cancer screening with CT scans should be covered for people at high-risk of developing LC. The screenings are also recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, making them an essential benefit now covered under the Affordable Care Act as well.\n\nFor high risk patients, the potential of receiving a mistaken positive diagnosis means the possibility of adding both cost and potential complications. As Dr. Kazerooni explains, \u201cThe high false-positive rate in the NLST is a potential harm. By implementing Lung-RADS, we may find that screening can be potentially even more effective.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Read how Implementing Lung-RADS Guidelines May Result in More Effective Lung Cancer Screening", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Lung Cancer News Today", "description": "Read how Implementing Lung-RADS Guidelines May Result in More Effective Lung Cancer Screening", "title": "Implementing Lung-RADS Guidelines May Result in More Effective Lung Cancer Screening", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 5616, "identifier": "https://lungcancernewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_127625237.jpg", "height": 3744}, "updated_time": "2015-02-19T05:35:51-05:00", "url": "https://lungcancernewstoday.com/2015/02/19/implementing-lung-rads-guidelines-may-result-in-more-effective-lung-cancer-screening/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Read how Implementing Lung-RADS Guidelines May Result in More Effective Lung Cancer Screening", "creator": "@lcnewstoday", "image": "https://lungcancernewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_127625237.jpg", "title": "Implementing Lung-RADS Guidelines May Result in More Effective Lung Cancer Screening", "site": "@lcnewstoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://lungcancernewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-bionews-square-2-512x512-270x270.png", "keywords": "lung cancer, National Cancer Institute, smoking, CT scan, CT Screening, Methodist Hospital, Lung-RADS, Lung Cancer Screening", "article": {"section": "Lung cancer News", "tag": "U.S. Preventive Services Task Force", "published_time": "2015-02-19T04:00:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-19T05:35:51-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6944\"", "article_summary": "ARC recently released Lung-RADS, its own classification system for LDCT lung cancer screening.\nIn the light of these results, it is now recommended that LC screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) be performed on at-risk patients.\nNLST compared two ways of detecting lung cancer: low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) and standard chest X-ray.\nThe findings showed that CT screening resulted in a 20 percent reduction of LC deaths among heavy smokers at high risk of LC.\nBy implementing Lung-RADS, we may find that screening can be potentially even more effective.\u201d"}
