One goal will be to offer first time offenders and those who have committed non-violent crimes the opportunity to avoid going to jail.\n\n\u201cI think we are recognizing the low risk offenders charged with non-violent offenses need to be dealt with in a different way,\u201d the district attorney said. \u201cWe need to keep the dangerous, bad guys locked up, but these people we can work with and try to get back on the right path.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pre-trial risk assessment system that Harris County judges currently use will be modified because Anderson says it\u2019s outdated.\n\nOne example of an outdated criteria is whether or not the person has a telephone connected to a landline.\n\nIf they do not have one and instead have a cell phone, that scores against him or her.\n\n\u201cWho has a landline anymore?\u201d Anderson asks.\n\nA new approach to probation is another component of the plan. The goal is to make it more pragmatic.\n\n\u201cProbation will be individualized based on the specific needs of a person, what brought them to the situation to start with, what would keep them in the situation,\u201d explains Teresa May, Phd, who is the Director of the Harris County Community Supervision & Corrections Department.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "One goal is to give prosecutors the discretion to offer first time offenders and non-violent criminals the opportunity to avoid jail time.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "One goal is to give prosecutors the discretion to offer first time offenders and non-violent criminals the opportunity to avoid jail time.", "title": "Harris County DA Holds Seminar To Advance Criminal Justice Reform Plan | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/01/23/135183/harris-county-da-holds-seminar-to-advance-criminal-justice-reform-plan/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07200746/Photo-of-Devon-Anderson-Thursday-January-7th-2016-1200x800.jpg", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07200746/Photo-of-Devon-Anderson-Thursday-January-7th-2016-1200x800.jpg", "height": 800, "width": 1200, "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07200746/Photo-of-Devon-Anderson-Thursday-January-7th-2016-1200x800.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "story_id": 464087617, "twitter": {"description": "One goal is to give prosecutors the discretion to offer first time offenders and non-violent criminals the opportunity to avoid jail time.", "title": "Harris County DA Holds Seminar To Advance Criminal Justice Reform Plan", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/01/23/135183/harris-county-da-holds-seminar-to-advance-criminal-justice-reform-plan/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07200746/Photo-of-Devon-Anderson-Thursday-January-7th-2016-1200x800.jpg", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Al Ortiz", "wordCount": 277, "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2016-01-23T06:00:41+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "houston", "published_time": "2016-01-23T06:00:41+00:00"}, "keywords": "News, criminal justice, Devon Anderson, district attorney, harris county, houston", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 1, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a"}, "article_summary": "/ DownloadHarris County prosecutors, defense attorneys and others in the criminal justice system met for two-days in Houston on Thursday and Friday.\n\u201cI think we are recognizing the low risk offenders charged with non-violent offenses need to be dealt with in a different way,\u201d the district attorney said.\nOne goal is to give prosecutors the discretion to offer first time offenders and non-violent criminals the opportunity to avoid jail time.\nThe focus of the seminar at the South Texas College of Law was District Attorney Devon Anderson\u2019s plan to reform the criminal justice system and make it more effective.\nOne goal will be to offer first time offenders and those who have committed non-violent crimes the opportunity to avoid going to jail."}
