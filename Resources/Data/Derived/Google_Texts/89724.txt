The New York Times columnist Gail Collins recently wrote a takedown of Donald Trump. Her focus was Mr. Trump’s rationale for his professed support of Obamacare. “I don’t want people dying on the streets,” he said.

That was a boast. Mr. Trump later added that he also did not want people “dying on the sidewalks.” Ms. Collins rightly noted that this was yet another new low.

It was not, however, entirely without precedent in Republican circles.

When Pope Francis was new to the pontificate and rocking the establishment with his 2013 critique of capitalism, Newt Gingrich professed support for the pope’s view and urged other Republicans to support it as well. What the pope was saying, according to Mr. Gingrich, is that “you do not want to live on a planet with billionaires and people who do not have any food.”

Effective misdirection always incorporates elements of truth. I agree with Mr. Trump on one thing: I don’t want people dying on the streets and sidewalks. I agree with Mr. Gingrich on one thing: I don’t want people to go without food.

But according to Mr. Trump, the point of health care for the masses is to keep the sidewalks clear of dead bodies. Similarly, per Mr. Gingrich, the point of food for the masses is to keep the world safe for billionaires.

Worse, for all their talk, they are not really motivated to help. Mr. Trump’s health plan — as the campaign explained it to Ms. Collins — is nothing like Obamacare, but relies on tired old Republican ideas for tax deductions, Medicaid block grants and private health savings accounts. Mr. Gingrich, for his part, made deriding food stamps a centerpiece of his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.

The Trump phenomenon is appalling. But it did not come out of the blue.
