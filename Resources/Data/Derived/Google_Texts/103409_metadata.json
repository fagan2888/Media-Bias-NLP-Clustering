School officials decided quickly that there were more benefits to airing the ad than not.\n\n\u201cIt just became a very wonderful opportunity for us to be able to get in a major national media event,\u201d she said.\n\nIt cost $10,000 to run the commercial locally, which was a steep discount even for a local spot, Abent said. And the university ran its 2013 TV commercial, so it cost nothing extra to produce.\n\nSuper Bowl XLVIII was the most watched TV event in U.S. history with 111.5 million viewers nationally. In the Pittsburgh designated market area, 456,000 households were tuned in, according to Nielsen ratings.\n\nAbent said she got a few calls from people who thought the university took a national advertising spot and asked how the school, which entered 2014 with a looming $9 million deficit for the 2014-15 school year, could spend $4 million on an advertisement. That was the average cost of a 30-second commercial during this year's game, according to The Washington Post.\n\nOthers were excited to see a local university alongside big name companies like Coke and Budweiser.\n\nCody Young, 23, a senior at Slippery Rock, said while he's not one for school spirit, it was awesome to see his school represented during the big game.\n\n\u201cIt actually made me excited to see SRU showing itself off on such a broad spectrum like the Super Bowl,\u201d Young said.\n\nThe uniqueness of Slippery Rock's name always has been a draw for the university, and Abent said officials hoped that would draw viewer attention.\n\n\u201cWhen you have the opportunity for the name to catch them, even for 30 seconds, and then to say that we have these quality academic programs, we have this success rate, and this focus of student success,\u201d Abent said. \u201cIf you get people to make the connection between \u2018I know of Slippery Rock University' and now \u2018I know a little more about Slippery Rock.\u201d\n\nRachel Farkas is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
