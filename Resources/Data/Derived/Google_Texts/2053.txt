Progress has been made in the monthly review of quality scores for performance improvement: 86 percent of clinical leaders and 64 percent of individual physicians receive updates at least monthly at Most Wired organizations. Still, only 15 percent of clinical leaders and 13 percent of individual physicians receive this information in real time at the point of care.

At Rush Memorial Hospital in Rushville, Ind., the administrative team reviews data monthly to reduce errors or improve clinical performance. “These data are delivered in the form of reports, clinical decision support or scorecards across the organization, thus impacting patient care,” says Jim Boyer, chief information officer.
