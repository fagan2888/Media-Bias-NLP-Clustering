JAMES PINDELL SAT DOWN WITH HIM FOR THIS WEEK'S POLITICAL SCOOP. GOVERNOR PATAKI, THANKS FOR JOINING US. GOOD BEING BACK, JAMES. YOU WERE UP HERE TWO CYCLES AGO, POSSIBLY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. TWICE BEFORE. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT -- EVERY FOUR YEARS WITHOUT FAIL, I'M BACK! WHY IS IT THIS TIME, THE TIME THAT YOU POSSIBLY WOULD BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? WELL, I THINK THE OTHERS WERE POSSIBILITIES BUT AT THE END, I DIDN'T DECIDE TO. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE. I'M HERE NOW PRIMARILY TO HELP REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. THERE ARE A LOT OF HOT RACES HERE, AS YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST CAMPAIGNING WITH FRANK GUINTA, CAMPAIGNING WITH SOME OF THE STATE LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATES AND I'M JUST HOPEFUL THAT THE VOTERS WILL COME OUT AND SEND A MESSAGE THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS. ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOME ANSWER OR SOME OUTCOME IN THESE ELECTIONS THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT? THE ELECTORATE IS OUT THERE FOR GEORGE PATAKI. I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT ME. IT'S ABOUT THE COUNTRY AND THE NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY OUR GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS. BUT IT DOESN'T END NOVEMBER 5TH. IT ENDS WHEN WE HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT UNDERSTANDS THE WHOLE NATURE OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE. AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I'M LOOKING AT IT AGAIN IS OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS, WE'VE SEEN A GOVERNMENT THAT'S BEEN ALMOST DISRESPECTFUL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT IS SO CONVINCED THAT ITS WISDOM AND ITS INFINITE ABILITY THAT IT'S TRYING TO DICTATE MAJOR ELEMENTS OF INDIVIDUALS' LIVES. THE CLASSIC CASE BEING OBAMACARE. IT'S THE WRONG WAY TO GO. IT'S DESTRUCTIVE OF AMERICA IN THE LONG RUN AND WE NEED TO HAVE CANDIDATES OUT THERE WHO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE SIZE, THE COST, THE BURDEN, AND THE INTRUSION THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PLACES ON ALL OF OUR LIVES. GENERALLY SPEAKING, ELECTIONS CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE MID-TERM ELECTION OF 2014, WHAT QUESTIONS WILL -- WHAT ANSWERS WILL IT PROVIDE? I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DEFINITIVE ANSWERS OUT OF THIS ELECTION. I THINK THE QUESTION OF THIS ELECTION IS DO THE PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE IN THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO RUN THE GOVERNMENT? OBVIOUSLY, NOT THE PRESIDENT BUT EVERYTHING FROM THE GOVERNORSHIPS TO THE SENATE AND TO CONTINUE RUNNING THE HOUSE. I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS FAILED. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEIR IDEA OF THE BIG GOVERNMENT AND THE ELITE NO BETTER THAN US, DICTATE TO US MAJOR ELEMENTS OF OUR LIFE IS NOT WORKING. WE HAVE TO PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE MESSAGE THAT NORMAL, NONPOLITICAL AMERICANS COULD TAKE A LOOK AT AND SAY THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. AND THAT'S A REPUBLICAN IDEA AND I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THE REPUBLICANS. SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER. I HOPE WE HAVE A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN DIRECTION IN CONGRESS AND HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHERE REPUBLICANS HAVE MORE POWER, BUT I THINK THAT WILL AWAIT THE", "article_metadata": {"category": "Political Scoop", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Sat, 25 Oct 2014 08:53:01 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "James Pindell", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Former New York governor George Pataki sits down with WMUR Political Scoop's James Pindell.", "title": "Interview: George Pataki", "url": "http://www.wmur.com/political-scoop/interview-george-pataki/29336086", "image": "http://www.wmur.com/image/view/-/29336088/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/e3eefqz/-/img-Interview-George-Pataki.jpg", "type": "video"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wmur.com/political-scoop/interview-george-pataki/29336086", "player": {"width": 640, "height": 390}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wmur://content/video/29336086", "iphone": "wmur://content/video/29336086", "googleplay": "wmur://content/video/29336086"}, "name": {"ipad": "wmur", "iphone": "wmur", "googleplay": "wmur"}, "id": {"ipad": 504646663, "iphone": 504646663, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}}, "site": "@wmur9", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wmur://content/video/29336086", "app_name": "wmur", "package": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}, "ios": {"url": "wmur://content/video/29336086", "app_store_id": 504646663, "app_name": "wmur"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 98665743246}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wmur.com/political-scoop/interview-george-pataki/29336086"}, "keywords": "WMUR,George Pataki,James Pindell,politics,Political Scoop", "google-site-verification": "xTJFxn8Gm6mXV5ugnbTb198craV_CkoMGMqQyL4EfS4", "news_keywords": "WMUR,George Pataki,James Pindell,politics,Political Scoop", "description": "Former New York governor George Pataki sits down with WMUR Political Scoop's James Pindell."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6d0\"", "article_summary": "JAMES PINDELL SAT DOWN WITH HIM FOR THIS WEEK'S POLITICAL SCOOP.\nI'M HERE NOW PRIMARILY TO HELP REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES.\nI THINK THE QUESTION OF THIS ELECTION IS DO THE PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE IN THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO RUN THE GOVERNMENT?\nAND THAT'S A REPUBLICAN IDEA AND I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THE REPUBLICANS.\nWHY IS IT THIS TIME, THE TIME THAT YOU POSSIBLY WOULD BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?"}
