The Lauderdale County Circuit Clerk's office was opened from 8 a.m. until 12 p.m. Saturday for absentee voting.

Voters were voting for a run-off with democratic candidates for Transportation Commissioner in the Central District. There are 22 counties in the Central District. The candidates in this run-off race are Robert Amos and Mary Coleman.

"A lot of people think the election cycle is over and they don't realize that it's an awful lot of work and these election commissioners have been working really hard trying to get everything ready because we've been on a real time constraint right now with just three weeks to turn election around," Circuit Clerk Donna Jill Johnson says.

Absentee voting continues until 12 p.m. Saturday, August 22nd.
