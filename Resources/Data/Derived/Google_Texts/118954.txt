Denver police have arrested four people after their vehicle collided with another during an incident Sunday morning that started with shots fired, said Tyrone Campbell, police spokesman. Police are still seeking the shooter.

The incident began at about 10:26 a.m. near Florida Avenue and Federal Boulevard.

A red Jeep Wrangler, and a blue Jeep Cherokee were at the scene and the occupants of those two vehicles knew each other, Campbell said.

Someone in a third vehicle, which was unconnected with the two Jeeps, said something that upset someone in the Wrangler.

The Wrangler occupant got out of the vehicle and fired a shotgun, striking the third car, Campbell said.

Police arrived, and the people in both the Wrangler and the Cherokee, fled. “They were together, but we don’t know what their involvement was or why they fled,” Campbell said.

Police chased the Cherokee, which accidently collided with a fourth, unconnected, vehicle at Florida and Federal. Four men jumped out of the Cherokee and were arrested.

Police have not yet found the Wrangler, Campbell said.
