The good news is that Hurt\u2019s cancer is in its early stage, which often means a higher success rate in its treatment. The actor remains, as he stated, \u201cmore than optimistic,\u201d and he has no plans to stop working on projects and, in the near future, he will be recording a play that will air on BBC Radio 4. Hurt stated that \u201cone of life\u2019s small ironies\u201d is that the play he will be soon recording for BBC radio 4 is called \u201cJeffrey Bernard Is Unwell.\u201d\n\nIn the Harry Potter franchise, Hurt plays magic-wand shop-owner Garrick Ollivander. The British actor has been in many other films, like Nineteen Eighty-Four, V for Vendetta, Midnight Express, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Elephant Man, the TV movie, The Naked Civil Servant, and Alien, in which he played Kane, otherwise known as \u201cdude whose chest burst open and alien came out of.\u201d In 1981, he even played Jesus in the Mel Brooks comedy, History of the World: Part I. He was also the War Doctor in the 50th anniversary Dr. Who special.\n\nHurt is going to be in the upcoming movie, The History of Love, which is still being filmed, and he will also be in a new Tarzan movie, starring alongside Margot Robbie and Samuel L. Jackson. Monty Python\u2018s Terry Gilliam announced that the actor will be playing the title role in his movie project for Amazon, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. Just a few months ago, in December 2014, Queen Elizabeth honored the veteran actor by awarding him a knighthood.\n\nNot only is the Harry Potter star optimistic about there being \u201ca satisfactory outcome\u201d to his treatment for pancreatic cancer, he stated on Tuesday that \u201cthe medical team\u201d is optimistic. He has always been open in the past about, as he puts it, \u201cthe way I conduct my life,\u201d so he saw no reason to also not let the public in on the news that he has early stage pancreatic cancer and is undergoing treatment for it.\n\nHurt has been nominated twice for an Oscar during his career, but he has not won one yet. He was nominated for an Oscar the first time for his supporting role of Max in the 1978 movie, Midnight Express, and the second time for playing John Merrick in the 1980 film, The Elephant Man. In 2005, the actor married producer and casting director Anwen Rees-Myers. She is his fourth wife.\n\nThough Hurt is perhaps best known to his younger fans as Ollivander, the owner of the magic-wand shop in the Harry Potter movies, he has had a long career in acting. In 1962, one of his first roles on TV was playing James Hogan in Z Cars. He has been acting fairly regularly ever since, even providing the voice of the animated character, Professor Trevor \u2018Broom\u2019 Bruttenholm, in the TV movie, Hellboy Animated: Blood and Iron.\n\nHarry Potter star Hurt is undergoing treatment for early stage pancreatic cancer, but the actor has decided not to let that slow him down. He has had a long and successful acting career spanning several decades, and has had memorable roles in TV series, movies and onstage in plays. With the reportedly optimistic prognosis by Hurt\u2019s medical team, there is little reason to believe that he will not continue on delivering memorable roles for years to come.\n\nWritten by Douglas Cobb\n\nEdited by Jennifer Pfalz\n\nSources:\n\nFox News: John Hurt diagnosed with \u2018early stage pancreatic cancer\u2019\n\nLos Angeles Times: John Hurt has early pancreatic cancer; actor\n\nis \u2018more than optimistic\u2019\n\nEntertainment Weekly (blog): John Hurt diagnosed with pancreatic cancer\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Sam\u2019s Flickr Page \u2013 Creative Commons 2.0\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Harry Potter star John Hurt, 75, has been diagnosed with and is undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer.
