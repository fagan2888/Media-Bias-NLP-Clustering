Instead, she told TheBlaze, she felt as though the reporter was using the label in an effort to box her in ideologically.\n\nSaying the media often paint an unpalatable picture of Tea Party-aligned candidates, Love said she felt the reporter was following this approach when she asked whether Love is a member of the conservative cohort.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to allow you to put me in a box \u2026 I am a wife, I\u2019m a mother, I\u2019m a concerned citizen \u2014 I\u2019m a Utahan. Label me with that,\u201d Love said of the answer she gave.\n\nRather than distancing herself from traditional Tea Party values like fiscal discipline and restraint, Love said her attempt to avoid the reporter\u2019s label had everything to do with what she believes her opponent \u2014 and the media \u2014 are trying to do.\n\n\u201cThat (is a) label that they try to use is to discredit people like (Utah Republican Sen.) Mike Lee. (They use) it as a code sign for extreme,\u201d Love said. \u201cWhat I told her is, \u2018I\u2019m not going to allow you to label me.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cYou just cannot let them label you as being a crazy person. I have been a mayor in my city. Before I even knew about the Tea Party I was working in my city to make sure I understood the proper role of government.\u201d\n\nLove said Rep. Jim Matheson (D-Utah), her future opponent should she get her party\u2019s nomination, is using a similar tactic of making her look \u201cway out there.\u201d Her values, she said, remain the same and align with her vision of what the Tea Party truly stands for: fiscal responsibility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let the mainstream media decide who we are. I am the same person I have always been,\u201d Love said. \u201cMy principles are not going to change.\u201d\n\nThe article in question also reported Love said she didn\u2019t \u201ceven know what to say\u201d when asked if she was trying to distance herself from the Tea Party. But Love later told TheBlaze that she made this comment out of \u201cexasperation,\u201d because she was surprised by the question \u2014 one she said has no merits.\n\nLove called the article a \u201cclassic example of somebody that owns the ink and the paper taking things out of context.\u201d\n\nImmediately after the article was written, Love issued a statement responding to other comments published about how she would have adopted a different approach to the government shutdown than the one taken by Lee and other Republican leaders:\n\nThere\u2019s been some confusion over a poorly-written article by Lisa Riley Roche of the Deseret News, so let me make clear my position. My vote over the shutdown would have been the same as that of Utah\u2019s other GOP House members \u2013 Jason Chaffetz, Rob Bishop, and Chris Stewart. I would have voted against funding Obamacare and voted to keep open the rest of the government. I would not have voted, as Jim Matheson did, to continue the reckless rate of spending that President Obama and Harry Reid have insisted on. I believe it\u2019s wrong for us to kick the can down the road by shackling our children and grandchildren with our debt. Unfortunately, a false narrative exists out there that I disagree with Senator Mike Lee\u2019s goals and commitment. Here\u2019s the truth: Aside from state legislators, I was the only elected leader who stood with Senator Lee at his rally earlier this month. Senator Lee\u2019s devotion to limited government, fiscal discipline, and personal responsibility is a goal I share, and I\u2019m proud to have stood with approximately 2,000 fellow Utahns on a cold, November morning to applaud his commitment to defunding Obamacare and putting Utah first.\n\nLove is expected to pen an op-ed in in the coming weeks for Desert News, the outlet that published the original story, addressing these issues.\n\nCalls and e-mails to Deseret News and the reporter requesting a comment and offering a chance to respond were not returned.\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Saratoga Springs, Utah, Mayor Mia Love says a recent news article saying she\u00a0\"rejected\" the \"Tea Party\" label is inaccurate.
