(21Alive) -- Any and all speculation that U.S Congressman Marlin Stutzman, (R) 3rd district, was going make a run for Sen. Dan Coats' (R) - Ind soon-to-be vacant senate seat is now officially over as he announced today in Roanoke he will be running for the United States Senate.\n\nDuring his announcement he was surrounded by supporters holding \"Marlin for Senate\" signs.\n\n38-year-old Stutzman took office in 2011 and is considered among many in his party to the most conservative, as he has advocated for gun rights. He also criticized The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare for short, numerous times.\n\n\"What we're going to focus on is Washington D.C., I know the problems that are already there, I've cast difficult votes. I think people are going to be looking for proven leadership in a conservative that's already stood up and said he's going to stick to his values and that's what I've done,\" said the Congressman.\n\nStutzman admits that running on a state-wide campaign won't be easy, especially when it comes to getting votes in urban areas. He says he hopes to continue to build on the momentum from the campaign he ran in 2010.\n\nThe LaGrange County native will face off against former Indiana Republican Party Chairman Eric Holcomb as they are the only two that have declared that they will run for the senate. Other likely candidates to emerge in the future are Todd Rokita (R) - 4th district and Todd Young (R) - 9th district.\n\nSenator Dan Coats announced earlier this year that he would not seek reelection in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "21Alive", "description": "", "title": "Marlin Stutzman to Run for U.S. Senate", "url": "http://www.21alive.com/news/local/Marlin-Stutzman-to-Run-for-Senate-303179361.html", "image": "http://media.21alive.com/images/Stutz.jpg", "video": {"width": 470, "identifier": "http://www.21alive.com/v/?i=303179361", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "height": 264}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "cm-E52cTQXHogAoX23iypmrlnH2haauy-ZCZxZPn7p0", "description": "", "title": "Marlin Stutzman to Run for U.S. Senate"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4320\"", "article_summary": "Other likely candidates to emerge in the future are Todd Rokita (R) - 4th district and Todd Young (R) - 9th district.\nStutzman admits that running on a state-wide campaign won't be easy, especially when it comes to getting votes in urban areas.\n\"What we're going to focus on is Washington D.C., I know the problems that are already there, I've cast difficult votes.\nHe says he hopes to continue to build on the momentum from the campaign he ran in 2010.\nSenator Dan Coats announced earlier this year that he would not seek reelection in 2016."}
