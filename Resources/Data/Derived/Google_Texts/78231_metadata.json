Students seeking financial aid must file the form each year.\n\nApplying early is important because some states have early grant deadlines, and some distribute aid on a first-come, first-served basis, Asher said. So waiting may mean students will miss out.\n\nAlthough filing the form in early January is ideal, not all families are ready to do so. The form requires filers to use information from their federal income tax return from the calendar year that just ended \u2014 so January filers would use information from 2015. But most people will not receive their W-2 forms and other information necessary to file a 2015 tax return until later in January, at the earliest.\n\nThis is the last year filers will face this situation. The form for the 2017-18 academic year can be filed as early as Oct. 1 and will rely on income tax information from the previous tax year (or, in financial aid lingo, \u201cprior-prior\u201d year tax information). So in 2016, students will file two FAFSAs \u2014 each using 2015 tax information.\n\nIn the meantime, families who want to file in early January, before they have filed their 2015 income tax return, can complete the FAFSA with estimated financial data. That will get their application in the system, and they can update it, if needed, when they actually file their return, \u201cwithout losing your place in line,\u201d said Martha Holler, a spokeswoman for Sallie Mae.\n\nFiling estimated financial information and updating it later may raise the chances of your application being flagged for verification, Asher said. That means you may be required to submit extra documents before your financial aid package is completed. But estimating is the best option, she said, if you might risk missing an early state deadline by waiting.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about filing the FAFSA:\n\nDo I have to file the FAFSA online?\n\nIt is not required, but most filers do, and there are benefits to doing so, Asher said. If you have already filed your income taxes, for instance, you can use the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Data Retrieval Tool to automatically transfer tax data into your FAFSA form.\n\nDo I need a PIN to fill out the FAFSA online?\n\nIn May, the rules changed so that instead of a PIN, FAFSA filers must use a Federal Student Aid ID, which consists of a user-created username and password. The ID can be used to get access to financial aid information online and electronically sign the FAFSA. Information about setting up the ID is available on the federal Education Department\u2019s website.\n\nIs there a fee for filling out the FAFSA?\n\nNo. Student aid experts emphasize that the \u201cF\u201d in FAFSA stands for \u201cfree,\u201d and that consumers should be wary of websites pitching help for a fee. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau this year took action against the operator of a FAFSA website that illegally billed more than 100,000 consumers.\n\nThe New York Times", "article_metadata": {"description": "Students who plan on attending college next fall should begin preparing for a looming financial chore: completing the document that is crucial for financial aid.", "og": {"description": "Students who plan on attending college next fall should begin preparing for a looming financial chore: completing the document that is crucial for financial aid.", "title": "The time has arrived to fill out college aid forms", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20160101-the-time-has-arrived-to-fill-out-college-aid-forms.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20160101-nm_07collinvalsal_05sp_44318989.ece/BINARY/original/NM_07COLLINVALSAL_05SP_44318989", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-01-02T03:02:38Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-01-02T02:50:46Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"The time has arrived to fill out college aid forms\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20160101-the-time-has-arrived-to-fill-out-college-aid-forms.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20160101-nm_07collinvalsal_05sp_44318989.ece/BINARY/original/NM_07COLLINVALSAL_05SP_44318989\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2599210\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-01-02T02:50:46Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20160101-nm_07collinvalsal_05sp_44318989.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NM_07COLLINVALSAL_05SP_44318989", "publishtime": "2016-01-02T02:50:46Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "That means you may be required to submit extra documents before your financial aid package is completed.\nThe ID can be used to get access to financial aid information online and electronically sign the FAFSA.\nAfter holiday celebrations are over, students who plan to attend college next fall should begin preparing for a looming financial chore: completing the document that is crucial for financial aid.\nStudents seeking financial aid must file the form each year.\nFiling estimated financial information and updating it later may raise the chances of your application being flagged for verification, Asher said."}
