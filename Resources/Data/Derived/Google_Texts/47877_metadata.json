James Madison called separation of powers \u201cthe first principle of a free government\u201d and helped craft a Constitution that divides government power between national and state governments and between different branches of government.\n\nIn Federalist 51, Madison explained the related concept of checks and balances, saying that \u201cthe great security against a gradual concentration\u201d of government power (once separated) \u201cconsists in giving those who administer each department, the necessary constitutional means and personal motives, to resist encroachments of the others.\u201d\n\nNot all encroachments, however, have been resisted. A decision in the recently concluded U.S. Supreme Court term highlights one type of encroachment that has grown out of control. Department of Transportation v. Association of American Railroads asked whether granting Amtrak power to help frame regulations that apply to private railroad enterprises violates the Constitution.\n\nThe primary complaint was that this grant of power breaches the \u201cnon-delegation doctrine.\u201d When the Supreme Court passed that issue back to the lower court, Justices Alito and Thomas thoughtfully described considerations that should guide further review.\n\nThe essence of the non-delegation doctrine is that Congress cannot give its legislative power to others.\n\nThe \u201cvesting clauses\u201d of the Constitution assign different powers to each of the three branches, stating, for example, that \u201cAll legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States\u201d before going on to state how the Congress will be composed, what powers it will have, and what processes it must observe in passing laws.\n\nThe Constitution similarly vests executive power in the President\u2019s hands and judicial power in the courts created under Article III. The divisions of power among the branches and the processes established to govern each are essential protections against tyranny; they are the mechanisms that check expansion of discretionary official power.\n\nThe Supreme Court has been fairly vigilant in preventing exercise of judicial power by officials not appointed and tenured in accord with Article III\u2019s commands or assignments of executive power that do not observe constitutional requirements respecting appointment and control of executive officers. Its record with respect to congressional efforts to outplace legislative authority, however, has been far weaker.\n\nBasic policy choices on rules that regulate the behavior of others have to be made by Congress: it can\u2019t empower any other official or body to make those rules\u2014essentially to enact laws\u2014bypassing democratic election of the officials, bicameralism (different constituencies, criteria, and terms of office for House and Senate), presentment to and approval by the President, and other procedural protections built into the Constitution\u2019s design. Language from Supreme Court opinions in the late 1800s and 1920s, however, laid the groundwork for judicial acceptance of laws authorizing broad policy-making by executive officials (outside fields of independent, constitutionally-assigned executive power).\n\nThe Court found this permissible so long as Congress sets out an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d that binds executive officials. Although the Court struck down two laws in the 1930s for failing that test, it has approved numerous laws that give no meaningful direction. The FCC, for example, is authorized to hand out licenses to spectrum users \u201cas the public convenience, interest, or necessity requires\u201d\u2014in other words, as it sees fit. Many other laws are so complex, self-contradictory, or opaque as to leave wide fields of discretionary power in administrators\u2019 hands. The 848-page Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and the 900-plus-page Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) are just two other examples.\n\nCongress\u2019s failure to make the hard choices among competing policies and to give real direction to those asked to administer its burgeoning laws effectively transfers law-making power to unelected and largely unchecked officials. It also encourages ever more lawmaking by Congress (now freed from the hardest work). Congressionally enacted laws today cover nearly 30,000 pages; administrative rules occupy more than 180,000 pages! Citizens are held accountable\u2014even criminally liable\u2014for failing to adhere to directions spread across this ever-expanding maze.\n\nUnchecked discretionary official power inevitably erodes liberty. It\u2019s time to reinvigorate the non-delegation doctrine and resuscitate the constitutional system of separate and limited government powers. That will be hard work for judges, and another source of concern for those fearing a less constrained judiciary. Still, it is a risk worth taking to revive limits on law-creation central to our founding charter\u2014while we can.\n\nRonald A.
