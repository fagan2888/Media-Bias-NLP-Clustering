Within a day after multiple coordinated terrorist attacks killed more than a hundred people in Paris on Nov. 13, mourners constructed an impromptu memorial outside of the French Consulate on Kearny Street in San Francisco.

At a press conference on Friday, President Barack Obama called the attacks an “outrageous attempt to terrorize innocent civilians.”Law enforcement agencies throughout the Bay Area said they are heightening security in the interest of public safety, in the wake of the attacks.
