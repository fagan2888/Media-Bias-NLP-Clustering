(AP) - Two soldiers from the same Joint Base Lewis-McChord infantry battalion experienced two very different kinds of justice when they came home from training events a year apart and carried out deadly crimes.\n\nPvt. Jeremiah Hill, prosecuted in Army court, received a sentence of 45 years in prison for knifing another soldier in the heart on a Lakewood street, the News Tribune reported (http://bit.ly/1MfaWFm).\n\nThe rookie soldier from a poor Chicago family had an Army-provided defense attorney and rarely showed remorse when he testified.\n\nSpc. Skylar Nemetz, prosecuted in Pierce County Superior Court, received a sentence of less than 14 years for causing the death of his wife, Danielle, when he accidentally shot her in the head with rifle.\n\nHis Northern California family reached deep into their savings to hire an experienced private attorney. Nemetz wept on the witness stand and persuaded a jury he didn\u2019t mean to kill his wife.\n\nThe disparities in outcomes for two soldiers from the 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment show the differences in what can happen when the Army and Pierce County carry out their informal agreement to decide which agency should prosecute soldiers who commit crimes outside of JBLM.\n\nHill could have been prosecuted in a civilian court, where he likely would not have not received much more than 20 years for killing Geike, said the county prosecutor who handled the case for the year before it moved to military court.\n\nThat same offense, put in front of a military jury, got him more than double that time behind bars.\n\nBelieving the soldiers on the jury would agree that Geike\u2019s death was an accident, Hill couldn\u2019t contain his anger over his punishment. After Geike\u2019s family left the courtroom, he shouted an expletive that revealed his frustration.\n\nHad the Army taken Nemetz\u2019s case, the infantryman with almost three years of military experience would have had to explain to other trained soldiers how he mishandled the rifle and killed his wife.\n\n\u201cYou were an expert,\u201d Superior Court Judge Jack Nevin, himself a retired Army judge, said before he sentenced Nemetz. \u201cAnd the level of the expertise that you had shows the degree of recklessness. This isn\u2019t someone who picked up a weapon for the first time.\u201d\n\nOpen doors between prosecutors\n\nJBLM and the Pierce County Prosecutor\u2019s Office began opening the doors to trading criminal cases about two years ago, said deputy prosecutor John Sheeran.\n\nIt\u2019s a common procedure in military communities around the country where criminal suspects could be prosecuted in different courts.\n\nFor whatever reason, Sheeran said, the county and the base were fairly unfamiliar with each other when the Army and Air Force reached out to the prosecutor\u2019s office in 2014.\n\nIn a series of conversations, Army and Air Force attorneys invited civilian prosecutors out to the base, and the groups talked about the kinds of cases they\u2019d prefer to prosecute.\n\nThey grew friendly, as Army emails released in the Nemetz trial show. Attorneys called each other \u201cbrother\u201d and tried to ease obstacles for each other.\n\n\u201cBe certain we stand ready to help and contribute in any way we can,\u201d an Army attorney wrote to a county deputy prosecutor just after Nemetz\u2019s arrest.\n\nArmy attorneys did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nPierce County tends to want military-related cases that involve civilians, or some cases in which crime victims might benefit from county-run domestic violence or sex assault services.\n\nGenerally, Sheeran said, JBLM wants cases in which soldiers commit crimes against other soldiers or when the majority of witnesses are military service members.\n\nThe Army also has resources it can tap to fly a victim\u2019s family members to court hearings.\n\nAll of those factors applied to Hill\u2019s case.\n\nGeike\u2019s family lived out of state and was able to use Army resources to attend the trial. Geike\u2019s friends who were with him during the stabbing were soldiers, and so was the group that was out with Hill that night.\n\nHill sat in the Pierce County jail for 14 months before the Army took his trial. Today, Sheeran said, it wouldn\u2019t take a year to move a case such as Hill\u2019s over to JBLM.\n\n\u201cIf that case came along today, I\u2019m sure they would have had it in a matter of weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a better relationship now.\u201d\n\nDefense attorneys aren\u2019t at the table in determining which agency takes a case. It\u2019s a decision that belongs with the prosecutors, although a defense attorney might use it for an appeal after a verdict.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any say about that,\u201d said Michael Kawamura, the director of the Pierce County Office of Assigned Counsel.\n\nSimilar charges, different convictions\n\nHill and Nemetz offered similar cases to the extent that they were infantrymen returning from a training exercise who committed deadly crimes in Lakewood.\n\nEach claimed he did not intend to take his victim\u2019s life, although Hill seemed to be looking for a fight the night he stabbed Geike, whereas Nemetz said he was simply clearing a rifle when he accidentally shot his wife.\n\nPierce County initially charged Hill, 25, with first-degree murder. Prosecutors reduced the charge to second-degree murder, indicating they did not believe they could persuade a jury that Hill meant to kill Geike.\n\nWhen the Army took the case in December 2014, it escalated the charges to premeditated murder. His court-martial panel in April 2015 convicted him of a lesser charge, murder without premeditation, but gave him a long sentence.\n\nNemetz, 20 at the time of the killing, was charged with murder, meaning prosecutors believed he purposely shot his wife. His jury found him guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter.\n\nDefense attorneys said the differences in their sentences centered on Hill being convicted of a crime that reflected an intent to harm another person.\n\nBy contrast, Nemetz\u2019s manslaughter conviction reflected the jury\u2019s determination that his wife\u2019s death was a reckless accident.\n\n\u201cIn the civilian and the military side, the parameters for something you do intentionally are much higher compared to something that you do that is reckless but not intentional,\u201d said Mike Berens, a defense attorney who represented one of Hill\u2019s co-defendants.\n\nAnother difference, Berens said, was Hill\u2019s callous performance on the witness stand.\n\nWhereas Nemetz wept for his wife, Hill portrayed his crime as an unfortunate occurrence that unfolded between two groups of young men who confronted each other on the street after a night of drinking in October 2013.\n\nThat night, Hill and four others approached Geike and two of his buddies on Pacific Highway Southwest. They exchanged words, but appeared ready to go their separate ways. All of them served in the Army.\n\nThat\u2019s when Hill suddenly grabbed Geike and stabbed him in the chest.\n\nBerens noted that defense attorneys had some evidence they used to suggest Geike was armed with a knife, too, and that Hill might have felt threatened in some way.\n\nBut when he testified, Hill was \u201cpretty stone cold, no regret,\u201d Berens said.\n\nHill\u2019s family did not respond to requests for comment for this story. At his trial, they shared memories about him as a fun-loving young man who loved basketball and looked out for his younger sister.\n\nIn a flat voice at the trial, Hill apologized to Geike\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the death,\u201d he said. \u201cI killed him. There\u2019s nothing to do to take it back.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The News Tribune, http://www.thenewstribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two soldiers from the same Joint Base Lewis-McChord infantry battalion experienced two very different kinds of justice when they came home from training events a year apart and carried out deadly crimes.", "Author": "ADAM ASHTON", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Two soldiers from the same Joint Base Lewis-McChord infantry battalion experienced two very different kinds of justice when they came home from training events a year apart and carried out deadly crimes.", "title": "2 soldiers get vastly different sentences for deadly crimes", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/9/2-soldiers-get-vastly-different-sentences-for-dead/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/09/soldiers_sentenced.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/09/soldiers_sentenced.jpeg", "title": "2 soldiers get vastly different sentences for deadly crimes", "description": "Two soldiers from the same Joint Base Lewis-McChord infantry battalion experienced two very different kinds of justice when they came home from training events a year apart and carried out deadly crim", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "Generally, Sheeran said, JBLM wants cases in which soldiers commit crimes against other soldiers or when the majority of witnesses are military service members.\nSimilar charges, different convictionsHill and Nemetz offered similar cases to the extent that they were infantrymen returning from a training exercise who committed deadly crimes in Lakewood.\nBelieving the soldiers on the jury would agree that Geike\u2019s death was an accident, Hill couldn\u2019t contain his anger over his punishment.\nTACOMA, Wash.
