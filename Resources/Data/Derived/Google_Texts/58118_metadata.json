In some cases, they provide no coverage for treatment sought outside a network. More insurers, especially on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s public insurance exchanges, have started offering plans with narrow networks of doctors or hospitals in an attempt to squeeze better rates out of those providers and control health care costs.\n\nThis makes finding so-called in-network care crucial for insurance shoppers, especially those who have established relationships with a provider. But matching a doctor with an insurance network can be no simple task.\n\nBrokers say insurance directories are constantly evolving as doctors retire, sell their practices or join provider groups that may not be in a network. On top of that, they find that customers often get confused because one insurer may have several networks, some that cover their doctor and some that do not.\n\n\u201cIt can be overwhelming,\u201d said Susan Rider, a consultant with the Indianapolis-based insurance agency Gregory & Appel.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, known as AHIP, will attempt to streamline directory updates by testing a new concept next month in California, Florida and Indiana. AHIP will have one health information technology company contact providers for regular updates on standard information such as whether they are accepting new patients and if they are still in a coverage network. Then AHIP will share that information with several insurers.\n\nThis can spare a doctor\u2019s office multiple phone calls or faxes from insurers seeking updates, and it could lead to more accurate directories, AHIP officials say. They add that the six-month test is nothing consumers will notice, but it may help create a blueprint for building more efficient directories in other states.\n\nRider and Naples, Florida-based broker Wayne Sakamoto say they haven\u2019t noticed many problems with inaccurate directories, especially since they can be updated quickly online. That said, Sakamoto still recommends that his customers call a doctor to confirm that the provider is in a specific network simply because these networks evolve so frequently.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest concern is really having consumers understand these networks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very confusing.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2016 Associated Press.
