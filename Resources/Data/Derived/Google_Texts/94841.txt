The earlier a baby is born, the more severe its health problems are likely to be. A full-term birth lasts 40 weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A premature birth is categorized as one that lasts under 37 weeks. In 2012, one of every nine pregnancies was a premature birth.

So what happens when a baby is born just 23 weeks into the pregnancy? A North Dakota boy arrived in this world weighing just 1 pound and 6 ounces. Trevor Frolek was so small, his father Bo could fit Trevor’s foot in his wedding band.

Trevor spent 345 days in the hospital but is now able to go home and enjoy the company of his family. The hospital staff at Fargo’s Essential Health St. Mary's Children's Hospital had gotten so used to having Trevor and his family around that they threw him a going away party on his last day there.

“A lot of days we left here and were not sure we would see him again, and to see him do well,” nurse Erin Kuehl said, “this is the best reward we could ask for."

Trevor has been called a little blessing by his father and a miracle by his mother, Becky. She also said that she was nervous and excited, while hoping that she had what it takes to raise Trevor without the help of nurses and doctors.

The Froleks are expecting another child to arrive in a few short months, so Trevor and his big sister Brookelyn will have some company soon.
