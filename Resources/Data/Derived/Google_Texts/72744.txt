Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson says he doesn't agree with front-runner Donald Trump's assertion that former president George W. Bush is to blame for the 9/11 terror attacks, but added that a more aggressive policy could have captured the mastermind of the attacks sooner.

Carson, appearing Sunday on ABC's "This Week," said Bush should have declared energy independence after the attacks and that would have forced moderate Arab governments to turn terrorist leader Osama bin Laden over to the United States.



Host George Stephanopoulos noted that the Saudi government, then the world's top oil supplier, already had kicked bin Laden, a Saudi citizen, out of their country.



"Well, you may not think they had any loyalty to him, but I believe otherwise," Carson said. "They would have known where he was. You know, there were indications for instance during the Clinton administration that they knew exactly where he was, but didn't necessarily pull the trigger. If we could tell where he was, I'm certain they knew where he was."



Carson also discussed how he has changed his past thinking on health insurance. In his book "America the Beautiful," Carson discussed limiting private health insurance profits to 15 percent, five percent of which would be given to the government's national catastrophic health care fund.



Carson said he now believes health savings accounts are a far better solution.
