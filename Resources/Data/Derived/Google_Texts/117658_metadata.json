In a league with eye-opening stories, his path sticks out. The rookie prepared for the NFL by starring at Sacramento State. Then, after an anxious six weeks following OTAs last summer, the New Orleans Saints signed the linebacker for training camp.\n\nThe Hornets aren\u2019t a football factory. They don\u2019t play major-college football. Their most notable victory was upsetting the University of Colorado in Boulder in 2012. Davis starred in that game.\n\n\u201cI had a big third-down stop that helped (set up the Hornets\u2019 winning field goal). But it wasn\u2019t me. It was the entire team,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone contributed.\u201d\n\nDavis has even better memories of Colorado. Claimed off waivers a month ago from the Saints to fill in on Denver\u2019s special teams, Davis could be a starter Monday night at Cincinnati, or at least receive significant snaps, at weakside linebacker after injuries to Brandon Marshall and Danny Trevathan. Davis talked last week about his winding journey to Denver.\n\nQ: You played 28 snaps last Sunday at San Diego, including 23 in pass coverage. Are you ready to be a starter in prime time against the Bengals?\n\nA: I couldn\u2019t ask for a better situation and scenario with family watching Monday night. I always dreamed of this. Coming from Sacramento State, it was always a dream, but a dream that\u2019s hard to realize. For me to be in this position, it\u2019s a blessing. I will be ready for any opportunity. The communication is the biggest adjustment with the different groups in the base package.\n\nQ: How do you compare being in the NFL with the Broncos to your college experience?\n\nA: It has definitely been different. You get a few people at Sacramento State who know your name. It\u2019s a smaller school. Here, you have thousands of fans waiting outside practice yelling \u201cTodd!\u201d I am like, \u201cYou know my name?\u201d That\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s been a great experience.\n\nQ: Your arrival in Denver created headlines because the Broncos were upset that they couldn\u2019t reach you immediately in New Orleans, which suggested the Saints were trying to keep you from other teams. What happened?\n\nA: It was an off day. I didn\u2019t know people were trying to contact me. I went to the Saints\u2019 facility and turned my phone off like I always had. I didn\u2019t think I was going anywhere. The plan was to go back to their practice squad. When I turned my phone back on later in the day, I had a Colorado number on there. I was like, \u201cWhy is someone from there calling me?\u201d I found out I was going to be a Bronco. Sounds good to me.\n\nQ: A teammate, linebacker Brandon Marshall, praised how quickly you have learned the Denver defense. How has your transition gone?\n\nA: I just saw it as an opportunity. I didn\u2019t know what to expect. The guys have been great. It felt like home, felt good from the start. The guys here took me in and took care of me.\n\nQ: Who was your favorite player growing up?\n\nA: I am a big Ray Lewis guy, everything about him. His intensity, the way he talks. I watch his highlights before I play even today. I think I have seen every (NFL Films) miked-up show, every inspirational video. I don\u2019t have a pregame dance. I don\u2019t bring that yet. His dance was sick, though. Being from SoCal, I was a Raiders fan. I loved the Ravens later. I just loved the way Ray played. He\u2019s the kind of person that makes you switch teams. Like LeBron James. You are a Heat fan one minute and next minute you are a Cavaliers fan again. It\u2019s like that.\n\nQ: Who is the biggest influence in your life?\n\nA: My dad, Todd. He taught me how to walk the right path. He\u2019s a pastor. He taught me the right morals. Not only to treat women with respect, but treat people the right way. Everything you do, do it as if you\u2019re doing it for God. I talk to my dad every day. I talk to my mom every day. If I don\u2019t, I am in trouble. That\u2019s the other thing that brought me to Ray (Lewis). His faith. How intense and passionate he is about it. It\u2019s something I gravitated to very strongly.\n\nTroy E.
