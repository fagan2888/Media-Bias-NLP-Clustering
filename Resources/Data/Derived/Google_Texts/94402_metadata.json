(Photo: Gannett file photo)Buy Photo\n\nPolice investigated a coyote sighting Thursday afternoon in the Windward development by West Bay Avenue, Barnegat Police Lt. Keith Germain said.\n\nPolice responded to a 10th Street home after a resident reported the sighting, he said. Authorities are looking for the coyote to be sure it is not rabid or threatening.\n\n\"They are part of the ecosystem here,\" said Germain. \"I've seen them myself when I'm out driving around the western portion of the township. It's certainly not unusual to see them.\"\n\nGermain expects coyote sightings to become more common as their population grows and new homes encroach on their Pinelands environment.\n\nAnyone who walks in wooded portions of the township should be aware of their surroundings, he said, adding that Barnegat has no history of coyote attacks.\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
