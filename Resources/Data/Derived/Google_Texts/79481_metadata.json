Despite the fast approaching deadline, many local employers still have little idea about what they need to turn in to the IRS and how to collect this information.\n\nMany employers who have put off the reporting until now will likely struggle to fill it out correctly. If they report incorrect information, they could end up impacting an employee's eligibility for a subsidy.\n\nWe'll learn more about the requirement and what must employers do on Monday's Smart Talk. Our guest is Rob Glus, a consulting actuary and chair of Conrad Siegel Actuaries health and welfare committee.\n\nThis segment is part of WITF's Transforming Health project covering health news and in depth analysis of today's evolving Health Care landscape.

Malaria was eradicated in this country in the 1950s, but in Sub-Sahara Africa, 594 thousand people die from malaria every year. A group of local clergy and churches have joined in a campaign called Imagine No Malaria.\n\nWe'll discuss their efforts on Monday's Smart Talk", "article_metadata": {"date": "Nov 30, 2015", "description": "Monday's Smart Talk examines new requirements for employers as part of Obamacare and also local churches involved in fighting the spread of malaria.", "copyright": "WITF,Inc.", "url": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/2015/11/smart-talk-emplyers-scramble-to-meet-obamacare-requirement-stopping-malaria.php", "twitter": {"description": "Monday's Smart Talk examines new requirements for employers as part of Obamacare and also local churches involved in fighting the spread of malaria.", "title": "Smart Talk: Employers scramble to meet Obamacare requirement; Stopping malaria", "image": {"src": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/assets_c/2015/11/malaria%20collage%20600%20x%20340-thumb-600x340-22444.jpg"}, "creator": "@witfnews", "site": "@witfnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "a0ab0edf38b22322d1aeb144003b161c"}, "keywords": "affordable care act, conrad siegel, malaria, obamacare, robert glus", "article": {"section": "Smart Talk", "published_time": "2015-11-30T09:05:00-5:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-01T09:09:09-5:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "witf.org", "description": "Monday's Smart Talk examines new requirements for employers as part of Obamacare and also local churches involved in fighting the spread of malaria.", "title": "Smart Talk: Employers scramble to meet Obamacare requirement; Stopping malaria", "url": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/2015/11/smart-talk-emplyers-scramble-to-meet-obamacare-requirement-stopping-malaria.php", "image": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/assets_c/2015/11/malaria%20collage%20600%20x%20340-thumb-600x340-22444.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, conrad siegel, malaria, obamacare, robert glus"}, "article_summary": "This segment is part of WITF's Transforming Health project covering health news and in depth analysis of today's evolving Health Care landscape.\nWe'll learn more about the requirement and what must employers do on Monday's Smart Talk.\nSmart Talk airs live every week day at 9 a.m. on WITF\u2019s 89.5 and 93.3.\nWe'll discuss their efforts on Monday's Smart Talk\nTransforming Health is an educational partnership of WITF, Penn State Hershey Medical Center and WellSpan Health."}
