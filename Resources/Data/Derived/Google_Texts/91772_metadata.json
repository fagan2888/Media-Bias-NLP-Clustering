Jim McGovern, the second highest-ranking Democrat on the Rules Committee. He is replacing 28-year veteran Jerry Hartz, who left Pelosi's office in September for the nonprofit National Democratic Institute. It was fitting that as Stern sat with CQ Roll Call to discuss his career on Capitol Hill, in which strategizing has played a significant role, a bipartisan majority of House members were executing a rarely successful procedure, a discharge petition, to force a future vote on the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank \u2014 illustrating that with the right strategy, the patience to implement it and a strong knowledge of the rules, the minority can be effective.\n\n\u201cIf you look, many of the people in the majority were trying to oppose that and block it,\" Stern said. \"And you use the process to get it through.\"\n\nDifferent issues require different strategies, and Stern is always thinking about what tools are available. Stern twice helped his former boss, McGovern, force votes on an authorization for use of military force against the Islamic State terror group. In 2013, Stern helped McGovern craft an amendment that would have restored food stamp cuts to the farm bill.\n\nStern, who called McGovern \"one of the best rules minds and floor minds you'll find,\" said strategy depends on knowing how everything works, from procedure to the floor to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot doing that,\" Stern said. \"It\u2019s been pretty interesting.\u201d\n\nAs floor director, Stern is in charge of all of Pelosi's floor activities, which includes advising the caucus \u2014 members, leadership and staff \u2014 on legislative and procedural strategy.\n\n\u201cOne of the things about being the minority floor director is you\u2019re not just serving the Democratic leader, you\u2019re serving the Democratic caucus as a whole,\u201d Stern said. \u201cYou\u2019re making sure that everyone is well represented; that the views of the caucus are getting through, because we believe that those are the views of the voters.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1990s, Stern, a Southern California native, headed east to study political science at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania. He moved to Washington in 1996 to launch his career, starting with internships for the U.S. Agency for International Development, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif.\n\nStern waited tables at a California Pizza Kitchen in Dupont Circle while seeking a full-time job. He soon landed a legislative correspondent position with then-Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif., and then a legislative assistant position with Roybal-Allard. In 1999, he moved to McGovern\u2019s office as a legislative assistant and worked his way up, first to rules associate and then to chief of staff in 2014.\n\nStern is married with two young daughters at home. He plays basketball in his spare time \u2014 when there is spare time \u2014 and even turned in some last-second heroics in the 2010 Hoops for Hope charity game with members of Congress, knocking down a free throw to seal victory.\n\nAs a time management technique while still with McGovern, he delegated the day-to-day Rules Committee operations once he became chief of staff. It wasn\u2019t uncommon at Rules to get a call at 11 p.m. for a midnight meeting, or have a 4 p.m. meeting last until 10 p.m.\n\n\u201cThe late nights didn\u2019t bother me as much as the uncertainty,\u201d Stern said. \u201cA lot of that is based on the rhythms of the House. The House just has to move in certain ways.\u201d\n\nStern said he is excited for the new challenge, for the opportunity to work with Pelosi and to be in a leadership office. Naturally, his biggest worry is that he won't do well enough with so much at stake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just letting someone down,\u201d Stern said. \u201cIt actually matters if you screw up.\u201d\n\nAs highly as Stern speaks of McGovern's strategic acumen, he didn't hesitate to pronounce Pelosi the House\u2019s best strategist \u2014 Democrat or Republican. From engineering the campaign for House control in 2006, resulting in a four-year Democratic majority, to getting the Affordable Care Act passed, he has complete trust in her tactics.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to learn from someone like that is once in a lifetime,\u201d Stern said.\n\nRelated: Veteran Pelosi Staffer Heads to Nonprofit Hoyer Says Ex-Im Has 218 Backers Steve King Crowns 24-Year-Old Queen of the Hill See photos, follies, HOH Hits and Misses and more at Roll Call's new video site.
