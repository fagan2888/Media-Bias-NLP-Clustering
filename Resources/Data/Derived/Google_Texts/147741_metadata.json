He took a handoff up the middle, broke to the outside and raced down the sideline, breaking a couple of tackles in the process.\n\n\u201cBrian is a champ, works hard and is competitive,\u201d Wyoming coach Craig Bohl said. \u201cEverything he has done all summer, all season, been a team player and today is another example of his ability.\u201d\n\nCoffman completed 14-of-24 passes for 248 yards. His final TD pass, a 64-yarder to Jacob Hollister with 2:20 left in the game, broke a 28-28 tie.\n\nHe also had a 35-yard TD pass to James Price and a 19-yard score to Jake Maulhardt.
