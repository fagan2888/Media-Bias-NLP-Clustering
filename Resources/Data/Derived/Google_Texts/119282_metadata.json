Christopher Gadsden, using colonial rattlesnake imagery popularized by Benjamin Franklin, that accompanied the first-ever mission of the nascent U.S. Navy.\u201d\n\nNor is it, as it was in 1991, the \u201csong and album cover from Metallica.\u201d\n\nNor, as law enforcement officials said in 1999, is it the \u201cmost common symbol displayed by militia members and organizations,\u201d possibly suggesting \u201cterrorist or criminal operations.\u201d\n\nNow, according to Christine Pelosi, a Democratic strategist and the daughter of the House minority leader, it is \u201ca symbol to be re-appropriated in the service of defending the heavy-treading Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs ever, the richest symbolism is often in the eye of the beholder,\u201d Welch observed.\n\nHe provided a link to Christine Pelosi\u2019s Twitter feed, which was drawing starkly harsh condemnation of the federal move to control the health insurance market.\n\nPelosi tweeted: \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on me \u2026 or my healthcare\u201d with an image adapted from the Gadsden flag. The flag bore the words: \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on My Obamacare,\u201d with a looped image of a stethoscope in place of the snake.\n\nHowever, the responses were not sympathetic to her cause.\n\nSaid S.M.: \u201cYes this is clearly what Gadsden had in mind when \u2026 defending an overbearing mandated government program against the people.\u201d\n\nAl Masino said: \u201cTell that to the 6 million who lost insurance.\u201d\n\nTimothy O\u2019Donnell commented that \u201cyour healthcare can\u2019t be tread on if you have none after your policy was canceled due to obamacare.\u201d\n\nSaid Josh Jordan: \u201cMillions said this as Obamacare got their plans canceled.\u201d\n\nMatt Verduci asked \u201cwhat if your healthcare treads on \u2026 literally everyone else?\u201d\n\nVisit the WND SuperStore\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d department, where the message of independence and self-reliance is on caps, flags, blankets and more.\n\nDerek Hunter said: \u201cI love being told how to live by children of privilege.\u201d\n\nWelch, at Reason, had pointed out that the \u201cDon\u2019t Tread\u201d message was common at anti-Iraq War protests 10 years ago and among anti-tea party commentators five years ago, who said it was a historical indicator of \u201cwhite resentment.\u201d\n\nJust last year in New Rochelle, N.Y., he noted, the mayor and city council decided it was so \u201coffensive\u201d that it must be removed from the local armory.\n\nThe tweet from Pelosi was among the latest moves to bolster the popularity of the struggling Democrat plan called the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn a report in the Atlanta Blackstar, Nick Childs noted that today Democrats are \u201ctrying to run away from it and Republicans still blasting away at it.\u201d\n\nRepublican Party Chairman Reince Priebus wrote: \u201cFor months, the news has not been kind. A broken promise, a broken website. Lost plans, lost doctors. Rising prices, rising frustration. Shrinking paychecks, a shrinking workforce. Unsecure date, insecure Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe law was upheld at the Supreme Court, where justices had to redefine the penalty for noncompliance as a tax to make it compliant with the Constitution. But now it\u2019s back at the high court, with its abortion mandate under fire now.\n\nFormer Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., who provided the deciding vote for Obamacare even though he had objected to the plan to have taxpayers fund abortions, wants the justices now to strike it down.\n\nHe gave up his opposition, drawing scorn from pro-lifers as a traitor, when President Obama promised to issue an executive order separate from the law that would respect prohibitions on federal funding of abortion and freedom of conscience and religion.\n\nStupak recently wrote a commentary published by USA Today to support the Green and Hahn families, who are challenge the Obamacare abortifacient mandate.\n\n\u201cAs a private citizen,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m proud to stand with the Green and Hahn families and their corporations, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood, in seeking to uphold our most cherished beliefs that we, as American citizens, should not be required to relinquish our conscience and moral convictions in order to implement the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nHe said his objection is to the Obamacare mandate that forces businesses and their owners to cover \u201cmethods of contraception that may cause the abortion of new embryos: new human beings.\u201d\n\nThe Hobby Lobby and Conestoga cases are just two among nearly 90 lawsuits pending over the Obamacare abortifacient mandate.\n\nOne of the most pointed cases was brought by the Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of Catholic nuns who run homes for the elderly in Denver and other locations.\n\nThe nuns have argued their faith prohibits them \u201cfrom participating in the government\u2019s program to distribute, subsidize, and promote the use of contraceptives, sterilization, or abortion-inducing drugs and devices.\u201d\n\nThe government has persistently demanded that the Little Sisters \u201cgive up\u201d their position on abortion, a brief filed with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in their case charges.\n\n\u201cThe government has fought all the way to the Supreme Court, and continues to fight in this court, to force the Little Sisters to execute and deliver its mandatory contraceptive coverage form. \u2026 If the Little Sisters refuse, the government promises to impose severe financial penalties,\u201d the brief notes.\n\nVisit the WND SuperStore\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d department, where the message of independence and self-reliance is on caps, flags, blankets and more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "In a new question-and-answer posting at Reason.com, Editor in Chief Matt Welch has an answer for the question \u201cWhat is the Gadsden \u2018Don\u2019t Tread on Me\u2019 flag?\u201d It\u2019s not, as it was in 1775, a \u201cbanner designed by Continental Col.
