The inertial forces seem plain: children from intact households tend to prosper, or at least have a fair shot at prosperity. The support components are here. But children born into single-parent or nontraditional households more often than not are born into poverty and tend to stay there \u2013 the support components are not always there.\n\nBack in the 1960s most of the people I knew were poor, but escaped poverty. How? Through education.\n\nHistorically, education has been the gateway to better life for all Americans but especially minorities and the poor. While the culture of this generation is entirely different then it was 40 or 50 years ago, there is a need to provide all children of Caddo Parish, regardless of where they live, the opportunity to get a good education.\n\nAdditionally, the need for a good education today is ever more important then it was 40 or 50 years ago. In today\u2019s economy, education is a pre-requisite for an opportunity, let alone equal opportunity. Forty or 50 years ago there were at least some jobs in which a high school diploma was not really a necessity but now even a job at a fast-food restaurant requires some skills. For many, education is the only real pipeline to a better quality of life. Economics and the school system cannot be separated.\n\nI unequivocally support and will vote \u201cYes\u201d for the Caddo Parish School Board millage renewal on April 9. And urge all citizens that understand the importance of having a good education to vote \u201cYes\u201d also.\n\nSadly, there\u2019s an ongoing campaign by some to defeat the millage renewal. Why? Some believe education if too expensive. While others are disgruntled with the superintendent and the CPSB administration. Then I say: \"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\" And, I ask, why must students be penalized because of your disgruntlement with the CPSB administration?\n\nOf course there are challenges within the Caddo Parish school system. There are challenges in school systems throughout America, but the CPSB administration, local schools administrators and principal are working hard, students are improving, and school test scores are improving.\n\nIf we truly believe children are our most valuable resource, and it\u2019s our responsibility to prepare them for the future, then how can we even think of killing their funding? And deny them the opportunity to get a good education? This is not the time to gamble with our children\u2019s education.\n\nI don\u2019t know what world some of these nay voters are living in. Because in the real world we\u2019re losing too many of our young people to gangs, drugs and poverty. They desperately need to be in school and educated. And it\u2019s our responsibility to ensure that they receive the best education we can afford.\n\nPlease join me in voting \u201cYes\u201d on Saturday, April 9.\n\nWillie Bradford is a Shreveport City Council member.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/opinion/2016/04/01/bradford-vote-yes-school-bond-renewal/82530692/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Caddo Parish is too often several communities: rich and poor, black and white, rural and urban, one at peace with itself and one in turmoil.", "og": {"site_name": "shreveporttimes.com", "description": "Caddo Parish is too often several communities: rich and poor, black and white, rural and urban, one at peace with itself and one in turmoil.", "title": "Bradford: Vote \u2018yes\u2019 for school bond renewal", "url": "http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/opinion/2016/04/01/bradford-vote-yes-school-bond-renewal/82530692/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/shreveporttimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Caddo Parish is too often several communities: rich and poor, black and white, rural and urban, one at peace with itself and one in turmoil.", "title": "Bradford: Vote \u2018yes\u2019 for school bond renewal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d918e7817f9fecfc0b6e801a5ce35273bb21d8fb/c=0-74-458-532&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/01/LAGroup/Shreveport/635951264634689328-Untitled.png", "creator": "@shreveporttimes", "site": "@shreveporttimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898368928", "fb": {"app_id": 170028863032820}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0939\"", "article_summary": "I unequivocally support and will vote \u201cYes\u201d for the Caddo Parish School Board millage renewal on April 9.\nAnd urge all citizens that understand the importance of having a good education to vote \u201cYes\u201d also.\nAdditionally, the need for a good education today is ever more important then it was 40 or 50 years ago.\nOf course there are challenges within the Caddo Parish school system.\nAnd deny them the opportunity to get a good education?"}
