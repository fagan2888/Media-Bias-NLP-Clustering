RALEIGH. (AP) — Blue Cross and Blue Shield is likely to face big fines for technology problems that have resulted in insurance coverage and payment problems for thousands of customers, according to North Carolina’s insurance commissioner.

The fines could reach “millions of dollars” for the problems this year, Wayne Goodwin told The News & Observer of Raleigh.

The nationwide computer failure that prevented enrollments in the Affordable Care Act was fixed in two months. Blue Cross’ technology problems in North Carolina have lasted twice as long, Goodwin said.

“We’re still seeing many of the same problems,” he said of Blue Cross’s struggle to fix its broken software for insurance billing and administration. “I’m furious about it.”

In an email to the newspaper, Blue Cross spokesman Lew Borman said that most of the customer enrollment issues have been resolved. Borman also said that the number of calls to the company’s customers service department have dropped considerably since January.

“A majority of claims are being paid normally, and most of our customers are not impacted,” Borman said. “The amount of delayed claims will shrink over the next few weeks as we continue to process additional waves.”

According to Borman, only about 15 percent of Blue Cross’s 3.9 million customers have been affected by the technology problems.
