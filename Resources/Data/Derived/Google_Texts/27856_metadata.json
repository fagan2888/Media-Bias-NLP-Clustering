Because that\u2019s what you do at it all the time,\u201d said Chris \u201cAngus\u201d Sweitzer, a Kauai Community College computer literacy professor.\n\nIt was the first of a four-session continuing education class. On the syllabus: Pop up windows. Task bars. Right clicks. And spell check, which Sweitzer explained appears as a squiggly red line beneath the words you type that the computer doesn\u2019t recognize.\n\n\u201cThat would have a lot of fun with pidgin,\u201d said Ui Ito, a fruit farmer from Kilauea.\n\nOn the first day of one of the first continuing education classes ever to be taught at Kauai Community College\u2019s newest satellite location in Hanalei, Ito announced that she has never taken a formal computer class.\n\n\u201cI just need to familiarize myself with modern technology,\u201d she said, adding that proficiency in Microsoft Word will help her manage her fruit business.\n\nKCC\u2019s new Hale Halawai partnership allows North Shore residents the opportunity to learn, explore and boost their career skills without having to make the hour-long drive to the main college campus in Lihue.\n\nDuring a debut course offered last month at the new location, the classroom was full of North Shore residents, including taro farmers, fresh off the field, wearing rubber boots.\n\nThere are two opportunities for tuition assistance. Native Hawaiians who meet specific income requirements are eligible for funding through the Hoowaiwai Project. Some classes are also approved for Employment and Training Funds, which gives students a 50 percent tuition break so long as the other half of the tuition cost is paid for by the student\u2019s employer.\n\nKati Conant, who teaches a basic drawing class and is Hale Halawai\u2019s executive director, said the program is also seeking private donations to help more people afford tuition. The cost of enrollment is the biggest barrier to increasing class sizes, she said.\n\n\u201cA lot of the people who really need the classes cannot afford them,\u201d Conant said. \u201cThe goal is to try to help the local community strengthen their work skills and help them find placement.\u201d\n\nMike Ching, property manager of Ching Young Village, said he enrolled in the Microsoft Word class for personal and business reasons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from the older generation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just did basic letter writing, but now there\u2019s a lot more.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest draws of the Hanalei satellite is its location.\n\nJanet Teves of Princeville said she never would have chased an opportunity to brush up on word processing if it meant driving to KCC\u2019s main campus in Lihue.\n\nEven Sweitzer, a longtime KCC professor, enjoys the change of scenery \u2014 so much so that he took a photo on his cellphone of the green ridged mountains outside the classroom door and sent it to his mother on the Mainland. He included a note: \u201cHey, look at my classroom!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need for basic computer literacy here like, \u2018What\u2019s this mouse thing?\u2019\u201d Sweitzer said. \u201cWe now have a classroom to meet that need with green around us instead of classroom buildings around us. We now have the beautiful, fresh Hanalei air instead of air conditioning.\u201d\n\nAfter demonstrating so many Microsoft Word functions, hacks and tricks, Sweitzer decided he better show the class that the world isn\u2019t over if you make a mistake. Like mistakenly deleting the best line of prose you\u2019ve ever written.\n\nNo need to break into a cold sweat. You can get it back, he assured the class.\n\nStanding before an overhead projector illuminating an oversized, blank Word document, Sweitzer pointed to the undo and redo icons.\n\n\u201cThis is your best friend,\u201d he told the class of three. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful way to save your sanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo much to play with,\u201d Ito called out. \u201cIt\u2019s scary. I never knew there was all this stuff. Yikes.\u201d\n\nIto tinkered with the function, making the subject of the sentence she had typed out on the computer screen disappear and then reappear again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re learning enough to be dangerous,\u201d Sweitzer told her. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Garden Island, http://thegardenisland.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barefoot, in a building just yards from a shock green taro field and waterfall-drenched mountain peaks, three adult students huddled behind computer screens.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Barefoot, in a building just yards from a shock green taro field and waterfall-drenched mountain peaks, three adult students huddled behind computer screens.", "title": "Not your typical classroom", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/6/not-your-typical-classroom/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/04/2f872416e9621827810f6a706700202d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/04/2f872416e9621827810f6a706700202d.jpg", "description": "Barefoot, in a building just yards from a shock green taro field and waterfall-drenched mountain peaks, three adult students huddled behind computer screens.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Not your typical classroom"}, "Author": "BRITTANY LYTE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4b3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe now have a classroom to meet that need with green around us instead of classroom buildings around us.\n\u201cI just need to familiarize myself with modern technology,\u201d she said, adding that proficiency in Microsoft Word will help her manage her fruit business.\nBecause that\u2019s what you do at it all the time,\u201d said Chris \u201cAngus\u201d Sweitzer, a Kauai Community College computer literacy professor.\nDuring a debut course offered last month at the new location, the classroom was full of North Shore residents, including taro farmers, fresh off the field, wearing rubber boots.\nStanding before an overhead projector illuminating an oversized, blank Word document, Sweitzer pointed to the undo and redo icons."}
