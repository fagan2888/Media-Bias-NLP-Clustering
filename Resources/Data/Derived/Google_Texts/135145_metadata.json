The debate was quick but heated. Democratic Senator Gene Davis said the legislation ignored thousands of Utahns in the coverage gap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a no on this because this is fiscal insanity. This is just trying to have control over people who need help, but leaving a whole lot of people without the coverage or benefits that they could have,\u201d said Davis.\n\nThe legislation, now approved by both the House and the Senate, represents what could be the end of fight over Medicaid expansion that has lasted several years. Last year, Republicans in the House voted down Governor Gary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah plan that would have covered a large portion of Utahns that didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid, but couldn\u2019t afford health insurance. Republican Senator Todd Weiler supported the Healthy Utah plan in last year\u2019s session and supported this measure even though he believes it\u2019s incomplete.\n\n\u201cThis is probably not my first or second or third choice of how to do this, but I think it would be irresponsible to leave those people out in the cold for another year while we fight about this, so I vote aye,\u201d said Weiler.\n\nSenator Gene Davis is sponsoring a bill that would fully expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But the session will likely end on Thursday before lawmakers can vote on that legislation. Meanwhile, Dunnigan\u2019s HB 437 now needs only the Governor\u2019s signature to become law.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "The Utah Senate voted Tuesday to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid program, but only to cover a small population living in extreme poverty.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kuer.org/post/utah-senate-approves-limited-medicaid-expansion-sends-legislation-governor-herbert", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuer/files/styles/medium/public/201603/UT_Senate-02.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "The Utah Senate voted Tuesday to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid program, but only to cover a small population living in extreme poverty.", "title": "Utah Senate Approves Limited Medicaid Expansion, Sends Legislation to Governor Herbert"}, "story_id": 469739369, "twitter": {"site": "@KUERNews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@tergildea"}, "author": "Terry Gildea", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Utah Senate Approves Limited Medicaid Expansion, Sends Legislation to Governor Herbert"}, "nid": 74950, "datePublished": "2016-03-08", "keywords": "Medicaid, HB 437", "wordCount": 341, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The Utah Senate voted Tuesday to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid program, but only to cover a small population living in extreme poverty.\nRepublican Senator Todd Weiler supported the Healthy Utah plan in last year\u2019s session and supported this measure even though he believes it\u2019s incomplete.\nThe legislation, now approved by both the House and the Senate, represents what could be the end of fight over Medicaid expansion that has lasted several years.\nBut the session will likely end on Thursday before lawmakers can vote on that legislation.\nLast year, Republicans in the House voted down Governor Gary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah plan that would have covered a large portion of Utahns that didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid, but couldn\u2019t afford health insurance."}
