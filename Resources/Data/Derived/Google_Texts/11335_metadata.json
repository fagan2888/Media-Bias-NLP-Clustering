While they would have qualified for an expanded Medicaid program, Texas officials have refused to participate in that effort.\n\nParkland estimated that 180,000 of its low-income patients would qualify for Medicaid if the Texas program were allowed to grow. An additional 50,000 patients will qualify for private insurance coverage, many using tax credits to cover a portion of their monthly premium costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great day,\u201d said Sharon Phillips, Parkland\u2019s interim chief operating officer for ambulatory and behavioral health.\n\nCounty Judge Clay Jenkins also called the start of the six-month-long enrollment effort an \u201chistoric day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is about real people getting real help for real problems,\u201d he said during the hour-long informational session at the hospital.\n\nPhillips said Parkland has set up a phone bank and computer terminals to assist patients who want to explore their insurance options. The county hospital has trained more than 40 application counselors to answer questions about the new law.\n\n\u201cWe will guide them and help them select the plan and program that is right for them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives me goose bumps.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEzLzEwL3BhcmtsYW5kLWhvc3BpdGFsLW9mZmljaWFscy1sYXVkLXRoZS1vYmFtYWNhcmUta2lja29mZi1ieS1oZWxwaW5nLXBhdGllbnRzLWdldC1pbnN1cmFuY2UuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Sherry Jacobson", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Parkland Memorial Hospital, the main medical provider for uninsured Dallas County residents, kicked off private insurance enrollment for its patients Tuesday under the federal Affordable Care Act.
