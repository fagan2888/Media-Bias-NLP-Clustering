Those include medication reminders and alerts set to be triggered if the home health monitoring kit detects a patient's deteriorating health.\n\nBased on the pilot's success in metrics and cost savings, NAH officials said they are planning to expand the program to patients with other cardiac problems as well as people with pulmonary issues and those needing post-operative care.\n\nThis article originally appeared on mHealth News.
