Incumbent Sam Caruso was pushed into a runoff with challenger Pete O'Connell Saturday in the District E race for the Slidell City Council. Keith Sehon finished third.



Caruso, a longtime mayor and council member, campaigned on his experience. O'Connell and Sehon campaigned on the need to bring new leadership onto the council.



The runoff is May 3. Other issues included the need to attract new business to the city, keeping watch over the tight budget and making it easier for businesses to get permits from the city.
