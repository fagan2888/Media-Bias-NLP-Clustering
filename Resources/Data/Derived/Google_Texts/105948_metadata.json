Ben persuades his nephew Elliot (Darren Burrows, so laconically wise as Ed in Northern Exposure) to let him crash at the Brooklyn home he shares with his writer wife, Kate (three-time Oscar nominee Marisa Tomei). There Ben is relegated to sleeping in the bunk bed below their son, Joey (Charlie Tahan, recently in Blue Jasmine). These make-do measures spark tensions within both sets of guests and hosts, while George and Ben struggle with the sadness of their separation.\n\nSachs, who wrote the script for Love Is Strange with Mauricio Zacharias (also his collaborator on 2012's Keep the Lights On), admirably avoids preaching to the audience or striking an overtly political stance. Instead he keeps the focus on the characters and their relationships. Scenes unfold organically, sometimes jumping subtly forward in time, the cityscapes made even more beautiful by the Chopin \u00e9tudes playing beneath them.\n\nI have to say that Sachs' casting choices are brilliant here: Lithgow and Molina, social acquaintances for years in real life, display a tender \u2014 and utterly believable \u2014 intimacy on screen. Tomei is equally convincing as a working mother dealing with an inattentive husband and an often surly teen (that would be Tahan, who portrays the agony and ecstasy of adolescence to perfection).\n\nThough Love Is Strange overflows with modern-day hot buttons \u2014 marriage equality, orientation prejudice, income disparity \u2014 those issues are never allowed to crowd out the movingly genuine people at the heart of this timeless love story. Sachs has given us a delightful film that exquisitely demonstrates how, despite our differences, we are inexorably drawn to one another.\n\nMeg Grant is West Coast editor of AARP The Magazine.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "'Love Is Strange' Strikes a Familiar Chord", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2015-03-24T16:12:34.577-04:00", "keywords": "love is strange, John Lithgow, Alfred Molina, Marisa Tomei, couples, same sex marriage, love, relationships, reality, marriage equality", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "true", "author": "Meg Grant", "comments": "on", "source": "aarp_org", "type": "info", "description": "\"Love Is Strange\" takes on same-sex marriage equality, relationships and reality with stars John Lithgow and Alfred Molina.", "IALevel3": "info-2014", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "DCSubjects:Entertainment/Movies for Grownups", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "Subject3": "DCSubjects:Home and Garden/Sex & Intimacy/Marriage & Partnerships", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "\"Love Is Strange\" takes on same-sex marriage equality, relationships and reality with stars John Lithgow and Alfred Molina.", "title": "Love Is Strange Stars John Lithgow and Alfred Molina Tackle Same-Sex M... - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-2014/love-is-strange-movie-review.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/2014-08/200-alfred-molina-john-lithgow-love-strange.imgcache.rev1408113822463.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarpe/en/home/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-2014/love-is-strange-movie-review", "Subject2": "DCSubjects:Home and Garden/Sex & Intimacy/Gay & Lesbian", "aarpeContent": "true", "IALevel1": "entertainment", "IALevel2": "movies-for-grownups", "s43": "31.Entertainment|MyPersonalTime", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-25"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0aff\"", "article_summary": "There Ben is relegated to sleeping in the bunk bed below their son, Joey (Charlie Tahan, recently in Blue Jasmine).\nThese make-do measures spark tensions within both sets of guests and hosts, while George and Ben struggle with the sadness of their separation.\nSachs has given us a delightful film that exquisitely demonstrates how, despite our differences, we are inexorably drawn to one another.\nThough Love Is Strange overflows with modern-day hot buttons \u2014 marriage equality, orientation prejudice, income disparity \u2014 those issues are never allowed to crowd out the movingly genuine people at the heart of this timeless love story.\nSachs, who wrote the script for Love Is Strange with Mauricio Zacharias (also his collaborator on 2012's Keep the Lights On), admirably avoids preaching to the audience or striking an overtly political stance."}
