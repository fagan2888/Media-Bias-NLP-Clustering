However, they have extended that deadline to Dec. 17 at 11:59 p.m. pacific standard time, which is 2:59 a.m. eastern standard time.\n\nHealthCare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan said in a statement that the extension was due to an unprecedented demand.\n\n\"Because of the unprecedented demand and volume of consumers contacting our call center or visiting HealthCare.gov, we are extending the deadline to sign-up for January 1 coverage until 11:59pm PST December 17,\" Counihan said.\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands have already selected plans over the last two days and approximately 1 million consumers have left their contact information to hold their place in line. Our goal is to provide access to affordable coverage, and the additional 48 hours will give consumers an opportunity to come back and complete their enrollment for January 1 coverage.\"\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan has deployed extra resources to help people still trying to enroll for coverage that will start Jan. 1. Their health care advisors are available at (888) 899-2968 and also has guidance online.\n\nFor people who don't need coverage to start Jan. 1, the open enrollment period goes through Jan. 31, 2016.\n\nEmily Lawler is a Capitol/Business reporter for MLive.
