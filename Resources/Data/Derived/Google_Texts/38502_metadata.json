Anthony List group had standing to challenge the state laws.\n\nThe group wanted to publicize the support for Obamacare by then-Rep. Steve Driehaus, a Democrat. SBA List said it was alarmed by the abortion funding in Obamacare, and Driehaus also said he opposed abortion funding but voted for the bill anyway. SBA List wanted to point that out.\n\nDriehaus contended there was no abortion funding in the law.\n\nBest-selling author Mark Levin talks about his blueprint to fix America\u2019s broken government, in \u201cThe Liberty Amendments.\u201d\n\nSBA List was prevented from countering Driehaus\u2019 view by the threat of prosecution under Ohio\u2019s false-statement law.\n\nDriehaus lost his re-election bid anyway and later sued SBA List for defamation and loss of livelihood. But the case apparently was resolved when the 6th Circuit said his defamation complaint failed because the claim wasn\u2019t false.\n\nThat ruling said: \u201cGiven the debate prior to passage of the PPACA as to whether it includes taxpayer funding for abortion, the gist or sting of the statements appears to have at least some truth, to be substantially true, or to be subject to differing interpretations. Driehaus vocally opposed the PPACA because of his concerns about federal funding for abortions but he then voted for it anyway despite the absence of his desired language (the Stupak-Pitts Amendment) in the final version. The executive order adds language, but is not part of the PPACA and does not alter the statutory text. In fact, debate continues over the meaning and effect of the PPACA \u2026 For SBA List to overcome Driehaus\u2019s defamation claim, it is enough that the statements had some truth, were substantially true, or were subject to differing interpretations. Driehaus\u2019s own change of position demonstrates that they were.\u201d\n\nSince then, it\u2019s become clear that Obamacare funds abortion. In fact, the government is in court fighting for its authority to force even Catholic nuns to fund abortion pills.\n\nCasey Mattox, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, said the First Amendment \u201cforbids government from acting as a \u2018truth commission\u2019 on matters of public debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 6th Circuit understood that this type of government intrusion has no place under the Constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cThe court was right to affirm, as the district court did, the freedom of Susan B. Anthony List and all the people of Ohio to speak in accordance with their views.\u201d\n\nIt was after the Supreme Court ruled SBA List had standing that a district court judge in 2014 ruled the Ohio statute unconstitutional. But the state claimed the right to censor ads and appealed.\n\nWND reported the lower court\u2019s decision. Ohio District Judge Timothy Black found that Ohio could not issue judgments on what is true or false in political campaigns.\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom and Life Legal Defense Foundation have said: \u201cFive years into Obamacare, it is now evident that SBA List\u2019s warnings were true. This law is forcing Americans to pay for abortions in numerous ways, and SBA List had a right to say so.\u201d\n\nThe appeals court on Wednesday noted that the regulation impacted all false speech regarding a political candidate, even if it is not material, negative or damaging.\n\nWND reported when the fight for free speech drew in the left-leaning American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, even though the issue was speech against abortion.\n\nThe ACLU said then: \u201cOhio\u2019s political false-statement statute \u2026 presents a clear facial violation of the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects free political expression foremost among all areas of speech. American self-governance requires that the public be well-informed not only in facts, but in the broad range of political opinions present in the marketplace of ideas. Restrictions on political speech must therefore be regarded with particular suspicion.\u201d\n\nBest-selling author Mark Levin talks about his blueprint to fix America\u2019s broken government, in \u201cThe Liberty Amendments.\u201d\n\nThe appeals court explained how Ohio\u2019s provision threatened political activists with up to six months in prison or a fine of up to $5,000 for violating the \u201ctruth law.\u201d\n\nThe panel noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected the \u201ccategorical rule \u2026 that false statements receive no First Amendment protection.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitical speech is at the core of First Amendment protections,\u201d the court said. \u201cThough combining protected speech with unprotected speech does not afford the speaker absolute immunity for lies \u2026 \u2018the power to proscribe [speech] on the basis of one content element \u2026 does not entail the power to proscribe it on the basis of other content elements. \u2026 Even false speech receives some constitutional protection.\u201d\n\nThe opinion noted the state\u2019s interest in fair elections.\n\n\u201cBut Ohio\u2019s laws do not meet the second requirement: being narrowly tailored to protect the integrity of Ohio\u2019s elections. \u2026 Ohio\u2019s laws do not pass constitutional muster because they are not narrowly tailored in their (1) timing, (2) lack of a screening processes for frivolous complaints, (3) application to non-material statements, (4) application to commercial intermediaries, and (5) over-inclusiveness and under-inclusiveness.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "A pro-life organization that has been fighting an Ohio state election regulation that barred it from publicizing a politician\u2019s support for Obamacare and its abortion advocacy has won at the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
