Jay Inslee today announced the first appointees to the new Office of Youth Prevention and Protection Programs Advisory Committee, the latest in a series of actions the governor has taken to address homelessness in Washington in the past three years.\n\nThe committee was established as a result of Inslee\u2019s Homeless Youth Prevention and Protection Act last year to enhance statewide coordination and efforts to reduce and prevent youth homelessness.\n\nFirst Lady Trudi Inslee was a leading advocate for the bipartisan bill. Sponsored by Senator Steve O\u2019Ban and Representative Ruth Kagi, the Act puts a dedicated focus on homelessness among young adults.\n\nCommittee members will provide guidance and recommendations to the newly established Office of Homeless Youth Prevention and Protection Programs on funding, policy, and practice gaps in the state\u2019s systems that serve homeless youth.\n\n\u201cYouth homelessness is a complex issue that touches many systems in every community in Washington,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cThese appointees bring the breadth of perspective and expertise we need to tackle the growing crisis of youth homelessness in Washington state so that every young adult receives the support they need to thrive.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone deserves to have a place to call home,\u201d said First Lady Trudi Inslee. \u201cIn the past several years I\u2019ve visited many organizations helping those who are homeless and have met many families and children who are battling homelessness. Service providers are stretched for resources and I\u2019m glad of the significant investments we\u2019ve made in Washington. We can continue to work together to alleviate this crisis in Washington.\u201d\n\nHomelessness has become one of the top issues for this session. Senate Democrats today announced a Bring Washington Home Act that would provide even further funding for shelter and support services.\n\n\u201cHomelessness has been one of the most challenging chronic issues of our time and I appreciate that legislators and local leaders want to continue our good work on this,\u201d Inslee said.\n\nAppointments to the Office of Youth Prevention and Protection Programs Advisory Committee include:\n\nBridget Cannon, a parent advocate with Volunteers of America;\n\nDetective Kim Bogucki of the Seattle Police Department;\n\nMelinda Giovengo, Director of Youth Care;\n\nSierra Phillips, youth advocate with The Mockingbird Society;\n\nKris Hermanns, Director of the Pride Foundation;\n\nCasey Trupin, with the Raikes Foundation; and\n\nKatara Jordan from Columbia Legal Services.\n\nFour additional members will be appointed to the committee by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate.\n\nIn addition to the creation of the Office of Homeless Youth Prevention, Inslee has helped to restore and expand resources and programs for homelessness and affordable housing. In the past three years, the state has provided $240 million in investments in statewide homelessness prevention and housing.\n\nExamples include:\n\n$125 million for the state Housing Trust Fund which helps leverage private and federal funding to build and improve affordable housing\n\n$58 million for Housing and Essential Needs which provides rent assistance to low-income residents\n\n$35 million for local governments to support emergency shelters, short-term rent assistance and transitional housing\n\nInslee said the focus on homelessness reinforces the importance of collaboration between state and local leaders and organizations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made good progress over the past three years and there is so much more we can accomplish if we work together.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "OLYMPIA \u2013 Gov.
