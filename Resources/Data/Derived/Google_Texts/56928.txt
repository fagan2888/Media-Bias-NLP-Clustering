KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia — The U.S. women kept a lid on their biggest tricks to ease into finals for the Olympic debut of ski halfpipe late Thursday.

In front of a capacity crowd at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, all four of the U.S. women made the final, where 12 skiers from seven countries will introduce their sport to the world. They tempered the trickery, opting for solid, albeit mellow, runs that pushed them into finals.

“Qualifying I just wanted to put down a clean run and then finals let it rip,” said California’s Maddie Bowman, the gold medal favorite with a pair of back-to-back 900s that has dominated women’s halfpipe for the last season.

The slushy conditions in the pipe is working for South Lake Tahoe’s Bowman.

“A little piece of home, halfway across the world,” said Bowman, who qualified third.

Brita Sigourney qualified second behind France’s powerful Marie Martinod. Angeli Vanlaanen qualified fifth and Annalise Drew enters finals from the 11th qualifying position.
