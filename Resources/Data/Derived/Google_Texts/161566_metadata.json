The plan also proposes provisions to help prevent fraud in safety-net programs: It requires Medicaid recipients to work and converts the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program into a a State Flexibility Fund, giving more power back to the states to tailor the program to their individual needs.\n\nA loophole allowing people to collect both unemployment insurance and disability insurance would also be closed.\n\n\u201cWe achieve $7 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade \u2013 through a combination of $6.5 trillion in savings coupled with economic growth \u2013 bringing an end to annual deficits so we actually begin to pay down the debt and avoid a completely predictable and preventable fiscal crisis looming over the horizon,\u201d the proposal reads.\n\nUnder the proposal defense spending would be increased to a base of $574 billion with an additional $74 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funding.\n\n\u201cThe Fiscal Year 2017 House Republican budget, A Balanced Budget for a Stronger America, provides a vision and specific solutions for how we can, as a nation, get our fiscal house in order, strengthen our national security, provide support for those who need assistance, and empower our citizens and our communities,\u201d Price said in a statement. \u201cIt is a plan to balance the budget through commonsense reforms and greater economic growth; to create a healthier economy, more secure nation, and a more accountable Washington.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has called on members of the conference to support a budget that falls in line with the legislation passed last year, making the case that conservatives shouldn\u2019t give up the chance to pass appropriations bills, a balanced budget, entitlement reform and reconciliation for just a $40 million increase after defense spending is taken into account.\n\nConservatives in the House Freedom Caucus rejected the blueprint, saying they can\u2019t get behind the $1.07 trillion discretionary spending level and spending hikes.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning of the budget process, the House Freedom Caucus has called for a Republican budget that shows the American people we are serious about addressing Washington\u2019s out-of-control spending problem. Our Members have put forward multiple proposals that would rein in spending through real budget reforms,\u201d the HFC said in a statement released to The Daily Caller News Foundation Monday evening. \u201cHouse leadership has continually asked the Republican conference to support President Obama\u2019s budget levels, even though the national debt passed the $19 trillion mark in January, and the Congressional Budget Office has reported that the federal deficit increased by $105 billion this year.\u201d\n\nThe House Budget Committee is slated to hold a markup on the budget Wednesday.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
