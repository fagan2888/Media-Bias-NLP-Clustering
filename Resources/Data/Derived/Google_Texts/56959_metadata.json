When thinking about delaying Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, that image is worth keeping in mind.\n\nFor it\u2019s not just that delaying the individual mandate is popular (a recent Rasmussen poll finds that Americans favor such a delay by a 30-point margin), an easy sell (President Obama lawlessly delayed the employer mandate, so why not lawfully delay the individual one?), a quick way to cut the deficit by more than $20 billion in 2014 alone (according to the Congressional Budget Office), and a \u201cvery reasonable and sensible\u201d thing to do (to quote Democratic senator Joe Manchin, one of 23 Democratic members of Congress who\u2019ve already publicly expressed support for the delay). Indeed, it\u2019s all of those things. But, in two key veins\u2014one psychological, the other functional\u2014it\u2019s also a way to pave the path to full repeal.\n\nPsychologically (as well as rhetorically), the individual mandate is very important to the left. Obamacare is all about coercion\u2014about forcing people to do things they don\u2019t freely choose to do\u2014and the individual mandate serves as its coercive core. It\u2019s what allows Obama to grasp onto the thinnest reed of legitimacy when describing Obamacare as offering \u201cuniversal coverage,\u201d despite the CBO\u2019s estimate that, even after ten years and $1.8 trillion, Obamacare would cover less than 45 percent of the uninsured (at the whopping 10-year cost of $72,000 per newly insured person). That\u2019s a far cry from \u201cuniversal coverage.\u201d But one can think of it\u2014and describe it\u2014as \u201cuniversal,\u201d so long as one is forcing every American, as a matter of federal law, to do the government\u2019s bidding. Without the individual mandate, Obamacare would cease to be \u201cuniversal coverage,\u201d even in the sense of being universally coercive, and would simply become \u201c45 percent coverage.\u201d That would be demoralizing to the left.\n\nIn reality, however, even hitting that 45-percent mark would likely prove impossible, for that\u2019s the figure the CBO gives when assuming the mandate will be in effect. As things now stand, if a young person, say a 30-year-old single man, making, let\u2019s say, $40,000 dollars a year, decides not to buy government-mandated health insurance, he\u2019ll be fined $400 next year, and $800 the year after, and $1,000 in 2016\u2014not a fortune, but not exactly chump change, either.\n\nIf the mandate were delayed for a year, however, the same 30-year-old man wouldn\u2019t be fined anything in 2014 (and would subsequently be fined only $400, rather than $800, in 2015, etc.), meaning that the only motivation he\u2019d have to buy government-approved insurance next year would be if he were actually attracted to the product or to the taxpayer-funded incentives to buy it. Well, according to a recent report from the National Center for Public Policy Research, the young man in question almost surely wouldn\u2019t get a dime\u2019s worth of Obamacare subsidies, even though a 60-year-old with the same income would get a huge subsidy, at taxpayer expense. So the 30-year-old could either buy government-approved insurance at artificially inflated prices (courtesy of Obamacare), without a subsidy, or he could simply forgo that overpriced insurance, knowing that, if he ever gets sick or injured, Obamacare will let him sign up later\u2014since it\u2019s only \u201cfair,\u201d as Obama continually tells us, to mandate that those with preexisting conditions be able to sign up for \u201cinsurance\u201d after the fact.\n\nThe CBO estimates that, in 2014, the combination of Obamacare\u2019s taxpayer-subsidized exchanges (7 million additional insured) and changes in sales through the non-group market (2 million fewer insured) would result in 5 million additional people buying insurance. But the CBO has also estimated that, without the individual mandate, about 40 percent of those people (2 million of 5 million) would take a pass. In other words, an estimated 40 percent of the newly sold insurance would be attributable to federal coercion.\n\nIndeed, the Obama administration has consistently argued that, without the individual mandate, Obamacare\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive\u201d architecture would collapse. Obama loves the \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d and \u201ccommunity ratings\u201d parts of Obamacare, which together force insurers to cover all comers at essentially the same price (subject only to limited variations), regardless of their health status and hence how much it will actually cost to cover them. Yet he nevertheless had his administration argue before the Supreme Court that, should the Court strike down the individual mandate as unconstitutional (as four justices thought the Constitution required), it should also strike down these other two provisions. If the administration had really thought Obamacare would work without the individual mandate, it wouldn\u2019t have been willing to sacrifice these other two provisions that Obama holds dear.\n\nIn truth, the administration is deeply concerned about getting people to buy insurance through Obamacare\u2019s government marketplaces even with the mandate in effect. At an Obamacare event a few days ago, both Obama and Bill Clinton kept pleading with people to sign up to buy their mandatory insurance. Clinton said that Obamacare \u201conly works, for example, if young people show up.\u201d Obama said that we need to have \u201cthose of us who are healthy subsidize somebody who is sick.\u201d (Quite a sales pitch, eh? You can see why they need the mandate.) Clinton\u2019s very last words at the event were, \u201c[W]e\u2019ve got to get everybody to sign up.\u201d Aside from \u201cThank you very much,\u201d Obama\u2019s were, \u201cEverybody, sign up. Go to healthcare.gov.\u201d\n\nBut all the presidential pleading isn\u2019t likely to do much good without the mandate. Here\u2019s what Stephanie Cutter wrote on the White House blog about a year after the Democrats passed Obamacare into law:\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act\u2026bans insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions. However, unless every American is required to have insurance, it would be cost prohibitive to cover people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s why: If insurance companies can no longer deny coverage to anyone who applies for insurance \u2013 especially those who have health problems and are potentially more expensive to cover \u2013 then there is nothing stopping someone from waiting until they\u2019re sick or injured to apply for coverage since insurance companies can\u2019t say no. That would lead to double digit premiums increases \u2013 up to 20% \u2013 for everyone with insurance, and would significantly increase the cost [of] health care spending nationwide. We don\u2019t let people wait until after they\u2019ve been in a car accident to apply for auto insurance and get reimbursed, and we don\u2019t want to do that with healthcare. If we\u2019re going to outlaw discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, the only way to keep people from gaming the system and raising costs on everyone else is to ensure that everyone takes responsibility for their own health insurance.\u201d\n\nSo, in Cutter\u2019s own words, without the individual mandate, Obamacare would be \u201ccost prohibitive,\u201d \u201cwould lead to double digit premiums increases,\u201d and \u201cwould significantly increase the cost [of] health care spending nationwide.\u201d In fact, \u201cthe only way\u201d to make it all work is to enforce the individual mandate. That is to say, without its requirement that private American citizens, for the first time in United States history, must buy a product or service of the federal government\u2019s choosing, Obamacare would be much more of a disaster than it\u2019s already poised to be.\n\nAs Republicans debate the best strategy going forward, it\u2019s worth considering that, defunding Obamacare\u2014were it remotely possible\u2014would simply put the Death Star out of commission for a year. Delaying the individual mandate\u2014 which is quite achievable\u2014could well make it implode.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health Care,Jeffrey H.
