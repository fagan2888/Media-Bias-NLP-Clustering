He explained his choice the following day:\n\nI\u2019ve decided to stop using the Washington team nickname. It\u2019s a name you won\u2019t see me use anymore. The simple reason is that for the last two or three years, I\u2019ve been uneasy when I sat down to write about the team and had to use the nickname. In some stories I\u2019ve tried to use it sparingly. But this year, I decided to stop entirely because it offends too many people, and I don\u2019t want to add to the offensiveness. Some people, and some Native American organizations\u2014such as the highly respected American Indian Movement\u2014think the nickname is a slur. Obviously, the team feels it isn\u2019t a slur, and there are several prominent Native American leaders who agree.
