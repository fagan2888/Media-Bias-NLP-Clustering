That\u2019s the tongue-in-cheek question Playboy\u2019s Joe Donatelli intended to answer when he set out for FreedomFest in Las Vegas last week:\n\nThis is what the vortex of evil looks like. A well-dressed man onstage in a ballroom at Planet Hollywood is talking about investment in rare metals. Knut Andersen of Swiss Metals has come to the annual FreedomFest conference in Sin City to share investment opportunities with libertarians and other freedom-loving nuts. Nuts? Oh, yeah. If there\u2019s one thing the political left and right in America agree on \u2013 strongly \u2013 it\u2019s these libertarians. They\u2019re the absolute worst. Salon has called libertarians a \u201ccult\u201d and a \u201cfreakshow\u201d and \u201ccrazy\u201d and a \u201ccon\u201d and a \u201cscam\u201d for \u201cpetulant children,\u201d and those are just some of the headlines it has used since 2014. New Jersey\u2019s Republican Gov. Chris Christie says libertarians are \u201cdangerous.\u201d How dangerous? Human YouTube comment Ann Coulter says libertarian voters are \u201cidiots\u201d who should \u201cdrown.\u201d Slagging libertarians is so commonplace online that Washington Post criminal justice blogger Radley Balko keeps a running list of all of Salon and Alternet\u2019s libertarian headlines going back two years. It stands at 140 and counting.\n\nDonatelli\u2019s full article\u2014which pokes fun at the crazies while giving the non-crazies their day in court\u2014is well worth a read. He concludes with some context from Cato Institute Vice President David Boaz:\n\nCato\u2019s Boaz says the big libertarian tent synchs with the belief that peaceful people should be able to do whatever they want to do. There are a lot of people who want to do a lot of things, and the people who really, really want to do a lot of things with no one to bother them\u2014they\u2019re different than you and me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to drink raw milk, but some people do. I don\u2019t want to smoke marijuana, but some people do,\u201d Boaz said. \u201cIt\u2019s also true that a lot of Republicans still want to fly the Confederate flag, and only a few years ago it was the Democratic Party that put the Confederate flag on top of the South Carolina statehouse. Bernie Sanders looks at a world full of Venezuela and Greece and says, \u2018Let\u2019s be more like those countries.\u2019 Who are the crazies?\u201d\n\nFor more dispatches from FreedomFest, read Matt Welch\u2019s brilliant takedown of conference speaker and implausible Republican candidate Donald Trump here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "'This is what the vortex of evil looks like.'", "title": "Libertarians: They\u2019re Just Like Us?
