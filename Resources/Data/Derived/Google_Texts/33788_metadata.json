He\u2019s an orthodox Hasidic Jew. She\u2019s an atheist vegan. He teaches religion. She\u2019s an actor.\n\nBut in at least one essential way, they could not be more alike. They are two of only four living Coloradans who have donated one of their kidneys to a stranger this year.\n\nSo they have saving lives in common. They just wish that weren\u2019t so uncommon.\n\nLeventhal, 28, visited Rollman, 38, at Porter Adventist Hospital on Aug. 23, just after Rollman said, \u201cGoodbye and good luck, little lefty\u201d to her kidney, which was flown to Virginia and transplanted into a critical young patient she may never meet.\n\nHis message to Rollman: \u201cI am happy for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI meant that you will be better for having done this,\u201d said Leventhal, who fully expects Rollman to feel the same euphoria that has enveloped him since March, when he gave his kidney to a father of five in Brooklyn.\n\nAnd because Rollman signed up for a groundbreaking paired program called the National Kidney Registry, her sacrifice set off a chain reaction of transplantations that saved three lives in three states in back-to-back-to-back operations. \u201cAnd I am certain the chain will continue past those three,\u201d said Jessica Johnson, Porter\u2019s transplant coordinator. That\u2019s because the chain Rollman triggered is only in its initial phase.\n\nThe gift\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: Most kidney-failure patients have a willing, living donor.\n\nBefore, if they don\u2019t match, that\u2019s the end of it \u2014 and often, the patient\u2019s life. Now, should the NKR database identify a compatible kidney for a dying patient, that person\u2019s healthy donation partner agrees to give up a kidney that then goes to another stranger, perpetuating what Leventhal calls \u201ca beautiful chain that keeps on giving life.\u201d\n\nBut it takes what the NKR calls a \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d donor \u2014 someone who offers up a kidney without stipulation \u2014 to set a new chain in motion. Rollman\u2019s 4.72-inch miracle bean went to a patient in Virginia whose healthy partner\u2019s kidney then went to Ohio. Soon another kidney there was on its way to Wisconsin.\n\nOne expected recipient became too sick for transplant, which left the chain at three links so far. A chain typically averages six transplants, the NKR says, but a single altruistic donor once touched off a wave of more than 40 kidney donations. A chain usually ends when a child\u2019s life is at stake. In those cases, a kidney is given regardless of whether the child has a healthy donor partner.\n\nThese chains are revolutionizing the transplant industry by drastically reducing the number of Americans awaiting kidneys, the critical organs that cleanse the blood of waste. Currently, that number is at just under 100,000. Last year, 6,000 died waiting. In Colorado, while more than 1,660 people await a kidney, someone dies every four days. Paired donation is dropping the wait time for recipients by an average of 78 percent, the NKR says, from 51 months to just 11.\n\nColorado is considered a generous organ-donor state. Last year, 67 percent of residents who applied for their driver\u2019s license or state ID cards checked the box for organ, eye and tissue donors in the event of death, second only to Alaska.\n\nThe nationwide average, according to The Donor Alliance, is only 42 percent.\n\nBut the very concept of living donation \u2014 involving a kidney or liver \u2014 is still foreign to most anyone not facing the imminent death of a loved one. It was to Rollman.\n\n\u201cI am crazy relaxed about this,\u201d Rollman said in an interview one month before her operation. In the subsequent weeks, she said, \u201cI never had a single doubt in my mind.\u201d\n\nThe surgery\n\nRollman wasn\u2019t worried, she said, because she did her research. With the help of the Denver-based American Transplant Foundation, she learned that, statistically, kidney donation is less dangerous than childbirth. That less than 1 percent of living kidney donors ever experience complications. That donation does not reduce life span.\n\nThat the surgery is minimally invasive. And, perhaps most important to Rollman: That while the five-year survival rate for kidney patients on dialysis is just 35 percent, it is 81 percent for patients who receive a kidney from a living donor.\n\nRollman would like to live in a world where giving up an organ to a stranger is not considered unusual or heroic. So when Porter spokesman Tim Shonsey calls her good deed \u201cthe ultimate exercise in good faith and goodwill,\u201d she doesn\u2019t know what to do with the compliment.\n\n\u201cWhen someone tells me, \u2018You make the world a better place,\u2019 I just say, \u2018Well \u2026 so do you \u2026 because they generally do,\u201d Rollman said. \u201cThere are a million ways to do good things in the world, and this is just one of them.\u201d\n\nLeventhal calls Rollman \u201can ordinary person doing something extraordinary \u2014 that other ordinary people could do as well.\u201d\n\nRollman didn\u2019t know living donation \u201cwas even a thing\u201d until she found out her friend Mara Wiles was on dialysis. Dialysis isn\u2019t a cure, Wiles said. \u201cIt delays death.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, Wiles was a healthy 24-year-old distance runner who was establishing herself as a local stand-up comedian. Then she started to notice arthritis-like pain, cloudy thinking and extreme fatigue, followed by three years of decline and a lupus diagnosis. In April 2012, she went into kidney failure on a flight home from her grandfather\u2019s funeral. Three months after that, she was on dialysis and chemotherapy.\n\nShe was placed on the kidney transplant list, and stayed there for seven months.\n\nWiles went public with her need for a donor on social media, and it was hard to ask for help. \u201cI don\u2019t even ask for a ride to the airport,\u201d she said. But more than 30 of her friends and family got themselves tested for compatibility \u2014 including Rollman, who only knew Wiles at that time from seeing her perform. \u201cI thought she was weird and kind of funny \u2014 like me,\u201d Rollman said.\n\nThere was a match, but it wasn\u2019t a relative, and it wasn\u2019t Rollman. Instead, it was Jessica Anderson, Wiles\u2019 best friend dating back to elementary school. When Anderson, now a schoolteacher in Los Angeles, learned she was a match, she called Wiles and said, \u201cI hope you are ready to take care of my kidney for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nAnderson flew home for the surgery during her spring break. It took place March 8.\n\n\u201cIt was like someone had flicked a switch, and everything worked again,\u201d said Wiles, whose autoimmune disease has also gone dormant since the surgery. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it could be this good again.\u201d\n\nAbout three weeks after Wiles\u2019 surgery, Rollman had an epiphany. \u201cIf I were willing to give my kidney to Mara,\u201d she said, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I give it up for a stranger?\u201d\n\nThe question sent chills down Rollman\u2019s mother\u2019s spine.\n\n\u201cI feel like I raised a gem,\u201d said Georgianne Rollman. \u201cI know it is a great thing she is doing. But as a mother, you can\u2019t help but worry. We all know people who go into the hospital with nothing, and come out of it with something.\u201d\n\nWhen Rollman officially passed her barrage of tests, she asked the probability there would be a match. Johnson told her, unequivocally, it was 100 percent. It took two hours for the NKR database to identify a match for Rollman.\n\nAnd at that moment, she said. \u201d I knew this was happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are the needle in the haystack that someone has been waiting years for,\u201d Leventhal said. \u201cFor the people who match? They have won the lottery.\u201d\n\nThe legacy\n\nLeventhal, a graduate of the Rocky Mountain Hebrew Academy and Denver Jewish Day School, discovered living organ donation in an online newspaper that serves the Chabad-Lubavitch communities.\n\n\u201cI felt such a high from reading that article that I reached out to get tested right away,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not want the inspiration to fade.\u201d\n\nLeventhal learned he was a unique match with a man who had a very high antibody count \u2014 meaning he was at great risk to reject a kidney from anyone else.\n\nLeventhal flew to Brooklyn for the operation in March just to make the transplantation easier on both the recipient and his doctors.\n\nIn most cases, donors and recipients know nothing about each other until at least three months after the operation, if ever. But when Leventhal arrived, he was asked to meet with the recipient, his wife and three children. When Leventhal walked into the man\u2019s hospital room, the wife told her husband, \u201cThis is the angel that God has sent you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will live with those moments forever,\u201d Leventhal sad.\n\nRollman\u2019s surgery was scheduled for 5 a.m. on Aug. 23. The surgery, led by Dr. Peter Kennealey, took just two hours, and it was without incident, Shonsey said. Rollman woke up a little foggy, muttering something about the middle-schoolers who used to play catch with her cat when she was a kid. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty terrible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she mumbled, to the great amusement of her many waiting friends.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not used to medication,\u201d said fellow actor Brian Colonna.\n\nRollman was released from the hospital the next day. While patients are told to expect a three-week recovery, Rollman resumed a relatively active routine by Sunday. She worked, played games and even went out to dinner. She was a little sore but otherwise, she said, \u201cI feel great. No joke.\u201d\n\nRollman thinks of living organ donation as a normal behavior that is \u201cjust not yet normalized.\u201d For the recipients like Wiles, \u201cIt\u2019s just very humbling and inspiring to know that we are all on this planet together.\u201d\n\nEvan Weissman of the eclectic Buntport Theater, which Rollman started with six pals from Colorado College, says what Rollman did was \u201cexpand her moral imagination.\u201d\n\nRollman has been informed that all three transplants her donation triggered have been successful. She has no regrets. Leventhal has just one.\n\n\u201cThat I can\u2019t do it again,\u201d he said.\n\nKidney donation\n\nFacts and figures\n\n119,348: Americans awaiting organ transplant (all organ types)\n\n97,270: Americans awaiting kidney transplant\n\n1,661: Coloradans awaiting kidney transplant\n\n6,000: Americans who died in 2012 awaiting kidney transplants\n\n82: Coloradans who died in 2012 awaiting kidney transplants\n\n6,000: Living donations now occurring each year in the U.S. (all organ types)\n\n33: Overall living kidney donors in Colorado, 2013\n\n60: Cadaver kidney donors in Colorado, 2013\n\n51 months: Average kidney transplant wait time (national average)\n\n11 months: Average kidney transplant wait time (patients with living donor partners)\n\nAbout donations\n\nLiving donors are never paid, but the Denver-based American Transplant Foundation will help compensate donors with unpaid wages, rent, food and other expenses while they are recovering.\n\nThere are four kidney transplant centers in Colorado:\n\nChildren\u2019s Hospital\n\nUniversity of Colorado\n\nPorter Adventist\n\nPresbyterian St. Luke\u2019s\n\nSources: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, American Transplant Foundation, National Kidney Registry, The Donor Alliance, United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)\n\nFor more information on shared kidney donation:\n\nkidneyregistry.org\n\namericantransplant foundation.org\n\ndonoralliance.org\n\nunos.org", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado kidney donation to stranger sets off life-saving chain reaction", "title": "Colorado kidney donation to stranger sets off life-saving chain reaction", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/07/colorado-kidney-donation-to-stranger-sets-off-life-saving-chain-reaction/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130907__20130908_A18_cd08kidneyjp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130907__20130908_A18_cd08kidneyjp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-07T20:15:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T12:50:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee82\"", "article_summary": "With the help of the Denver-based American Transplant Foundation, she learned that, statistically, kidney donation is less dangerous than childbirth.\nThat\u2019s because the chain Rollman triggered is only in its initial phase.\nShe was placed on the kidney transplant list, and stayed there for seven months.\nThey have won the lottery.\u201dThe legacyLeventhal, a graduate of the Rocky Mountain Hebrew Academy and Denver Jewish Day School, discovered living organ donation in an online newspaper that serves the Chabad-Lubavitch communities.\nThat less than 1 percent of living kidney donors ever experience complications."}
