David Vitter, and one of them is that he really hates Obamacare. The Louisiana Republican spent months in 2013 gumming up non-Obamacare-related legislation in an effort to end federal subsidies for Capitol Hill staffers to buy health insurance. His obsessive quest irked lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who weren\u2019t keen to force their staffs to pay more out-of-pocket for their health coverage. Democrats finally got fed up and told Vitter that if he didn\u2019t quit it, they\u2019d start bringing up the other thing you should know about David Vitter.\n\nAnyway, with Vitter on record as a die-hard opponent of federally subsidized health insurance, it was a bit of a shocker this week when he showed up at the Press Club of Baton Rouge and said maybe he\u2019d be open to accepting federal dollars to expand Medicaid in the state. \u201cWe need to improve and reform Medicaid, and I want to look at everything that could be brought to bear to do that. Now, could more federal resources help to do that? They could, if it\u2019s done right and if it\u2019s done in a constructive way.\u201d\n\nFrom a crass political standpoint, it makes sense for Vitter to ease into bed with Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. He\u2019s running for governor, and expanding Medicaid would mean lots of Louisiana residents receiving health coverage at relatively little cost to the state. Republican governors nationwide have been slowly coming to the same realization. But the fact that David Vitter, of all people, is adulterating his rigid opposition to the Affordable Care Act is just the latest indication that the much-maligned law is working, and working well.\n\nI wrote a couple of weeks ago about how June was shaping up to be a bad month for Affordable Care Act opponents, and it\u2019s only gotten worse for them since then. A new report from Health and Human Services found that people who were eligible for subsidies and shopped for health insurance on Healthcare.gov paid an average of $82 monthly for their insurance premiums. The report also found that \u201c82 percent of people eligible to purchase a qualified health plan could choose from 3 or more health insurance issuers, and 96 percent could choose from 2 or more health insurers in the Marketplace.\u201d\n\nThe whole idea behind Obamacare was to provide incentives for insurance companies to participate in the marketplaces, and foster competition among them to keep prices down. The exchanges have been successful enough that insurers who opted out of the first enrollment period are reversing course and will offer plans through the federal exchange next year.\n\nThose who\u2019ve been enjoying Obamacare\u2019s benefits for years now \u2013 the young people who were allowed to remain on their parents\u2019 insurance until age 26 \u2013 are reporting better health outcomes and reduced expenses. And the Obamacare \u201csticker shock\u201d that so many conservatives were sure was coming has not yet materialized. A study conducted by a conservative economist found that people who\u2019d been purchasing their own health insurance and then switched to Obamacare saw their premiums rise between 14 and 28 percent \u2013 not exactly a tremendous jump. Also, the study didn\u2019t take into account Obamacare\u2019s subsidies for lower-income families.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The success of the Affordable Care Act has its GOP critics like David Vitter folding, or flailing", "author": "Simon Maloy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The success of the Affordable Care Act has its GOP critics like David Vitter folding, or flailing", "title": "Obamacare is working \u2014 despite all the Republican promises it wouldn\u2019t", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/19/obamacare_is_working_despite_all_the_republican_promises_it_wouldnt/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/david_vitter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The success of the Affordable Care Act has its GOP critics like David Vitter folding, or flailing", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/david_vitter.jpg", "title": "Obamacare is working \u2014 despite all the Republican promises it wouldn\u2019t", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Obamacare is working \u2014 despite all the Republican promises it wouldn\u2019t", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Congressional Budget Office, congressional republicans, David Vitter, Editor's Picks, Health Care, Health care reform, House Republicans, Obamacare, Republicans, U.S. Politics", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0292\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Affordable Care Act, Congressional Budget Office, congressional republicans, David Vitter, Editor's Picks, Health Care, Health care reform, House Republicans, Obamacare, Republicans, U.S.\nThe Louisiana Republican spent months in 2013 gumming up non-Obamacare-related legislation in an effort to end federal subsidies for Capitol Hill staffers to buy health insurance.\nPolitics, Politics NewsThere are two things you should know about Sen.
