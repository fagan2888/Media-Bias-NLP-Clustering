(Photo: Courtesy of the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office.)\n\nA retired New York City Fire Department lieutenant who was found dead in his Barnegat Light home last week will be remembered at a funeral service in New York on Tuesday.\n\nRichard P. Doody, 60, of Barnegat Light and the Tottenville section of Staten Island, was found slain on Monday inside his Barnegat Light home by Long Beach Township police. Authorities entered Doody's locked home and found his body after a relative grew concerned after not hearing from him.\n\nAccording to the Staten Island Advance, Doody, who worked for 29 years with the Fire Department of New York and taught probationary firefighters at the Randall's Island Fire Academy, will be remembered at a Mass at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday at Our Lady Help of Christian Church in Tottenville, Staten Island. His funeral will follow at Bedell-Pizzo Funeral Home, also in Tottenville, according to the newspaper.\n\nDoody spent weeks working at ground zero after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and he founded the \"9-11 Sticker Fund\" to help raise money for widows and children of fallen firefighters, according to the Advance.\n\nColts Neck resident Conrad Sipa has been charged with murder in connection with Doody's death. An autopsy determined Doody suffered blunt-force trauma to his head and slash wounds to his neck, according to the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office.\n\nDoody is survived by his wife, Virginia, two sisters, and 15 nieces and nephews, according to the Advance.\n\nAmanda Oglesby: 732-557-5701; aoglesby@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
