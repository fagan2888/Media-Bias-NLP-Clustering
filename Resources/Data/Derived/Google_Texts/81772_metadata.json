Ruiz, senior policy analyst with the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, finds in a new story of the nation\u2019s F-1 visa program.\n\nIthaca, home to Cornell University, includes 71.2 foreign students for every 1,000 enrolled in higher-education programs, istock\n\nIthaca, home to Cornell University and Ithaca College, includes 71.2 foreign students for every 1,000 enrolled in higher-education programs, the highest concentration of foreign students in the nation. Corvallis, home to Oregon State University, is fourth with 62.6 students per thousand. It also had the fastest-growing population of foreign students between 2008 and 2012, according to Mr. Ruiz. Jonesboro, home to Arkansas State University, was fifth with 62.2 students per thousand. Champaign, Ill., and Lafayette, Ind., were among the top 10.\n\nThe common denominator in many of these cases is public universities drawing students in science, technology engineering and math (or STEM) programs, often at a lower cost than at private universities.\n\nThe schools have helped to manage state budget cuts by drawing foreign students, Mr. Ruiz said. In Corvallis \u2014 population 54,520 with aggregate personal income of $3.45 billion in 2012 \u2014 foreign students were a source of $79 million in income from tuition and local living expenses from 2008 to 2012. Ithaca drew $426 million from foreign students during that span.\n\n\u201cForeign students constitute a large source of export earnings for U.S. metropolitan areas,\u201d according to the study.\n\nMr. Ruiz built a database of enrollments in 118 metro areas after conducting a Freedom of Information Act request of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s database of applicants for F-1 student visas. The findings are published online.\n\nMr. Ruiz said small towns could use foreign students as a bridge for local businesses to generate export earnings, but these cities are having a difficult time keeping the students around. Only 14% of foreign students stayed in Ithaca after graduating, while 75% of New York City foreign students remained in the area through \u201cOptional Practical Training\u201d visas, which allow people to temporarily work after studying in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a big city like New York with lots of employment opportunities then people will stay there,\u201d Mr. Ruiz said.\n\nMeantime, the small-town foreign students are coming from big cities around the world, including Seoul, Beijing and Shanghai.\n\nOne outlier: Kathmandu, Nepal, a small city of 1.8 million people, sent 10,721 students between 2008-2012. Its students mostly receive business and marketing degrees, and are concentrated in the Dallas and Washington, D.C., metro areas.\n\nHyderabad, India, is shipping some of its students to \u201cdiploma mills\u201d in remote areas. Mr. Ruiz found a large number of students from Hyderabad showing up at places like Tri-Valley University and University of Northern Virginia, programs that were shut down by the Department of Homeland Security in 2011 and 2013 respectively due to allegations they served only to provide F-1 visas to individuals looking to enter the U.S. to work.\n\nBusinesses in Hyderabad seem to be using the visa program as \u201ca back door into the United States,\u201d Mr. Ruiz said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Small cities are among the biggest beneficiaries of a wave of foreign students studying at U.S. universities, according to a Brookings Institution study.", "title": "Small U.S. Cities Prove To Be A Big Draw For Foreign Students", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/08/29/small-u-s-cities-prove-to-be-a-big-draw-for-foreign-students/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EI141_0829co_P_20140829162416.jpg"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "Small U.S. Cities Prove To Be A Big Draw For Foreign Students", "description": "Small cities are among the biggest beneficiaries of a wave of foreign students studying at U.S. universities, according to a Brookings Institution study.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Jon Hilsenrath", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "Small cities are among the biggest beneficiaries of a wave of foreign students studying at U.S. universities, according to a Brookings Institution study.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-08-29T13:30:44-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/08/29/small-u-s-cities-prove-to-be-a-big-draw-for-foreign-students/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-27486", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Small cities are among the biggest beneficiaries of a wave of foreign students studying at U.S. universities, according to a Brookings Institution study.", "title": "Small U.S. Cities Prove To Be A Big Draw For Foreign Students", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/08/29/small-u-s-cities-prove-to-be-a-big-draw-for-foreign-students/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EI141_0829co_P_20140829162416.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-27486", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-29T20:35:59-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe46\"", "article_summary": "Meantime, the small-town foreign students are coming from big cities around the world, including Seoul, Beijing and Shanghai.\nIthaca, home to Cornell University, includes 71.2 foreign students for every 1,000 enrolled in higher-education programs, istockIthaca, home to Cornell University and Ithaca College, includes 71.2 foreign students for every 1,000 enrolled in higher-education programs, the highest concentration of foreign students in the nation.\nSmall cities are among the biggest beneficiaries of a wave of foreign students studying at U.S. universities, according to a Brookings Institution study.\nIt also had the fastest-growing population of foreign students between 2008 and 2012, according to Mr. Ruiz.\nThe schools have helped to manage state budget cuts by drawing foreign students, Mr. Ruiz said."}
