It\u2019s a symbolic venue for a mother of two from the South Side of Chicago who stepped into the role of presidential spouse with the goal of welcoming more visitors, especially children, to the seat of world power.\n\n\u201cWhile our family might live upstairs, the president and I know that the White House is truly the \u2018People\u2019s House,'\u201d the first lady said. \u201cIt belongs to all of us.\u201d\n\nMilitary families and students are among those given priority at White House events such as the annual Fourth of July picnic. Mrs. Obama is also more consistent than her recent predecessors in using the South Lawn. Most first ladies used the outside grounds for the occasional state dinner, annual Easter Egg Roll or ceremony for a visiting head of state.\n\nGirl Scouts hunkered down in tents for a campout last summer until rain and claps of thunder sent them and their chaperones scampering into a nearby office building. Mrs. Obama said it was the first campout ever held on the lawn.\n\nIn 2011, scores of children surrounded Mrs. Obama on the lawn to break the Guinness World Record for the most people around the world doing jumping jacks in a 24-hour period. (More than 300,000 people participated.) The lawn is also where she showed off her hula-hooping prowess, performing 142 turns of her hips during a \u201chealthy kids\u201d fair that same year. Children joined her in 2014 when blue sport bottles were laid out on the lawn in the shape of a water drop, part of her campaign to encourage people to drink more plain water.\n\nObservers say these events wouldn\u2019t pack the same punch if Mrs. Obama held them anywhere else.\n\n\u201cEven if those kids are sweating in the sun doing jumping jacks, they only need to look back over their shoulder to see the most powerful house in the world,\u201d said Carl Anthony, historian at the National First Ladies\u2019 Library in Canton, Ohio.\n\nThen there\u2019s Mrs. Obama\u2019s world-famous garden. It\u2019s the first one on the South Lawn since World War II, when first lady Eleanor Roosevelt started a garden there as Americans were being encouraged to plant \u201cvictory gardens\u201d to supplement the U.S. food supply.", "article_metadata": {"description": "White House South Lawn becomes first lady\u2019s grassy stage", "title": "White House South Lawn becomes first lady\u2019s grassy stage", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "White House South Lawn becomes first lady\u2019s grassy stage", "title": "White House South Lawn becomes first lady\u2019s grassy stage", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/02/white_house_south_lawn_becomes_first_ladys_grassy_stage_2/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/michelle-obama-south-lawn.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "White House South Lawn becomes first lady\u2019s grassy stage", "title": "White House South Lawn becomes first lady\u2019s grassy stage", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/michelle-obama-south-lawn.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Darlene Superville", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Michelle Obama\u2019s affection for the White House South Lawn has grown just like the sweet potatoes and carrots she plants there.\n\u201cWhile our family might live upstairs, the president and I know that the White House is truly the \u2018People\u2019s House,'\u201d the first lady said.\nMrs. Obama is also more consistent than her recent predecessors in using the South Lawn.\n\u201cIt belongs to all of us.\u201dMilitary families and students are among those given priority at White House events such as the annual Fourth of July picnic.\nBut to Mrs. Obama, the 6-plus acres of manicured grass and gardens are more than a place to talk about diet and health."}
