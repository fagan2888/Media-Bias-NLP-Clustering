The majority of her patients are uninsured, something Obamacare has impacted.\n\n\u201cWe have more patients with insurance, but having an insurance card unfortunately doesn\u2019t solve a lot of the problems,\u201d said Obeime.\n\nGetting people in is easy, but getting them to get their prescriptions and to follow up, is not so easy. That\u2019s why Obeime stresses that getting the under-insured preventive care not only costs taxpayers less to treat them, but it\u2019s vital to the health of her client\u2019s whole family.\n\n\u201cPatients who get really sick, who lose everything, end up on Medicaid,\u201d said Obeime.\n\nBecause poverty is not a circumstance that can be treated by a doctor, Obeime has worked with lawmakers here and in D.C., to help impact policy. Her desire to treat the whole person, is what motivates her practice.\n\nObeime\u2019s center has a Marion County \u201cbaby shop\u201d inside, where clients get coupons that can be used to buy necessities for their babies. She also felt called to help those in need in her native Nigeria. In 2001, she started the Mercy Foundation, and for many years she took medical mission trips to see patients there. It\u2019s a way to combine her faith and career, by addressing the basic need in every person.\n\n\u201cSometimes people don\u2019t even want you to fix everything,\u201d said Obeime. \u201cThey just want you to listen, they want you to listen and say \u2018yes, I know that this hurts, I know that it is difficult to live in this situation.'\u201d\n\nFor Obeime, helping those around her see and understand just how much she cares is part of the job; and by addressing the whole person, not just their physical ailments, she is able to do that.\n\n\u201cWhether it is here, or whether it is on our medical missions, people just want to be cared for, most people (want to feel) loved,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot treat somebody by just saying where it hurts. They may be hurting spiritually, emotionally or socially and if those things are not addressed, you\u2019re not going to get a good outcome.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obeime stresses that getting the under-insured preventive care not only costs taxpayers less to treat them, but it's vital to the health of \u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488524387", "og": {"site_name": "WISH-TV", "description": "Obeime stresses that getting the under-insured preventive care not only costs taxpayers less to treat them, but it\u2019s vital to the health of each client\u2019s whole family.", "title": "Dr. Obeime works tirelessly on behalf of underinsured", "url": "http://wishtv.com/2015/02/11/dr-obeime-works-tirelessly-on-behalf-of-underinsured/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwish.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/obeime-md.jpg", "height": 370}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obeime stresses that getting the under-insured preventive care not only costs taxpayers less to treat them, but it\u2019s vital to the health of each client\u2019s whole family.", "creator": "@WISH_TV", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwish.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/obeime-md.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Dr. Obeime works tirelessly on behalf of underinsured", "site": "wish_tv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": ", Local News, News, Top Video, Lori Wilson", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wish", "fb": {"pages": 51020120862}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wishtv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/3eda613633012e4513b3dffff2e4b0bc?s=16", "application-name": "WISH-TV", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wishtv", "published_time": "2015-02-11T17:15:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-12T01:31:42+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "-0bIsWnsWP_Tti2P_v5CM_6E-Jif4gWmQWQHbxcE9q4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb8b\"", "article_summary": "(WISH Photo)INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) \u2014 Dr. Mercy Obeime knew she wanted to help other people, and she knew she would use medicine to do that.\n\u201cPoverty is a huge reason that people have poor health,\u201d said Obeime.\n\u201cWe have more patients with insurance, but having an insurance card unfortunately doesn\u2019t solve a lot of the problems,\u201d said Obeime.\nThat\u2019s why Obeime stresses that getting the under-insured preventive care not only costs taxpayers less to treat them, but it\u2019s vital to the health of her client\u2019s whole family.\nIn 2001, she started the Mercy Foundation, and for many years she took medical mission trips to see patients there."}
