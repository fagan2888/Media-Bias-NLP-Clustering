In the piece entitled \u201c(Actually) True War Stories At NBC News,\u201d sources said Williams was often unwilling \u201cto go after hard-hitting stories,\u201d including one about an Obama Justice Department memo defending killing Americans with drones and another about the White House knowing back in 2010 that millions would lose their insurance due to Obamacare regulations:\n\nMultiple sources told me that former NBC investigative reporters Michael Isikoff and Lisa Myers battled with Williams over stories. In February 2013, Isikoff failed to interest Williams in a piece about a confidential Justice Department memo that justified killing American citizens with drones. He instead broke the story on Rachel Maddow. That October, Myers couldn\u2019t get Williams to air a segment about how the White House knew as far back as 2010 that some people would lose their insurance policies under Obama\u00adcare. Frustrated, Myers posted the article on NBC\u2019s website,where it immediately went viral. Williams relented and ran it the next night. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to put stories on the air that would be divisive,\u201d a senior NBC journalist told me. According to a source, Myers wrote a series of scathing memos to then\u2013NBC senior vice-president Antoine Sanfuentes documenting how Williams suppressed her stories.\n\nMyers and Isikoff have both since left the network, Sherman reported, and declined comment for his article. As pointed out by media watchdog NewsBusters, Williams already has a well-established reputation for being soft on the Democratic Party and President Obama in particular.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "An excerpt from Gabriel Sherman's\u00a0New York\u00a0Magazine article on suspended\u00a0NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams revealed he tried to suppress two stories that would hurt President Obama.
