Whereas 50 grams of white fat stores 300 calories, the same volume of brown fat can burn 300 calories in one day. \u201cExcitement in the brown fat field has risen significantly over last few years because its energy-burning nature makes it a potential therapeutic target against obesity and diabetes,\" he explained. \"White fat transformation into brown fat could protect animals against diabetes, obesity, and fatty liver.\u201d\n\nThe study, which is published in the journal Cell Metabolism, shows that this fat transformation may be achieved without access to weights or treadmills. By exposing volunteers to cold temperatures and measuring their production of hormones associated with brown fat activation, the researchers found that 10 to 15 minutes of shivering yielded the same increase in production as one hour of moderate exercise. \"We identified two hormones that are stimulated by cold \u2014 irisin and FGF21 \u2014 released from shivering muscle and brown fat respectively,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cThese hormones fired up the energy-burning rate of human white fat cells in the laboratory, and the treated fat cells began to emit heat \u2014 a hallmark of brown fat function.\"\n\nAside from illuminating a potential weight-loss method, these findings also expand the current knowledge of the body\u2019s own heating mechanism. \"When we are cold, we first activate our brown fat because it burns energy and releases heat to protect us,\u201d Lee told reporters. \u201cWhen that energy is insufficient, muscle contracts mechanically, or shivers, thereby generating heat. However, we did not know how muscle and fat communicate in this process.\"\n\nShiver, Burn Fat\n\nThe current study dovetails with a paper from Maastricht University published earlier this year, in which researchers show that lowering your thermostat may help you burn excess fat continuously throughout your day. According to the authors, it follows that a nationwide move toward lower indoor temperatures may have a tremendous impact on the national health profile. With obesity rates on the rise, an intervention of this scope may prove to be an invaluable service to public health.\n\nWhile many factors may account for the health benefits of shivering, Lee and his colleagues believe that it all comes down to the fact that heat generation and exercise follow the same physiological rules. \"We speculate exercise could be mimicking shivering \u2014 because there is muscle contraction during both processes, and that exercise-stimulated irisin could have evolved from shivering in the cold.\"\n\nSource: Lee P, Linderman JD, Smith S, et al.
