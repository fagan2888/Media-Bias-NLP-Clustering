He also held the title of recruiting coordinator last season.\n\nHe was a Washington graduate assistant in 2011 and 2012, and Nevada's assistant linebackers coach in 2010.\n\nWilliams began his coaching career as the secondary coach at Los Angeles Harbor College in 2007, held the same job at El Camino College a year later and then was secondary coach at Mount San Antonio College in 2009.\n\nAs it turned out, Rodriguez is in the midst of replacing his full defensive staff.\n\nHe let go of coordinator/linebackers coach Jeff Casteel, defensive line coach Bill Kirelawich and cornerbacks coach David Lockwood. Safeties coach Matt Caponi accepted an assistant coaching job with West Virginia last week.\n\nRodriguez already promoted Jahmile Addae from the administrative staff to cornerbacks coach. Addae, 33, is another young coach who should be a force on the recruiting trail.\n\nThe coordinator search has centered on Boise State defensive coordinator Marcel Yates, who is 38 and especially focused on recruiting in the Los Angeles area.\n\nWilliams, originally from the L.A. area, was a defensive back at Pasadena Community College, played for Syracuse in 2003 and then spend his final two seasons at Idaho State.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "As of Sunday morning, the Arizona Wildcats had yet to announce a new defensive coordinator, but another piece of the puzzle fell into place.", "author": "Anthony Gimino", "og": {"url": "http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/story/30987207/arizona-adds-defensive-assistant-donte-williams-san-jose-state", "image": "http://kold.images.worldnow.com/images/9669021_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "As of Sunday morning, the Arizona Wildcats had yet to announce a new defensive coordinator, but another piece of the puzzle fell into place.", "title": "Arizona adds defensive assistant from San Jose State"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 17641427, "title": "Arizona adds defensive assistant from San Jose State", "image": "http://kold.images.worldnow.com/images/9669021_G.jpg", "creator": "@TucsonNewsNow", "site": "@TucsonNewsNow", "card": "summary", "description": "As of Sunday morning, the Arizona Wildcats had yet to announce a new defensive coordinator, but another piece of the puzzle fell into place."}, "wnreadableurl": "arizona-adds-defensive-assistant-donte-williams-san-jose-state", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOLD", "fb": {"admins": 644426401, "app_id": 215936215202939}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/TucsonNewsNow"}, "date": "2016/01/17", "google-site-verification": "wum6pK5VyCXxNIhQSMSz7se_UVLjlDGJFKTm4EWnWUY", "KEYWORDS": "Tucson News Now,KOLD News 13,FOX 11,KOLD,KMSB,Tucson,Southern Arizona,Arizona", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS23", "news_keywords": "Tucson News Now,KOLD News 13,FOX 11,KOLD,KMSB,Tucson,Southern Arizona,Arizona"}, "article_summary": "Arizona announced that Donte' Williams, the secondary coach at San Jose State, has joined the staff.\nAs of Sunday morning, the Arizona Wildcats had yet to announce a new defensive coordinator, but another piece of the puzzle fell into place.\nThe coordinator search has centered on Boise State defensive coordinator Marcel Yates, who is 38 and especially focused on recruiting in the Los Angeles area.\n\"In order for our program to grow, we have to be better at recruiting,\" Rodriguez said.\nHe let go of coordinator/linebackers coach Jeff Casteel, defensive line coach Bill Kirelawich and cornerbacks coach David Lockwood."}
