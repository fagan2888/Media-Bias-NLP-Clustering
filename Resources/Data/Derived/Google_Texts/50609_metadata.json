It\u2019s going to be an exciting playoff.\u201d\n\nAlabama\u2019s title hopes were on the ropes in mid-September when five turnovers allowed Mississippi to pull off a 43-37 upset at Bryant-Denny Stadium. The Tide (12-1, No. 2 CFP) bounced back to win 10 straight games, earning a spot in the national semifinals at either the Cotton or Orange Bowl on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nThe pairings will be announced Sunday. Unbeaten Clemson, rated No. 1 and atop the playoff rankings, beat No. 8 North Carolina 45-37 Saturday night in the ACC championship game.\n\nA year ago, the Tide played in the inaugural playoff but was upset by eventual national champion Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl.\n\nSaban, who said he even had questions about his team after the Ole Miss loss, gushed over how the Crimson Tide rebounded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of this team,\u201d said Saban, who already has three national titles as the Tide\u2019s coach and needs two more wins for his fourth. \u201cThey wanted to do something special. And probably more than any other time I\u2019ve ever coached, I wanted to see these guys succeed.\u201d\n\nHenry capped his Heisman campaign with a flourish, rushing for 189 bruising yards on a staggering 44 carries against one of the nation\u2019s top defenses. Jake Coker turned in just the sort of performance that the Tide needed out of its quarterback - 18 of 26 completions for 204 yards, including a pair of touchdowns. The defense was too much for Florida\u2019s maligned offense, which managed only 3 yards of offense in the second and third quarters.\n\nFlorida, an 18-point underdog, briefly grabbed a 7-2 lead on Antonio Callaway\u2019s 85-yard punt return for a touchdown early in the second quarter.\n\nAlabama dominated from there.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "The confetti fell on another Alabama championship, just not the one the Crimson Tide really wants.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The confetti fell on another Alabama championship, just not the one the Crimson Tide really wants.", "title": "No. 2 Alabama clinches playoffs with 29-15 win over Florida", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/6/no-2-alabama-clinches-playoffs-with-29-15-win-over/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/04/sec_championship_football.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/04/sec_championship_football.jpeg", "description": "The confetti fell on another Alabama championship, just not the one the Crimson Tide really wants.", "card": "summary", "title": "No. 2 Alabama clinches playoffs with 29-15 win over Florida"}, "Author": "PAUL NEWBERRY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jake Coker, Derrick Henry"}, "article_summary": "ATLANTA (AP) - The confetti fell on another Alabama championship, just not the one the Crimson Tide really wants.\nThe Tide became the first team since Tennessee in 1998 to win two straight SEC titles - an impressive achievement indeed.\n2 Alabama cruised into the four-team playoff with a 29-15 victory over No.\nBut the only way this season will be considered a true success is Alabama claiming another national title.\nFlorida, an 18-point underdog, briefly grabbed a 7-2 lead on Antonio Callaway\u2019s 85-yard punt return for a touchdown early in the second quarter."}
