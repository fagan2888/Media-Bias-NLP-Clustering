He extended Russian citizenship to the French movie icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu, who now owns a vineyard in Crimea. He basks in the ways that Russia\u2019s cultural and artistic cognoscenti are supporting Moscow\u2019s aggression in Ukraine.\n\nThis offers the United States an unexpected opening. If Washington really wants to wield more influence over Putin, President Barack Obama need only place one call: to former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Give \u201cThe Governator\u201d a sequel as the next U.S. ambassador to Russia.\n\nCompare Schwarzenegger to Washington\u2019s most recent ambassador, Michael McFaul. A Stanford political science professor, McFaul tended to follow his academic interests \u2014 focusing on building a civil society \u2014 which rubbed the Kremlin the wrong way and often hampered diplomatic efforts. Even John Tefft, a career diplomat and the former U.S. ambassador to Lithuania, Georgia and Ukraine who may be getting the Moscow post, is too well-known for his tough anti-Russian stance. He is unlikely to improve Washington\u2019s relations with the Kremlin.\n\nBut consider: Schwarzenegger, who has serious political credentials as the two-term governor of California, is also the action hero of The Terminator, Terminator II: Judgment Day and Total Recall. He is a celebrated bodybuilder, five-time winner of the Mr. Universe competition. He has a larger-than-life personality, yet played a tough-but-kind nanny in Kindergarten Cop and an endearing man-mother in Junior.\n\nRelated: The Growing Power of Putin\u2019s Propaganda Machine\n\nSchwarzenegger personifies all the qualities that the Russian president most admires: He could teach Putin how to be everyone\u2019s policeman and everyone\u2019s nurse \u2014 at the same time. And since the Russian president is an avid martial arts enthusiast, the star of Collateral Damage andCommando could probably offer a few pointers.\n\nIn addition, Putin speaks German, having mastered it during his KGB posting as a Soviet spymaster in East Germany. So the Russian president can talk sports or East-West politics \u2014 or even women\u2019s issues, since both he and Schwarzenegger have had past difficulties with marital fidelity \u2014 with the Austrian-born physical-fitness advocate in his native language.\n\nI am not being frivolous \u2014 just pragmatic. I saw Putin courting cultural figures in his early Kremlin days. In the fall of 1999, we both attended a concert to hear the famous Georgian romance singer Nani Bregvadze, who was performing at a home in the chic section of Moscow. Putin was then an aspiring prime minister to President Boris Yeltsin and clearly intent on paying respects to influential members of the artistic intelligentsia. When this short man with opaque gray eyes, wearing a pitch-black suit, walked in, however, the elite had no interest in him.\n\nPutin quickly sized up the cognoscenti\u2019s disparaging mood. In a stunning move, he fell to his knees and crawled toward Bregvadze, begging her to sing. \u201cYou are my favorite artist of all time,\u201d he insisted. The snooty Moscow intellectuals were smitten.\n\nHis adoration of Bregvadze garnered positive buzz around the capital. \u201cEven if he is KGB,\u201d the intellectual elite asserted, \u201che understands us, he loves culture.\u201d\n\nI knew then and there that with such prominent supporters, Putin\u2019s victory as the successor to Yeltsin was sealed.\n\nIn 2003, I again watched Putin as he wooed Russia\u2019s influential cultural elite. He was seated across the aisle from me at a concert in the new House of Music, off Moscow\u2019s central Garden Ring. Putin was sandwiched between two iconic Russian artists. On one side was the celebrated former dissident, conductor-cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. On Putin\u2019s other side was Rostropovich\u2019s equally legendary wife, the opera soprano Galina Vishnevskaya.\n\nPutin looked thrilled to be surrounded by these cultural giants \u2014 former Soviet exiles no less. He must have felt all-powerful in being able to merge the past and the future \u2014 the once irreconcilable differences between communism and its critics. Hanging out with famous artists was, for Putin, a validation of his personal magnitude.\n\nRelying on cultural influences is, of course, one of the oldest tricks in any autocrat\u2019s playbook. History has demonstrated this, particularly in Russia.\n\nTsarina Catherine the Great sought the enlightened friendship of the French writer and philosopher Voltaire as justification for her efforts to strengthen and expand the Russian empire. More than a century and a half later, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin enlisted world-renowned artists like Boris Pasternak, the poet who wrote Dr. Zhivago, and Dmitri Shostakovich, the composer and pianist, to write odes and sing praises to the dictator and his rule.\n\nRelated: How Obama\u2019s Russia Strategy Imperils Eastern Europe\n\nNikita Khrushchev, Stalin\u2019s successor (and my great-grandfather), staked his de-Stalinization reform on the novels of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, whose 1962 One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich described the grim realities of the Soviet detention camps.\n\nIt was the ultimate post-Soviet irony that Putin, who launched his political career after serving as a KGB colonel, later embraced Solzhenitsyn, the fierce critic of the secret police, as a prophet of Slavic superiority. Though this time it was less about solving the existential problems of dictatorial rule and more about a photo-op with a cultural icon.\n\nGiven Putin\u2019s long quest for celebrity approval, the Obama administration\u2019s nomination of Schwarzenegger could offer the Russian leader a photo-op he can\u2019t refuse. For Washington, the choice could be a better long-term strategy than exercising largely ineffective ideological outrage \u2014 even if the White House seems to enjoy insulting Putin \u2014 or costly economic sanctions.\n\nThough a new Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, has been elected, the Ukrainian crisis is still continuing. If Russia decides on a third act of its expansion (parts of Georgia and Ukraine being the first two) \u2014 say, to take over a Transdnestria region in Moldova, in case that country turns toward the West \u2014 The Governator might just have enough muscle to put a stop to it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is star-struck.", "title": "Why Schwarzenegger Should Be U.S. Ambassador to Russia", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/23/Why-Schwarzenegger-Should-be-US-Ambassador-Russia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06232014_Schwarzenegger_Medvedev.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/23/Why-Schwarzenegger-Should-be-US-Ambassador-Russia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06232014_Schwarzenegger_Medvedev.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is star-struck.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a60\"", "article_summary": "If Washington really wants to wield more influence over Putin, President Barack Obama need only place one call: to former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nAnd since the Russian president is an avid martial arts enthusiast, the star of Collateral Damage andCommando could probably offer a few pointers.\nGive \u201cThe Governator\u201d a sequel as the next U.S. ambassador to Russia.\nCompare Schwarzenegger to Washington\u2019s most recent ambassador, Michael McFaul.\nGiven Putin\u2019s long quest for celebrity approval, the Obama administration\u2019s nomination of Schwarzenegger could offer the Russian leader a photo-op he can\u2019t refuse."}
