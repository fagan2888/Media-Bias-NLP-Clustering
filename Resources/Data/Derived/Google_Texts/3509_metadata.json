Mitt Romney knew early on that Obama\u2019s huge lead among unmarried young women had to be cut down, so Romney started campaigning with Republican women and Ann Romney became one of his chief surrogates. \u201cI LOVE YOU WOMENNNNNN,\u201d Mrs. Romney belted out at the Republican National Convention. Despite the canny subtlety of these efforts, Romney lost the female vote by 11 points, and lost unmarried women by an astounding 36 points.\n\nAfter Romney lost, the Republicans looked to make changes. \u201cMuch was written after the 2012 election regarding the Republican Party\u2019s \u2018women\u2019 problem,\u201d the Republican National Committee\u2019s Growth and Opportunity Project observed. \u201cThe RNC must improve its efforts to include female voters.\u201d Just last week, RNC chair Reince Priebus acknowledged that Republicans still have work to do on that front. \u201cWe basically have a single-women problem under 35-ish,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cIt\u2019s a demographic issue that we want to do better with.\u201d\n\nRepublicans want to prove to women that they\u2019re sensitive to their concerns. And what better way to show it than to line up behind a corporation pushing for the \u201creligious freedom\u201d to deny its employees contraceptive coverage? Republicans know how vitally important women voters are in national elections, and they know how politically troublesome contraceptive coverage can be for them. But they\u2019re going back for another bite of the apple because they\u2019re hidebound by ideology, and they really hate Obamacare.\n\nAs Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties went to the Supreme Court yesterday to argue for a religious exemption to Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive coverage mandate, congressional Republicans fired off statements of support. \u201cReligious freedom is not for some people under some circumstances; it is for one and all,\u201d read a statement from John Boehner. \u201cIt\u2019s time to restore our complete and unwavering support for religious freedom and that is why I stand with those arguing for their liberty before the court today,\u201d said Eric Cantor. You\u2019ll find a similarly worded statement from almost every high-profile Republican defending Hobby Lobby\u2019s assertion of \u201creligious liberty.\u201d\n\nWhile they say \u201creligious liberty,\u201d the heart of this matter is the conservative belief that ladies who have sex should buy their own sex drugs using their own sex money. There\u2019s a moral component, they argue, given that contraceptives facilitate anything from wanton licentiousness to euthanasia to abortion. (None of that is true.) This notion that contraceptives cause abortions is the most interesting one, given that it is central to the case against the Affordable Care Act, even though it is complete garbage in the eyes of the medical community. The fact that contraceptives also may be medically necessary to treat certain reproductive disorders is too often left unmentioned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats face real political challenges.
