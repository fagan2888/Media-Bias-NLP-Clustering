The event will run from 3 p.m. until 6 p.m.\n\nVolunteers will serve a variety of food in what they're calling a \"good southern dinner\". They'll have ham, turkey, peas, and cornbread, just to name a few.\n\nThey're also handing out gifts to children.\n\n\"We don't know of anyone who does a public event like this at no cost,\" store owner Penny Corley explained. \"We know there are quite a few needy people in the area and even those that are not needy. So we want to do this as a service to our community and just allow everybody to come out and celebrate the holiday.\"\n\nThe staff are prepared for 150 people to attend. They'll also be available to answer question people may have about their taxes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Organizers say wanted to hold the dinner because they are not aware of any sort of free public event that's available in the area.", "language": "english", "author": "Brian Hill", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Liberty-Tax-Service-hosting-Christmas-dinner-363486361.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/liberty+tax1.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Organizers say wanted to hold the dinner because they are not aware of any sort of free public event that's available in the area.", "title": "Liberty Tax Service hosting Christmas dinner"}, "twitter": {"description": "Organizers say wanted to hold the dinner because they are not aware of any sort of free public event that's available in the area.", "title": "Liberty Tax Service hosting Christmas dinner", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Liberty-Tax-Service-hosting-Christmas-dinner-363486361.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/liberty+tax1.JPG", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Liberty Tax Service hosting Christmas dinner", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Liberty Tax Service hosting Christmas"}, "article_summary": "Liberty Tax Service is hosting their first Christmas dinner for local families Friday.\nStaff at the Chipley office have spent the past few days turning their office in to a dining area.\n\"We know there are quite a few needy people in the area and even those that are not needy.\nVolunteers will serve a variety of food in what they're calling a \"good southern dinner\".\nSo we want to do this as a service to our community and just allow everybody to come out and celebrate the holiday.\""}
