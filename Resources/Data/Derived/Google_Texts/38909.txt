WINKELMAN, AZ (Tucson News Now) - A driver and four horses died early Sunday, Feb. 14 when a car hit a small herd on State Route 77 north of Tucson.

The collision happened around 4:20 a.m. a little more than halfway between Tucson and Phoenix, when a black car drove into a group of eight horses, hitting four of them.

The driver died at the scene. Three of the horses died, and the fourth was injured so badly it had to be put down.

Shortly after, a pickup truck hit one of the dead horses, damaging the vehicle.

SR-77 was closed for several hours, and traffic was rerouted through Dudleyville. The road reopened at 11:20 a.m.
