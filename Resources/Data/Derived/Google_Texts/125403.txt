Born of an entrepreneurial eureka in 1858 — the discovery of gold at the confluence of the Platte River and Cherry Creek — Denver is an instant city, produced by gold and sustained by commerce. Today, Denver continues to reflect the brash carelessness of the parvenu, flush and arrogant with sudden riches. In the frenetic drive to bigger, newer, faster, it’s time to stop and consider the structures and places now silent, the storytellers of our history.

Rest in peace, historic buildings:

• 999 S. Broadway — The main factory buildings of the Gates Rubber Plant represent Denver’s industrial history. Shuttered since 1991, the bulk of the sprawling site has been demolished and certified for redevelopment. The remaining, signature buildings are being demolished, despite the absence of a plan or developer to repurpose the site. In 2012, the Denver City Council and city administration accelerated the path to destruction, issuing Certificates of Non-Historic Status to London-based Tompkins PLC, the firm that acquired the family-based Gates Rubber Company in 1995.

Denver’s collective failure of imagination and political will spelled the destruction of this noble storyteller. A poorly informed City Council, a politically neutered Landmark Preservation Commission and a mayor infatuated with developers meekly ceded to an indifferent property owner. Proposals to repurpose the structures, spearheaded by savvy and experienced local and national developers, were dismissed. The buildings disappear, to be replaced by who knows what?

• Designed by Denver’s foremost Usonian-style architects, Victor Hornbein and Ed White, the Children’s Psychiatric Day Care Center (1962) and the neighboring John F. Kennedy Childhood Development Center (1968) are two of the most important buildings on the former University of Colorado Medical Center’s Eighth Avenue and Colorado Boulevard campus. These iconic examples of Denver mid-century architecture met the wrecking ball, although there is neither a developer nor a plan for the site. Chalk up another lost opportunity to the failure of patience and wisdom.

As for Denver’s irreplaceable open space and public parkland, while last rites haven’t yet been read, it appears the following are on life support:

• Hentzell Park — The questionable swap between the city of Denver and Denver Public Schools of 9 acres of open space in southeast Denver for a building at 1330 Fox St. is on appeal. The Friends of Denver Parks, with the able support of attorney John Case, appealed District Court Judge Herbert Stern’s June decision to approve the opaque transaction, denying the rights of Denver voters to agree. The Court of Appeals’ expedited decision is due by year’s end.

• City Loop is a proposal to convert 13 acres in the northwest corner of City Park to a regional destination. Designed by Maine-based PORT Architecture, this loopy, multimillion-dollar scheme anticipates corporate sponsorship, promises to attract thousands of visitors and includes no plan for public safety, maintenance or parking. City Loop will offer a frenetic mix of kinetic amusements, skate parks, rain gardens, spiral slides and faux forests.

City Park hosts two of Denver’s most active cultural assets — the Denver Zoo and the Denver Museum of Nature & Science. Can it sustain another, year-round regional attraction?

Instant cities that don’t mature and become sustainable disappear. This country’s most famous: Tombstone.

RIP.
