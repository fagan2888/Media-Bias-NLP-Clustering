The public needs to understand that.\"\n\nBut Rep. Brian Ellis, R-Butler, one of ALEC's Pennsylvania chairs, said there is no secrecy involved.\n\nEllis said due to the budget impasse and scheduling issues, only he and Rep. Seth Grove, R-York, are attending the conference this week out of the 32 ALEC-registered members within the state Legislature.\n\nEllis said he was paying for his travel and registration this year out of his own pocket, though he has accepted some \"scholarships\" from ALEC in the past, which he has disclosed.\n\n\"The whole experience has been invaluable to me, meeting colleagues in other states, seeing how things are done in other states,\" he said.\n\nSteve Miskin, House Republican spokesman, said most legislators pay their own way to attend conferences, though they can be reimbursed afterward if they wish.\n\nSome legislation Kauffman said has been linked to the meetings \"behind closed doors\" at ALEC in the past including voter ID legislation and the \"stand your ground\" guns rights law.\n\nKauffman said some larger tech companies -- such as Google, Facebook and Yahoo -- have dropped out of sponsoring the event in the past because of the controversy surrounding it.\n\nJay Riestenberg, a Common Cause research analyst, is in San Diego this week protesting outside the conference alongside labor unions, public interest organizations and environmental groups outside the conference that started Wednesday and runs through Friday.\n\nRiestenberg said the conference has resulted in anti-labor bills and efforts to redefine state pension plans from defined benefit to defined contribution plans, which was the core of a Senate Republican pension reform bill recently vetoed by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf.\n\n\"Additionally, ALEC has been the leading organization [for Republicans] to stop, block and try to repeal the Affordable Care Act through all kinds of different legislation,\" Riestenberg said. \"They're also one of the leading groups opposing any kind of environmental protection.\"\n\nCommon Cause submitted a complaint to the Internal Revenue Service in 2012 and supplemental materials in recent years in an effort to increase ALEC's transparency. Riestenberg said the organization has made efforts to change, but it still does not release lists of corporate sponsors or legislative attendees.\n\nSeveral attempts to get comment from ALEC representatives were not successful on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nRiestenberg said his group will be following up after the conference by going through disclosure reports from various corporations to see if they reveal what they paid for at the conference. They'll also check legislators' disclosure forms as they become available, but that can take three to six months, he said.\n\nJennifer Kocher, spokeswoman for Senate Republicans, said she wasn't aware of any members of the Senate Republican caucus who had registered for either the ALEC or NCSL conferences. However, legislators would not need pre-approval to get reimbursed at a later point, she said.\n\nNo House or Senate Democratic members are attending ALEC as the event attracts more Republicans than Democrats, according to caucus spokespeople.\n\nAnother major conference for lawmakers, the National Conference of State Legislators, will convene Aug. 3 to Aug. 6 in Seattle, Washington. It was unclear on Thursday how many, if any, legislators would be attending that conference.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "american-legislative-exchange-council, barry-kauffman, brian-ellis, common-cause-pa, news", "title": "Group wants answers about conservative lawmakers' conference", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Group wants answers about conservative lawmakers\\u0027 conference\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/07/alec_conference.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/18384092-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16564599\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-07-23T15:31:38Z\", \"author\": \"Sam Janesch | Special to PennLive\", \"tags\": [\"@papolitics\",\"@topstories\",\"american-legislative-exchange-council\",\"barry-kauffman\",\"brian-ellis\",\"common-cause-pa\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.pennlive.com/politics_impact/photo/18384092-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "A controversial meeting of the nation's lawmakers is happening this week in San Diego and government reform group Common Cause Pennsylvania is keeping tabs on what's on the agenda.", "card": "summary", "site": "@pennlive"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, July 23, 2015, 11:31 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/politics_impact/photo/alec-rally-b12bbaebdc0f7b50.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"sjanesch\", \"author_nickname\": \"Sam Janesch | Special to PennLive\", \"author_id\": \"12537575\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Pennsylvania Politics\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/politics/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "A controversial meeting of the nation's lawmakers is happening this week in San Diego and government reform group Common Cause Pennsylvania is keeping tabs on what's on the agenda.", "title": "Group wants answers about conservative lawmakers' conference", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/07/alec_conference.html", "image": "http://media.pennlive.com/politics_impact/photo/18384092-thumb_square_large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, July 23, 2015, 11:31 AM", "article_author": "Sam Janesch | Special to PennLive", "Description": "A controversial meeting of the nation's lawmakers is happening this week in San Diego and government reform group Common Cause Pennsylvania is keeping tabs on what's on the agenda."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca593\"", "article_summary": "Another major conference for lawmakers, the National Conference of State Legislators, will convene Aug. 3 to Aug. 6 in Seattle, Washington.\nA controversial meeting of the nation's lawmakers is happening this week in San Diego and government reform group Common Cause Pennsylvania is keeping tabs on what's on the agenda.\nCommon Cause submitted a complaint to the Internal Revenue Service in 2012 and supplemental materials in recent years in an effort to increase ALEC's transparency.\nKauffman said the meetings and events held at the ALEC conference are activities defined as lobbying under Pennsylvania's lobbyist disclosure law but ALEC does not register or report to the state.\nIt was unclear on Thursday how many, if any, legislators would be attending that conference."}
