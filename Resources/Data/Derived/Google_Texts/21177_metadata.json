About 46,000 purchased plans directly from Highmark.\n\nHighmark is one of three carriers in the state to request rate increases of 10 percent or higher, which triggers a requirement in the Affordable Care Act that state officials conduct a review.\n\nGeisinger Health in Danville asked to boost rates by averages of 14.8 percent and 19.4 percent, according to filings with the insurance department. Independence Blue Cross in Philadelphia requested a 14.9 percent increase.\n\nThe department is not reviewing rates for UPMC Health Plan and Aetna, meaning any increases the companies might be planning would be less than 10 percent.\n\nAcross the country, insurers have been raising their exchange premiums.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers said this month that the average rate increase in 40 states where price information is available is 5.9 percent.\n\nBut the consulting and accounting firm cautioned that \u201cpremium prices vary significantly across states,\u201d ranging from a decrease of 22 percent to an increase of 35 percent.\n\nOpen enrollment on the federal exchange Healthcare.gov starts in less than four weeks, on Nov. 15. Premiums for 2015 have yet to be released. Officials in the state Department of Insurance were unable to say Wednesday when rates for Highmark and other insurers would be public.\n\nThe lack of information leaves people such as Tom Peters worried about how much he's going to have to pay to replace his canceled Highmark plan.\n\nThe 58-year-old from Ross was able to extend his policy for an extra year last fall even though it doesn't provide for all the 10 essential health benefits that Obamacare plans must cover.\n\nHe would prefer to keep what he has because the plan has a premium of about $288 a month and a deductible of $2,200. A Highmark plan that meets the health law's requirements was priced at about $290 a month this year but carried a $6,300 deductible, Peters said.\n\n\u201cIt's really good and has a lower deductible, that's what makes it attractive,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's why I'd like to keep it.\u201d\n\nLast fall, Highmark allowed about 140,000 of its individual members to extend their plans for an extra year rather than be forced into a health law-compliant one.\n\nBillger said the insurer is terminating four out of five of the extended plans, but he declined to say how many people were being canceled.\n\nTo keep the old policies viable, Billger said Highmark would have had to raise premiums significantly.\n\n\u201cThey would have been at the price of exchange products,\u201d he said. \u201cSo now they get richer benefits.\u201d\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
