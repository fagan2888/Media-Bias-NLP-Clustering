Jill Schupp of Creve Coeur, in the fall. Also running is Libertarian Jim Higgins.\n\nAshcroft's GOP rivals, Jack Spooner and Robb Hicks, have raised less money and have generally been ignored by major Republican figures.\n\nControl of the Missouri Senate doesn\u2019t rest on who wins the 24th District in St. Louis County, which takes in much of the county's central turf from Creve Coeur to Chesterfield. But that isn\u2019t stopping the two major parties from pulling out the stops to help their preferred candidate to win a contest that could send a political signal statewide.\n\nThe Republican contest is a vigorous one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running ads like this to let people know where I stand, so they can make a good decision,\u2019\u2019 said Ashcroft, a lawyer and engineer who lives in unincorporated St. Louis County between Creve Coeur and Maryland Heights.\n\nAshcroft, 41, is the son of John Ashcroft, who held four statewide offices in Missouri \u2013 including governor and U.S. senator \u2013 before becoming the U.S. attorney general under President George W. Bush.\n\nCandidate Ashcroft allows that he talks to his father regularly. His mother, Janet Ashcroft, already has donated at least $30,000 to her son\u2019s campaign.\n\nAlthough he goes by \"Jay Ashcroft,'' he's listed on the ballot as \"John R. Ashcroft.\"\n\nAshcroft is touting support from a number of major Republican officials and donors -- such as U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, former Gov. Christopher \u201cKit\u201d Bond and wealthy business magnate Sam Fox -- who see the younger Ashcroft as their best hope for keeping the 24th District in Republican hands.\n\nThe latest campaign-donation figures show Ashcroft raising $239,111 all told, compared to $160,969 for Spooner and $51,125 for Hicks. More significantly, Ashcroft still has $208,249 in the bank \u2013 more than Hicks and Spooner combined.\n\nSchupp, who has the backing of most of Missouri\u2019s major Democrats, has amassed $459,287 in the bank as she waits to see which Republican she\u2019ll face in the fall. \u201cI am standing by and watching what they do,\u201d she said.\n\nSchupp notes that she is continuing with lower-profile campaigning, such as going door-to-door, and preparing for the politicking that will dominate the contest this fall.\n\nThe 24th District currently is represented by Republican John Lamping, who unexpectedly captured the post during the 2010 GOP wave, when the 24th District was even more Democratic than it is now. (Redistricting changed the legislative boundary lines in 2011.)\n\nBut Lamping isn\u2019t running for re-election, largely for family reasons, which explains the bipartisan frenzy over his seat.\n\nHow conservative is the 24th district?\n\nSome area activists in both parties said that Lamping had been veering to the right since his election and might be too conservative for the district. But at least two of the Republican challengers appear to be as conservative as Lamping.\n\nAshcroft, Spooner and Hicks say they oppose the proposed \u201cCommon Core\u2019\u2019 standards for education, are leery of any expansion of Medicaid, and embrace fiscal policies that they say will encourage job growth.\n\nJay Ashcroft\u2019s views on economic, governmental and social issues are generally in line with those of his conservative father. He believes in less government, lower taxes and has been endorsed by Missouri Right to Life, the state\u2019s largest anti-abortion group.\n\n\u201cThis ad embodies the key issue both in the primary and in the general election,\u2019\u2019 Ashcroft said. \u201cThis idea that far too often government, trying to be helpful and trying to do good things, gets involved in areas where it just gets in the way of people being able to live their lives the way they want to.\u201d\n\nOverall, Ashcroft said, his philosophy boils down to \u201cyou should do what you want to do as long as you\u2019re not hurting someone else.\u201d\n\nRegarding abortion and reproductive issues, Ashcroft said his views partially reflect his personal experience. He has a son who was born at 25 weeks \u2013 that\u2019s about 15 weeks earlier than the average 40-week pregnancy.\n\nSpooner, also an attorney, says his \u201ccore philosophy\u2019\u2019 is in line with the Republican Party. But that said, Spooner observed in a recent interview that \u201cI do tend to be more of a \u2018centrist\u2019 than a \u2018rightist.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more of an issue-driven person,\u2019\u2019 Spooner said.\n\nHicks says his key pitch to voters is \u201cpreserving our freedom from a bloated government.\u201d\n\nA physician, Hicks is particularly critical of the federal Affordable Care Act \u2013 also known as Obamacare. He said he purchased insurance on the exchange created by the law. He said he recently learned that he can no longer go to his preferred physician.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a constitutional conservative,\u2019\u2019 Hicks said. \u201cI believe we need to preserve our Second Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nThe victor is expected to portray Schupp as a liberal because she backs Medicaid expansion, opposed the tax-cut package passed last session and supports reproductive rights. Schupp believes her views are more in tune with the district and welcomes any comparison with whoever wins the Republican primary.\n\nSt. Louis Public Radio reporter Jason Rosenbaum contributed information for this article.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "Jay Ashcroft\u2019s life is steeped in politics, even if he\u2019s never run for political office before.
