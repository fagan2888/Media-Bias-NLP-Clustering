I hope to God this doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cObama exhaled heavily when he learned the news. He was stunned, then angry, then disappointed, then hurt. \u2018I can\u2019t believe this,\u2019 Obama said. \u2018This is exactly what I said couldn\u2019t happen.\u2019 Obama was in the Oval Office \u2026 and being told that his list had leaked. The details came from Plouffe and [Jim] Messina, who had learned that two authors [Halperin and Heilemann] \u2026 knew all about the extraordinary session six weeks earlier; they had the whole roster of Obama\u2019s regrets in copious detail. \u2018How could someone do this to me?\u2019 Obama asked. \u2018If I can\u2019t be honest with you people, how can we keep having these meetings?\u2019 \u2026 [T]he next session was scheduled to start in a few minutes \u2026 The group was assembling in the Roosevelt Room \u2026 Maybe they should just cancel the thing, shut it down? No, Obama said. I want to go in there and say my piece. \u2026 He walked into the room looking stern \u2026 and then laid into his team.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWhen we started having these meetings, Obama said, I told you that I trusted everyone in this room. But now somebody has betrayed that trust. \u2026 [U]nless and until the person who did this comes to me, tells me they did this, and apologizes, these meetings are over. I\u2019m gonna be in the Oval Office. When somebody is ready to come forward and own up to this, you know where to find me. With that, Obama stood up and walked out the door, leaving a crashing silence behind him.\u201d No one did, and the inner circle shrunk markedly.\n\nMORE NUGGETS from \u201cDouble Down\u201d:\n\n--Obama \u201cand Michelle were both avid consumers of political commentary. Here habit was cable, and especially \u2018Morning Joe.\u2019 (She watched the show religiously while working out, then fired off agitated e-mails to [Valerie] Jarrett about what this or that talking head had said.) \u201d\n\n--Dan \u201cPfeiffer was \u2026 droll, acerbic, faintly cynical, and whip smart. \u2026 Pfeiffer \u2026 pounded out a memo with various [options]. More off-the-record briefings \u2026 More outreach to liberal columnists, bloggers, and the talking heads at MSNBC. \u2026 \u2018We could do all those things, but part of this is about strategic choices.,\u201d Pfeiffer told Obama. We made a strategic choice that we were gonna portray you, because you are, as reasonable. But in today\u2019s media environment, there is no caucus for reasonableness, with the possible exception of David Brooks. And there is no communications strategy that will make David Brooks and Paul Krugman like the same thing. So you\u2019re gonna have to choose.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cObama and Clinton convened on the first tee at Andrews \u2026 Obama intent on playing the game, getting up and down; Clinton cracking jokes and yakking, taking mulligan after mulligan. \u2026 When Clinton came off the course, he was asked by an aide how it went. Obama grimaced and replied, \u2018I like him \u2026 in doses.\u2019\u201d\n\n--\u201cUntil [the] Denver [debate debacle], Clinton had watched in wonder as Obama caught break after break. \u2026 Meanwhile, Romney\u2019s ineptness staggered Clinton. After the release of the 47 percent video, he remarked to a friend that, while Mitt was a decent man, he was in the wrong line of work. (\u2018He really shouldn\u2019t be speaking to people in public.\u2019) As for Obama, Clinton trotted out for his pals the same line again and again: \u2018He\u2019s luckier than a dog with two dicks.\u2019\u201d\n\n--In the staff hold room at Obama\u2019s second debate camp, at the Kingsmill resort in Williamsburg, \u201cThe full transcript [of the camp\u2019s first mock debate, in which Obama\u2019s \u2018emotional flatness from \u2026 Denver was back\u2019] \u2026 became a source of gallows humor. As the clock ticked well past midnight, Favreau stagily read aloud some of Obama\u2019s most dreadful answers. Soon his colleagues joined in, with [David] Axelrod, [Joel] Benenson, and Plouffe offering recitations and laughing deliriously over the absurdity and horror of the circumstances. \u2026 Every day, \u2026 the team had put Obama in front of a video monitor. Every day they explained what he needed to do to improve. Every day he said, \u2018I got it.\u2019 But apart from momentary flashes of adequacy, nothing had changed.\u201d\n\n--Robert \u201cBarnett and others believed that Obama\u2019s playbook needed to be stripped down more dramatically \u2026 Klain agreed and wanted to go further. In 1996, Democratic strategist Mark Penn had devised something called \u2018debate-on-a-page\u2019 for Gore in his VP face-off with Jack Kemp. \u2026 Klain \u2026 presented Obama with his debate-on-a-page: MUST REMEMBER 1. (Your) Speed Kills (Romney) 2. Upbeat and Positive in Tone 3. Passion for People and Plans 4. OTR [Off the Record] Mindset \u2013 Have Fun 5. Strong Sentences to Start and End 6. Engage the Audience 7. Don\u2019t Chase Rabbits BEST HITS 1. 47% 2. Romney + China Outsourcing \u2026 4. 9-11 Girl 5. Sketchy Deal \u2026 REBUTTAL CHEAT SHEET 1. Jobs \u2013 The 1 point plan \u2026 8. Gridlock \u2013 Romney brings the lobbyist back 9. Benghazi \u2013 Taking offense.\u201d\n\n--\u201cThat the intervention had had some effect on Obama was immediately apparent \u2026 He brought a new energy and focus to his afternoon drills. \u2026 [H]e refused even brief breaks for a walk by the river. As the afternoon went on, the debate team concocted cutesy catchphrases to cue him at the slighted hint of backsliding. \u2018Fast and hammy! Fast and hammy!\u2019 Klain would say when his delivery was too lugubrious. \u2018Punch him in the face!\u2019 Karen Dunn chipped in when he missed a chance to cream Kerry-as-Mitt.\u201d Amazon.com pre-order: $20.07 hardcover, $11.99 Kindle, $26.96 audiobook CD http://goo.gl/oxpGMU\n\nVEEP FRENZY --N.Y. Times A15, with A1 tease, \u201cBook Details Obama Aides\u2019 Talks About Replacing Biden on 2012 Ticket,\u201d by Jonathan Martin: \u201cThe idea of replacing Mr. Biden with Mrs. Clinton \u2026 was pushed by the chief of staff at the time, William M. Daley \u2026 In a phone interview on Thursday, Mr. Daley acknowledged that he had wanted to research what the move would have meant for Mr. Obama, whose popularity, in the fall of 2011, was at its lowest in his presidency to date. He called it simply \u2018due diligence. \u2026 I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them \u2026 You have to remember, at that point the president was in awful shape, so we were like, \u2018Holy Christ, what do we do?\u2019\u201d http://goo.gl/RpY1w8\n\n--Daley pushed back on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d: \u201cNot for a moment was there a serious discussion or a belief that Joe Biden should be replaced. Period. That doesn\u2019t mean issues were not looked at \u2026 This is a little bit of an overhype \u2026 Any research that was done confirmed the fact that this was not an issue that the voters cared about or thought that should be done, and the president, in my opinion, believed then, and I believe now, not for a moment would he have ever considered that.\u201d \u2013Tal Kopan\n\nROLLOUT --FIRST TV INTERVIEW: Monday on \u201cToday\u201d \u2013 NBC release: \u201cSavannah Guthrie will sit down with \u2026 Mark Halperin and John Heilemann live in Studio 1A \u2026 Guthrie will get their unique insights on the biggest news revealed in the book and discuss their personal experiences reporting and writing this narrative over the past several years.\u201d\n\n--@MarkHalperin tweeted a pic of Savannah reading the book. http://goo.gl/cmgGFG \u2026 PLAYBOOK EXCLUSIVE: Here\u2019s Fergus, Heilemann\u2019s Blue Great Dane (a.k.a., the mayor of Williamsburg, Brooklyn) doubling down. http://goo.gl/VJyoD0\n\n** A message from GE: Manufacturing is essential to growing local economies and maintaining America\u2019s competitive advantage in advanced manufacturing.

MENDING FENCES \u2013 Secretary of State John Kerry admits some spying has \u201creached too far inappropriately\u201d \u2013 Remarks via videoconference yesterday to the Open Government Partnership Annual Summit, in London, released by State last night: \u201cThere is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening, in many ways, on an automatic pilot because the technology is there \u2026 We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we\u2019ve been able to learn ahead of time of the plans. I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process, but there\u2019s an effort to try to gather information. And yes, in some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately. \u2026\n\n\u201c[O]ur President \u2026 is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse. \u2026 Just the other day \u2026 there was news in the papers of 70 million people [French conversations] being listened to. No, they weren\u2019t. It didn\u2019t happen. There\u2019s an enormous amount of exaggeration in this reporting from some reporters out there. What we\u2019re trying to do is in a random way find ways of trying to learn if, in fact, there is a threat that we need to respond to. And in some cases, I acknowledge to you, as has the President, that some of these actions have reached too far, and we are going to make sure that does not happen in the future.\u201d Transcript http://goo.gl/3UnYEo\n\nCLICK DU JOUR \u2013 Bloomberg Businessweek cover shows a photo of President Obama, failing to load: \u201cCrashed \u2026 One year \u2013 and one epic fail \u2013 into his second term, Barack Obama needs a reboot.\u201d EZRA KLEIN has the cover essay, \u201cHow the iPod President Crashed\u201d: \u201cThe disastrous launch of healthcare.gov \u2026 has dealt a devastating blow to Obama\u2019s vision. In the months leading up to the Oct. 1 rollout of the site, the president rarely compared his signature policy achievement to Medicare or Social Security. Instead, he favored analogies to e-commerce sites such as Orbitz, Travelocity, and Expedia. Obamacare was supposed to be the model for a 21st century social program, not a replica of programs built in the 20th. Now Republicans are seizing on the breakdown of the health exchange to reinforce the idea that government can\u2019t do anything right\u2014particularly not anything of this size. \u2026\n\n\u201cEven Obama\u2019s allies acknowledge that the healthcare.gov debacle could do damage beyond the health-care system. \u2026 Obama and the people around him \u2026 must force the rest of the federal bureaucracy to change. The iPod didn\u2019t negotiate with the other music players on the market\u2014it ruthlessly outcompeted them. The Obama administration needs to set that process loose in government, too. That begins with procurement reform, but it won\u2019t end until the White House is ready to take IT tasks away from agencies that can\u2019t handle them effectively and create a centralized IT group \u2026 We live in an age when machines can learn. Can government?\u201d See the cover. http://goo.gl/o9ZyL1 Read Ezra. http://goo.gl/NuP2RG\n\nNEWS YOU CAN USE \u2013 \u201cU.S. to allow expanded electronic device use on flights\u201d \u2013 Reuters: \u201cMobile phone calls remain barred \u2026 But fliers will be free to keep smartphones, tablets and e-readers running in \u2018airplane\u2019 mode. \u2026 Passengers will be able to connect with an airline's WiFi network and can use Bluetooth accessories \u2026 A big winner from the change could be Gogo Inc, whose shares closed 4.5 percent higher. The company supplies Internet service to about 80 percent of U.S. aircraft. \u2026 [T]he current policy was put in place about 50 years ago.\u201d\n\n--\u201cAirlines jockey for front of the gadget line,\u201d by Kathryn A. Wolfe, with Scott Wong: \u201cThe FAA\u2019s announcement that it\u2019s loosening the restrictions on in-flight electronic devices served as a starting gun for the airlines, with JetBlue and Delta being the most aggressive. JetBlue predicted it may be able to start allowing its passengers to play music and games through all phases of flight the same day \u2026 Delta, which claimed to be the first airline to have its paperwork turned in to the FAA for approval, said it could allow its passengers to use their Kindles and iPads all flight as soon as [today]. American Airlines \u2026 said it plans to submit its paperwork on Friday for its mainline fleet, while its regional partners could have their flights approved by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nBUZZ \u2013\u201cHartley Said to Be Top Candidate for U.S. Ambassador to France,\u201d by Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Sobczyk: \u201cJane Hartley, a fundraiser for President Obama and co-founder of the economic and political advisory firm Observatory Group LLC, is the leading candidate to be nominated as U.S. ambassador to France [and Monaco] \u2026 Hartley, 63, would replace Charles Rivkin, another Obama fundraiser who the president has nominated to become assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs \u2026 Hartley raised at least $500,000 for Obama's 2012 re- election campaign \u2026 [H]er husband, Ralph Schlosstein, [is CEO] of Evercore Partners \u2026 Avenue Capital Group LLC co-founder Marc Lasry had been the leading candidate for the Paris posting. He told clients of the distressed-debt firm in April that he would stay [in] New York.\u201d\n\nCONFIRMATION WAR \u2013 \u201cSenate talks going nuclear,\u201d by Burgess Everett, with John Bresnahan and Seung Min Kim: \u201cSenate Republicans held together to block two of President Obama\u2019s nominations to both the executive and judicial branches. The votes threatened to upend the relative peace that has taken hold in the Senate over the past few months since leaders agreed in July to not change the chamber\u2019s rules by a majority vote \u2014 the \u2018nuclear option\u2019 \u2014 to make it harder for the minority to block executive nominations. Senate liberals \u2014 who have long pressed their leadership to rewrite the rules to allow nominations to pass with a simple majority \u2014 pointed to Thursday\u2019s votes as yet another reason to eliminate 60-vote thresholds on procedural votes for nominees. The chamber voted 56-42 to block Rep. Mel Watt\u2019s (D-N.C.) nomination to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency \u2014 a rare rebuke to a sitting lawmaker. Patricia Millett\u2019s nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals was stopped in a 55-38 vote. \u2026\n\n\u201c[L]eadership is taking a wait-and-see approach before again throwing the Senate into a chaotic battle over the filibuster, which consumed the chamber in July. But there may even more pressure to consider filibuster reform in the coming weeks, when tough votes loom over Obama\u2019s nominees to head the Federal Reserve, the Homeland Security Department as well as two additional D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals judges. \u2026 The GOP blocked Watt\u2019s nomination because they saw him as a political pick, rather than a housing policy expert. Republicans objected to Millett because they believe the court has a minimal workload and they were worried that Obama is trying to stack the 11-seat bench ideologically.\u201d http://goo.gl/bcu1zn\n\nTOP TALKER \u2013 \u201cObamacare enrollments got off to very slow start, documents show,\u201d by Sharyl Attkisson on the \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d: \u201cEarly enrollment figures are contained in notes from twice-a-day \u2018war room\u2019 meetings convened within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services after the website failed on Oct. 1. They were turned over in response to a document request from the House Oversight Committee. The website launched on a Tuesday. Publicly, the government said there were 4.7 million unique visits in the first 24 hours. But at a meeting Wednesday morning, the war room notes say \u2018six enrollments have occurred so far.\u2019 \u2026 By Wednesday afternoon, enrollments were up to \u2018approximately 100.\u2019\n\n\u201cBy the end of Wednesday, the notes reflect \u2018248 enrollments\u2019 nationwide. The health care exchanges need to average 39,000 enrollees a day to meet the goal of seven million by March 1. The war room notes give a glimpse into some of the reasons customers had problems [including] \u2018confusion with credit check information\u2019 \u2026 The notes leave no doubt that some enrollment figures, which the administration has chosen to keep secret, are available. \u2026 Contractor \u2018QSSI has a daily dashboard created every night.\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201c[An HHS] spokesman suggested the numbers obtained by CBS News may not include all the different ways to enroll, such as paper applications. The spokesman also said that enrollment figures in Massachusetts' health care plan started off negligible but then skyrocketed as a deadline neared.\u201d Video and documents http://goo.gl/kPLIKW\n\n--MARKETING DOLLARS BEING HELD BACK -- Anna Palmer and Jonathan Allen: \u201cThere\u2019s no point in an ad blitz directing people to sign up on a website that doesn\u2019t work. And while advocacy groups say they had always planned to spend more money on the back end to boost enrollment in lagging states at the end of this year and early next year, \u2026 [t]he website bomb is more than just an inconvenience for the groups \u2026 The ad effort is an integral part of the plan to sign up enough people -- particularly the \u2018young invincibles\u2019 so critical to making the law\u2019s exchanges a success \u2026 The pro-Obamacare interest groups have been holding back, according to White House and insurance industry sources \u2026 \u2018There was definitely a pullback,\u2019 said one health insurance company executive \u2026 The groups had also been planning to reserve some money so they could focus on states with lagging enrollment \u2026 But the combination of factors means there\u2019s still a lot of more money than expected sitting on the sidelines \u2026\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration isn\u2019t just leaving the PR campaign to third party groups. In July, HHS inked a $33 million contract with PR giant Weber Shandwick. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid had already signed a $3 million and $8 million contracts. Porter Novelli also has a $20 million contract with the agency.\u201d http://goo.gl/1rwmKT\n\n--TODD S. PURDUM, \u201cThe Obamacare sabotage campaign \u2026 calculated sabotage by Republicans at every step\u201d: \u201c[S]ome states refused to do anything at all to educate the public about the law. And congressional Republicans sent so many burdensome queries to local hospitals and nonprofits gearing up to help consumers \u2026 The conservative battle against the Affordable Care Act continues \u2026 in the courts. A federal district court judge in Washington last week denied the government\u2019s motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by individuals and businesses from six states. The suit, coordinated by the Washington-based Competitive Enterprise Institute, challenges an IRS ruling that people can get tax credits to subsidize insurance in the federal-run exchanges, not just the state-based ones. Knocking out those subsidies would be a huge blow to the heart of Obamacare \u2026 Similar cases are pending in other states.\u201d http://goo.gl/uvc5oj\n\nTUESDAY\u2019S RACES \u2013 \u201cLiberal billionaires spend big in 2013 elections,\u201d by Alexander Burns and Maggie Haberman: \u201cDemocrats and liberal interest groups spent much of 2012 bemoaning an avalanche of outside spending from billionaires on the right, warning that ideological tycoons like the Koch brothers and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson could threaten the legitimacy of the American electoral system. \u2026 In the off-year campaigns of 2013, liberal and Democratic interests have enjoyed a decisive advantage in the billionaire spending bracket. Indeed, groups tied to just three liberal-leaning billionaires \u2013 New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, California investor Tom Steyer and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg \u2013 have spent well over $25 million this year pushing progressive candidates and causes. Their arrival on the political scene, at the same time as many conservative donors remain disheartened from the GOP\u2019s 2012 defeat, represents a shift in power in the arena of big-money campaigns. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe left\u2019s swift embrace of outside money is both disheartening to campaign finance reformers and maddening to Republicans, who argue that the media and political community hold wealthy progressives to a different standard than donors like the Kochs. Democratic strategist Chris Lehane, Steyer\u2019s top adviser, predicted that more liberal super-donors would come forward over the next election cycle \u2026 [In Virginia,] Bloomberg\u2019s Independence USA PAC is on track to spend $3 million by Election Day targeting the Republican candidates for governor and attorney general on the issue of gun control. Steyer, a hedge fund executive, has spent millions through the group NextGen Climate Action on digital and turnout programs \u2026 FWD.us \u2013 which receives a majority of its funding from Zuckerberg \u2013 has put about $15 million into advocating for comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d http://goo.gl/VNx5Ws\n\n--AIR WAR \u2013 \u201cMcAuliffe seeks to win race that eluded him before,\u201d by AP\u2019s Philip Elliott in Harrisonburg, with Steve Szkotak in Richmond: Democrat Terry \u201cMcAuliffe \u2026 is outspending [Republican Ken] Cuccinelli by \u2026 25-to-1 \u2026 on \u2026 TV \u2026 this week. \u2026 Outside groups, including Planned Parenthood, the labor unions AFSCME and the United Steelworkers, have stepped in with tons more \u2026 Mayor Michael Bloomberg is spending more than $1 million on ads criticizing Cuccinelli's support for gun rights, and California billionaire Tom Steyer has spent more than $2.4 million on ads criticizing Cuccinelli's environmental record.\u201d\n\nMEDIAWATCH \u2013 BETSY OUT OF THE FISHBOWL -- Dylan Byers: \u201cBetsy Rothstein \u2026 has resigned as editor of \u2026 [the media gossip website] Fishbowl DC. \u2018Whether raging waters or smooth sailing, my 3 years at FishbowlDC have been the perfect storm.

Contributor Peter Ogburn also left the site on Thursday; Eddie Scarry, another writer, decamped to The Blaze months earlier. Chris Ariens, the vice president of Mediabistro, declined to comment. Under Rothstein, Fishbowl DC became a gossip hub for media's 20- and 30-somethings, many of whom visited the site fearing rather than hoping that they would see their names in print.\u201d\n\n--N.Y.

Assembly mischief-makers and Senate backroom deal-makers, look out.

She has also written for other sections of the paper: Earlier this year, for Sports, she spearheaded an investigation into judging conflicts at the Westminster Dog Show, and in 2011 she was on the scene for Metro when Tropical Storm Irene ripped through upstate New York.\n\n\u201cPrior to landing at The Times, Sue worked at The Wall Street Journal, where she covered Wall Street for more than a decade. During that time she was a lead reporter in a package of stories on the financial crisis and the collapse of Lehman Brothers that was a finalist for a 2009 Pulitzer. However, she is perhaps best known at The Journal for her investigation into gift-giving on Wall Street, a series of stories that culminated with an article on a lavish stock trader's bachelor party, complete with dwarf-tossing. When Sue came to me and expressed an infectious interest in covering Albany in all its \u2018unvarnished\u2019 glory, I could hardly believe my \u2014 or Metro's \u2014 good fortune. Her excitement in diving into this world of characters, and dubious dealing, and dysfunction, and sometimes even governing, reminded me just how fascinating it all really is. \u2026\n\n\u201cBut Metro's good fortune is BizDay's bittersweet day, so let me hand off for a moment to [Business Editor] Dean Murphy: \u2026 \u2018It's World Series time, so forgive the sports analogy, but when Sue came to BizDay three years ago, she was what sports teams call a franchise hire. She proved that with her very first story, a Page 1 takeout on partners at Goldman Sachs being pushed from the bank's cherished inner circle .. [I]t is with great delight we await her dispatches from Albany. That will be a captivating spectator sport.\u2019 Sue has also worked at The Globe and Mail and The Financial Post. A native of Canada, she is looking forward to being three hours closer to her homeland. Craig, McKinley and Kaplan are something akin to a dream team. It's going to be a big, hotly competitive year on Albany. \u2026 Sue starts \u2026 Jan. 1.\u201d\n\nSPORTS BLINK \u2013 COLLEGE BASKETBALL -- \u201cKentucky is No. 1 in preseason poll,\u201d by AP Basketball Writer Jim O\u2019Connell: \u201cKentucky and its roster full of high school All-Americas is the narrow choice over Michigan State in The Associated Press' preseason college basketball poll.

Andrew Wiggins has Kansas fans harking back to the days when Danny Manning led the Jayhawks to the national championship. Chicago native Jabari Parker will fit smoothly into Duke's offense which this season promises to be a lot more uptempo.\u201d\n\n--WORLD CHAMPION BOSTON RED SOX \u2013 Boston Globe, A1 teases: \u201cRolling rally for Sox: The champions will mount the duck boats at Fenway Park and parade through the city on Saturday\u201d \u2026 \u201cEyes on \u201914 already: Free agency could change the Red Sox roster and the team\u2019s winning chemistry.\u201d\n\nBIRTHDAYS: Chairman Darrell Issa \u2026 Ali Ahmad, senior communications advisor at House Oversight Committee (hat tip: Becca) \u2026 Alex Byers (h/t Lauren French) \u2026 Peter Newell (h/t Christina Bellantoni) \u2026 Leslie Pollner, former Los Angeles deputy mayor for federal affairs (hubby tip: Noam) \u2026 David Bossie ...
