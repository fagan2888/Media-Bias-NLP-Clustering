While I News 9’s Meteorologist Matt Mahler can't promise full sun and perfect temperatures like we had last Saturday, he says at least we'll have 70’s again this Saturday.

There’s a low chance for widely scattered showers and maybe an isolated storm Saturday afternoon. Nothing crazy expected and Oklahoma needs the rain.

Sunday evening and night into Monday, Oklahomans will see a big uptick in rain and storm chances. The best opportunity for strong to severe thunderstorms will be overnight Sunday into Monday, mainly a hail and wind threat. As per usual, the tornado threat is low but not zero.

The News 9 weather team will be watching. Stay tuned!
