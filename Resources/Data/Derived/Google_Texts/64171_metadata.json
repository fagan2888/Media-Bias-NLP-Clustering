I pass the piece on given interest in Gregory\u2019s work among First Things\u2019 readership and Ephraim Radner\u2019s review of it in First Things\u2019 pages.\n\nRadner faulted Gregory\u2019s work for failing to identify a failure of love as a root cause of the fracturing of Western Christianity that is the Reformation. Pfau is much more appreciative of much of Gregory\u2019s work (\u201ca book whose courage and ambition I applaud, if for no other reason than that it exemplifies what an engaged form of historiography [and humanistic inquiry more generally] can and should do\u201d); what makes his piece especially worthwhile is its trenchant engagement with critics of Gregory\u2019s work and their often uncritical allegiance to the modernity of the modern academy. For those interested in Gregory\u2019s book, the emergence of modernity, and the modern academy, Pfau\u2019s piece is well worth reading.
