John Kasich has kept up his viability as a prime-time debate candidate -- a coveted position among the 17 Republicans running for their party's presidential nomination, because millions of viewers will likely tune in for the GOP debate at 9 p.m. Thursday in Cleveland.\n\nEven with several variables in play, Kasich as of now places at or near the bottom of the top 10 -- or 11 because of a tie in a new poll Sunday -- which is the number that debate sponsor Fox News wants to maintain on the Quicken Loans Arena stage.\n\nFox will hold a second televised forum, at 5 p.m. Thursday, for the candidates whose polling isn't strong enough to get them in the main event. | Read Stephen Koff's story\n\nFox News's Bret Baier interview: The debate, Donald Trump, candidate complaints (video)\n\nIf you watch the Republican presidential debate Thursday night, one of the first faces you'll see is Bret Baier's.\n\nBaier, 44 (he turns 45 Tuesday, sharing a birthday with President Barack Obama), is the square-jawed, athletic and golf-loving chief political anchor of Fox News and anchor of its nightly program, \"Special Report.\" Although not shy about interrupting in interviews when he believes a subject is filibustering, his manner leans toward steady and patient -- which could explain why he says his debate-moderator role model is Jim Lehrer of PBS.\n\nBaier will co-host the 9 p.m. debate with Fox's Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace. The Northeast Ohio Media Group sat down with him in his Washington, D.C., office to discuss the difference between fairness and equal time, controversies from past debates and what he expects from the crowded stage in Cleveland. | Read Stephen Koff's story | Read Andrew J.
