American Express and other traditional financial firms face competition from upstart payment systems.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a large population better served by something other than credit or charge cards,\u201d said Neal Sample, president of the Enterprise Growth group at American Express. For example, the group worked with Wal-Mart Stores to develop the Bluebird prepaid, reloadable card. It also created a digital wallet and peer-to-peer payment system, called Serve.\n\nThe company\u2019s lab of agile developers and designers works to adapt American Express products and services to new consumer devices, such as Google Glass and the Apple Watch. The lab also experiments with emerging technologies, doing mock-ups and prototypes to prove or disprove their theories. \u201cWe want to do the minimum amount of work to demonstrate whether a leap of faith to full development is worth taking,\u201d Mr. Sample said.\n\nFacial recognition technology is gathering support in the company\u2019s lab. David Baldie, director of technical delivery at American Express Enterprise Growth, has been testing with ways to capture and authenticate face images accurately and quickly on a mobile device. Facial recognition could be more secure than user names and passwords, Mr. Baldie said. A customer could use it when conducting sensitive transactions, such as money transfers, via mobile device.\n\nSeveral incremental challenges make the process difficult. Mr. Baldie found, for example, that users need visual cues on screen to help align the camera properly. Also, the authentication step of sending the image to a server to match it against stored files must be very fast and very accurate.\n\nThe technology is not ready for launch but it\u2019s far enough along that Mr. Sample and his team demonstrated a version to senior managers in March. \u201cIf we bring it forward, we would follow the full rigor of the development process,\u201d said Mili Doshi, director of mobile product development and innovation at American Express Enterprise Growth. That includes extensive risk and security review, she said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "AmEx\u2019s New York City lab is experimenting with ways to use facial recognition in conducting money transfers via a mobile device.", "title": "American Express Lab Testing Facial Recognition Technology", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/04/09/american-express-lab-testing-facial-recognition-technology/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HU900_0409_c_G_20150409175039.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "American Express Lab Testing Facial Recognition Technology", "description": "AmEx\u2019s New York City lab is experimenting with ways to use facial recognition in conducting money transfers via a mobile device.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Kim S.
