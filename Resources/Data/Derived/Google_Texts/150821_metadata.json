However, the lawsuit threat is the latest obstacle for a project that has been under consideration for four years and faced organized opposition because of building heights and other impacts, a lawsuit, a total redesign of the project and a long list of city conditions.\n\nIn March, the Planning Board approved 440 apartments in four buildings of six stories each, along with a parking garage for 800 vehicles and 87,000 square feet of retail space on Somerset Street. Both city officials and the developer had hoped to get the project underway this summer.\n\nDEMAND FOR HOUSING NOT AS DIRE\n\nThe developer inquired in mid-May about the possibility of building hotels. Federated\u2019s desire to convert two of those apartment buildings would result in the loss of 180 apartments, according to the June 18 letter from Greg Mitchell, the city\u2019s economic development director to Jonathan Cox, the Federated Cos. chairman.\n\nBack in 2011, Federated\u2019s project was poised to be the first major development of market-rate housing in Portland in roughly a decade. Since then, a tight housing market and vacancy rate near zero have spawned a slew of market-rate projects that have been proposed, approved and built or are under construction.\n\nWhile the desire for much-needed housing near downtown helped to build city support for the project, Cox said in his letter Friday that delays caused in part by the city meant that other housing developments have moved ahead at a faster pace to satisfy the market demand.\n\n\u201cThe demand which factored into this project\u2019s design and forecasting has been partially absorbed by a number of other projects which have sailed through the city\u2019s permitting process with little issue, while Federated has watched from the sideline,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFederated has not yet made an official proposal to change the land use. While several other housing projects have moved forward, Portland also has seen the construction of several new hotels in recent years.\n\nMitchell said in his letter that the change would require Federated to go before the Planning Board for another site plan review \u2013 an arena where the developer has faced stiff resistance in the past.\n\nMitchell also said that the purchase-and-sales agreement for the 3.5-acre city-owned parcel between Pearl and Elm streets had expired, and that the council would need to approve an extension.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding that fact, staff has no reason to believe that the city\u2019s commitment to selling the property to Federated has changed,\u201d Mitchell said. He later added, \u201cThe city remains committed to advancing the Midtown project.\u201d\n\nJessica Grondin, the city\u2019s communications director, said Friday that the sales agreement expired on May 27. She attributed the project\u2019s delays to the developer, saying they were slow to assemble a development team.\n\nHowever, Federated\u2019s chairman argued Friday that the sales agreement remains valid and that there was no expiration date in the agreement.\n\nCox threatened to sue the city unless it changes its position, because delays already have posed \u201csignificant obstacles and caused measurable detriment\u201d to getting the project underway this summer. His letter says the company has spent nearly $2 million \u201cin what appears to be a never-ending process of debating even the simplest matters while the city\u2019s wish list continues to grow and in a manner out of step with market realities.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, before the exchange of letters, Cox told the Press Herald that Federated was working with city staff to address the nearly 30 conditions that were placed on the project\u2019s approval. Once those were addressed, Cox said, the company would close on the sale and begin construction. He did not mention the prospect of hotels.\n\n\u201cWe are working with the city to satisfy the conditions (before) closing,\u201d Cox said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready, willing and able to close when those conditions have been met.\u201d\n\nPROJECT ENCOUNTERED MANY HURDLES\n\nFederated agreed to buy the city-owned land for $2.3 million in 2011. The following year, the city agreed to help finance the construction of a $15 million parking garage, which has not yet been built.\n\nThe proposal Federated unveiled in the fall of 2013 included four high-rise towers approaching 165 feet tall. The Planning Board and City Council agreed to rezone portions of the property to accommodate the tall buildings, which initially would have included 650-800 market-rate apartments and 100,000 square feet of retail space.\n\nIn January 2014, the Planning Board approved a master development plan for the phased development, which was expected to occur over the next decade, as well as the site plan approval for one high-rise tower at Somerset and Pearl and a parking garage. The approval came after six board workshops and two public hearings, which divided residents.\n\nShortly afterward, a group called \u201cKeep Portland Livable\u201d appealed the decision on the basis that it did not comply with the city\u2019s Comprehensive Plan.\n\nIn October 2014, Federated agreed to scale down the project to avoid a lawsuit. The new design eliminated a parking garage and 400 parking spaces, and lowered the building heights by about half to 72 feet. The remaining 92-foot tall parking garage became the tallest building in the development, which was expected to be built in one phase.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The developer objects after being told the purchase agreement for city-owned property earmarked for the project has expired.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The developer objects after being told the purchase agreement for city-owned property earmarked for the project has expired.", "title": "Portland threatened with lawsuit over latest 'midtown' project demands - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1090, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Midtown.jpg", "height": 680}, "updated_time": "2015-06-20T00:49:01-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/06/20/portland-threatened-with-lawsuit-over-latest-midtown-project-demands/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The developer objects after being told the purchase agreement for city-owned property earmarked for the project has expired.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Midtown.jpg", "title": "Portland threatened with lawsuit over latest 'midtown' project demands - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-06-20T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-20T00:49:01-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "While several other housing projects have moved forward, Portland also has seen the construction of several new hotels in recent years.\nBack in 2011, Federated\u2019s project was poised to be the first major development of market-rate housing in Portland in roughly a decade.\nBoth the developer and city officials say they continue to want the project to move forward.\nThis architect's rendering shows the design of Midtown Building 3 as submitted to the Portland Planning Board in March.\nIn October 2014, Federated agreed to scale down the project to avoid a lawsuit."}
