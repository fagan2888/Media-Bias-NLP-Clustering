But Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top Democrat on the budget committee, said it\u2019s important to counter the Republicans\u2019 proposal.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the Republican budget proposal is the wrong direction for America, but we also think it\u2019s important that we present an alternative that we believe reflects the priorities and values of the country,\u201d Van Hollen said during a conference call with reporters.\n\nOn education, the Democratic budget would increase investments in Head Start, which provides early childhood education to low-income children, as well as fund President Obama\u2019s proposal for universal preschool for children. It would also increase funding aimed at making college more affordable.\n\nPerhaps the starkest difference between the two proposals is in health care. While Republicans\u2019 budget fully repeals Obamacare, turns Medicare into a voucher program and cuts funding to Medicaid, the Democratic budget promotes Obamacare and maintains Medicare while promoting more efficiency, Van Hollen said.\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., complained that while the Affordable Care Act would be repealed in the GOP budget plan, Republicans \u201cdon\u2019t lay out any coherent alternative.\u201d\n\nThe parties also differ in their approach to defense spending, which has become one of the biggest question marks in the Republican budget. Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., kept military spending at $523 billion, the level mandated under automatic cuts known as sequestration, but increased allocations to a reserve fund known as Overseas Contingency Operations as a way to placate defense hawks pushing for increases. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., proposed an amendment to do the same in the Senate\u2019s budget.\n\nThe Democratic budget, however, would follow in Obama\u2019s footsteps and increase discretionary defense spending to $561 billion, a $38 billion increase over the sequester level. Obama has said that he will not sign a budget that doesn\u2019t increase both defense and non-defense spending and that goes about sequestration cuts equally. Democrats in the House proposed a $37 billion increase in non-defense spending over the sequester levels.\n\nUnlike the GOP budget, which Republicans say balances within a decade, the Democratic proposal would accrue nearly $6 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years, adding significantly to the national debt. Republicans\u2019 claim that their budget is balanced is \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d because it accounts for revenues from Obamacare but also repeals the Affordable Care Act entirely, Van Hollen said.\n\nWhile Democrats offered a liberal alternative to the Republican budget, a group of conservatives in the House released a proposal to the right of the official GOP plan. The Republican Study Committee, a caucus of House conservatives, released a proposal that would reduce spending by $7.1 trillion over a decade and balance within just six years \u2013 four years faster than the Republican plan, with $1.6 trillion more in spending cuts.\n\n\u201cThis forward-looking document lays out a fresh, new vision for tackling some of Washington\u2019s top fiscal challenges, while introducing policies that will grow our economy and create more jobs and better paychecks for hard-working American taxpayers,\u201d RSC Chairman Bill Flores said in a statement.\n\nIn the Senate, Democrats decided against releasing an alternative budget, citing the amount of time that goes into crafting a proposal. Instead, they will push their policy priorities using the robust amendment process allowed during budget negotiations to offer a number of amendments. Several of those policies, including ending tax loopholes, increasing the minimum wage and providing paid sick leave, are part of the House Democrats\u2019 budget.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats in the House of Representatives on Monday released their budget proposal for fiscal year 2016, calling for spending increases and new taxes on the wealthy that stand in stark contrast to...", "title": "House Democrats Counter GOP Budget Plan | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/03/23/house_democrats_counter_gop_budget_plan_126018.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/289377_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Democrats in the House of Representatives on Monday released their budget proposal for fiscal year 2016, calling for spending increases and new taxes on the wealthy that stand in stark contrast to...", "title": "House Democrats Counter GOP Budget Plan | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "House Democrats Counter GOP Budget Plan | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,defense spending,House Democrats,House GOP,budget,Budget Committee,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "Several of those policies, including ending tax loopholes, increasing the minimum wage and providing paid sick leave, are part of the House Democrats\u2019 budget.\nWhile Democrats offered a liberal alternative to the Republican budget, a group of conservatives in the House released a proposal to the right of the official GOP plan.\nBut Rep.
