Last night, “Transparent” director Jill Soloway and star Jeffrey Tambor won awards for best episode directing and best comedic acting, respectively, and they used their acceptance speeches as opportunities to pay tribute to the transgender community.

Amazon’s “Transparent” centers around the experiences of Maura (born Mort) Pfefferman, a parent of three and grandparent who comes out as transgender. And as many Emmy voters learned last night, the story is based, in part, on the experience of Soloway, whose own transgender parent she, like the kids on the show, refers to as “Moppa.”

“My moppa, Carrie, she could, tomorrow, go and try to find an apartment and in 32 states, and it would be legal for the landlord to look her in the eye and say we don’t rent to trans people,” Soloway said, upon receiving her award for directing “Transparent’s” “Best New Girl” episode. “We don’t have a trans tipping point yet. We have a trans civil rights problem. So go transequality.org to pass the trans equality bill.”
