But he made clear he was formulating a presidential campaign that would tack to the left of the current field of Republican candidates.\n\nA managing director at Lehman Brothers before its collapse in 2008, Kasich, 62, lampooned Wall Street bankers in terms more usually associated with the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\u201cWall Street is necessary because it helps move the financial operations of America forward, but I\u2019ll tell you the problem with Wall Street: it is too much about \u2018I gotta make money\u2019,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cThere\u2019s too much greed. And that\u2019s just part of what happens there.\n\n\u201cI think on Wall Street most of the bankers have to fight off the concept of greed, because you know what they say all the time up there? They say, \u2018Am I going to get paid? What is my big bonus gonna be?\u2019 Nothing wrong with that. But here\u2019s the problem: if all you seek is money without values, then you\u2019re bankrupt.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo what I think is that our banking community needs to realise is there\u2019s a moral underpinning.\u201d\n\nI have more experience than any in the field. I don\u2019t just talk about what I would do. I talk about what I have done. John Kasich\n\nKasich has reportedly created New Day for America, a tax-exempt nonprofit \u2013 a precursor to the launch of the presidential exploratory committee that, one GOP source said, he will formally announce as soon as next week.\n\n\u201cI have more experience than anybody in the field,\u201d he told NBC. \u201cI don\u2019t just talk about what I would do. I can talk to people about what I have done.\u201d\n\nAsked about the comparison between his unsuccessful run against George W Bush in 2000 and the need to overcome the second Bush president\u2019s brother, Jeb Bush, this time around, Kasich quoted the baseball legend Yogi Berra: \u201cIt could be d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush is currently considered a frontrunner in the race, alongside Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. Yet neither has formally declared a presidential bid, and neither has succeeded in pulling away from a second-tier bunch of candidates including senators Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.\n\nKasich is a moderate figure cut from similar political cloth as Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey who is failing to revitalise his own presidential prospects and lags far behind in polls.\n\nAll of the above were in New Hampshire over Friday and Saturday, along with virtually every other Republican presidential hopeful. The contest is so crowded that few in the party can give a definitive answer about precisely how many presidential contenders there are \u2013 let alone name them all. There were, for example, 19 possible presidential contenders in Nashua for the Republican Leadership Summit. Most focused their fire on Hillary Clinton, the only declared Democratic candidate so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re blessed as Republicans; we have a strong field of quality people that are running,\u201d Rubio, the Florida senator who formally entered the race this week, told CBS on Sunday. \u201cThe Democrats are struggling to find one. We have eight or nine. And I think we are going to be a better party for it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Senator Marco Rubio, one of a number of stars in a crowded Republican field, speaks in New Hampshire.

He won re-election to the governor\u2019s mansion in Ohio last year with the kind of overwhelming majority rarely enjoyed in statewide elections.\n\nOhio is a crucial battleground state that has backed every successful presidential candidate since 1968. A fiscal hawk, Kasich has carved out a reputation as a pragmatist, even crossing the Rubicon for Republican governors to expand Medicaid subsidies under a provision of Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul attacks Clinton and names the enemy of the US \u2013 'radical Islam'\n\nSuch moves are akin to blasphemy among the party\u2019s conservative factions. When Kasich appeared at an event in Greenville, South Carolina, on Saturday, flyers were affixed to nearby vehicles warning: \u201cJohn Kasich Pushing Obama\u2019s Agenda.\u201d\n\nKasich, who said repeatedly over the weekend that his final decision over whether to run by president would be guided by God, appeared unperturbed by the attacks from the right of his party. Instead he warned against the influence of extremists in the party whom he called \u201cdividers\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople want to divide with fiery rhetoric and attacks and all of that,\u201d he told NBC. He added: \u201cI\u2019m not so much into the attack mode and all that other business. I\u2019m into solving problems.\u201d\n\nKasich added it was time to \u201cstop hanging out in our silos thinking that we\u2019ve got all the answers without realising that you can compromise without losing your principles\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Republican echoes Elizabeth Warren as he launches attack on big banks: \u2018If all you seek is money without values, then you\u2019re bankrupt\u2019", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Paul Lewis", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Republican echoes Elizabeth Warren as he launches attack on big banks: \u2018If all you seek is money without values, then you\u2019re bankrupt\u2019", "title": "Former Lehman Bros executive Kasich eyes 2016 and knocks Wall Street 'greed'", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/19/ohio-governor-john-kasich-wall-street-election-2016", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402695694230/7e568cc8-5191-4c83-ade6-8e3041625ffd-620x372.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=eb381206fc11fa38b69f56dadb8d4ea2", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/apr/19/ohio-governor-john-kasich-wall-street-election-2016?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/19/ohio-governor-john-kasich-wall-street-election-2016", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/apr/19/ohio-governor-john-kasich-wall-street-election-2016?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@PaulLewis", "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402695694230/7e568cc8-5191-4c83-ade6-8e3041625ffd-620x372.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/apr/19/ohio-governor-john-kasich-wall-street-election-2016?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US elections 2016,Republicans,US politics,Ohio,New Hampshire,US news,World news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-04-19T20:37:54.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paullewis", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2016-05-25T14:21:52.000Z", "tag": "US elections 2016,Republicans,US politics,Ohio,New Hampshire,US news,World news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402695694230/7e568cc8-5191-4c83-ade6-8e3041625ffd-620x372.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=12cff8dca1d8455ba014b41616a45a2b", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US elections 2016,Republicans,US politics,Ohio,New Hampshire,US news,World news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb801\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWall Street is necessary because it helps move the financial operations of America forward, but I\u2019ll tell you the problem with Wall Street: it is too much about \u2018I gotta make money\u2019,\u201d Kasich said.\n\u201cI think on Wall Street most of the bankers have to fight off the concept of greed, because you know what they say all the time up there?\nAll of the above were in New Hampshire over Friday and Saturday, along with virtually every other Republican presidential hopeful.\nA managing director at Lehman Brothers before its collapse in 2008, Kasich, 62, lampooned Wall Street bankers in terms more usually associated with the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren.\nBut he made clear he was formulating a presidential campaign that would tack to the left of the current field of Republican candidates."}
