Not exactly, but it\u2019s sure nice to know that even back in 1971, Richard Nixon agreed that homosexuality was an orientation people were born with. Still, in 2014, although countless individuals may share Nixon\u2019s belief, the question of whether sexual preference is a choice or biologically determined remains unanswered.\n\nIn The Words Of Former President Nixon, \u201cGays Are Born That Way\u201d\n\nWhite House tapes containing Nixon\u2019s take on homosexuality have recently emerged, and they depict the former president's beliefs as being quite forward for the time period, the New York Post reported. \u201cThey\u2019re born that way. You know that. That\u2019s all. I think they are. Anyway, my point is, though, when I say they\u2019re born that way, the tendency is there,\u201d Nixon is heard clearly saying in the conversation. However, before you get too excited at Nixon\u2019s gay revelation, soon afterward he blames homosexuality for the fall of the Greek and Roman empires. Former President Nixon is heard making statements such as, \u201cThe Greeks. And they had plenty of it,\u201d following comments by the former secretary of the state, Henry Kissinger, who said that \u201cThe Romans were notorious\u2026homosexuals.\u201d\n\nA Genetic Component?\n\nTwin studies have shown that sexual preference has a genetic component, The Huffington Post reported. Also, a gay man is more likely than a straight man to have a gay biological brother, just as lesbians are more likely than straight women to have gay sisters. \u201cSexual orientation has nothing to do with choice,\u201d Dr. Michael Bailey, a researcher in search of the controversial \u201cgay gene,\u201d told the Daily Mail. \u201cOur findings suggest there may be genes at play \u2014 we found evidence for two sets that affect whether a man is gay or straight.\u201d The Huffington Post also reported that the brains of gay men are visibly different from the brains of straight men. Unfortunately, human brains do not stop developing until an individual is in their mid-20s, so this cannot be taken as concrete evidence of nature vs. nurture.\n\nMixed With A Little Bit Of Environmental Factors\n\nWith just about every other aspect of human personality, however, a part of sexual preference may also be attributed to the environment. For example, in families where alcoholism is prevalent, it\u2019s not just genes that predispose children of alcoholics to drink excessively, but also their upbringing around parents who handle stress with alcohol. Upon entering adulthood, it is more likely that they would follow this practice than say, a child who grew up in a dry household. One could say the same with homosexual siblings. Rather than genes being a part of the picture it may be growing up with other homosexuals nearby.\n\nAt the end of the day, science can\u2019t really say for sure whether homosexuality is genetic or acquired. When it comes to some subjects, such as those we love, and why we love them, maybe science should just stay out of it altogether.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nixon, believed, gays, were, born, way, were, they, white, house, tapes, show, former, presidents", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The recent emergence of White House tapes reveals that back in 1971, former U.S. President Richard Nixon had some pretty interesting views on homosexuality.", "title": "Former President Nixon Believed Gays Were 'Born That Way,' But Were They?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nixon-believed-gays-were-born-way-were-they-white-house-tapes-show-former-presidents-cringeworthy", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/12/nixon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The recent emergence of White House tapes reveals that back in 1971, former U.S. President Richard Nixon had some pretty interesting views on homosexuality.", "title": "Former President Nixon Believed Gays Were 'Born That Way,' But Were They?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nixon-believed-gays-were-born-way-were-they-white-house-tapes-show-former-presidents-cringeworthy", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/12/nixon.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/12/nixon.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-12T17:17:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-12T17:17:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The recent emergence of White House tapes reveals that back in 1971, former U.S. President Richard Nixon had some pretty interesting views on homosexuality."}, "article_summary": "Still, in 2014, although countless individuals may share Nixon\u2019s belief, the question of whether sexual preference is a choice or biologically determined remains unanswered.\nFormer President Nixon is heard making statements such as, \u201cThe Greeks.\nAnyway, my point is, though, when I say they\u2019re born that way, the tendency is there,\u201d Nixon is heard clearly saying in the conversation.\nMixed With A Little Bit Of Environmental FactorsWith just about every other aspect of human personality, however, a part of sexual preference may also be attributed to the environment.\nTwin studies have shown that sexual preference has a genetic component, The Huffington Post reported."}
