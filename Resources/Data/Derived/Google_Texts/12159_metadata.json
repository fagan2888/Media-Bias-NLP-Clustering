I assume that\u2019ll change and he\u2019ll get some face time this a.m. too, if only to keep pace with everyone else. On top of Kasich\u2019s full-court press, Trump is slated for \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d \u201cState of the Union,\u201d and \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d while Ted Cruz is booked for \u201cThis Week\u201d and MTP as well. (Carly Fiorina, already one of Cruz\u2019s most prominent surrogates, will pinch hit for him on SOTU.) Maybe Rubio\u2019s better off skipping, though. His hosts would only want to talk about Trump and Chicago, Trump and Florida, Trump and a brokered convention, etc etc, anyway. What\u2019s left to say?\n\nBernie Sanders will be on various shows this morning, probably also to denounce Trump, but who cares? His odds at the nomination in his own party are probably no better than, say, Cruz\u2019s are in the GOP\u2019s. The full line-up is at the AP.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Crunch time.", "title": "Sunday morning talking heads", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/03/13/sunday-morning-talking-heads-3/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "cruz, Florida, GOP, kasich, republican, rubio, sanders, trump,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-13T12:01:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-12T16:22:20+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "His hosts would only want to talk about Trump and Chicago, Trump and Florida, Trump and a brokered convention, etc etc, anyway.\nBernie Sanders will be on various shows this morning, probably also to denounce Trump, but who cares?\nOn top of Kasich\u2019s full-court press, Trump is slated for \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d \u201cState of the Union,\u201d and \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d while Ted Cruz is booked for \u201cThis Week\u201d and MTP as well.\nHis odds at the nomination in his own party are probably no better than, say, Cruz\u2019s are in the GOP\u2019s.\nI assume that\u2019ll change and he\u2019ll get some face time this a.m. too, if only to keep pace with everyone else."}
