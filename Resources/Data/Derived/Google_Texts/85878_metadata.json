Many will decide to just stay where they are, which is bad for job growth and the economy in general.\u201d\n\nBusinesses who employ fewer than 50 full-time-equivalent employees have access to the Small Business Health Operations Program, SHOP, under the ACA. Companies with more than 50 full-time-equivalent employees have other regulations they must meet.\n\nEighteen percent of businesses indicated they had reduced workers\u2019 hours by decreasing the number of full-time employees and increasing the number of part-time employees.\n\n\u201cA lot of the stagnant economic growth and reduction in hiring is a result of this law,\u201d Archamault said. \u201cIt puts too heavy a burden on employers, and the average working man is paying, both figuratively and out of his own pocket.\u201d\n\nEmployers share stories of hour, employment cuts\n\nThe study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is only the latest piece of evidence that the employer mandate and other requirements of the Affordable Care Act is forcing employers to scale back hiring and reduce hours for employees.\n\nA survey in April 2013 by the Society for Human Resource Management found 41 percent of small businesses had put off hiring new employees, while 20 percent had cut hours and reduced payroll.\n\nThese studies come after several announcements by business owners that they would be forced to cut employee hours as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn October of 2012 Darden Restaurants, which operates Olive Garden and other restaurant chains, announced it would be experimenting with cutting employee hours to below the 30-hour per week threshold that would require them to offer health benefits. The move draw intense criticism and Darden later said it would not be cutting employee hours.\n\nSeveral other restaurant franchisees also announced they would have to cut employee hours. In an August 14, 2013 report by NBC News, several other small business owners shared they too would be cutting hours in response to the employer mandate.\n\n\u201cTo tell somebody that you\u2019ve got to decrease their hours because of a law passed in Washington is very frustrating to me,\u201d Loren Goodridge, who owns 21 Subway franchises, told NBC News.\n\nCutting employment and keeping quiet\n\nSmall businesses that have spoken publicly have faced an intense backlash among supporters of the law. Darden faced a firestorm of criticism after its announcement, and owners of Denny\u2019s, Papa Johns, and Applebee\u2019s franchises also endured negative attacks based on their business decisions to consider cutting hours.\n\nIn light of that backlash, health policy experts say employers who have to cut employee hours or jobs will simply keep quiet. \u201cGiven the way Obamacare supporters publicly criticized employers who announced that they were cutting back hours in response to the health care law, it would not surprise me if many employers are still doing so but not telling anyone about it,\u201d said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the free-market Cato Institute.\n\nBrady Cremeens writes for the Illinois News Network, where an earlier version of this article originally appeared.
