Because Stephanie Merrow is a gay woman. And she\u2019s a freelance drama coach at a Catholic school. One that just a few weeks ago parted ways with its vice principal \u2013 a gay man.\n\nMark Zmuda \u2014 who was not just an administrator but a teacher and coach at Washington state\u2019s Eastside Catholic High School \u2014 left his position on Dec. 20, when the archdiocese learned he\u2019d married his partner last summer. Zmuda unreservedly says he was let go, though school attorney Mike Patterson says instead Zmuda resigned. Patterson does, however, concede that school president Sister Mary Tracy \u201casked in a hypothetical fashion out of frustration\u201d whether Zmuda would consider divorcing his husband. In an interview with Catrina Crittenden, a 14-year-old school freshman, Zmuda said, \u201cApparently, the fact that I have a same-sex partner, they\u2019re against that. But I also thought a teaching they were against was divorce.\u201d\n\nZmuda is far from the only openly gay educator to find himself unemployed in the Catholic school system. Michael Griffin at Holy Ghost Preparatory School in Pennsylvania says he was fired in December after 12 years of service when he said he and his partner were applying for a marriage license. Last year Ohio teacher Carla Hale was fired from her school when she included her partner\u2019s name in her mother\u2019s obituary. And in California, St. Lucy\u2019s Priory High School canned Ken Bencomo when his wedding made the local newspaper. And what\u2019s especially galling about these petty, punitive acts is that in many cases, the teachers say the schools knew full well that they were gay. It was when they acknowledged it, when they exercised their right to marriage, that they were punished. The hypocrisy has not gone unnoticed.\n\nThe unflattering public spotlight on Eastside Catholic High School, and its clearly confused views on what constitutes a violation of its ethical standards (Marriage? Yes. Divorce? Maybe not so much) has clearly had a disruptive effect. On Monday, its board chair Gene Colin abruptly announced he was stepping down, saying he needed to \u201ctake a break.\u201dAnd parents and students were warned last week that any campus protests to the departure of Zmuda would result in students being sent home.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A lesbian teacher stays on in a school where a gay administrator was let go", "title": "A glimmer of hope for tolerance in Catholic schools", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A lesbian teacher stays on in a school where a gay administrator was let go", "title": "A glimmer of hope for tolerance in Catholic schools", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/08/a_glimmer_of_hope_for_tolerance_in_catholic_schools/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/stephanie_merrow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A lesbian teacher stays on in a school where a gay administrator was let go", "title": "A glimmer of hope for tolerance in Catholic schools", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/stephanie_merrow.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Catholic education, catholic schools, Catholicism, Gay Marriage, LGBT, Mark Zmuda, Marriage equality, Stephanie Merrow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8aef\"", "article_summary": "And she\u2019s a freelance drama coach at a Catholic school.\nThe unflattering public spotlight on Eastside Catholic High School, and its clearly confused views on what constitutes a violation of its ethical standards (Marriage?\nAnd in California, St. Lucy\u2019s Priory High School canned Ken Bencomo when his wedding made the local newspaper.\nBut I also thought a teaching they were against was divorce.\u201dZmuda is far from the only openly gay educator to find himself unemployed in the Catholic school system.\nTopics: Catholic education, catholic schools, Catholicism, Gay Marriage, LGBT, Mark Zmuda, Marriage equality, Stephanie Merrow, Life NewsThat Stephanie Merrow\u2019s employer says that she\u2019s welcome to go on doing her job, that her work status is not even an issue for discussion, made national news this week."}
