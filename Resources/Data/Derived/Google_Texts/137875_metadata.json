Thirteen states are increasing their minimums this year, and some Democrats believe raising the national minimum wage is a winning campaign issue for November.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that raising the minimum wage would reduce employment and slow economic growth. Worse, government wage-setting is immoral. It is unfair and wrong for politicians to posture as philanthropists while forcing other people to pay higher salaries.\n\nThe first question is the minimum\u2019s impact on employment and price levels. The answer is clear: the cost of higher wages will be borne in varying degrees by customers, workers, and investors. As I wrote in the American Spectator:\n\nas Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman observed, there ain\u2019t no such thing as a free lunch. Arbitrarily raising the cost of labor\u2014there is no principled basis for choosing any particular government minimum\u2014will increase prices, reduce investor returns, and cut employment levels.\n\nMost vulnerable are workers with the least education, experience, and skills, who tend to be young and minorities. Forcing up wages will not only reduce overall employment, but shift jobs toward higher-skilled workers who are more productive and thus warrant higher pay. The minimum wage also encourages mechanization, since it makes economic sense for companies to invest more in machines to spend less on labor.\n\nIn effect, the minimum wage is a tax on labor-intensive companies. No surprise, then, as explained by Mark Wilson of Applied Economic Strategies in a Cato Institute Policy Analysis: \u201cThe main finding of economic theory and empirical research over the past 70 years is that minimum wage increases tend to reduce employment.\u201d\n\nThe strangest claim may come from the Financial Times, which editorialized: \u201ca higher wage would stimulate the economy without adding a dime to federal spending.\u201d However, to the extent raising the minimum increases the total amount of wages, it does so by redistributing the money from other people, who end up with less to spend on consumption.\n\nNo doubt, the employment impact of a small increase, especially if salary levels have been rising, would be modest, which explains recent economic studies demonstrating lesser job loss. But the less significant the increase, the less meaningful any potential benefit.\n\nIn contrast, those who claim that raising today\u2019s minimum would have no impact on employer behavior fail to demonstrate the courage of their convictions. If government can hike wages without harm, why stop at $10 or $15 an hour? Why not go to $1000 or $1500? Then everyone in America could be rich at no cost to anyone!\n\nYet there is an even more fundamental issue. The minimum wage is the modern perversion of compassion into coercion: I believe there is a moral imperative for you to earn more, so I force someone else to pay more. I feel moral while sticking someone else with the bill.\n\nHowever, if \u201cwe,\u201d the citizens of America, believe people should earn more, then \u201cwe,\u201d the citizens of America, not a few labor intensive businesses, should pay for those above-market wages. Opposing the minimum wage is simple fairness.\n\nWhile many advocates no doubt are true believers, for some fairness talk is pure twaddle. John Cassidy wrote in the New Yorker: \u201cIn the current political environment, there is little chance of pushing through another hike in income-support programs. Raising the minimum wage pushes the burden onto corporations and consumers.\u201d\n\nWashington should be systematically reducing, not increasing, the cost of doing business. Yet the regulatory-happy Obama Administration has been imposing multiple burdens on commerce, starting with ObamaCare.\n\nThe next time someone rises to support arbitrary government wage-setting, they should be asked what they are doing personally to help the economically disadvantaged.
