In a statement to Isikoff, the White House acknowledged for the first time that the civilian-protecting restrictions on drone strikes President Obama announced to great fanfare last year were not being applied to its new anti-ISIS campaign in Iraq and Syria. Translated from the purposefully anodyne language of a statement to the press, the White House\u2019s message to civilians near ISIS targets was simple and clear: You\u2019re on your own.\n\nTo critics of U.S. policy in the greater Middle East, Yahoo!\u2019s report was an unwelcome confirmation of a nagging suspicion and fear. Namely, that Obama\u2019s 2013 drone speech \u2014 during which the president outlined a long list of reforms his administration would implement to the drone program \u2014 was little more than presidential lip service, and that the U.S. was still running its counterterrorism like a game of Calvinball, the imaginary sport from \u201cCalvin and Hobbes\u201d whose only real law is that player/creator Calvin gets to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants to do it.\n\nIt\u2019s no longer a surprise, of course, to find Obama upholding Bush\u2019s legacy on national security policies. What\u2019s troubling, though \u2014 and what the new war on ISIS has made even more clear \u2014 is that despite being nearly six years through the Obama era, our famously cautious, rational and legalistic president has done little to clean up and clarify the legal and political counterterrorism framework left to him by his predecessor. The war on terror is bigger and more entrenched than ever, and it\u2019s still being waged according to secret rules.\n\nFor experts in the field of human rights, the Yahoo! report was both disappointing and unsurprising, with some seeing it as just the latest manifestation of a dynamic that\u2019s been present throughout Obama\u2019s years in the White House. In conversations with Salon, members of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch shared concerns over the White House\u2019s statement to Yahoo!, but emphasized that they were unable to weigh in more authoritatively due to the administration\u2019s insistence on keeping secret much of the law supporting targeted killings and other uses of force against terrorist organizations.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re even having this conversation stems from the decision by the administration to not be clear about what law governs,\u201d said Human Rights Watch Deputy Washington Director Andrea Prasow after noting Obama\u2019s 2013 drone speech \u201cwas clearly policy, not law\u201d and therefore non-binding. \u201cThe Obama administration has used targeted killing in circumstances that may not be an armed conflict,\u201d Prasow said, \u201cand in those cases, human rights law is the law that governs. If the [ISIS] decision was to apply \u2026 to those situations,\u201d she continued, \u201cthe policy is illegal.\u201d\n\nIf all that sounds quite hypothetical, it\u2019s because it is. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if particular strikes are part of the armed conflict which Iraq requested the U.S. join, or if they\u2019re strikes against al Qaeda as part of the administration\u2019s claim that it\u2019s in an armed conflict with al Qaeda and its \u2018associated forces\u2019 around the world,\u201d Prasow said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know how to analyze [drone strikes] and how to figure out which law governs. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s actually happening.\u201d The president\u2019s 2013 address was supposed to answer many of these questions and provide greater. It hasn\u2019t.\n\nAmnesty International Senior Policy Adviser Avner Gidron\u2019s read on the situation is much the same. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit skeptical about these really rigorous standards that they [supposedly] apply to drone attacks in the first place,\u201d Gidron said. And because the administration never followed-through on its 2013 promises, Gidron noted,\u201d it\u2019s impossible for us to even assess\u201d whether their actions against ISIS are a clear deviation from what they were doing before. \u201cBecause of the complete lack of transparency,\u201d Gidron said, \u201cit\u2019s impossible \u2026 to assess whether this policy about drone strikes is actually being applied to those situations where they said it would apply.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our latest bombings in the Middle East remind us of a scary truth: Here's what the \"war on terror\" is really about", "title": "America\u2019s counter-terrorism lie: Waging war with secret rules, hypocrisy and worse", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Our latest bombings in the Middle East remind us of a scary truth: Here's what the \"war on terror\" is really about", "title": "America\u2019s counter-terrorism lie: Waging war with secret rules, hypocrisy and worse", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/11/americas_counter_terrorism_lie_waging_war_with_secret_rules_hypocrisy_and_worse/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/bush_obama_isis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Our latest bombings in the Middle East remind us of a scary truth: Here's what the \"war on terror\" is really about", "title": "America\u2019s counter-terrorism lie: Waging war with secret rules, hypocrisy and worse", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/bush_obama_isis.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, amnesty international, andrea prasow, avner gidron, Council on Foreign Relations, Drones, Editor's Picks, Human Rights Watch, isis, micah zenko, michael isikoff, President Obama, Targeted killing, Terrorism, War on Terror", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8918\"", "article_summary": "For experts in the field of human rights, the Yahoo!\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know how to analyze [drone strikes] and how to figure out which law governs.\nThe war on terror is bigger and more entrenched than ever, and it\u2019s still being waged according to secret rules.\n\u201cThe Obama administration has used targeted killing in circumstances that may not be an armed conflict,\u201d Prasow said, \u201cand in those cases, human rights law is the law that governs.\n\u201cBecause of the complete lack of transparency,\u201d Gidron said, \u201cit\u2019s impossible \u2026 to assess whether this policy about drone strikes is actually being applied to those situations where they said it would apply.\u201d"}
