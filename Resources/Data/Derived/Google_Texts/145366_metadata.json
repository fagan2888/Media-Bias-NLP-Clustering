The one question he couldn\u2019t answer as a kid was a primal one: Who is my father?\n\nAs a Denver Post story explained, his mother, Wendy Kramer, had used a sperm bank to conceive her son and had only an anonymous donor number to share.\n\n\u201cWe started a little Yahoo group \u2026 all these people wanted to make mutual-consent contact,\u201d Kramer said. Ryan\u2019s quest \u2014 which so far has turned up six half-siblings as well as the donor \u2014 evolved into the Donor Sibling Registry. Since 2000, the Registry has successfully connected 10,506 half-sibs and/or donors.\n\nThe evolution in how a new generation looks at conception, parenthood, family and, not least, privacy now takes another step: \u201cGeneration Cryo\u201d is a six-part MTV docu-reality series premiering Nov. 25 that lays out the issues in an easy yet respectful format.\n\n\u201cGeneration Cryo\u201d traces the search for a donor by one 17-year-old, Breeanna, the single child of a lesbian couple. In the course of her search, Bree locates \u201cat least\u201d 15 half-siblings fathered by the same anonymous donor, No. 1096.\n\nThis is the nonfiction world dramatized in Vince Vaughn\u2019s movie, \u201cDelivery Man,\u201d which opened last this week. In that comedy, the donor learns he\u2019s fathered 533 children through anonymous donations to a fertility clinic years earlier. The MTV docu-series is as earnest as that movie is outrageous.\n\nAs Bree travels to meet her newfound blood relatives, keeping a video diary of her impressions, the camera catches the half-siblings comparing physical similarities and shared interests, worrying about their parents\u2019 feelings, wondering what unwanted surprises are in store, all while looking for \u201cNo. 1096.\u201d Some of the half-sibs aren\u2019t comfortable with the idea of meeting the man who isn\u2019t a \u201cfather\u201d in the conventional sense, but whose DNA they share. (Certain personal information on the Registry is redacted for the camera.)\n\nThe topic is loaded. Even the terminology is loaded (\u201cdonor\u201d or \u201cbiological father\u201d?). Onscreen, the \u201cnon-bio parent\u201d admits to feeling threatened by the idea of his family finding the donor. The process can be emotional for all concerned. But for a growing population, it\u2019s a fact of life.\n\nKramer, who founded the Donor Sibling Registry and served as associate producer on the series, said her mission is \u201ctaking the stigma out of donor conception.\u201d At the same time, she also argues in favor of stricter restrictions on the profit-motivated sperm and egg donation system.\n\nThe MTV audience is a logical place to start.\n\nIn the first two hours of \u201cGeneration Cryo,\u201d the exact research methods Bree used to locate her sperm donor are unclear. Kramer expressed disappointment that a segment involving her son Ryan walking Bree through the process via computer was cut from the series.\n\nMore specifics would have helped. But, like most docu- reality TV mashups, the need for drama on-screen trumped detailed explanations. Choppy editing comes standard.\n\nStill, the tension between the impulse to search and the need for privacy is clear. Emotions run high and the conflict makes for good television.\n\nIs the series ultimately titillating? Or is it an educational primer for the new reality? Judging by the first two hours, it\u2019s a bit of both but the series encourages an evolving viewpoint.\n\nAnd for Bree, the ending is ultimately a happy one, with loose ends.\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "MTV documents sperm donor, half-sibling contacts in \u201cGeneration Cryo\u201d", "title": "MTV documents sperm donor, half-sibling contacts in \u201cGeneration Cryo\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/21/mtv-documents-sperm-donor-half-sibling-contacts-in-generation-cryo/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131121__20131124_E1_AE24TVOSTROWp1.jpg", "height": 367}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131121__20131124_E1_AE24TVOSTROWp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-21T16:28:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:39:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In the first two hours of \u201cGeneration Cryo,\u201d the exact research methods Bree used to locate her sperm donor are unclear.\nRyan\u2019s quest \u2014 which so far has turned up six half-siblings as well as the donor \u2014 evolved into the Donor Sibling Registry.\nIn the course of her search, Bree locates \u201cat least\u201d 15 half-siblings fathered by the same anonymous donor, No.\n\u201cGeneration Cryo\u201d traces the search for a donor by one 17-year-old, Breeanna, the single child of a lesbian couple.\nAs a Denver Post story explained, his mother, Wendy Kramer, had used a sperm bank to conceive her son and had only an anonymous donor number to share."}
