Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.\n\nTrump criticized Rubio for his attendance record in the Senate, his record on immigration and for his poor debate performance in New Hampshire, which Trump labeled as a \u201cmeltdown like I\u2019ve never, ever seen.\u201d He also said Rubio sold a house to a lobbyist for whom he was writing legislation.\n\nTrump said if he wins the primaries in the Senators\u2019 home states of Florida and Texas, it would be \u201cembarrassing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you beat a sitting Senator in Florida? How do you beat a sitting Senator in Texas? They could have an embarrassing time,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRubio held a rally earlier in the day at the Chevy Bricktown Event Center in Oklahoma City where he called Trump \u201ca con man\u201d and mocked the billionaire for a series of tweets with misspelled words.\n\nNew Jersey governor Chris Christie, who endorsed Trump earlier in the day, introduced the billionaire to the crowd.\n\n\u201cAmerica needs a strong leader who\u2019s going to restore America\u2019s strength around the world, and Donald Trump is that man,\u201d Christie said.\n\nTrump stuck to many of the same themes of previous rallies - immigration, building a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico, international trade and repealing Obamacare.\n\nAt one point, a protester unfurled a banner that read \u201cIslamophobia is not the answer\u201d and displayed a shirt that read \u201cKKK Endorses Trump.\u201d Trump criticized security for removing the protestor too slowly.\n\n\u201cIn the good old days, they\u2019d rip him out of that seat so fast. But today everybody\u2019s politically correct. Out country is going to hell with being politically correct,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cIn all fairness, I love the police, they\u2019re the greatest. But they\u2019re afraid to move. They\u2019re afraid to move. They want to keep their jobs. They don\u2019t want to lose their pensions. We are really becoming a frightened country and it\u2019s very, very sad,\u201d Trump said.\n\nNate Weikal from Oklahoma City said he will vote for Trump because he is a successful businessman.\n\n\u201cI mostly support him because he is a fiscal conservative,\u201d Weikal said. \u201cI think the debt that this country has is absolutely enormous and ridiculous and I believe that he is the only person who would be able to turn it around for us.\u201d\n\nJohn Naeher said he supports Trump because the Republican establishment has not done any of the things they have promised to do.\n\n\u201cThey asked us to give them the House, and we gave them the House of Representatives, and what the heck do they do with it? Nothing,\u201d Naeher said. \u201cWe gave them the Senate and they did squat.\u201d\n\nNaeher concedes that Donald Trump is \u201ca little bit of a rebel,\u201d but he should help the Republicans learn to fight as well as the Democrats.\n\nOklahoma will vote in the Super Tuesday primaries on March 1, and it will be a weekend for political activity in the Oklahoma City metro. In addition to the Trump and Rubio rallies on Friday, former President Bill Clinton will campaign on behalf of Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton on Saturday at 9:00 a.m. at the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond. Hillary Clinton\u2019s rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, will appear at the Cox Convention Center in Oklahoma City on Sunday at 2:00 p.m. Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas will be at the Chevy Bricktown Events Center on Sunday at 4:00 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Republican presidential primary frontrunner Donald Trump returned to Oklahoma City on Friday for a rally at the Cox Convention Center, where he quickly", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kosu.org/post/trump-attacks-rubio-cruz-oklahoma-city-rally", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kosu/files/styles/medium/public/201602/160226_Trump2.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Republican presidential primary frontrunner Donald Trump returned to Oklahoma City on Friday for a rally at the Cox Convention Center, where he quickly", "title": "Trump Attacks Rubio, Cruz At Oklahoma City Rally"}, "story_id": 468410262, "twitter": {"site": "@KOSURadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@KOSURadio"}, "author": "Jacob McCleland, Emily Wendler", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Trump Attacks Rubio, Cruz At Oklahoma City Rally"}, "nid": 30120, "datePublished": "2016-02-27", "keywords": "Donald Trump, 2016 Elections, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio", "wordCount": 1165, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "At one point, a protester unfurled a banner that read \u201cIslamophobia is not the answer\u201d and displayed a shirt that read \u201cKKK Endorses Trump.\u201d Trump criticized security for removing the protestor too slowly.\nOklahoma will vote in the Super Tuesday primaries on March 1, and it will be a weekend for political activity in the Oklahoma City metro.\nNate Weikal from Oklahoma City said he will vote for Trump because he is a successful businessman.\nRubio held a rally earlier in the day at the Chevy Bricktown Event Center in Oklahoma City where he called Trump \u201ca con man\u201d and mocked the billionaire for a series of tweets with misspelled words.\nRepublican presidential primary frontrunner Donald Trump returned to Oklahoma City on Friday for a rally at the Cox Convention Center, where he quickly went on the offensive against his two closest rivals, U.S. Sens."}
