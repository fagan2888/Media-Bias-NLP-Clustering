He did so because it was not yet realized for black Americans.\n\nAt Corinthian Hall in Rochester, New York, Douglass declared: \u201cThis Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn.\u201d To his hosts, he asked: \u201cDo you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak today?\u201d\n\n\n\nDouglass continued, explaining:\n\nWhat, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sound of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants brass fronted impudence; your shout of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety and hypocrisy \u2014 a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of the United States, at this very hour.\n\nToday, however, Douglass would undoubtedly think differently. He would more likely be proud of how far America has come in ensuring equal protection under the law. There are now many reasons to celebrate Independence Day.\n\n\n\nNow, for example, under our Constitution, everyone enjoys the guarantee of individual freedom.\n\n\n\nDouglass would probably also appeal to modern blacks to remember their predecessors who contributed to American independence. It is these people, who surely envisioned the America we now live in, who deserve tribute and are a reason to celebrate the 4th of July now with pride and dignity.\n\n\n\nIt is important to share \u2014 especially with our youth \u2014 the stories of black patriots such as Crispus Attucks, Peter Salem and Salem Poor.\n\n\n\nCrispus Attucks, an escaped slave, was an early casualty of the American Revolution when he was killed by British troops in the Boston Massacre. He became a martyr during the Revolutionary War and was later a symbol of liberty in fight against slavery. In spite of restrictions related to the burial of blacks at that time, Attucks was nonetheless buried at the Granary Burial Ground beside other honored dead such as Paul Revere.\n\n\n\nPeter Salem and Salem Poor exhibited bravery at battles such as Bunker Hill. Salem shot and killed British Major John Pitcairn as Pitcairn rallied his troops. His fellow soldiers later presented Salem to General George Washington as a hero.\n\n\n\nPoor, who earlier bought his freedom, joined a Massachusetts militia company in part to promote black liberty. For killing a high-ranking British officer, Lt. Col. James Abercrombie, Poor\u2019s heroism was noted in a petition signed by fourteen of his officers:\n\nWe declare that a negro man, called Salem Poor\u2026 in the late Battle at Charlestown, behaved like an experienced officer, as well as an excellent soldier. To set forth particulars of his conduct would be tedious, we would only beg leave to say in the person of this said negro centers a brave and gallant soldier.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that lack men of that era believed the Revolutionary War was a fight for everyone\u2019s liberty. Their loyalty was to the American principle of individual freedom. Over 5,000 black men fought for the Continental Army. Many black women served as nurses, laundresses and cooks. They all played a vital role in winning the independence we are all now privileged to enjoy.\n\n\n\nResponding to Douglass today about the meaning of and reason to celebrate Independence Day, we ought to proudly stand tall and respond: We have everything to celebrate \u2014 for we played a big part in the independence in this great nation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/P21StacySwimp.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1404497972095", "description": "The following New Visions Commentary from Project 21 member Stacy Swimp was originally published i...", "title": "What, to Black Americans, is the 4th of\u00a0July? - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "article_summary": "Poor, who earlier bought his freedom, joined a Massachusetts militia company in part to promote black liberty.\nHe did so because it was not yet realized for black Americans.\nIt is important to share \u2014 especially with our youth \u2014 the stories of black patriots such as Crispus Attucks, Peter Salem and Salem Poor.\nThere are now many reasons to celebrate Independence Day.\nDouglass would probably also appeal to modern blacks to remember their predecessors who contributed to American independence."}
