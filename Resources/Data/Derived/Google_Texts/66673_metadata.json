We now have a fair average market price for each of the main publication types and they vary according to the level of support.\u201d\n\nPfizer has taken a similar approach, both with its decision that publication support is a transfer of value as well as to how this is worked out, according to Lorna Fay, senior director of the company's publications management team.\n\nHowever, Fay was keen to make the point that this was the company's \u201ccurrent opinion\u201d and things could change.\n\n\u201cThere are ongoing discussions as to whether our approach will remain,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really don't know where it will end up.\u201d\n\nShire's viewpoint \u2013 as discussed by director of global publications Antonia Panayi - was simpler, taking the approach that medical writing support for Shire-sponsored studies was only of benefit for the pharma company and so there was no transfer of value to the physician.\n\n\u201cThere is no transfer of value to physicians or authors beyond what has already been paid as part of their contractual agreement for the trial,\u201d said Panayi. \u201cThis is because Shire is deriving the benefit not the authors.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe did recognise there may be kudos for the authorship, but how do you quantify this? We didn't see it as tangible benefit.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on whether Shire is still collecting this data 'being the scenes' in case it had to be reported, Panayi said the company was, but it was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with its current approach.\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.", "article_metadata": {"DC.identifier": 538434, "msvalidate.01": "0EC42B8AFF32E3F8AF94AE970DE63445", "DC.coverage": "World", "Listing Name": "Pharma companies differ on Sunshine Act payment definition", "DC.language": "en", "DC.title": "Pharma companies differ on Sunshine Act payment definition", "DC.type": "text", "Author Name": "Thomas Meek", "DC.date": "2014-01-29 04:27:20", "theme": "medicalcommunications", "FB_searchresultformat": "News Article", "FB_searchresult_listingurl": "http://www.pmlive.com/__data/assets/image/0009/508284/varieties/listing.jpg", "sections": "Marketing; PME; Communique", "tags": "Sunshine Act; doctor payments", "DC.format": "News Article", "DC.publisher": "PMGroup Worldwide Limited", "FB_searchresultname": "Pharma companies differ on Sunshine Act payment definition", "14days": "2014-02-12 11:27:35", "primary_section": "Marketing", "viewport": "width=device-width", "DC.description": "Confusion about whether provision of editorial services is transfer of value", "DC.rights": "All content copyright \u00a9 PMGroup Worldwide Limited.", "FB_searchresult_headlineurl": "http://www.pmlive.com/__data/assets/image/0009/508284/varieties/headline.jpg", "1month": "2014-03-01 11:27:38"}, "article_summary": "There is still no consensus on whether medical writing or editorial services support from pharma companies should be reported under the Sunshine Act.\nHowever, there has been a lack of clarity as to what should and should not be reported, including the medical writing support provided by pharma companies to authors of clinical studies.\nAs heard at the ISMPP event, both Pfizer and AstraZeneca have taken the stance that they should report medical writing support under the Sunshine Act, while Shire does not.\n\u201cWe have taken an average fair market value approach,\u201d said Hill.\nRegarding the practical implication of this, Hill described how the company ascribes a value to the author support provided by pharma companies."}
