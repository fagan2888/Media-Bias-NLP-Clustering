An estimated 80 percent of those infected show no symptoms at all.\n\nResearchers in Brazil said on Wednesday they had found new evidence linking the virus to increasing incidence of microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with unusually small heads.\n\nU.S. authorities confirmed on Saturday the birth of a baby with a small head in Hawaii to a mother who had been infected with the Zika virus while visiting Brazil.\n\nThe agency issued an advisory last week against travel to Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela, and the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n(Reporting by Natalie Grover in Bengaluru; Editing by Don Sebastian)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "us, adds, more, countries, zika, travel, alert", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The CDC has cautioned pregnant women not to travel to areas that pose risk of infection.", "title": "US Adds More Countries To Zika Travel Alert", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-adds-more-countries-zika-travel-alert-370646", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/23/zika-virus.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The CDC has cautioned pregnant women not to travel to areas that pose risk of infection.", "title": "US Adds More Countries To Zika Travel Alert", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-adds-more-countries-zika-travel-alert-370646", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/23/zika-virus.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/23/zika-virus.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-01-23T10:33:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-23T10:33:06-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The CDC has cautioned pregnant women not to travel to areas that pose risk of infection."}, "article_summary": "The Zika virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is also known to carry the dengue, yellow fever and Chikungunya viruses.\nReuters/Jose Cabezas(Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) extended its travel warning to another eight countries or territories that pose a risk of infection with Zika, a mosquito-borne virus spreading through the Caribbean and Latin America.\nThe CDC has cautioned pregnant women not to travel to these areas as Zika has been suspected to lead to birth defects.\nA health worker fumigates the Altos del Cerro neighborhood as part of preventive measures against the Zika virus and other mosquito-borne diseases in Soyapango, El Salvador January 21, 2016.\nU.S. authorities confirmed on Saturday the birth of a baby with a small head in Hawaii to a mother who had been infected with the Zika virus while visiting Brazil."}
