× CDOT replaced 420 mile marker sign with 419.99 sign because of thieves

DENVER — The Colorado Department of Transportation decided to change a mile marker sign in rural eastern Colorado because thieves kept stealing it.

The sign read 420 — a common symbol for marijuana enthusiasts.

It was replaced with a sign that reads 419.99.

CDOT spokeswoman Amy Ford said the sign was replaced within the last year. She wasn’t sure how many times it had been stolen.

The sign is along Interstate 70 east of Denver.
