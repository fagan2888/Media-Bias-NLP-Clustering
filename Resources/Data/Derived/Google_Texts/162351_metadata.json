(AP) - Todd Oldham may have left fashion behind nearly 20 years ago, but an upcoming exhibit will celebrate the multidisciplinary designer\u2019s enduring sense of style.\n\n\u201cAll of Everything: Todd Oldham Fashion\u201d is scheduled to open next spring at the Rhode Island School of Design Museum. It\u2019s the first solo museum exhibition to focus on the designer\u2019s runway opus of the 1990s. It will feature nearly 70 ensembles, many of which were last seen on supermodels like Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington.\n\nOldham and RISD collaborated to make the pieces new again, mixing seasons and years to create a fresh point of view.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we try to look at how this stuff works together?\u2019 It\u2019s not a season; it\u2019s 10 years of stuff,\u201d Oldham said. \u201cIt worked beautifully.\u201d\n\nOldham arrived on the fashion scene in 1989 and gained recognition for his colorful designs and handcrafted textiles. The Nueces County, Texas, native was featured prominently on MTV\u2019s \u201cHouse of Style,\u201d hosted by Cindy Crawford, where he gave viewers tips on everything from thrift shopping to reupholstering furniture.\n\nHe left the industry a decade later to pursue other creative projects, including his arts and crafts line Kid Made Modern, and he often gives lectures at RISD, which awarded him an honorary doctorate last year.\n\nFor the upcoming show, Oldham is designing one new dress, made from textiles he and his RISD students made in a class last spring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working on it because it\u2019s got a ton of elaborate embroidery,\u201d he said.\n\nKnown for his playful point of view, Oldham said shifting back into fashion design was easy because he has the same spirit no matter what he\u2019s working on.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t in any way say it ignited a desire to return to this industry,\u201d he added with a laugh.\n\nThe idea for the exhibit came about last year, while Oldham was touring the RISD museum. Curator Kate Irvin was installing some 1920s beaded dresses that immediately caught the eye of the designer, known for his own highly embellished textiles.\n\nIrvin, the museum\u2019s costume and textiles curator, said Oldham\u2019s designs are striking in person.\n\n\u201cThe significance is what a thoughtful artist and maker he is, and that comes through when you see these pieces,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while some of the pieces are more than 20 years old, they don\u2019t seem dated, Irvin said.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t made in the \u201890s with the idea that this is the fashion trend for the season, and I think that will come through when we put these pieces on display in 2016,\u201d she said.\n\nOldham is giving many of his designs to RISD, and a few will be on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City for the show.\n\nMeanwhile, Oldham said he continues to be inspired by passion, singularity - and free-thinkers.\n\n\u201cThose are usually the things that startle me in great ways more than anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, I think Miley Cyrus is astonishing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Todd Oldham may have left fashion behind nearly 20 years ago, but an upcoming exhibit will celebrate the multidisciplinary designer's enduring sense of style.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Todd Oldham may have left fashion behind nearly 20 years ago, but an upcoming exhibit will celebrate the multidisciplinary designer\u2019s enduring sense of style.", "title": "Designer Todd Oldham to have solo exhibit at RISD museum", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/21/designer-todd-oldham-to-have-solo-exhibit-at-risd-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/21/1daf6e46b149061b7a0f6a706700e9bf.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/21/1daf6e46b149061b7a0f6a706700e9bf.jpg", "description": "Todd Oldham may have left fashion behind nearly 20 years ago, but an upcoming exhibit will celebrate the multidisciplinary designer's enduring sense of style.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Designer Todd Oldham to have solo exhibit at RISD museum"}, "Author": "AMY ANTHONY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7b32\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAll of Everything: Todd Oldham Fashion\u201d is scheduled to open next spring at the Rhode Island School of Design Museum.\nThe idea for the exhibit came about last year, while Oldham was touring the RISD museum.\nPROVIDENCE, R.I.
