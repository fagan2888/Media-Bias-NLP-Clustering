Those who woke up to snow across Colorado should be prepared for more this weekend.

A storm that dropped several inches across the state overnight Thursday is expected to be followed by another system heading into the metro area on Saturday.

The weekend system could drop up to 4 inches in areas in and around Denver.

“An upper level disturbance and cold front will be responsible for the snow,” the National Weather Service in Boulder said.

Driving will be hazardous on the Eastern Plains. The NWS has issued a winter weather advisory for east of Denver starting late Saturday morning. Wind gusts of up to 40 mph will cause poor visibility and blowing snow may cover roads. The NWS said traffic delays should be expected.

Snow is expected to move out of the state on Saturday night, forecasters say.

Thursday night’s spotty snow added more to the already-heavy ground cover leaving roads slick once again.
