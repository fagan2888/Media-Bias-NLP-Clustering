Retailer TJX Cos, which operates the T.J. Maxx, Marhsalls and Home Goods chains, announced Wednesday that it plans to raise wages for its lowest paid workers, following quick on the heels of Walmart\u2019s decision to raise wages last week.\n\nThe announcement leaves Target looking like the lone holdout on low wages among major discount retailers. The Minneapolis-based retailer \u2014 which has struggled in the face of increased competition, a damaging data breach and a disastrous attempt to expand into Canada \u2014 also announced stronger than expected earnings on Wednesday, but was mum on any plans to hike pay.\n\nRelated: The Real Reason Walmart Is Raising Worker Pay\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nUnder new CEO Brian Cornell, who took over in August after serving as CEO of PepsiCo Americas Foods and the Sam\u2019s Club division of Walmart, Target managed to increase traffic to its stores and boost online sales during the holiday quarter. But if Cornell\u2019s turnaround efforts are showing some traction, helped by an improving economy, they still have further to go.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in the very early stages,\u201d Target CFO John Mulligan told analysts on a conference call Wednesday.\n\nAs the company pushes ahead, it\u2019s likely to face pressure to join the list of retailers who are upping their workers\u2019 wages. Costco Wholesale Corp. and some other successful retailers have long paid higher wages as a way to decrease turnover and improve customer service. Gap said in June that it was moving to a $10 an hour wage base, a change that led to more job applications.\n\nTarget was already under pressure to increase wages even before the TJX announcement. \u201cSomebody is going to take the place at the bottom of the heap,\u201d Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison of Minneapolis told the local paper. \u201cDoes Target want to be that company? I hope not.\u201d\n\nThe headline of the Minneapolis StarTribune story from Feb. 21 was, \u201cExperts think Target will follow Wal-Mart\u2019s lead on raises.\u201d\n\nRelated: Walmart Changes the Debate on Minimum Wage\u200b\u200b\n\nLike Walmart, TJX is going to boost wages first to $9 this year and then $10 by 2016. That\u2019s well above the current federal minimum wage of $7.25, which hasn\u2019t changed since 2009. TJX announced the increases in conjunction with strong earnings on Wednesday.\n\n\"This pay initiative is an important part of our strategies to continue attracting and retaining the best talent in order to deliver a great shopping experience for our customers, remain competitive on wages in our U.S. markets, and stay focused on our value mission,\" TJX CEO Carol Meyrowitz said in a statement.\n\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, points out that wages for the bottom 10 percent of workers increased in 2014 while they fell on average for higher-earning groups of workers. Burtless is not alone in suggesting that Target (and other retailers that pay near minimum wage) will have to raise wages if it wants to hang onto good employees and attract higher caliber workers.\n\nTarget is planning to announce investments at a meeting with analysts on March 3. But, previewing that meeting on a conference call on Wednesday, CFO Mulligan spoke about cutting costs to fund the investments, which doesn\u2019t exactly foreshadow wage hikes.\n\nBut as Target looks to continue rehabilitating its reputation \u2014 and as both economic and political pressure increase \u2014 it will likely have to match the competition on wages sooner rather than later.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "So far Target isn\u2019t joining the wage-hike party, even as competitors jump in.", "title": "Will Target Be Next to Raise Its Minimum Wage?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/25/Will-Target-Be-Next-Raise-Its-Minimum-Wage", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-02-27T130004Z_3_CBRE91Q0ZP300_RTROPTP_2_TARGET.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/25/Will-Target-Be-Next-Raise-Its-Minimum-Wage", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-02-27T130004Z_3_CBRE91Q0ZP300_RTROPTP_2_TARGET.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ameystone"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "So far Target isn\u2019t joining the wage-hike party, even as competitors jump in.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfed2\"", "article_summary": "Burtless is not alone in suggesting that Target (and other retailers that pay near minimum wage) will have to raise wages if it wants to hang onto good employees and attract higher caliber workers.\nRetailer TJX Cos, which operates the T.J.
