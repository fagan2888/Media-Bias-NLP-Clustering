Selfie. Geek. Science. Four dictionary publishers each selected one of those words as its word of the year for 2013. But it\u2019s tough to catalog the preoccupations of the year in a single word. There were many flying around that seemed to capture a moment, an emotion, a thought, a new way of doing or describing things, or the larger zeitgeist. Some were new, some not so new, but they all seemed to say something about the times. Here are a few:\n\nAG-GAG LAW n. Legislation that restricts the use of undercover video in places where food animals are raised or slaughtered. From agriculture + gag law.\n\nAIR GAP n.

Spelling representation of a dialect pronunciation of babe or baby.
