The other 41,965, so to speak, would be manufacturing and construction jobs that would end after a year or two, necessitating new job creation.\n\nAt Reason.com, Scott Shackford taunts that liberals are trying to have it both ways by trumpeting the 35 figure, pointing out that this is an essential characteristic of all infrastructure projects, which constitute a substantial portion of President Obama\u2019s jobs legislation. It\u2019s true: The thing about installing capital goods is that the installation process concludes. Shackford\u2019s gotcha is hollow, though, unaccompanied as it is by a workable libertarian long-term full employment strategy.\n\nIf pipeline champions are so interested in an approach that can really bring meaningful, long-lasting improvement to American jobs, there are several initiatives awaiting their support. So let\u2019s be clear about what we need:\n\n1. A large \u2013 temporary \u2013 infrastructure program. There\u2019s plenty of stuff worth building, like a national bullet train infrastructure, a smart grid with renewable energy sources, and fiber-optic telecommunications network \u2013 hell, solar roadways (which, did you know a Republican senator is into?). These projects might all be combined into one large-scale construction initiative, which once complete, could basically cede operation and maintenance of the infrastructure to robots. The temporary jobs would stimulate the currently measly U.S. economy, but the central appeal is the infrastructure we\u2019d be getting out of it.\n\n2. A permanent job guarantee. Conventionally, stimulus is done trickle down-style, by employing the skilled, educated, and relatively highly-paid and hoping the boost they provide to aggregate demand will result in employment for everyone. This approach tends not to reach the long term unemployed, the formerly incarcerated, those born into poverty, &c. The bottom-up version is to offer guaranteed employment not in manufacturing and construction, but the service, care, education, and community development sectors. Among the stated merits of such a program are a built-in check on inflation, and the pairing of national funding with a decentralized, local planning structure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Want to really create jobs in this country?
