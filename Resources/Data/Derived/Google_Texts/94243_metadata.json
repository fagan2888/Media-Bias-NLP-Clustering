Even revisions in the health care payment structure focus on preventive health services and accountability for health outcomes,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s what is driving policy decisions at the federal, state and local levels.\u201d\n\nMichalek says health administrators with population health training will be in high demand as the Affordable Care Act evolves and the health care sector continues to expand. The intention here, he says, is to prepare health and health-related human services professionals to administer health care delivery systems competently in this new environment.\n\nJean Wactawski-Wende, professor of epidemiology and environmental health and interim dean of the school, agrees.\n\n\u201cCompetent practice in the reformed system requires acquisition of knowledge and skills in an array of population health and prevention-oriented principles that are at the foundation of public health,\" Wactawski-Wende says.\n\n\u201cOur school has a long history of preparing professionals at the master and doctoral levels in the public health disciplines, and has developed a highly qualified faculty that includes experienced practitioners in relevant community health fields,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe are well-positioned and well-prepared to offer the new MPH accelerated program with the same high quality coursework and community involvement as the longer program,\u201d she says.\n\nThe program will include coursework and research on topics such as health system administrative theory and practice; health program planning and evaluation; the study of disease and prevention in population groups; population health behaviors; applied biostatistics; and environmental health.\n\nUB has the only school in the western New York region offering a concentration in health services administration accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "BUFFALO, N.Y. &mdash;&nbsp; In the fall of 2015, the University\nat Buffalo School of Public Health and Health Professions will\noffer a 12-month accelerated master&rsquo;s degree program in\npublic health (MPH) with a concentration in health services\nadministration and population health.", "title": "UB to offer accelerated route to Master of Public Health degree"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "keywords": "School of Public Health and Health Professions (SPHHP), Student Life, Pat Donovan, Health and Medicine, News Article", "keywordIDs": "ub-entity:public-health,ub-entity:news-center/ub-news-topic/student-life,ub-entity:news-center/ub-news-author/pat-donovan,ub-entity:news-center/ub-news-topic/health-and-medicine,content-type:news-article", "date": "2014-12-04", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd90a\"", "article_summary": "UB to offer accelerated route to Master of Public Health degreeA response to public health reforms, increased need for experts in population healthBUFFALO, N.Y. \u2014 In the fall of 2015, the University at Buffalo School of Public Health and Health Professions will offer a 12-month accelerated master\u2019s degree program in public health (MPH) with a concentration in health services administration and population health.\nUB has the only school in the western New York region offering a concentration in health services administration accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health.\n\u201cNow the health of populations and the delivery of health care to those populations is a major component of health and human service delivery.\nThe program will include coursework and research on topics such as health system administrative theory and practice; health program planning and evaluation; the study of disease and prevention in population groups; population health behaviors; applied biostatistics; and environmental health.\n\u201cTraditionally, the public health profession has focused on outcomes for individual patients,\u201d Michalek says."}
