I am outraged. I am livid. I have just been "had" by the pharmaceutical industry. A prescription refill that cost $33.34 (my co-pay) just five months ago, today cost $143.34 (co-pay). This is a generic drug. Whatever happened to "generics are a lot less expensive than the original drug?" And the folks in Washington say there is no inflation? That's what they claim is the reason people on Social Security get no cost-of-living increase this year.

After a little research, I discovered it was the pharmaceutical industry that was first to endorse Obamacare. It was just a year after Obamacare became law that Big Pharma started buying up smaller companies that make generics, and started jacking up prices. (Research it.) The more time that passes the greater the increase in cost to people getting prescriptions filled. Some prices have increased by thousands of dollars overnight.

This whole pharmaceutical mess smells like collusion. The president does nothing about it. The Federal Trade Commission and the so-called Justice Department do nothing about it. Those government agencies are supposed to be looking out for the people. They have done nothing.

Outrageous! Vote them out!
