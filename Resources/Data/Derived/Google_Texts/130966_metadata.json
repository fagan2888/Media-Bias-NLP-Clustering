Luxembourg is home to 22 subsidiaries (yet no Walmart stores) with $64.2 billion in assets. Since 2011, Walmart has transferred more than $45 billion in assets to Luxembourg subsidiaries, and has paid less than 1 percent in tax in the country on $1.3 billion in profits from 2010 to 2013, according to the report.\n\nRelated: Wal-Mart Presses Case for Repairs at Stores in Labor Dispute\n\nOverall, American companies are holding more than $2 trillion in untaxed profits overseas, keeping that money outside the U.S. in an effort to reduce their tax liabilities. The rapid growth in those foreign holdings has prompted widespread calls for corporate tax reform that would encourage businesses to repatriate those profits. While the new report focused on Walmart, it also noted that 21 Fortune 500 companies are known to each have more subsidiaries in tax havens than the 78 Walmart subsidiaries it documents.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that this case study about Walmart\u2019s secretive and extensive use of tax havens causes members of Congress to rethink their approach on how to tax these offshore profits and international tax issues in general,\u201d the report\u2019s authors wrote, adding that \u201cwhen large corporations avoid taxes, the rest of us have to make up the difference.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Walmart owns more than $76 billion worth of assets through an extensive network of 78", "title": "Walmart Stashes $76 Billion in Secret Overseas Tax Havens: Report", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/17/Walmart-Stashes-76-Billion-Secret-Overseas-Tax-Havens-Report", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-08-31T193759Z_1_CBRE87U1IJD00_RTROPTP_2_WALMART-EXPRESS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/17/Walmart-Stashes-76-Billion-Secret-Overseas-Tax-Havens-Report", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-08-31T193759Z_1_CBRE87U1IJD00_RTROPTP_2_WALMART-EXPRESS.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Walmart owns more than $76 billion worth of assets through an extensive network of 78", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "While the new report focused on Walmart, it also noted that 21 Fortune 500 companies are known to each have more subsidiaries in tax havens than the 78 Walmart subsidiaries it documents.\nLuxembourg is home to 22 subsidiaries (yet no Walmart stores) with $64.2 billion in assets.\nWalmart owns more than $76 billion worth of assets through an extensive network of 78 subsidiaries and branches located in 15 countries considered tax havens, according to a new report released by Americans for Tax Fairness, a tax-reform advocacy group.\nSince 2011, Walmart has transferred more than $45 billion in assets to Luxembourg subsidiaries, and has paid less than 1 percent in tax in the country on $1.3 billion in profits from 2010 to 2013, according to the report.\nThe rapid growth in those foreign holdings has prompted widespread calls for corporate tax reform that would encourage businesses to repatriate those profits."}
