A possible alternate title for at least one of the editions of the new season of Sportsman Channel’s Amazing America with Sarah Palin could be “A Whole Lotta Huntin’ Goin’ On.” Gun rights advocates will be happy to learn that legendary rocker Ted Nugent joins the former Alaska governor.

Nugent, a tireless constitutional rights advocate, is a member of the National Bowhunters Hall of Fame and, like Palin, an outspoken defender of our Second Amendment.

Season two of the program begins on January 15 at 9 p.m. ET/PT. Twelve new episodes are on the schedule with Nugent’s appearance slated for the third show. Nugent is not the only big draw for the upcoming season. Like she did in last year’s inaugural season, Palin will take viewers across the United States to share inspiring stories of outdoor enthusiasts, personalities, craftsmen, and other Americans who go out of their way to help others.

Amazing America will visit the Warrior Games in Colorado Springs, featuring archery, shooting, and wheelchair basketball competition for injured veterans; discuss “Operation Home,” a program that builds houses for veterans, with former Army infantryman and Dancing with the Stars winner JR Martinez; travel to Maine to learn training techniques from a Wilderness Rescue team; and go behind-the-scenes at the Bristol Motor Speedway and the city’s bomb squad, as well as many other adventures.

In addition to Palin serving as the host, comedian Jerry Carroll, a season one co-host, returns as well. Miss USA 2006 Tara Conner will join Carroll this time around as a co-host in the field.

The first season of Amazing America with Sarah Palin helped propel Sportsman Channel to triple-digit growth among households and key male demographics. The lineup for season two looks poised to grow the audience for the show and the network as a whole even further.
