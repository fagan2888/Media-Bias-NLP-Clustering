Speaking at a White House clean energy summit, Biden said more needs to be done \u2014 from the government, but especially among private investors \u2014 to create new low-carbon energy technology.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOnly with the private sector can we fully or even mostly realize the opportunities of this energy transformation. Government can\u2019t do this, government can\u2019t do this alone,\u201d Biden said. \u201cOur energy future is in cleaner, cheaper renewable energy, and all of you understand that clean energy investments have provided financial and social returns.\u201d\n\nBiden highlighted the work the Obama administration has done on clean energy, including spending on energy programs and tax credits for carbon-free energy sources. Energy prices for solar and wind \u2014 and their share of the energy generated in the U.S. \u2014 have improved since 2009, Biden said.\n\nHe also knocked congressional Republicans for proposing spending cuts to energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.\n\n\u201cJust as we got, in this transformative moment, off the ground, by ramping up private and federal investment, once again \u2014 some shortsighted decisions from the outfit I worked in for a long, long time \u2014 up on the hill, they\u2019re ramping it down as fast as you all ramped it up,\u201d Biden said.\n\nPart of the solution, he said, is more private sector spending on new clean energy technology.\n\nThe Obama administration attracted $4 billion in commitments from would-be clean energy investors, the White House announced on Monday. The pledges are twice what officials had hoped they would receive in February when they launched their Clean Energy Investment Initiative, which they said will help encourage spending on new low-carbon technology among investors who are both concerned about the environment and looking for a financial return.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only the morally right thing to do, it\u2019s not only in the interest of our national security,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart economic play.\u201d\n\nThe speech was Biden\u2019s first public remarks since the funeral for his son, Beau, who died last month.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical moment for our country, not only for us but more importantly for our children and grandchildren,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t seize the moment now, I hope there\u2019s never a point of no return but, man, we are getting closer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Private sector investors should do more to boost spending on clean energy technology, Vice President Joe Biden said on Tuesday.", "description": "Private sector investors should do more to boost spending on clean energy technology, Vice President Joe Biden said on Tuesday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Devin Henry", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Private sector investors should do more to boost spending on clean energy technology, Vice President Joe Biden said on Tuesday.", "title": "Biden promotes private sector clean energy investments", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/245178-biden-promotes-private-sector-clean-energy-investments", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/bidenjoe_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-16T17:36:43-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-06-16T17:36-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/245178-biden-promotes-private-sector-clean-energy-investments", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-16T17:20-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Devin Henry", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Climate change,Joe Biden,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-16T17:20:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-16T17:36:43-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/245178-biden-promotes-private-sector-clean-energy-investments", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Private sector investors should do more to boost spending on clean energy technology, Vice President Joe Biden said on Tuesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Biden promotes private sector clean energy investments"}, "dcterms.title": "Biden promotes private sector clean energy investments"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2300\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOur energy future is in cleaner, cheaper renewable energy, and all of you understand that clean energy investments have provided financial and social returns.\u201dBiden highlighted the work the Obama administration has done on clean energy, including spending on energy programs and tax credits for carbon-free energy sources.\nPart of the solution, he said, is more private sector spending on new clean energy technology.\nSpeaking at a White House clean energy summit, Biden said more needs to be done \u2014 from the government, but especially among private investors \u2014 to create new low-carbon energy technology.\nThe Obama administration attracted $4 billion in commitments from would-be clean energy investors, the White House announced on Monday.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cOnly with the private sector can we fully or even mostly realize the opportunities of this energy transformation."}
