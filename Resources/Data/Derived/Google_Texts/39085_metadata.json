Filibusters are limited to 20 minutes, black turtlenecks have replaced pinstripe suits, and instead of deficits and Obamacare, the GOP are buzzing about out of the box ideas and disruption.\n\nThat\u2019s right\u2014the Republican Party is embracing the TED Talk.\n\nOr they are for this week at least, as House Republicans gather on the Eastern Shore of Maryland for their annual retreat, a gathering that is self-consciously modeling itself on those \u201cIdeas Worth Spreading\u201d that have dominated drone office lunch breaks for the last decade.\n\nThe retreat is the brainchild of Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a lawmaker from Eastern Washington and the fourth-ranking Republican in the House who\u2019s already brought some west coast sensibility to her post: Her office walls are painted a multi-colored bright hue more likely to be found in Silicon Valley, and there\u2019s a framed sign in the lobby that reads, \u201cIf You Could Do One Thing, What Would It Be?\u201d She\u2019s installed an \u201cInnovation Lounge\u201d in the back of her office suite and converted part of her office into a \u201cGOP Lab\u201d where members or their staff can learn tools like Photoshop or Final Cut pro.\n\nNate Hodson, a spokesman for McMorris Rodgers, says the conference was looking for \u201coutside the box, TED Talk type speakers so members would be challenged to think about what is possible in the realm of public policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted people who approach problems in their fields in ways you wouldn\u2019t have thought of,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is just so easy to get trapped in the same ways of thinking because that is the culture here on the Hill.\u201d\n\nTo wit, in addition to the usual slate of conservative stalwarts like National Review editor Ramesh Ponnuru, pollster Frank Luntz, and celebrities like football coach Lou Holtz and Army Ranger Sean Parnell, a handful of unusual guests are slated to speak; guests that aren\u2019t usually associated with a political party struggling to shake off its reputation as a hidebound enclave for old white men.\n\nThere\u2019s Simon Sinek, a motivational speaker whose Twitter biography simply says, \u201cTo run & jump & laugh & cry & love & hope & imagine\u2026to experience as much as I can all for purpose: to inspire,\u201d and whose 2007 TED talk, \u201cHow Great Leaders Inspire Action\u201d remains one of the series\u2019 most popular. In fact, that talk begat a bestselling book, Start With Why, that argues, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you do, it matters Why you do it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s Odest Chadwicke Jenkins, a robotics research at Brown, and Henry Evans, who was left mute and completely paralyzed after a stroke at the age of 40, but thanks to Jenkins\u2019 work, is able to communicate using a computer that only requires slight movement of the head and fingers. (The two also have a popular TED Talk.)\n\nAdd to the list Rich Thau, who, according to his website is \u201can industry leader in scientifically testing and refining the effectiveness of business and issue-advocacy presentations, moment-to-moment\u201d (think focus group dials), along with being the co-author of the career advice book Get It Together by 30.\n\nSal Khan, a former Silicon Valley hedge funder who gave up the financial game to found a non-profit called Khan Academy that provides free online educational videos (and, yes, is also the host of a popular TED Talk), is also scheduled to address a roomful of Congressional Republicans. Though, he himself doesn\u2019t exactly know why.\n\n\u201cHopefully they are finding [what I do] a refreshing way to look at issues,\u201d says Khan. \u201cIt is not about technology versus humanity; it is about technology that empowers humans, about taking any system and thinking about it from an orthogonal direction, which can help any problem.\u201d\n\nAlso appearing before the lawmakers? Christine Hassler, a motivation speaker and self-described \u201cachievement addict\u201d who\u2019s (more relevantly for the GOP) an \u201cexpert on Millennials and Generation Yers\u201d that \u201chelps families and corporations understand [millennials] as consumers and employees.\u201d\n\nHassler told The Daily Beast that GOP brass visited her in Los Angeles recently. She says she told them, \u201cMillennials don\u2019t think government is very useful. They think they can make more of an impact building an app or starting a nonprofit.\u201d\n\nAlthough social issues continue to trouble the Republican Party\u2019s relationship with young voters, Hassler hopes to tell the members of Congress that there\u2019s an opening.\n\n\u201cThey have an expectation hangover regarding Obama,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can be at the same time apathetic, uninformed and a little bit disgusted about politics. But there are a lot of issues that I think millennials could really get behind.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "Freedlander"}, "keywords": "Republican Party, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201401291045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Republican Party, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "GOP Invites Friends of TED to Its Party", "tags": "entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "House Republicans invite big thinkers to its annual retreat.", "title": "GOP Invites Friends of TED to Its Party", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/29/gop-invites-friends-of-ted-to-their-party.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/29/gop-invites-friends-of-ted-to-their-party/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1390993836916.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "House Republicans invite big thinkers to its annual retreat.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "David Freedlander", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-01-29T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/david-freedlanderhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/29/gop-invites-friends-of-ted-to-their-party", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"GOP Invites Friends of TED to Its Party\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/29/gop-invites-friends-of-ted-to-their-party.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/29/gop-invites-friends-of-ted-to-their-party/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46366461.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/29/gop-invites-friends-of-ted-to-their-party\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-29T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"David Freedlander\",\"tags\":[\"republican_party\",\"politics\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/d/david-freedlander", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s right\u2014the Republican Party is embracing the TED Talk.\n(The two also have a popular TED Talk.)\nBut there are a lot of issues that I think millennials could really get behind.\u201d\nThink TankHouse Republicans embrace lightbulb moments by bringing big thinkers to its annual retreat.\nFilibusters are limited to 20 minutes, black turtlenecks have replaced pinstripe suits, and instead of deficits and Obamacare, the GOP are buzzing about out of the box ideas and disruption."}
