And hospitals that carry more fixed costs find it more problematic to have fewer admissions, Harold D. Miller, president and CEO of the national Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, wrote in the Gazette.\n\nFixed costs include overhead expenditures for electricity, facility maintenance, equipment and the hospital's property.\n\nTo highlight the problem of fixed costs, Miller cites a hypothetical hospital with $200 million in annual costs and 15,000 patients a year that paid an average of $13,500 per patient for $202.5 million in revenue. Fixed account for two-thirds of the hospital's costs while one third are variable and would decrease with fewer patients.\n\nTherefore, if a community improves primary care so 10 percent fewer people need hospital care, the hospital's variable costs would decrease by 10 percent to $60 million while its fixed costs would remain at $133 million, according to the Gazette. Its total costs drop to $193 million but its revenue also would decrease to $182 million with 10 percent fewer patients for an $11 million loss.\n\nWith industry changes and Affordable Care Act reforms, some hospitals are looking to horizontally integrate to spread fixed costs over a larger revenue base, according to a recent Fitch Ratings report.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Post-Gazette article\n\n- here's the Fitch Ratings statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nIgnore new imaging cost centers at your own financial peril\n\nTelehealth: Money and mission in one sustainable package\n\nPrice of heart attack care on steady rise\n\nHow value-based care will change healthcare\n\nHealthcare spending falls, but patients footing more of the bill", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite national calls to reduce costly hospitalizations and readmissions and enhance primary care, such initiatives don't always take off because they hurt hospitals' bottom line, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Despite national calls to reduce costly hospitalizations and readmissions and enhance primary care, such initiatives don't always take off because they hurt hospitals' bottom line, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.", "title": "Hospitals' fixed costs drive up healthcare expenditures", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospitals-fixed-costs-drive-healthcare-expenditures/2013-10-07", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Fixed Costs,healthcare costs,Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3104\"", "article_summary": "Fixed costs include overhead expenditures for electricity, facility maintenance, equipment and the hospital's property.\nFixed account for two-thirds of the hospital's costs while one third are variable and would decrease with fewer patients.\nThat's because hospitals still have to pay for fixed costs regardless of how many patients they admit or if their services aren't used.\nAnd hospitals that carry more fixed costs find it more problematic to have fewer admissions, Harold D.
