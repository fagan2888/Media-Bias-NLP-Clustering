VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Actor Ryan Reynolds was the victim of a hit-and-run in a hotel parking lot, his publicist and Vancouver police said Sunday.

“While walking, Ryan was struck by a paparazzi driving a car through an underground parking garage,” publicist Leslie Sloane said. “The man fled the scene. Ryan is OK.”

In an email, Brian Montague with Vancouver police said the star was not injured in Friday’s incident. Montague had no further details.

The Vancouver-born Reynolds has been in the city over the past several weeks shooting his new film, “Deadpool.”
