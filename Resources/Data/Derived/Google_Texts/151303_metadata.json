REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\n4663615\n\nFederal officials refuse to identify the troubled Obamacare health co-ops that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has placed in a special risk category requiring \u201cenhanced oversight\u201d due to low profitability or low enrollment.\n\nLast week the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services revealed that 22 of the 23 non-profit co-ops suffered net operating losses last year and that six were so distressed CMS said they were the subject to extra \u201cenhanced oversight.\u201d\n\nCMS spokesman Aaron Albright, however, refused to divulge the names of the struggling taxpayer-supported co-ops.\n\nHe suggested The Daily Caller News Foundation file a Freedom of Information Act request. It\u2019s not uncommon for responses to FOIA requests to take months or even years to be processed by federal departments and agencies.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding the identity of the six ailing co-ops is not sitting well with government watchdog groups.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers deserve to know when any sort of taxpayer-funded entity is failing,\u201d said David Williams, president of the Taxpayer Protection Alliance. \u201cTaxpayers need to know the success or failure of those co-ops. We have to name names.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, the government should be identifying co-ops that are at risk,\u201d noted Scott Amey, the general counsel for the non-partisan Project on Government Oversight. \u201cThe government seems to be just trying to bury its head in the sand.\u201d\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services IG Daniel Levinson was the first to report that six co-ops were in a special risk category within CMS.\n\n\u201cCMS recently placed four CO-OPs on enhanced oversight or corrective action plans and two CO-OPs on low-enrollment warning notifications,\u201d he revealed in his July 30 report.\n\nLevinson further criticized CMS officials, noting that the Obamacare program was now in its third year of existence, yet, \u201cCMS had not established guidelines or criteria to assess whether a CO-OP was viable or sustainable.\u201d\n\nLevinson painted a dismal national picture of the Obamacare health co-ops, noting they were suffering from cash shortages and that their enrollment numbers were \u201cconsiderably lower than the CO-OPs\u2019 initial annual projections.\u201d\n\nSparse enrollments could imperil most of the non-profit co-ops that were originally designed to compete with traditional health insurance companies.\n\n\u201cThe low enrollments and net losses might limit the ability of some CO-OPs to repay startup and solvency loans and to remain viable and sustainable,\u201d Levinson said.\n\nAbout $2 billion have been issued in start-up and solvency loans under Obamacare.\n\nRating agency Standard and Poor\u2019s last February identified 10 co-ops that failed to enroll 6,000 or fewer customers through the third quarter of last year.\n\nThose low enrollment co-ops are operating in Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Connecticut, Arizona, Tennessee, Michigan, Maryland and two in Oregon.\n\nIn that report, S&P optimistically claimed that one co-op, operating in Iowa and Nebraska, called Co-Opportunity Health, had enrolled 91,000 customers.\n\nBut Co-Opportunity abruptly closed its doors last December and by February the state had liquidated it.\n\nAt the time, the Iowa co-op suffered $163 million in operating losses, according to the Iowa insurance commissioner. CMS originally awarded $145 million under Obamacare.\n\nLikewise, S&P also reported that the Louisiana Health CO-OP had successfully enrolled 11,771 customers.\n\nBut last month the co-op announced it was shuttering its doors by the end of the year. CMS had loaned that co-op $66 million.\n\nSimilar to the experiences reported in Iowa and Louisiana, most of the non-profit health co-ops have been burning through their federal loans at an alarming rate, according to financial reporting agencies.\n\nInsurance ratings firm A.M. Best warned in January that as of Sept. 30, 2014, \u201cthe ratio of surplus notes outstanding to capital and surplus exceeded 100% for all of the co-ops.\u201d\n\nA Standard & Poor\u2019s Report on the co-ops reported that the worst performing co-ops that were burning through their existing capital were in Illinois, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Maryland.\n\nThomas Miller of the American Enterprise Institute and Grace-Marie Turner, the president of the free market Galen Institute reported that net losses for all the co-ops amounted to $614 million in 2014.\n\nLast year CMS announced that it was replenishing some co-op cash with emergency \u201csolvency loans.\u201d\n\nFive Obamacare health insurance co-ops in Connecticut, Kentucky, Maine, New York and Wisconsin received solvency loans in 2014 amounting to $322 million.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Richard Pollock", "description": "Federal officials refuse to identify troubled co-ops underwritten by taxpayer money", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Federal officials refuse to identify the troubled Obamacare health co-ops that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has placed in a special risk category requiring \"enhanced oversight\u201d due", "title": "Obama Administration Refuses To Identify Troubled Healthcare Co-Ops", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/08/03/obama-administration-refuses-to-identify-troubled-healthcare-co-ops/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-17T113240Z_1_CBREA3G0W2K00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-e1398903638245.jpg", "height": 344}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Federal officials refuse to identify troubled co-ops underwritten by taxpayer money", "title": "Obama Administration Refuses To Identify Troubled Healthcare Co-Ops Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/08/03/obama-administration-refuses-to-identify-troubled-healthcare-co-ops/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-17T113240Z_1_CBREA3G0W2K00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-e1398903638245.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-03 23:07:35", "sailthru.title": "Obama Administration Refuses To Identify Troubled Healthcare Co-Ops", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "department-of-health-and-human-services,obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "centers for medicare and medicaid services,department of health and human services,inspectors general,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Federal officials refuse to identify the troubled Obamacare health co-ops that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has placed in a special risk category requiring \"enhanced oversight\u201d due", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-17T113240Z_1_CBREA3G0W2K00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-e1398903638245.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "REUTERS/Mike Segar4663615Federal officials refuse to identify the troubled Obamacare health co-ops that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has placed in a special risk category requiring \u201cenhanced oversight\u201d due to low profitability or low enrollment.\nIn that report, S&P optimistically claimed that one co-op, operating in Iowa and Nebraska, called Co-Opportunity Health, had enrolled 91,000 customers.\nThose low enrollment co-ops are operating in Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Connecticut, Arizona, Tennessee, Michigan, Maryland and two in Oregon.\nLikewise, S&P also reported that the Louisiana Health CO-OP had successfully enrolled 11,771 customers.\n\u201cCMS recently placed four CO-OPs on enhanced oversight or corrective action plans and two CO-OPs on low-enrollment warning notifications,\u201d he revealed in his July 30 report."}
