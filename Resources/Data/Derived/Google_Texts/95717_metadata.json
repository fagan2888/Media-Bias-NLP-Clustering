Why the cover up? Why the dissembling about the cause of the murder of our ambassador on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil? We deserve answers to this. President Obama\u2019s shuck and jive shtick with these Benghazi lies must end,\u201d she wrote on her Facebook page in October of last year.\n\nJust a few hours later, she took to her Facebook page again to defend the phrase.\n\n\u201cFor the record, there was nothing remotely racist in my use of the phrase \u2018shuck and jive,\u2019\u201d she wrote, pointing to a handful of instances in some on the left have used the word as her proof.\n\nRush Limbaugh has used the phrase to criticize Obama in just the last few weeks, calling the president\u2019s Syria plan \u201coperation shuck and jive\u201d in comparison to President George W. Bush\u2019s \u201coperation shock and awe.\u201d\n\nThe phrase was examined by the mainstream media in 2008 when Hillary Clinton supporter Andrew Cuomo used the phrase in reference to Obama, and as we learned, \u201cshuck\u201d has its roots in African-American slave culture.\n\nThe Online Etymology Dictionary explains:\n\n[B]lack senses probably fr[om] the fact that black slaves sang and shouted gleefully during corn-shucking season, and this behavior, along with lying and teasing, became a part of the protective and evasive behavior normally adopted towards white people in \u201ctraditional\u201d race relations; the sense of \u201cswindle\u201d is perhaps related to the mid-1800s term to be shucked out, \u201cbe defeated, be denied victory,\u201d which suggests that the notion of stripping someone as an ear of corn is stripped may be basic in the semantics. [\u201cDictionary of American Slang\u201d]\n\n\u201cJive\u201d has similar origins, according to the Online Etymology Dictionary. Derived from \u201cblack English,\u201d though only dating back to the middle of the 20th century.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A Republican National Committee member from Arizona has drawn some ire after accusing President Obama of \"shucking and jiving.\"", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/another-republican-accuses-obama-shuck", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "A Republican National Committee member from Arizona has drawn some ire after accusing President Obama of \"shucking and jiving.\"", "title": "Another Republican accuses Obama of 'shuck and jive'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/another-republican-accuses-obama-shuck", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/2013/09/180777151.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/another-republican-accuses-obama-shuck", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/2013/09/180777151.jpg?itok=0TCHn5xv", "height": 553}, "title": "Another Republican accuses Obama of 'shuck and jive'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A Republican National Committee member from Arizona has drawn some ire after accusing President Obama of \"shucking and jiving.\""}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-27T15:50:12-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "morganwhitaker", "tags": "equality,race,republicans,society,tea-party,politicsnation", "contentId": "http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/09/27/another-republican-accuses-obama-of-shuck-and-jive/", "title": "Another Republican accuses Obama of 'shuck and jive'", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/another-republican-accuses-obama-shuck", "date": "09/27/2013 15:50:12 EDT", "published": 1}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "A Republican National Committee member from Arizona has drawn some ire after accusing President Obama of \"shucking and jiving.\"", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Equality, Race, Republicans, Society, Tea Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa3e\"", "article_summary": "Sarah Palin accused Obama of using a \u201dshuck and jive shtick\u201d in a jab against the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the consulate attack in Benghazi, Libya.\nPresident Obama\u2019s shuck and jive shtick with these Benghazi lies must end,\u201d she wrote on her Facebook page in October of last year.\n\u201cThere is nothing in my lexicon that has racial overtones.\u201dAsh is far from the only Republican to use the \u201cshuck and jive\u201d phrase in reference to Obama, nor the only one to say it wasn\u2019t racially charged.\nJust a few hours later, she took to her Facebook page again to defend the phrase.\n\u201cFor the record, there was nothing remotely racist in my use of the phrase \u2018shuck and jive,\u2019\u201d she wrote, pointing to a handful of instances in some on the left have used the word as her proof."}
