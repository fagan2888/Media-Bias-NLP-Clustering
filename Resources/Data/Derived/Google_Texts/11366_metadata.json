Really, it\u2019s right there in our bible \u2026 or it will be as soon as I write it.\n\nThose tenets alone should guarantee a sizeble membership, but if that\u2019s not enough I could toss in objections to prohibitions against underage drinking or perhaps shooting people whose carry-on bags are too big.\n\nA year or two ago, I might have doubted whether my new religion would draw much of a congregation. I mean, what are the chances that government would let you ignore a law just because you say you have a moral objection to it?\n\nWhen the draft was in effect, you could claim you were a conscientious objector. But that didn\u2019t get you out of serving; it just meant they didn\u2019t give you a gun. A special federal law protected Indians who might, say, ingest peyote as a religious observance, but I was under no illusion that I could fire up a joint and tell the police, \u201cLike, it\u2019s my religion, man.\u201d\n\nBut ever since the Hobby Lobby ruling, I\u2019ve been inspired, polishing the collection plates and looking for a radio network with some free airtime on a Sunday morning.\n\nI\u2019m sensing the recognition of a new right in this country \u2014 the right to refuse to do whatever you don\u2019t feel like doing.\n\nHobby Lobby, a \u201cclosely held corporation\u201d \u2014 that is, a company run by a handful of nuts rather than thousands of nuts \u2014 decided it didn\u2019t need to abide by the Affordable Care Act, because it objected to a mandate that its health insurance provide certain contraceptives to female employees.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court agreed, in a 5-4 decision. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, predicting that \u201cthe Court, I fear, has ventured into a minefield.\u201d Supporters of the decision scoffed. But on its heels came cases involving a college that declined to even fill out the forms asking for a contraceptive exemption, others objecting to negotiating with unions, and a fundamentalist sect that was accused of using child labor. Coming soon, no doubt: objections to the minimum wage, anti-discrimination laws \u2026 use your imagination.\n\nWhile the corporations have been finding religion, individual citizens haven\u2019t sat idle.\n\nAccording to the National Women\u2019s Law Center, there have been reports in 24 states of pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions for birth control. That includes pharmacists who refused to let women have nonprescription emergency contraception that the pharmacy had in stock.\n\nWhat\u2019s next? A teetotaler clerk at Publix refusing to sell me a bottle of wine? Maybe that\u2019s not so far-fetched. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2013 sued a trucking company that fired two Muslim drivers who refused to deliver alcohol.\n\nIn a closely followed case in New Mexico, a wedding photographer refused to work with a gay couple, citing religious beliefs. The state Supreme Court ruled that the photographer was illegally discriminating, and amazingly (well, I was amazed) the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case. The Alliance Defending Freedom, which was in the photographer\u2019s corner, vowed to be back with new cases.\n\nWhich brings us to this week.\n\nIn North Carolina, after two federal judges told the state that its ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, gay marriage finally became legal. Happy couples headed to their local town halls to \u2026 oh, wait.\n\nThe North Carolina Values Coalition (I love these names) advised public officials that they didn\u2019t have to sanction same-sex marriage if it conflicted with their religious values. And indeed, in Pasquotank County, a magistrate refused to marry two men. In Rockingham County, another magistrate had the decency to resign rather than simply refuse to do his job.\n\nNorth Carolina state Sen. Phil Berger, a Republican and president pro tempore for the 2013-14 session, has promised to introduce legislation that would protect those officials.\n\n\u201cComplying with the new marriage law imposed by the courts should not require our state employees to compromise their core religious beliefs and First Amendment rights in order to protect their livelihoods,\u201d Berger said.\n\nIn more liberal circles, this proposal is being called the \u201clicense to discriminate.\u201d\n\nThis is where my new church comes in.\n\nWith a few more laws like this, and if we can just get the U.S. Supreme Court to get rid of its silly little distinction between supplying birth control and paying taxes as legal obligations, I think I\u2019ll have a winner.\n\nAfter all, where does this end? If you have a right to ignore the law when it comes to women and gay couples, what\u2019s next? Refusing to serve meals to people based on race? Refusing hotel rooms based on the customer\u2019s religion? What law would have any meaning?\n\nWe are free to practice our religion, but we aren\u2019t free to hurt others or take away their rights in the process.\n\nBut just in case \u2014 has anyone got a snappy name for my new church?\n\nContact Mark Hohmeister at mhohmeister@tallahassee.com or (850) 599-2330.
