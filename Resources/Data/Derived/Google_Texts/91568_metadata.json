Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged his colleagues on Sunday to not enact a new round of sanctions against Iran, arguing that it could muck up nuclear negotiations with the country.\n\nAppearing on \"Fox News Sunday,\" the Vermont Democrat called the new sanctions bill a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell you why,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have voted for sanctions, very tough, and I have voted for very tough sanctions on Iran. Right now we have P5+1 of the countries working with Iran on this. We have people who have joined us on the sanctions. If they look like we are prejudging the negotiations, they are going to say: \u2018Hey, United States, you are on your own.\u2019 They are going to start pulling away \u2026\u201d\n\nHost Chris Wallace asked Leahy if he believed approval of a new round of sanctions would be tantamount to a declaration of war, as asserted by the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cI think if we do that we screw up the ability to have real negotiations,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf the negotiations fail, if Iran is seen as cheating, we will impose more sanctions in a nanosecond, both the House and Senate will. Don\u2019t do it prematurely. Because if you are trying to negotiate something, you don\u2019t have a third party \u2013- in this case the Congress \u2013- coming in and getting involved in that negotiation. \u201c\n\nLeahy has been openly critical of S.1881, the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013. But he also is in the minority with his opinion. The bill currently has the support of 59 Senators, which is an impressive total but not the 67 needed to overcome a president\u2019s veto, as the administration has pledged.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has said he has no current plans to bring the bill to the floor, which means that chances of passage are remote. But the White House has taken the matter seriously enough that during a meeting with Senate Democrats this past week, the president urged lawmakers in strong terms to drop the push for an additional round of sanctions.\n\nDefenders of the bill note that the sanctions would only be implemented should Iran violate the terms of the agreement it has struck to stop and even downgrade some of its enrichment operations. And those sanctions would only come after the six-month window of negotiations. Appearing alongside Leahy on \"Fox News Sunday,\" former NSA Director Michael Hayden argued that the president should get \u201cas much running room as possible when it comes to negotiations like this.\u201d\n\nBut he also seemed to embrace the bad-cop role that Congress was playing by considering a new round of sanctions.\n\n\u201cI think having that congressional action just off stage, just in the wing, might actually be a powerful negotiating tool,\u201d he said. \u201cI like the threat of additional sanctions hanging out there.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Longest Serving Senators In U.S. History Longest Serving Senators In U.S. History\n\n1 of 25 Robert Byrd (D-W.V.)
