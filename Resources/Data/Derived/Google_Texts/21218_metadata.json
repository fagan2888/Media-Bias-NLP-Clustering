Not to mention that she has already mounted a presidential bid once before, during the 2008 Democratic primary. With quite a following among Democrats -- particularly women -- and an expert campaigner as a husband, Clinton is one of the frontrunners for the 2016 nomination. In fact, if the Iowa caucuses were held today, a Public Policy Polling survey found she would win 58 percent of the vote, outstripping the runner-up, Vice President Joe Biden, by a margin of 41 percent. Now the question is whether or not Clinton will decide to throw her hat in the ring in 2016. After her term as secretary of state ends this year, she has declared her intention to take a year off from politics entirely. And after that? Clinton says that she does not want to run in 2016, but that hasn't quashed hopes to the contrary. -- Sarah Bufkin", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Republican multimillionaire is behind a new ad urging women to vote against ...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-09-23 13:40:35 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "A Republican multimillionaire is behind a new ad urging women to vote against ...", "title": "Bizarre GOP Ad Paints Women As Obama's Girlfriends", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/22/obama-women_n_5862004.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2087250/images/o-OBAMA-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Republican multimillionaire is behind a new ad urging women to vote against ...", "creator": "SamLachman", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2087250/images/o-OBAMA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Bizarre GOP Ad Paints Women As Obama's Girlfriends", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-22 13:40:35 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5862004", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "elections 2014,politics,HuffPolitics blog,Politics News,video,women voters,campaign ads,obama,Americans for Shared Prosperity,John Jordan,gop ads,Barack Obama", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "elections 2014,politics,HuffPolitics blog,Politics News,video,women voters,campaign ads,obama,Americans for Shared Prosperity,John Jordan,gop ads,Barack Obama", "published_time": "2014-09-22 13:40:35 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-09-22 14:59:06 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa89\"", "article_summary": "After her term as secretary of state ends this year, she has declared her intention to take a year off from politics entirely.\nWith quite a following among Democrats -- particularly women -- and an expert campaigner as a husband, Clinton is one of the frontrunners for the 2016 nomination.\nClinton says that she does not want to run in 2016, but that hasn't quashed hopes to the contrary.\nNow the question is whether or not Clinton will decide to throw her hat in the ring in 2016.\nNot to mention that she has already mounted a presidential bid once before, during the 2008 Democratic primary."}
