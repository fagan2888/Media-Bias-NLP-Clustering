RENO — My pre-game story from the late Nevada-Colorado State matchup is posted here, and it will run through early editions. It was a lot of fun to do, since I visited the Sambrailo family tailgate north of Mackay Stadium and talked with the parents of the Rams’ standout left tackle, Ty Sambrailo.

And in the glare of the late afternoon sunlight, these are the photos I came up with, using my cell phone.

OK, this shows why we have the true pros, the real photographers, on the staff.
