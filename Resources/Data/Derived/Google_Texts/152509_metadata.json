Although there were variations, the joke went something like this: a guy calls a pizza place and asks for a large pepperoni. The operator stops him and says he has already had his fill of pepperoni for this month, and he is way over his cheese quota. He also mentions that his cholesterol is high and he is a borderline diabetic, so he can have a tofu pizza.\n\n\u201cWhere did you get all of that information,\u201d the caller demands?\n\n\u201cWell, from your public records \u2026 from the government.\u201d\n\nIt is not a joke anymore. A new vending machine has been released and is about to hit the coffee-break room near you. It can tell you when you can and cannot buy junk food. That\u2019s right folks, a vending machine that tells you what you can eat.\n\nA report in the Telegraph indicates the new vending machines use facial-recognition software to determine who you are and your dietary restrictions. The Luce X 2 vending machine was debuted in October of this year.\n\nThe machine can learn your preferences, but it can also deny sales based on age, medical records, daily nutrition requirements, and even your purchasing history. You\u2019ve already bought a pack of smokes today? Well, sorry, you\u2019ve had enough. Bought too many lottery tickets? Sorry, you\u2019ll just have to wait till the next drawing.\n\nEach unit can be programmed to meet the owner\u2019s desires or personal limitations, but how long before this becomes a government mandated set of restrictions? Not possible? Think again.\n\nIn March of this year the UK Health Department ordered restaurants to cut the sizes of pizzas and other items to lower the caloric intake of the populace. Obamacare has regulations on food labeling, and who can forget the banning of trans fats and sodas of a certain size in New York City?\n\nRonald Reagan famously said, \u201cthe scariest words in the English language are, \u2018I\u2019m here from the government and I\u2019m here to help.'\u201d Reagan nailed it.\n\nYet since the Supreme Court approval of the mandatory clause of the Affordable Care Act, government really has no limits, as long as they include a tax (that isn\u2019t a tax, until it is) to enforce the mandate. You don\u2019t want to do it? No problem; just pay a tax. There is also no limit on how high that tax can be.\n\nAnother US president, Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us of the \u201cmilitary-industrial complex.\u201d In all honesty, that doesn\u2019t worry me anymore. What worries me is the \u201ccorporate-government complex.\u201d The cronies are likely waxing the palms of political coffers as we speak getting ready to introduce test legislation at the state or local level to implement mandatory use of these kinds of machines. The proposal will likely be sold as a away to help dieters and protect children and a tax.\n\nSo where will they get all of the age, dietary restrictions, and health information from? Do you really have to ask?\n\nNot to rub it in, (okay I\u2019m really rubbing it in) but smokers have been saying this was coming for years. Once you regulate personal behavior in the name of health and cost to others, you open the door to total regulation for everyone. As I have said many times before, \u201cgranting government power over something you hate, is granting government power over something you love; it\u2019s not a slippery slope, it is historical fact.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new vending machine has been released and is about to hit a coffee-break room near you.
