UnitedHealth, the Medicare Advantage provider with the most enrolled members of any company serving more than one state, ranked near the bottom of 30 multi-state providers in call center customer service in 2013.

That was among the findings in a HealthPocket analysis of government data on Medicare Advantage call center customer service. HealthPocket, a free website that compares and ranks health insurance plans, studied several major customer service categories tracked by the government: overall call center customer service, dropped calls, on-hold time and accuracy of information received.
