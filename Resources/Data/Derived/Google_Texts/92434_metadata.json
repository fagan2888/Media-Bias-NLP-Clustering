He and his brother, Crandy Johnson, live on the small reservation, which straddles the line between Lewiston, New York, and the neighboring town of Sanborn.\n\nA hunter/gatherer tribe, the Tuscarora also planted a wide variety of crops, Tracy said. The area once was covered in rich farmland and orchards.\n\n\u201cEverything that grew in the Garden of Eden grew here,\u201d he said. \u201cAt one point all this was solid hemp. They planted it as far as the eye could see.\u201d\n\nYet as the original land base has shifted and diminished, so have the traditions, including the rich but often controversial history of hemp.\n\nThis is the story of a displaced tribe, one that was crucial to the survival of early European settlers and essential in the Revolutionary War, yet one that now survives on only a few miles of land and whose traditions are being lost to time, geography and interpretation.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nOral stories place the Tuscarora as original inhabitants of New York and part of the Iroquois Confederacy, said Rick Hill, who is Tuscarora and senior project coordinator of the Indigenous Knowledge Center at Six Nations Polytechnic, in Ontario, Canada.\n\nLooking for better hunting grounds, they migrated to Virginia and the Carolinas, where their estimated population prior to European contact was about 6,000 people, states an 1881 autobiography by Elias Johnson, an early Tuscarora chief.\n\nBy 1700, European settlers were tapping into the tribe\u2019s traditional wisdom and borrowing farming techniques. Whatever amicable relationship they started with, however, soon shifted. In the years prior to the Revolutionary War, Europeans kidnapped Tuscarora children and sold them as slaves, advertising people for sale alongside bales of cotton.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, they were taking us as slaves, putting us on the market in New Orleans, Boston, Baltimore, all over the East Coast,\u201d said Crandy Johnson. \u201cEvery port we were sold. Signs said \u2018Tuscarora slaves for sale; also, six bales of cotton.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Tuscarora War, which raged in North Carolina from 1711 to 1715, pitted the Tuscarora against the British, Dutch and German settlers, who enlisted other tribes to fight on their side. After their defeat, many of the Tuscarora migrated back to New York, where they were welcomed in 1722 into the Iroquois Confederacy, becoming the final tribe comprising the Six Nations of New York\u2014or the Haudenosaunee\u2014which consisted of the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas and Senecas.\n\nChief Clinton Rickard, a Tuscarora leader born in 1882 in Lewiston, wrote about the migration north in his 1973 autobiography.\n\n\u201cWhen the Europeans came to our land and settled near the Tuscarora, there was controversy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe whites wanted our land, and they kidnapped our children for slavery. This caused war. As a result of these wars, my people moved back north again where the Oneida kindly received them.\u201d\n\nRickard added a final sentence to the passage: \u201cOur people followed the white roots of peace to the source.\u201d That refers to the Iroquois Tree of Peace, planted at the founding of the Iroquois Confederacy in 1451. Legend states that all weapons of war were thrown into a cavern beneath the tree and the warring nations joined together in a \u201cperpetual league of peace.\u201d\n\nYet the confederacy never accepted the Tuscarora in the same manner as the other five tribes. Chiefs never had equal voice and Tuscarora are still considered subordinate within the confederacy, often referred to as the younger sibling to the Oneidas and Cayugas, Rickard wrote.\n\nShifting land\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, during which most Tuscaroras and Oneidas sided with America against the British, the Seneca gave the Tuscarora some land near Niagara Falls\u2014the beginning of the present-day reservation.\n\nThe reservation increased in size to about nine square miles, Hill said, but even that small sliver of land has been endangered almost from the beginning. It consists of three plots: the Seneca gift, land donated by the Holland Land Company and a parcel the tribe purchased with funds after selling land in South Carolina. That last piece is held in trust by the federal government.\n\nThen, in the 1950s, the New York State Power Authority grabbed one-fifth of the land to build a reservoir. According to Rickard, the state offered $3 million for the land and planned to relocate homes and a cemetery to accommodate the project.\n\nThe case ultimately went before the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled against the tribe, finding that the land was not a federally protected reservation because the title belonged to the tribe and not the government.\n\n\u201cIt is seldom easy for a white person to understand why our lands are dear to us,\u201d Rickard wrote. \u201cA large portion of the land that we had so carefully accumulated 180 years earlier to compensate us for the loss of our North Carolina lands and to provide a homeland for our people forever had been wrenched from us by a government that was supposed to protect us.\u201d\n\nAccording to Crandy Johnson, the land struggle is representative of the tribe\u2019s subsequent loss of culture and tradition, including the use of hemp.\n\n\u201cAs Tuscarora, we are born into a struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wars are over, but we\u2019re still under termination orders. We\u2019re losing our inherent, God-given right to land, to herbs, to spiritual refinement and our sacred relationship with the earth.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tracy Johnson says the plateau overlooking Niagara Falls and nestled among the Finger Lakes of northwestern New York once was covered in hemp.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/26/people-hemp-part-1-losing-land-culture-tradition-157074", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/people-of-the-hemp-randy-wegerski-closeup.jpeg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "People of the Hemp, Part 1: Losing Land, Culture, Tradition"}, "abstract": "Tracy Johnson says the plateau overlooking Niagara Falls and nestled among the Finger Lakes of northwestern New York once was covered in hemp.", "dc": {"title": "People of the Hemp, Part 1: Losing Land, Culture, Tradition"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/26/people-hemp-part-1-losing-land-culture-tradition-157074", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Tuscarora Nation, Hemp, Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy, Native American History, Cannibis", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-09-26T15:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "People of the Hemp, Part 1: Losing Land, Culture, Tradition"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019re losing our inherent, God-given right to land, to herbs, to spiritual refinement and our sacred relationship with the earth.\u201d\nIt consists of three plots: the Seneca gift, land donated by the Holland Land Company and a parcel the tribe purchased with funds after selling land in South Carolina.\nThen, in the 1950s, the New York State Power Authority grabbed one-fifth of the land to build a reservoir.\nThe way Tracy Johnson tells it, the plateau of land overlooking Niagara Falls and nestled among the Finger Lakes of northwestern New York once was covered in fields of hemp.\n\u201cWhen the Europeans came to our land and settled near the Tuscarora, there was controversy,\u201d he wrote."}
