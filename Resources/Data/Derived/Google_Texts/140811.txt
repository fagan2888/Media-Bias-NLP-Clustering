America's terrible first quarter wasn't as bad as we thought.

The third and final revision of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) came in at -0.2%, right in line with expectations.

In April, the first estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed a GDP print of -0.2%.

The second revision released a month later pushed down the GDP print to -0.7%.

So this final estimate, while negative, is an improvement.

The report also showed that personal consumption rose 2.1%, beating expectations.

Economists had forecast that personal spending rose to 1.9% from 1.8%, according to Bloomberg.

Wall Street had forecast 2% GDP growth in Q1, but that eluded the economy, and it changed its story in just a few weeks.

The Atlanta Fed, which nailed the first-quarter flop, sees the economy bouncing back in Q2 with 1.9% growth.

Q1 real #GDP revised up half of a point to -0.2% on the back of stronger consumption, construction and inventory building. â€” Joseph A. LaVorgna (@Lavorgnanomics) June 24, 2015

In a client email, Barclays economists wrote that they're looking past the first quarter weakness altogether (emphasis added): "Other data on labor markets, including jobless claims, payroll growth, and the unemployment rate, and readings on the ISM surveys are more consistent with a modest pace of economic activity. Given the adverse weather early in the year, the significant distortions to trade from the port strikes on the West Coast, and the effect of residual seasonality that has consistently suppressed growth in Q1 relative to remaining quarters during the recovery, we are inclined to look through the softness in the GDP statistics."
