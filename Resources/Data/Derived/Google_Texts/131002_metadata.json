His latest book is: \u201c The Power of RELENTLESS! \u201d Dubbed by the media as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist,\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years. Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nThe biased, clueless liberal mainstream media are in shock and awe. They have no idea why so many Americans love Donald Trump. But the answer is so simple and clear. Just ask any conservative.\n\nDonald Trump is a breath of fresh air. Donald Trump is the answer to what ails America \u2013 simply because he kills two birds with one stone.\n\nAmerica has two big problems. America is under attack by a vicious one-two combination. America has been ruined by two parties. And Donald Trump\u2019s mouth solves both problems. Donald Trump\u2019s mouth is a nuclear weapon.\n\nAmerica is being lost because the GOP is bringing knives to a gunfight. Share:\n\nDemocrats clearly hate American exceptionalism, capitalism, entrepreneurship, and Judeo-Christian values. They hate business owners (see \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that\u201d) and appear to blame American patriotism, white people, business owners and Christians for every problem in the world today.\n\nThe Democrat Party is riddled with socialists, Marxists and communists hell bent on \u201cfundamentally changing America.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat Party is filled with frauds (see President Barack Obama, Jonathan Gruber and the lies used to sell Obamacare); traitors (see Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry and the new Iran nuclear treaty); thieves and conmen (see the scandal involving $2 billion donated to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state); reckless wasters of taxpayer money (see Obama\u2019s Kenya trip that cost us over $50 million dollars for one day in a country that offers America NOTHING ); and outright criminals (see Hillary\u2019s upcoming criminal investigation and Obama\u2019s use of the IRS to target, persecute and even attempt to imprison political opponents and critics).\n\nBut the GOP may be worse.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything worse than evil, it\u2019s cowardice in the face of evil. The GOP leadership is riddled with cowards, wimps and na\u00efve, feckless, country club powder puffs who have no clue how to fight back against the Democrats ruining America and destroying our children\u2019s future with debt. Yes, Democrats are the bad guys. But Republicans are standing by helplessly, scared and petrified, allowing it to happen.\n\nI suspect many of the Republican leaders in Washington, D.C. are either being bribed or blackmailed. Exhibit A is Supreme Court Justice Roberts, House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. These guys are all either bought and paid for; or someone is holding a gun to their heads (along with a photo of them in bed doing something shocking). Don\u2019t believe me? See the criminal case against former Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert. They are all doing something morally wrong, or breaking some law. And Obama\u2019s partners in the National Security Administration and IRS are always watching. America is being lost because the GOP is bringing knives to a gunfight.\n\nThe only way to save America is to bring a nuclear weapon to a gun fight. And Donald Trump\u2019s mouth is a nuclear weapon.\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop being \u201cnice.\u201d \u201cNice\u201d is okay for playing golf with Muffy at the country club. But \u201cnice\u201d doesn\u2019t work in politics. \u201cNice\u201d guys finish last in politics. \u201cNice\u201d is getting our country ruined. \u201cNice\u201d is killing middle class jobs. \u201cNice\u201d is wiping out middle class incomes. \u201cNice\u201d has led to negative GDP growth. \u201cNice\u201d has led to more businesses closing than opening each day for the first time in America\u2019s history. \u201cNice\u201d has left the border wide open to an illegal alien invasion, the bankruptcy of America and a terrorist attack like Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n\u201cNice\u201d has led to disaster and disgrace all over the globe. The world no longer has any respect for, or fear of America. We are in decline and disarray. We are headed for collapse and disaster.\n\nInto this crisis steps \u201cthe nuclear mouth\u201d Donald Trump. He isn\u2019t afraid to put America first. He isn\u2019t afraid to tell the truth. He isn\u2019t afraid of what the media thinks. He isn\u2019t afraid of being called a \u201cracist\u201d for pointing out how Obama has damaged and destroyed America. He isn\u2019t afraid to question Obama\u2019s very mysterious, questionable and troubling past \u2013 much of it sealed away in darkness.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t afraid to fight like our future is on the line because he understands it is. He isn\u2019t afraid to offend. He isn\u2019t afraid to expose the cowards and frauds in his own GOP leadership for what they are. He refuses to be \u201cpolitically correct\u201d when he sees corruption and idiocy. He won\u2019t back down or apologize for telling the truth.\n\nOf course the evil Democrats, corrupt and cowardly GOP leadership, and biased mainstream media hate him. They are all rooting for another Mitt Romney. Let\u2019s compare Mitt to Donald Trump:\n\nThey are both rich white guys. Both famous successful businessmen. Both Republican presidential candidates past and present. That\u2019s where the similarity ends.\n\nMitt Romney is a very nice guy. Mitt has manners. Mitt would never offend anyone. Mitt let the media run roughshod over him. Mitt would never say something rude or offensive about Obama or Hillary. Mitt would never accuse them of crimes against the American people. Mitt would never prosecute Obama or Hillary if he was elected.\n\nAnd one other difference: Mitt lost.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that Mitt lost. The last thing we need now is \u201cnice.\u201d It\u2019s also no coincidence that the people in power (evil Democrats, the corrupt GOP leadership, and the mainstream media) all want another Mitt Romney. They want the status quo. They want to keep the bribes and blackmail coming. They don\u2019t want anyone to upset the apple cart.\n\nThey are scared to death of Donald Trump, who doesn\u2019t play by traditional rules or etiquette. They are scared to death of a guy who can\u2019t be bribed. They are scared to death of a guy who speaks about the hopes, dreams and fears of middle class Americans. They are scared to death of a street fighter. They are scared to death of a candidate who is as relentless for saving America\u2026as Obama is for destroying America. Donald Trump understands what I call, \u201cThe Power of Relentless.\u201d\n\nMostly, they are scared to death of Trump\u2019s mouth. The kind of mouth that could stir up a citizen revolution and topple \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in Washington, D.C.\n\nYes Donald Trump\u2019s mouth is a nuclear weapon. And that\u2019s precisely why we love him.\n\nBombs away!\n\nWayne Allyn Root is known as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist.\u201d Wayne\u2019s latest book is: \u201cThe Power of RELENTLESS!\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, bestselling author, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years.
