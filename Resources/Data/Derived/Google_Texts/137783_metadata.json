The future is now clear \u2014 Trump or Hillary. It is time for the party to set aside our differences and unite around the people\u2019s choice in order to regain the White House and maintain a Republican majority in Congress so we can successfully enact Republican priorities into law.\n\nWith Hillary, we know what lies ahead for America \u2014 four more years of the Obama administration, which has given us a failing healthcare system, an anemic economy burdened by over-regulation, and a disarmed America left vulnerable to appeasement foreign policy.\n\nLogin required We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us.

Instead, Oklahomans endured a 35.7 percent increase in their premiums this past year, and constituents regularly notify me of losing access to their preferred doctor or their healthcare plan. On the campaign trail, Hillary embraces this failed legacy when she reminds her base at rallies that, \u201cbefore \u2018ObamaCare\u2019 it was called \u2018HillaryCare.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnder the Obama administration, we have experienced the slowest economic recovery in our nation\u2019s history, in large part due to over-regulation. This is most obvious in the Obama administration\u2019s EPA, which developed the president\u2019s carbon mandates called the Clean Power Plan that would cost our economy $292 billion and result in double-digit electricity increases in 40 states.\n\nThe Supreme Court dealt these carbon mandates a major blow by issuing a stay on its implementation earlier this year. Despite this, Hillary calls the mandates a \u201ccrucial tool\u201d in the climate change battle and says she will make it a \u201ctop priority\u201d in her administration to fight back against a majority in Congress and against 150 entities, to include 27 states, 24 trade association, 37 rural electric co-ops and three labor unions that do not support the Clean Power Plan and are questioning its legality. EPA\u2019s own data shows that the mandates won\u2019t make an impact on climate trends, but with millions of dollars in green campaign donations up for grabs, Hillary is aligning with Obama\u2019s strategy to play to perception rather than admit reality.\n\nThen there is the Waters of the United States rule the Obama administration updated last year that expands the federal government\u2019s ability to regulate on our private lands. Tom Buchanan, president of the Oklahoma Farm Bureau, testified before my committee on this matter, saying that farmers and ranchers\u2019 top concern is how the rules will empower the federal government to dictate farm land practices. The courts have also put a temporary hold on its implementation. Under Hillary, expect these legally questionable, big government mandates to move forward.\n\nWhen it comes to our national security and America\u2019s standing in the world, Hillary and Obama\u2019s similarities couldn\u2019t be more obvious. While Hillary was spearheading Obama\u2019s appeasement foreign policy as Secretary of State, the Clintons were also pocketing millions from foreign governments through the Clinton Foundation. Corruption at its finest. While Obama was downplaying the dangers and growing influence of ISIS, Hillary was dismissing the red flags leading up to the terrorist attack on our U.S. consulate in Benghazi that resulted in the murder of four brave Americans. The media is painting her as a hawk, but the people will remember that under her watch as part of Obama\u2019s cabinet, our allies have come to no longer respect us and our enemies no longer fear us.\n\nThe divide between the values of the Republican Party and the Democrat Party couldn\u2019t be greater. Democrats say our defense spending is unnecessary and that looming catastrophic global warming is more important, that a single-payer health care system is about shared prosperity, and that illegal immigrants deserve to skip over the established legal process to become an American citizen.\n\nRepublicans are for a balanced budget, the right to life, rolling back big government taxes and mandates, and building a strong national defense. Without a Republican in the White House, accomplishing these priorities will be impossible. Let\u2019s move our party forward by taking back the White House in November.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "After a robust Republican primary race, Donald Trump has emerged as our presidential candidate.
