He\u2019d already given his dad Danny \u2014 who is also assistant Netherlands coach \u2014 two gifts to savor on Friday when he launched a pair of pinpoint long passes to set up the first two Dutch goals in the 5-1 thrashing of defending champion Spain in Salvador.\n\nHis commanding play in that match has sparked intense speculation in England that Blind could soon be playing alongside Robin van Persie in the red of Manchester United. Current Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal will take over at Old Trafford next season and attempt to rebuild the team after a disastrous season by the club\u2019s standards.\n\nHe said he was proud of the attention, particularly from England.\n\n\u201cI understand there\u2019s a lot of attention because of Robin playing there and Louis van Gaal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now I\u2019m totally focused on the Netherlands.\u201d\n\nIf Blind were to make the move to England, it would mean him playing for only the third club of his 24-year-old life.\n\nHe joined Ajax when he was eight \u2014 although he kicked balls around the Amsterdam club long before that as Danny captained the team and led it to the Champions League title in 1995 \u2014 with Van Gaal as coach.\n\nRising up through the Amsterdam club\u2019s famous youth program, Blind signed a professional contract in 2007 when he had just turned 17. He extended it last year to the end of the 2016 season. His only football in another shirt came in a brief period on loan to Dutch club Groningen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Daley Blind focused on World Cup not transfer", "author": "Mike Corder", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Daley Blind focused on World Cup not transfer", "title": "Daley Blind focused on World Cup not transfer", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/15/daley_blind_focused_on_world_cup_not_transfer/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-soccer-wcup-netherlands-blind.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Daley Blind focused on World Cup not transfer", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-soccer-wcup-netherlands-blind.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Daley Blind focused on World Cup not transfer", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Daley Blind focused on World Cup not transfer", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe07af\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI understand there\u2019s a lot of attention because of Robin playing there and Louis van Gaal,\u201d he said.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Daley Blind apparently is so wrapped up in the World Cup that Father\u2019s Day passed him by.\nHis commanding play in that match has sparked intense speculation in England that Blind could soon be playing alongside Robin van Persie in the red of Manchester United.\nCurrent Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal will take over at Old Trafford next season and attempt to rebuild the team after a disastrous season by the club\u2019s standards.\nRising up through the Amsterdam club\u2019s famous youth program, Blind signed a professional contract in 2007 when he had just turned 17."}
