It is, I suppose, one of the many substantial differences between blogging and general news reporting.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that some folks who write otherwise excellent pieces do not have the budgets, the time or the staff necessary to stay on a single story the way a major news organization can. On the other hand it does allow for a variety of opinions and fresh perspectives, expressed in ways that sometimes shake up the great, gray media dowagers that for some many years set the tone for what everyone else wrote, published or broadcast.\n\nTwo stories that have not been given enough attention in the general press but with which regular readers of what I post in this space will be familiar \u2013 and the phrase \u201cenough attention\u201d is admittedly subjective \u2013 have seen important developments over the last week that should be shared because, in some small way, they both affirm that the system sometimes does in fact work.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons]\n\nIn the first, the mighty Susan B. Anthony List \u2013 an organization that helps pro-life congressional candidates raise substantial sums of money \u2013 won a stunning victory in front of the Supreme Court earlier this week. The nine justices found the group did in fact have standing to bring a suit over an Ohio law that is a direct attack on its \u2013 and our \u2013 First Amendment rights. While for the moment remaining silent on the underlying issue \u2013 on which they were not asked to rule \u2013 the court affirmed the SBA List could in fact challenge a state law permitting the Ohio Elections Commission \u2013 a state agency \u2013 to determine when political ads contain false statements and, finding they do, to then prosecute those responsible for those ads.\n\nThe whole thing goes back to the passage of Obamacare through the House of Representatives after a group of self-identified anti-abortion Democrats were persuaded to vote in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act based on a now-demonstrably false promise from President Barack Obama. The shorthand version of what happened \u2013 and you can read my initial post on the subject for a more detailed explanation \u2013 is that the SBA List planned a media campaign against those Democrats, one of whom was now-former Ohio Rep. Steve Driehaus, who alleged to the elections commission that the planned billboard included false and damaging information that ultimately caused him to lose his seat in Congress.\n\n[READ: More by Peter Roff]\n\nThe state commission ruled against the SBA List, which then sued only to lose in front of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals \u2013 not on the merits of the case but because, as the election had passed by the time the ruling came down, there was no chance of future injury so the plaintiff lacked standing.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the SBA List ads were truthful and that the commission was wrong to reach the conclusion it did. Nonetheless, the mere existence of \u201cgovernment truth squads\u201d is a threat to the rights guaranteed us in the First Amendment, something the nation\u2019s highest court will no doubt affirm once the issues of fact are brought before them should the lower courts fail to see it would be wise to affirm the first amendment guarantee of free speech at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nFaithful readers of these posts may also remember the case of Justina Pelletier, whom the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, its courts, and the prestigious Boston Children\u2019s Hospital seemingly conspired to hold in custody against her parents\u2019 wishes in a dispute over her medical care.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nAt the time it occurred I wrote of the dangerous precedent the case might set, especially in a post-Obamacare world, if responsible parties and patients disagreed with health care providers about what course of treatment might be appropriate in a given case. By allowing Justina to be held against her will and her parents\u2019 on the say so of doctors at Children\u2019s Hospital \u2013 who in fact were latecomers to a case that was being managed by a competent team at Tufts\u2019 University Hospital \u2013 the government was affirmatively asserting it knew best.\n\nThis, as I said, is a dangerous idea \u2013 the government is constituted by the people to serve the people. We are citizens, not clients. The idea that sovereign authorities are always unquestionably correct, as the commonwealth seemed to be saying in this case, means that America will have evolved into a nation governed by laws into one governed by men, putting us all at the mercy of the whims, caprices and capacity for tyranny that exists inside us all.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Two Small Victories for Individual Freedoms", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "This week, our personal freedoms won some support.", "title": "Two Victories the Other Bloggers May Have Missed", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2014/06/19/two-small-victories-for-individual-freedoms", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/e9/3c/59f46cdc4e1fb18b595414655fa5/thumb-4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Two Small Victories for Individual Freedoms", "description": "This week, our personal freedoms won some support.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "June 19, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Roff,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,Republican Party,abortion,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "This week, our personal freedoms won some support."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b51\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s important to note that the SBA List ads were truthful and that the commission was wrong to reach the conclusion it did.\nIt is, I suppose, one of the many substantial differences between blogging and general news reporting.\nThis, as I said, is a dangerous idea \u2013 the government is constituted by the people to serve the people.\nThe blogosphere is full of one offs \u2013 columns and posts that are written to sensationalize an issue that few if any bloggers bother to go back to.\nThe nine justices found the group did in fact have standing to bring a suit over an Ohio law that is a direct attack on its \u2013 and our \u2013 First Amendment rights."}
