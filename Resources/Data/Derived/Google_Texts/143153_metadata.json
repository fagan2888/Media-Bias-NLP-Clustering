The website\u2019s no longer operational, but BuzzFeed, using the magic powers of the internet, was able to unearth some of its best material. And, man, is it good.\n\nWhat BuzzFeed found is that Founder\u2019s Truth\u2019s website had itself a blog. It was called \u201cThe Freedom Blog.\u201d And while you\u2019d expect the Freedom Blog to have musings from Brannon or other members of his group, BuzzFeed found that the Freedom Blog featured something else: Articles, reposted in their entirety, from well-known conspiracy theorist websites like Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars.com and Mike Adams\u2019 Naturalnews.com.\n\nSo what kind of stories did Brannon\u2019s Freedom Blog repost? Here are some good ones that BuzzFeed found:\n\nA post sincerely propagating the Agenda 21 conspiracy theory.\n\nA post referring to the Aurora massacre as an \u201cop\u201d (i.e., a government initiative).\n\nA post warning of \u201csecret police murder and cover-up in the USA.\u201d\n\nA post about the nefarious plot of global elites to create \u201cone world currency.\u201d (A step, many conspiracy theorists believe, toward the establishment of a New World Order.)\n\nA post reporting that the TSA may force people to wear \u201cshock bracelets.\u201d\n\nA post titled \u201cThey Really Do Want To Plant Microchips Inside Your Brain\u201d\n\nA post charging that putting fluoride in drinking water is \u201cpatently unethical and criminal\u201d\n\nA post asking if Israel will engage in a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation in order to spark a war with Iran", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Greg Brannon's now-defunct Tea Party site was a hotbed of crazy", "title": "Tea Party candidate endorsed by Rand Paul used to run a website full of conspiracy theories", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Dr. Greg Brannon's now-defunct Tea Party site was a hotbed of crazy", "title": "Tea Party candidate endorsed by Rand Paul used to run a website full of conspiracy theories", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/23/tea_party_candidate_endorsed_by_rand_paul_used_to_run_a_website_full_of_conspiracy_theories/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-14-at-4.05.45-PM-e1389733642478-620x3821.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Greg Brannon's now-defunct Tea Party site was a hotbed of crazy", "title": "Tea Party candidate endorsed by Rand Paul used to run a website full of conspiracy theories", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-14-at-4.05.45-PM-e1389733642478-620x3821.png", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Agenda 21, Alex Jones, BuzzFeed, Conspiracy, conspiracy theories, False Flag, Founder's Truth, Greg Brannon, Infowars, Mike Adams, NaturalNews, New World Order, Rand Paul, The Freedom Blog", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "So what kind of stories did Brannon\u2019s Freedom Blog repost?\nHere are some good ones that BuzzFeed found:A post sincerely propagating the Agenda 21 conspiracy theory.\nThe website\u2019s no longer operational, but BuzzFeed, using the magic powers of the internet, was able to unearth some of its best material.\nWhat BuzzFeed found is that Founder\u2019s Truth\u2019s website had itself a blog.\nA post referring to the Aurora massacre as an \u201cop\u201d (i.e., a government initiative)."}
