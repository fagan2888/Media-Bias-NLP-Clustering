(Photos by Cynthia Washington/Tucson News Now)\n\nSaturday morning, hundreds of church members gathered in an empty lot at 7281 N. Skyline Drive to witness a bit of history.\n\nPresident Dieter Uchtdorf of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, along with other high-level leaders, grabbed a shovel and officially broke ground on a new LDS temple, which will be the first in Tucson and the sixth in Arizona.\n\nNow, church members have to drive to Mesa if they want to go to a temple.\n\nWorshipers say the need for a temple in Tucson is great because there are more than 30,000 Latter-Day Saints living in the Tucson area.\n\nUchtdorf said he believes the temple will not only add beauty to Tucson, but it will improve the surrounding communities.\n\n\"Because of the temple and the members coming to the temple and learning these principals at even a higher level, it allows us to reach out to our fellow man and worship our heavenly Father,\" he said. \"It will bring good into the community; Mormons when they live their religion they really do good in their neighborhood.\"\n\nIt is important to note that Latter-Day Saints temples are different than a meeting house or chapels where members meet for Sunday services.\n\nIn the Mormon church, temples are places specifically for weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies that unite families.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
