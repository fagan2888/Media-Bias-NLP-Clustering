BNSF hazardous materials teams were also responding to assess damage.\n\n\n\nRettig says the derailed cars were near the front of the train.\n\nScotland Fire Chief Mike Mehrer said additional crews were called to the scene.\n\n\"We came out here with probably 5,000 gallons of which wouldn't have lasted very long,\" Mehrer said. \"The biggest reason we might have sprayed any water is to cool the tanks.\"\n\nFirefighters were able to put most of the fire out. Now, their focus is on cleaning up. They're now planning to fill the cars with foam to clean out any ethanol material remaining. Crews also plan to repair the wooden bridge that was damaged.\n\nThe exact cause of the derailment and fire still remains under investigation.\n\nBNSF train derailment southeast of Scotland earlier this morning.
