Maybe you recoil in horror at the sight of a coffee pod? Hey, it happens. You probably prefer your morning cup or two at a more sedate pace. Not everything has to be at the pace of \u2018I wanted that coffee an hour ago.\u2019\n\nNah, sit back. Enjoy the aroma. Then get to work. Why not do it with more than a touch of style?\n\nMeet the \u2018slow brew\u2019 Theo coffee maker. Using matte black stoneware, Stelton is drawing both rustic and minimalist elements to create one of the coolest coffee makers around.\n\nGranted, it\u2019s not feature-rich. It brews about two cups of coffee, and that\u2019s it. If you\u2019re expecting knobs, buttons or an app, look somewhere else. Theo is about looking beautiful and keeping coffee simple.\n\nThe removable top can hold your standard coffee filter. The pot comes with a ring of insulating silicone to keep us from having the \u2018yep, that\u2019s hot\u2019 moments and burned fingers.\n\nA bamboo lid caps off the design, sealing the pot to keep it warm, and giving contrast with the all black design.\n\nPricing and a release date is still TBA but expect it on the shelves soon. Keep updated over at Stelton.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "coffee, slow brew coffee, theo coffee maker, stelton coffee, , coffee maker, design", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "News Ledge", "description": "Coffee purist?
