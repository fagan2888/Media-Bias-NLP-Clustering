You can watch the interview below, starting today at 2pm Pacific time:\n\nYou might be asking yourself why the most powerful man in the world is sitting down with a person who makes cupcake and cute hair tutorials. I\u2019m not a fortune-teller, but this interview probably won\u2019t be a 21st century Frost-Nixon.\n\nThe youths of America are key to Obama\u2019s signature laws. His health care legislation, the Affordable Care Act, was dependent on the fresh young bodies of millions of young Americans buying health insurance, which subsidized lower costs for older Americans. Hence, it\u2019s why he sat down with Funny or Die\u2019s \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d for a comedy skit, which ended up driving millions of views to the healthcare.gov website.\n\nHis next plan will be free community college for the entire country. This is necessary for Obama to help close the high-tech skills gap.", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2015-01-22T13:15:27+00:00", "author": "gregory-ferenstein", "modDate": "2015-01-22T13:05:29+00:00", "keywords": "barack-obama,government,sotu,youtube", "type": "news", "id": 1645722}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "To reach young netizens, the president will be responding to questions from popular YouTube personalities Bethany Mota, GloZell, and Hank Green.", "title": "Watch President Obama answer questions from YouTube\u00a0celebrities", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2015/01/22/watch-obama-answer-sotu-questions-from-youtube-celebrities/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-20-at-11.10.26-AM-780x389.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "To reach young netizens, the president will be responding to questions from popular YouTube personalities Bethany Mota, GloZell, and Hank\u00a0Green.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd33c\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama is with it: He was on Facebook before your parents, has an iPad, and is best buds with YouTube celebrities.\nTo reach young netizens, the president will be responding to questions with popular YouTube personalities Bethany Mota, GloZell, and Hank Green.\nHis health care legislation, the Affordable Care Act, was dependent on the fresh young bodies of millions of young Americans buying health insurance, which subsidized lower costs for older Americans.\nThese digital celebs have been fielding questions from their rabid fan base, and via Twitter through the hashtag #YouTubeAsksObama.\nThis is necessary for Obama to help close the high-tech skills gap."}
