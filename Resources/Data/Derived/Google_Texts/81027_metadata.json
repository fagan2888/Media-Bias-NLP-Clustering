Who knows taxes more than me? I know the taxes very well. I would say that probably before the end of September we\u2019ll have a very comprehensive plan, and one of the things will be simplification. And I believe we\u2019ll end up with a tax reduction, which to me is very important. You know, the United States, we pay the highest taxes in the world. We are going to be asking for a reduction. So, I think overall it will be very \u2014 people are going to be very happy.\u201d\n\nLater in the press conference, he was asked if repairing infrastructure would require tax increases. Trump stated, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you have to raise taxes at all. There\u2019s so much fat in Washington, that if somebody got in that knew what they were doing, you don\u2019t have to raise taxes, we want to lower taxes.\u201d\n\nTrump was then questioned on whether he would sign the Taxpayer Protection Pledge. He responded, \u201cWell, I may change them around. I know hedge fund guys that pay almost nothing, and they make a fortune. I want to see lower taxes, and I\u2019m going to make a determination. But, on some people, they\u2019re not doing their fair share. These hedge fund guys, I hate to say, many are friends of mine, and most of them support Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, just so you understand. They\u2019re not supporting me because I told them, \u2018I don\u2019t want your money.\u2019 But the hedge fund guys have to pay up.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump said \"I believe we'll end up with a tax reduction, and some people, like \"hedge fund guys\" are \"not doing their fair share\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Donald Trump said \"I believe we'll end up with a tax reduction, and some people, like \"hedge fund guys\" are \"not doing their fair share\"", "title": "Trump On Taxes: 'I Believe We'll End Up With a Tax Reduction,' But 'Hedge Fund Guys' Aren't Paying 'Fair Share' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Trump-Taxes-828-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/08/28/trump-on-taxes-i-believe-well-end-up-with-a-tax-reduction-but-hedge-fund-guys-arent-paying-fair-share/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump said \"I believe we'll end up with a tax reduction, and some people, like \"hedge fund guys\" are \"not doing their fair share\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Trump-Taxes-828-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Trump On Taxes: 'I Believe We'll End Up With a Tax Reduction,' But 'Hedge Fund Guys' Aren't Paying 'Fair Share' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Hedge Funds,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Taxes,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Hedge Funds", "published_time": "2015-08-28T17:07:56-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Taxes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I know hedge fund guys that pay almost nothing, and they make a fortune.\nAnd I believe we\u2019ll end up with a tax reduction, which to me is very important.\nThese hedge fund guys, I hate to say, many are friends of mine, and most of them support Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, just so you understand.\nThey\u2019re not supporting me because I told them, \u2018I don\u2019t want your money.\u2019 But the hedge fund guys have to pay up.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\nTrump stated, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you have to raise taxes at all."}
