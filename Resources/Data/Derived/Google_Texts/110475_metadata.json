The Obama administration also proposed that the judge issue a partial stay that would allow every state except for Texas to start implementing Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Justice Department gave U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen until Wednesday to decide on the matter. If Hanen does not act, the Justice Department will ask the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals for a stay.\n\nThe Justice Department argued that the Department of Homeland Security would \u201csustain irreparable harm\u201d that would not be cured even if the Obama administration wins its appeal. The Obama administration alleged that a \u201cstay pending appeal is necessary to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d or \u201cDepartment\u201d) is able to most effectively protect national security, public safety, and the integrity of the border.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllowing the preliminary injunction to remain in place pending appeal would also harm the interests of the public and of third parties, who will be deprived of the significant law enforcement and humanitarian benefits of prompt implementation of the Guidance,\u201d the Justice Department argued in its filing.\n\nIn issuing his injunction, Hanen determined that since Texas, which led the states in the lawsuit, \u201cstands to suffer direct damage from the implementation\u201d of Obama\u2019s executive amnesty, all of the states that sued had standing. Specifically, Hanen noted that Texas would likely have to issue driver\u2019s licenses to illegal immigrants if the federal government started implementing Obama\u2019s executive amnesty program.\n\nThe Justice Department asked Hanen to, \u201cat the very least,\u201d stay the injunction \u201cso that it applies only to the implementation of the Guidance in Texas because \u201cinjunction purports to extend beyond implementation of the Guidance in Texas (the only State whose claims of harm the Court credited) to States the Court did not find to have established any injury, and even to States that have informed this Court that they desire and expect to benefit from implementation of the Deferred Action Guidance.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the stay request, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Monday that the injunction against Obama\u2019s executive amnesty \u201conly makes it harder for the Department of Homeland Security to protect the American people and bring much-needed accountability to our nation\u2019s immigration system.\u201d He also noted that while a majority of states sued the Obama administration over his executive amnesty, 12 states and Washington, D.C. filed a brief in support of the administration\u2019s executive amnesty program.\n\nThe expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) part of Obama\u2019s executive amnesty was set to start last week, but the Obama administration announced after the injunction that it would comply with it and not accept any applications until the case is resolved. The Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) part of Obama\u2019s executive amnesty for the illegal immigrant parents of U.S. citizens is set to go into effect in May.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s funding is set to expire on February 27, and Senate Democrats have united to filibuster the House\u2019s spending bill that would fund all of the department except for Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama Admin Proposes Compromise to Judge: Let Every State Except Texas Implement Exec Amnesty", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama Admin Proposes Compromise to Judge: Let Every State Except Texas Implement Exec Amnesty", "title": "Obama Admin Proposes Compromise to Judge: Let Every State Except Texas Implement Exec Amnesty - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 473, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-9.17.53-AM-e1461931221544.png", "height": 354}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/23/obama-admin-proposes-compromise-to-judge-let-every-state-except-texas-implement-exec-amnesty/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama Admin Proposes Compromise to Judge: Let Every State Except Texas Implement Exec Amnesty", "title": "Obama Admin Proposes Compromise to Judge: Let Every State Except Texas Implement Exec Amnesty - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-9.17.53-AM-e1461931221544.png", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-02-23T11:57:49-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2b7\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Justice Department gave U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen until Wednesday to decide on the matter.\nThe Obama administration also proposed that the judge issue a partial stay that would allow every state except for Texas to start implementing Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\nThe Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) part of Obama\u2019s executive amnesty for the illegal immigrant parents of U.S. citizens is set to go into effect in May.\nSpecifically, Hanen noted that Texas would likely have to issue driver\u2019s licenses to illegal immigrants if the federal government started implementing Obama\u2019s executive amnesty program.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Monday, the Justice Department asked a federal judge in Texas who issued an injunction last week against President Barack Obama\u2019s executive amnesty to stay his injunction."}
