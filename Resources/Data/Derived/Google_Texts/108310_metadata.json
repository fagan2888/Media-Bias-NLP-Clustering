Asked by the interviewer if it was part of a \u201cThird World War in pieces,\u201d he responded: \u201cThis is a piece. There is no justification for such things.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Vatican\u2019s chief spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, released a statement saying: \u201cThis is an attack on peace for all humanity, and it requires a decisive, supportive response on the part of all of us as we counter the spread of homicidal hatred in all of its forms.\u201d\n\nIn Cairo, Al-Azhar University, the pre-eminent seat of Sunni Muslim scholarship, called the attacks a criminal act and said that \u201cIslam denounces any violence,\u201d the Arabic news site Al Arabiya reported, quoting Egypt\u2019s state news agency, MENA.\n\nOn Saturday morning, French President Francois Hollande said the attacks were an \u201cact of war\u201d carried out by the group that calls itself the Islamic State. Its propaganda arm took responsibility in statements in various languages, claiming revenge for French participation in U.S.-led military operations against its fighters in Syria and Iraq.\n\nWitnesses had reported hearing the cry \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d from gunmen, and supporters of the group cheered on social media, while many other Muslims condemned the bloodshed.\n\nIn Ireland, the imam of the Al-Mustafa Islamic Centre in Dublin said his thoughts and prayers are with the people of Paris \u201cand every other place on earth plagued by sick men with weapons and bombs.\u201d\n\n\u201cTerrorists have no religion whatsoever,\u201d said the Muslim leader, Umar Al-Qadri. \u201cTheir religion is intolerance hatred for peace.\u201d\n\nShuja Shafi, secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \u201cThis attack is being claimed by the group calling themselves \u2018Islamic State.\u2019 There is nothing Islamic about such people and their actions are evil, and outside the boundaries set by our faith.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, the reactions varied, including among evangelical Christians.\n\nFranklin Graham, son of the preacher Billy Graham, said: \u201cIslam is at war with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we pray for France we also need to pray for wisdom for the world\u2019s leaders & that Islam will be stopped in its tracks,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAs we pray for France we also need to pray for wisdom for the world\u2019s leaders & that Islam will be stopped in its tracks. #PrayForParis \u2014 Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) November 14, 2015\n\nHowever, evangelical author Ed Stetzer criticized the call for \u201cwar with Islam.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to see Muslims come to Christ (as, yes, they want to win me to Islam). And, we can\u2019t do that by going to war with a billion people,\u201d he wrote in Christianity Today.\n\nAmong mainline Protestants, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, Michael Curry, called upon \u201call Episcopalians and people of goodwill and faith to pray for those who have died.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, canceled a meeting with the pope at the Holy See, as well as the rest of his European trip, which was to have included a visit to Paris.\n\nRouhani had been due to arrive in Rome on Saturday for meetings with the pontiff and the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi.\n\nThe Iranian leader called the attacks \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d\n\nMultiple terrorist attacks in the French capital targeted civilians at a concert hall, restaurants and a sports stadium, where Hollande was present. Seven of the attackers also died.\n\nJS/MG END SCAMMELL", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Christian, Evangelical, extremism, France, Islam, islam, Paris, Protestant, terrorism", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "(RNS) Pope Francis raises the specter of a World War III \u201cin pieces,\u201d Muslims issue statements of condemnation, while evangelical Christians in America debate whether to speak of a \u201cwar with Islam.\u201d", "title": "World religious leaders condemn Paris carnage", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/11/14/world-religious-leaders-condemn-paris-carnage-terrorist-attacks-isis-hollande-rouhani/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RTS6X48-e1447505357691.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rosiescammell"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/11/14/world-religious-leaders-condemn-paris-carnage-terrorist-attacks-isis-hollande-rouhani/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/11/14/world-religious-leaders-condemn-paris-carnage-terrorist-attacks-isis-hollande-rouhani/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "(RNS) Pope Francis raises the specter of a World War III \u201cin pieces,\u201d Muslims issue statements of condemnation, while evangelical Christians in America debate whether to speak of a \u201cwar with Islam.\u201d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2560\"", "article_summary": "Asked by the interviewer if it was part of a \u201cThird World War in pieces,\u201d he responded: \u201cThis is a piece.\nAs we pray for France we also need to pray for wisdom for the world\u2019s leaders & that Islam will be stopped in its tracks.\nOn Saturday morning, French President Francois Hollande said the attacks were an \u201cact of war\u201d carried out by the group that calls itself the Islamic State.\n\u201cThis is not human,\u201d Francis said in a phone call to an Italian Catholic television station.\nAnd, we can\u2019t do that by going to war with a billion people,\u201d he wrote in Christianity Today."}
