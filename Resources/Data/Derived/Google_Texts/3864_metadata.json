Phil Gramm of Texas remarked on the importance of being willing to inflict pain when negotiations don\u2019t go your way. \u201cI don\u2019t take hostages I\u2019m not willing to shoot,\u201d Gramm explained.\n\nThe point Gramm was making is that once you demonstrate that you don\u2019t make idle threats, future negotiations are easier.\n\nRelated: Wall Street Knows Greek Debt Drama Is Far from Over\n\nThe treatment of Greece by its European creditors may have had a similar effect.\n\nIn Spain, which is even more indebted than Greece, the leftist Podemos Party has been gaining influence, in part by making promises in line with those made by Greece\u2019s Syriza Party. In May, Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Podemos, demanded that Spain\u2019s debt be restructured and that debt payments be tied to economic growth.\n\n\u201cFor Spain to be able to meet its international obligations, we have to link debt payments to economic growth and expansive job creation policies,\u201d he said. A similar argument had been made by former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who so aggravated his European counterparts that he was eventually replaced.\n\nThe reaction of Podemos to the punishing deal to enable another Greek bailout was telling. After battling to the bitter end, Syriza was forced to accept a humiliating offer from its creditors. In a deal primarily driven by Germany and other northern European countries, Greeks face pension cuts, huge tax increases, reduced services, and the forced sale of $50 billion worth of the country\u2019s physical assets.\n\nRelated: 5 Surprising Facts About the Greek Economy\n\nIn Madrid on Tuesday, it was as though the Eurogroup, fresh from dealing with Greece, had turned to Spain with smoking gun in hand and asked, \u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d\n\nThe answer from Podemos\u2019 top economic policy officer, Nacho Alvarez, was essentially, \u201cWho, me? Nothing. Nothing at all.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Alvarez said that debt restructuring wasn\u2019t really necessary after all. \u201cSpain, he said, \u201cis not Greece.\u201d\n\nOr so he must fervently hope.\n\n\u201cGreece and Spain are different economies in very different situations which demand different economic strategies,\u201d Alvarez said at a press conference.\n\nRelated: Why Greece Can\u2019t Grow Its Way Out of This Mess\n\nHe added, \u201cPodemos and Syriza have different economic approaches\u201d and said that he is confident the country\u2019s current programs to stimulate economic growth will allow it to manage its debts.\n\nWhether Podemos has detected a significant shift in the country\u2019s economic future over the last two months or has had a change of heart more related to the Eurogroup\u2019s treatment of Greece is up for debate.\n\nHowever, if part of the aim of Greece\u2019s creditors was to punish Syriza pour encourager les autres, there seems to be little room for debate at all. It worked. In the near term, at least, it worked.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In a battle over banking regulation at the end of the Clinton administration, former R", "title": "The EU Shot Its Greek Hostage, Now Spain Is Nervous", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/15/EU-Shot-Its-Greek-Hostage-Now-Spain-Nervous", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-01-15T093710Z_1_CBRE90E0QQ600_RTROPTP_2_SPAIN.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/15/EU-Shot-Its-Greek-Hostage-Now-Spain-Nervous", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-01-15T093710Z_1_CBRE90E0QQ600_RTROPTP_2_SPAIN.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In a battle over banking regulation at the end of the Clinton administration, former R", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cGreece and Spain are different economies in very different situations which demand different economic strategies,\u201d Alvarez said at a press conference.\nRelated: Wall Street Knows Greek Debt Drama Is Far from OverThe treatment of Greece by its European creditors may have had a similar effect.\nThe point Gramm was making is that once you demonstrate that you don\u2019t make idle threats, future negotiations are easier.\n\u201cFor Spain to be able to meet its international obligations, we have to link debt payments to economic growth and expansive job creation policies,\u201d he said.\nThe reaction of Podemos to the punishing deal to enable another Greek bailout was telling."}
