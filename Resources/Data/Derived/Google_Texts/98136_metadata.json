I\u2019m going to just pretend I\u2019m the most ruthless Emperor ever to sit in the cockpit of state of this absurd 21st Century Imperium I\u2019m calling The Corporate and Imperial States of America \u2014 C.I.S.A. for short. I sit on a throne made by a homeless designer out of a dozen broken parts from a dozen pieces of thrift shop furniture. A line of correspondents waits to ask me a question. (We\u2019ve cut off Fox News until they learn better how to grovel for access in this new regime.) The correspondent from MSNBC asks the first question. In fact, it\u2019s the only question we\u2019ve allowed this afternoon:\n\n\u201cWhat are the first ten things you\u2019re going to do?\u201d\n\n1) First we will be releasing Bradley/Chelsea Manning and dropping any legal actions against Julian Assange. We are announcing an amnesty program for Edward Snowden, who will, if he accepts, become a consultant as part of a major re-vamping of the entire US intelligence system. Yes, heads will have to roll. Like they say, you can\u2019t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. While we don\u2019t want to throw anybody\u2019s baby out with the bathwater, we may have to throw somebody\u2019s baby out \u2014 for the good of the larger whole. It will not be without some bumps, and my newly formed People\u2019s Guard is ready to monopolize on any violence that breaks out. We support the Second Amendment, and all over the country we are establishing and training chapters of a well-armed militia known as the Smedley Butler Brigades made up of disgruntled unionists, the unemployed and the homeless. These are things that have to be done. We are not allowing change to be quashed any longer. The status quo ends here.\n\n2) The most powerful purely symbolic thing we can do as a nation is, after holding it at virtual gunpoint for over 100 years, we will be relinquishing any and all ownership rights to our military base at Guantanamo, Cuba. We will move all prisoners to a well-designed prison in Oklahoma. Absent any significant criminal evidence, captives will be released on an expedited basis. Most important, we will no longer hold Cuban territory illegally.\n\n3) Tomorrow, we will be eliminating the Affordable Care Act (AKA \u201cObamacare\u201d) and, as we should have done in the first place, we will be expanding Medicare (which everyone loves!) to cover American citizens from cradle to grave. Citizens will still have plenty of things to worry about, but basic health care will not be one of them. We will simplify and streamline record keeping. Immortality will remain unachievable, but a reasonable, basic level of health care will be guaranteed to all Americans. Luxury-level medicine will continue to be available. For those who are dying to know, yes, we will be raising taxes. But don\u2019t worry, they will be heavily skewed so they bleed only the rich.\n\n4) We will be launching a major new program to break the addiction in America to Police, Courts and Prisons as a solution to the misuse and abuse of a whole range of drugs and intoxicants. If your police department is strung out on arrests of young black males for drug-related crimes, we have the equivalent of a methadone program for you. All your resources will be re-directed to fighting white-collar crime. Bonuses and medals will be given for bagging the biggest, most crooked fat cats. We will try to restrain over-aggressiveness and beatings, but you know being a cop is hard and working places like Wall Street can be very stressful. As far as legal and illegal drug use, we will be assuming a Harm Reduction approach and our courts will be re-vamped to direct the most egregiously addled drug takers to effective therapy. If you have a heroin habit and are functioning fine at the job you do, then we\u2019re fine with you. We will look at you like a diabetic in need of insulin. But when you become a drag on society, we will take our role as society\u2019s guardians seriously and haul your pitiful self before a judge to straighten you out.\n\n5) We will naturally have a Truth Commission. There\u2019s so much to talk about. (See the more detailed explanation in our 400-page handout.) Every American kid will be taught from Howard Zinn\u2019s The People\u2019s History of the United States. Students will be free to read Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Killing Famous Liberals series. Debate is great; bullying is not. The curriculum will be centered on real history and on overcoming human inequality and caring for the Earth. Media and internet resources will be employed with a host of other venues to kick off The National Dialogue, conceived like the old Chautauqua circuit, which Teddy Roosevelt called \u201cthe most American thing in America.\u201d The full pageant of American history \u2014 bullying wealth, dirty wars, warts and all \u2014 will be emphasized at all levels. The point is not to denigrate the truly good things about America; the point is to no longer officially hide the rotten things behind a veil of secrecy or censorship. We\u2019re going to have a free, public airing of lots of bad stuff. Oppositional voices will be encouraged but nonsensical blocking of discussion will be treated harshly.\n\n6) Hand-in-hand with this dialogue, we will be launching a program to improve the education of our children nation-wide known by its acronym PADLOCK. (The People\u2019s Action Division for Liberating Our Children\u2019s Knowledge.) The point is to move beyond test scores, family status and economic power to encourage education as practical engagement with the real. We\u2019ll even inject a little Paolo Freire and some liberation theology and the preferential option for the poor. There are no stupid questions. Excelling is encouraged. Cliquish bullying will be discouraged. In conjunction with the above-mentioned Truth Commission, a major part of the PADLOCK Program will be a national effort to deconstruct The Myth of American Exceptionalism and replace it with The Myth of American Competence, a myth based on humility and compassion.\n\n7) Yes we will be beginning the overdue and necessary process of re-distributing wealth in America. Redistribution is not a dirty word. It\u2019s also not class warfare. Or at least it\u2019s not the opening volley. The poor did not shoot first. It\u2019s needed as a corrective action to balance a long period of the accumulation of government-protected greed based on a free market that doesn\u2019t exist and an unregulated drive for profit. The movement of wealth upward needs to be turned around. The Supreme Counsel has decided to do it. So, the important next step is to figure out how to do it as painlessly as possible \u2014 emphasis on \u201cas possible.\u201d It isn\u2019t an easy task to strip people of wealth they\u2019re certain is theirs. This is America, so we certainly don\u2019t want to get Leninist and bolsheviky and run roughshod. The more self-re-distributing we can encourage the better. We really don\u2019t want to put anybody up against a wall. We don\u2019t want to nationalize anyone\u2019s wealth. We want to be cordial. But it\u2019s important for people to know the free ride is over. My imperial staff and I will not be Mister Nice Guy when it comes to weeping sob stories from billionaires.\n\n8) These things tend to logically unfold. So next we will be encouraging the resurrection of unions in America. People who work hard for a living need to be represented against the accumulated power of Capital. That should not be such a scary concept to grasp. From now on all workers in businesses and industry across the nation will have the right to organize expressed unambiguously in an Executive Order. Our first goal will be to obtain an amicable top-down/bottom-up dialogue in which neither Labor nor Capital overpowers the other. We want to re-fit a tough, pragmatic union movement to balance the runaway, top-down oppressive power of Greed.\n\n9) We can\u2019t forget our natural environment and our aging infrastructure. We\u2019re a speed-oriented society that thinks it\u2019s un-cool to repair old things. With resources tight, spending to maintain systems becomes less important than investing in spiffy, profitable future ventures. From now on, we fix up the stuff we have before we invest in new dreams. And we in the developed world, we spend more resources and practice more restraint in order to save the planet from ourselves. Does that sound politically correct? Great!\n\n10) Last but certainly not least, there\u2019s The Monster In the Room. The Really Big Show. The Pentagon. The Military-Industrial Complex. Those who rule the behemoth I miraculously sit atop as a fluke Emperor. Closing this down is my challenge.\n\nOur first act will be Project Shake-Off. Our logo is a large, wet sheepdog shaking itself off. For the next five years, each month we will be eliminating 10 bases around the world. That\u2019s 600 wasteful, unneeded bases. Gone. History. That will leave around 400 for the next five-year-plan. Will we be making ourselves vulnerable to terrorism? Not if we do it right. Look, we\u2019re going to do it. Period. So the question becomes how do we do it right. Smart. Will there be bumps along the way? One should always expect bumps. Will a \u201cterrorist\u201d ever get through our security and blow something up? Yes, certainly that\u2019s possible.\n\nBut our driving desire is to get beyond the FEAR \u2014 that thing FDR said was all we had to fear. The trouble is, to get beyond this fear we have to accept some danger in life. We need to give up any illusion of security. Maybe the hardest thing to face in today\u2019s bizarro world is that at any time any one of us can be absurdly blown to goosh in a gut bucket. It should be seen as good to stop fomenting so many globalized armed enemies. No, this is not a perfect solution. There are no perfect solutions. We are not pacifists, and we are keeping a strong military with reasonably sophisticated intelligence capacities.\n\nThe real problem is inside all of us. The Pogo dilemma. It has to do with the mythic chords of who we are as Americans. While we may have started out as ruthless Indian-killers, the question is do Americans have to remain proud Indian killers to the bitter end? Moral flaws \u2014 like genocide and carpet bombing \u2014 are good to recognize. As your Emperor, trust me, once properly studied and interiorized, societal moral flaws become the fodder for positive change. Go with me on this. To move forward with a fair society in mind a people must learn to see their warts as a positive force. I love warts. And those who continue to hide from and censor warts will not be part of our dialogue.\n\nThank you. I have to go. My imperial duties beckon. But a final thought:\n\nRemember, those opposed to those opposed to the Vietnam War liked to say, My country right or wrong. I agree.\n\nMay the Great Mystery shine on us all.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "www.counterpunch.org", "description": "A Holiday Fantasy", "title": "If I Were Emperor", "url": "http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/12/17/if-i-were-emperor/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/dropzone/2015/06/OGFB4.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-17T08:16:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-31T20:57:16+00:00"}, "description": "A Holiday Fantasy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "robots": "noodp, noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf030\"", "article_summary": "As your Emperor, trust me, once properly studied and interiorized, societal moral flaws become the fodder for positive change.\nThose who rule the behemoth I miraculously sit atop as a fluke Emperor.\nI\u2019m going to just pretend I\u2019m the most ruthless Emperor ever to sit in the cockpit of state of this absurd 21st Century Imperium I\u2019m calling The Corporate and Imperial States of America \u2014 C.I.S.A.\nCitizens will still have plenty of things to worry about, but basic health care will not be one of them.\n7) Yes we will be beginning the overdue and necessary process of re-distributing wealth in America."}
