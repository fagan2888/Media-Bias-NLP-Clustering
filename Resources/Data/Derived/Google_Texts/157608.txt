One by one, a group of students at Casa Loma Elementary shook hands with administrators and local law enforcement and picked up their gifts.

Thirty-six students received backpacks filled with some much needed school supplies.

First grader Victoria Berumen got some crayons, a pencil and a ruler in her backpack, she said.

And fifth grader Leonardo Velazquez got a ruler, a glue stick, an eraser, a pencil and a notebook, he said.

The gifts were donated by the nonprofit organization, 4RKids,4RFuture and delivered by BPD.

Casa Loma principal Alex Mira said the kids love it.

"Every time they get an opportunity to get something that's going to help them in the classroom, they get excited," he said.

This is all part of a program that gives kids the tools they need to succeed and helps build trust between police officers and the community .

Former Los Angeles police officer Javier Rodriguez founded 4RKids,4RFuture with his wife. He said he just wanted to give back to the community.

"This came about myself, when I was in school having the need for some of these very basic, very critical tools," he said.

Rodriguez said the program is helping bridge the gap between school districts and police departments.

"And that's why we have our partners from law enforcement at every backpack giveaway we do," Rodriguez said. "We invite them, and they always do show up and do their part as well to bridge that gap."

Mira said the police department has always been a strong supporter of their school and the community.

"They're our partners in education," he said. "Every time we need them, they're out here supporting us. And so our kids have had a lot of positive experiences with them."
