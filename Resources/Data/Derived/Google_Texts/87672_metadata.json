Crews did not have the equipment available to raise the single-engine Socata TBM700 from the lake Sunday afternoon, Whitmore said.\n\n\u201cBased on sonar images obtained today, it appears that the fuselage is intact and that the wings are still attached,\u201d Whitmore said\n\nEfforts to recover the bodies will begin Monday. The names of those thought to have died in the crash have not been released.\n\nNewspapers in Alabama identified the victims Sunday as Jimmy L. Hill, president of Gadsden Tool; his cousin Seth McDuffie; Katrina Vinzant Barksdale; and her two sons, Xander and Kobe.\n\nComments from friends on Barksdale\u2019s Facebook page indicated she was among of the victims. Hill\u2019s LinkedIn page states he is an instrument-rated pilot.\n\nThe 1996 model fixed-wing aircraft is registered to Gadsden Aviation LLC of Rainbow City, Ala., according to the FAA\n\nHill is listed in public records as the official representative of Gadsden Aviation. No one answered the phone at Gadsden Tool\u2019s office or at Hill\u2019s home Sunday evening.\n\nFlight records show the plane departed from Gadsden, Ala., at 8:30 a.m. Saturday then stopped in Bartlesville, Okla., where it departed at 12:12 p.m. en route to Montrose. The crash site is about 20 miles south of Montrose.\n\nOfficials have not speculated on the cause of the crash, although the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board began their investigations Sunday.\n\nWhitmore characterized the water as cold, murky and up to 100 feet deep where the plane went down, about 90 feet from shore, just before 2 p.m. Saturday.\n\nWitnesses who were attending a wedding onshore saw the plane spin into Mears Bay in the northeast corner of the 1,030-acre reservoir in Ridgway State Park.\n\nThe park remains closed.\n\nA sheriff\u2019s deputy who was quickly on the scene Saturday afternoon reported finding debris and an oil slick but no sign of the plane\u2019s occupants. The tail and other parts of the plane have been recovered but not the main body of the plane, which includes the cabin.\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Searchers find Alabama plane that crashed into Ridgway Reservoir; media outlets identify victims", "title": "Searchers find Alabama plane that crashed into Ridgway Reservoir; media outlets identify victims", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/23/searchers-find-alabama-plane-that-crashed-into-ridgway-reservoir-media-outlets-identify-victims/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140323_103405_crash1-3.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140323_103405_crash1-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-23T10:40:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:02:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd053e\"", "article_summary": "The 1996 model fixed-wing aircraft is registered to Gadsden Aviation LLC of Rainbow City, Ala., according to the FAAHill is listed in public records as the official representative of Gadsden Aviation.\nCrews did not have the equipment available to raise the single-engine Socata TBM700 from the lake Sunday afternoon, Whitmore said.\nDivers and sonar on Sunday located the fuselage of a small plane from Alabama that crashed into Ridgway Reservoir on Saturday afternoon, but no bodies have been recovered, Ouray County spokeswoman Marti Whitmore said.\nWitnesses who were attending a wedding onshore saw the plane spin into Mears Bay in the northeast corner of the 1,030-acre reservoir in Ridgway State Park.\nThe tail and other parts of the plane have been recovered but not the main body of the plane, which includes the cabin."}
