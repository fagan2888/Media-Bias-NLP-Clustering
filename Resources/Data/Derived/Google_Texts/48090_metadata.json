They amassed dossiers on about one quarter of the population of the country during the Communist regime.\n\nBut their spycraft \u2014 while incredibly invasive \u2014 was also technologically primitive by today\u2019s standards. While researching my book Dragnet Nation, I obtained the above hand drawn social network graph and other files from the Stasi Archive in Berlin, where German citizens can see files kept about them and media can access some files, with the names of the people who were monitored removed.\n\nThe graphic appears to show forty-six connections, linking a target to various people (an \u201caunt,\u201d \u201cOperational Case Jentzsch,\u201d presumably Bernd Jentzsch, an East German poet who defected to the West in 1976), places (\u201cchurch\u201d), and meetings (\u201cby post, by phone, meeting in Hungary\u201d).\n\nGary Bruce, an associate professor of history at the University of Waterloo and the author of \u201cThe Firm: The Inside Story of the Stasi,\u201d helped me decode the graphic and other files. I was surprised at how crude the surveillance was. \u201cTheir main surveillance technology was mail, telephone, and informants,\u201d Bruce said.\n\nAnother file revealed a low-level surveillance operation called an im-forgang aimed at recruiting an unnamed target to become an informant. (The names of the targets were redacted; the names of the Stasi agents and informants were not.) In this case, the Stasi watched a rather boring high school student who lived with his mother and sister in a run-of-the-mill apartment. The Stasi obtained a report on him from the principal of his school and from a club where he was a member. But they didn\u2019t have much on him \u2014 I\u2019ve seen Facebook profiles with far more information.\n\nA third file documented a surveillance operation known as an OPK, for Operative Personenkontrolle, of a man who was writing oppositional poetry. The Stasi deployed three informants against him but did not steam open his mail or listen to his phone calls. The regime collapsed before the Stasi could do anything further.\n\nI also obtained a file that contained an \u201cobservation report,\u201d in which Stasi agents recorded the movements of a forty-year-old man for two days \u2014 September 28 and 29, 1979. They watched him as he dropped off his laundry, loaded up his car with rolls of wallpaper, and drove a child in a car \u201cobeying the speed limit,\u201d stopping for gas and delivering the wallpaper to an apartment building. The Stasi continued to follow the car as a woman drove the child back to Berlin.\n\nThe Stasi agent appears to have started following the target at 4:15 p.m. on a Friday evening. At 9:38 p.m., the target went into his apartment and turned out the lights. The agent stayed all night and handed over surveillance to another agent at 7:00 a.m. Saturday morning. That agent appears to have followed the target until 10:00 p.m. From today\u2019s perspective, this seems like a lot of work for very little information.\n\nAnd yet, the Stasi files are an important reminder of what a repressive regime can do with so little information.
