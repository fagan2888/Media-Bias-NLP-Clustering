Another major funding source is the sale of crude oil from wells in areas it controls. While it\u2019s probably possible to dramatically reduce the ability of ISIS to move and sell oil, there\u2019s not a whole lot the current strategy of bombing ISIS targets can do about ground-level extortion.\n\nRelated: Can ISIS Save the Russian Economy for Putin?\n\nIn the end, if the object of the West is to prevent ISIS from launching more terror attacks like the one in Paris, focusing on the group\u2019s finances isn\u2019t going to do much either. That\u2019s because the Paris attacks were, almost certainly, breathtakingly cheap.\n\nIn a story published yesterday, NBC news speculated that the entire cost of the operation \u2013 from acquiring several AK-47s and ammunition to renting cars, hotels rooms and other minor expenses \u2013 probably totaled less than $10,000. Counterterrorism officials contacted by NBC agreed that the figure was a plausible estimate.\n\nThat contrasts sharply with the iconic terror attacks that stand out in the minds of most Americans, the multiple assaults on September 11, 2001, which experts have estimated cost between $400,000 and $500,000.\n\nBut Americans, naturally focused on the largest terror attack in this country\u2019s history, tend to have a distorted view of the amount of money and expertise that is really necessary to inflict massive harm and sow panic.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush \u2013 We Need U.S. Ground Troops to Fight ISIS\n\nAbdelhamid Abaaoud, the man who reportedly planned the Paris attacks and was subsequently killed in a police raid yesterday, is frequently referred to in the media as the \u201cmastermind\u201d of the attacks. However, suggesting that he was some sort of terrorist super-genius completely misses the point. This was a low-tech operation, with the exception of cell phones, using firearms that haven\u2019t significantly changed in design since 1948.\n\nThe alarming truth about terror attacks is that they aren\u2019t expensive, and don\u2019t require attackers to have extraordinary capabilities.\n\nYes, it would be comforting to think that it requires some sort of Bond villain-like combination of brilliance and wealth to murder dozens or hundreds of people. Unfortunately, all it really takes is a few motivated street thugs with enough cash to buy black market automatic weapons.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It would be comforting to think that it requires some sort of Bond villain-like combination of brilliance and wealth to murder dozens or hundreds of people.
