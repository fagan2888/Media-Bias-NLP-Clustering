Susan Femmer

Susan Femmer, a retired Boulder Valley paraprofessional and current school volunteer, recently announced her intent to run for a seat on the Boulder Valley school board.

"Having worked in BVSD schools for many years, and in the business sector before that, I feel I have a strong background to bring to this position," she wrote in an email. "Since I also live in the in the mountains, I have an understanding of this areas unique problems and needs."

Femmer worked as an intensive special education paraprofessional in Boulder Valley at Nederland Middle/Senior starting in 1998, retiring at the end of the school year.

She also served as the talented and gifted program coordinator at Nederland, as well as working as a paraprofessional at Flatirons Elementary. Before becoming a paraprofessional she worked as a probation officer and in banking.

If elected, Femmer would represent District C, the southernmost and largest of seven districts in BVSD, mainly covering south Boulder.

The District C seat is currently held by board President Laurie Albright, and is one of four up for grabs this November. Also planning to run for that seat is Chris Barge, director of The Community Foundation Serving Boulder County's School Readiness Initiative.
