Republican incumbent Congressman Kerry Bentivolio was defeated by businessman David Trott in suburban Detroit's 11th U.S. House District GOP primary by a roughly 2-1 margin.

The 53-year-old Trott will face the winner of a four-way Democratic primary in the fall to represent the district covering a swath of Detroit's western and northern suburbs.

Trott says the "size and scope of the federal government" is the single biggest problem facing residents of Michigan and calls for reducing wasteful government spending and cutting the debt and the deficit.

He says President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act has been "an absolute disaster," costing millions of Americans their health insurance coverage while driving up insurance rates for millions more.
