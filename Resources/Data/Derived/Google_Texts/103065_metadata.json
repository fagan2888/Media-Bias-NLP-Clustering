Unless there is a massive and totally unexpected change in the general position of the Republican Party between now and November 2016, the one thing Clinton can be absolutely sure of is that she won\u2019t be losing Latino voters to a Republican on the issue of immigration reform.\n\nHowever, being sure that voters won\u2019t support your opponent is only half the battle \u2013 Clinton is going to need to inspire Latino voters to come to the polls in the first place. And right now, immigration activists say that she hasn\u2019t given them much to work with.\n\nCesar Vargas, co-director of the Dream Action Coalition, a group that pushes immigration reform friendly to the undocumented population was one of a pair of activists who memorably confronted Clinton in Iowa last September, in an effort to pin her down on immigration issues.\n\nIn an interview, Vargas said that at the time, Clinton appeared to be \u201cnot very well versed on immigration policy.\u201d\n\nRelated: A Few Hours Late and Really, Really Short, Clinton Finally Announces\n\nPresident Obama had recently decided to delay taking executive action to ease the threat of deportation for some undocumented immigrants, a move widely seen as a blatantly political decision ahead of the 2014 elections.\n\n\u201cThe President has broken his promise to the Latino community, and we wanted to know if you stand by the President's delay on immigration,\u201d Vargas said to Clinton at the time.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Clinton said as she kept walking, \u201cI think we need to elect more Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just a partisan response, and is suggested she didn\u2019t know exactly what to say,\u201d Vargas remembers. And, he says, Clinton hasn\u2019t done much since to convince immigration activists that she deserves their support.\n\nRelated: Hillary Runs Unopposed? Not So Quick, Dems Say\n\nWhen Obama eventually took the executive action he had delayed, protecting several million undocumented immigrants from the threat of deportation, she came out with a statement in support of the move.\n\nShe has also expressed support for comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for the undocumented. In 2007, she supported an effort by then-President George W. Bush to reform the immigration system.\n\nBut Vargas and the activist community, who feel somewhat betrayed by the Obama administration\u2019s failure to move on immigration reform earlier in his tenure as president, are looking for more. Clinton, he says, has so far not provided enough detail or expressed enough commitment to satisfy his coalition\u2019s members.\n\n\u201cWe learned out lesson in 2008 from Barack Obama, who promised us immigration reform in his first year,\u201d said Vargas. \u201cWe can\u2019t be star-struck.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why the Hillary Everyone Knows Is Under Attack\n\nHe said, \u201cThe usual talking points are not going to be enough. Saying she supports comprehensive immigration reform and the president\u2019s executive actions is not going to be enough. We need bold leadership that would expand executive action if Congress fails to act.\u201d\n\nClinton, he said, also needs to show the Latino community that she \u201cunderstands the plight\u201d of the immigrant community. Last summer, he pointed out, she said that the children being stopped at the Southern border ought to be sent back.\n\n\u201cThe majority of these children are eligible for asylum because many of them are escaping rape or violent death,\u201d said Vargas, noting that the United Nations has said that the majority should qualify for refugee status.\n\nAnd then there was Clinton\u2019s video announcement of her campaign, which prominently featured a pair of Latino brothers \u2013 speaking in Spanish \u2013 who were preparing to open a new restaurant.\n\nRelated: The Biggest Obstacle to Rand Paul\u2019s 2016 Campaign\n\n\u201cIt was a little comical to us,\u201d said Vargas that Clinton\u2019s campaign chose to portray Latino immigrants unable or unwilling to speak English. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t she have two Latino brothers speaking English?\u201d he asked.\n\nThat\u2019s one of many questions Latino voters and others concerned about immigration reform are likely to have for Clinton in the coming months.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If Hillary Clinton wins the Democratic presidential nomination next year, she\u2019s unlikely to lose votes", "title": "Clinton\u2019s Fuzzy Position on Immigration Worries Activists", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/14/Clinton-s-Fuzzy-Position-Immigration-Worries-Activists", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-clinton-foundation-women_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/14/Clinton-s-Fuzzy-Position-Immigration-Worries-Activists", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-clinton-foundation-women_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If Hillary Clinton wins the Democratic presidential nomination next year, she\u2019s unlikely to lose votes", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s one of many questions Latino voters and others concerned about immigration reform are likely to have for Clinton in the coming months.\nShe has also expressed support for comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for the undocumented.\n\u201cWe learned out lesson in 2008 from Barack Obama, who promised us immigration reform in his first year,\u201d said Vargas.\nSaying she supports comprehensive immigration reform and the president\u2019s executive actions is not going to be enough.\nRelated: Rand Paul Takes Direct Aim at Hillary ClintonRight now, that candidate seems likely to be Hillary Clinton, who officially announced her presidential run on Sunday afternoon."}
