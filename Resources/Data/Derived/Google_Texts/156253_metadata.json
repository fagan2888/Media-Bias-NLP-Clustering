The 49-year-old Amish farmer knows Obamacare is coming, but he doesn\u2019t quite know what that means.\n\n\"I\u2019ve wondered, I\u2019ve really wondered what\u2019s going to happen with the health care, I don\u2019t know,\" he said.\n\nOn Oct. 1, the health insurance exchanges open. The exchanges, a compare-and-contrast marketplace, are a key part of the Affordable Care Act, the landmark federal legislation that\u2019s making health insurance mandatory for Americans \u2014 most of them anyway.\n\nCommunity-Based Care\n\n\"The Amish have from the beginning been excused from Social Security on the grounds that they would refuse to collect it that they practice their own kind of Social Security,\" said Karen Johnson-Weiner, a professor of anthropology at the State University of New York at Potsdam.\n\nShe has been studying Amish culture for decades. The Amish don\u2019t pay into Social Security and Medicare, and they don\u2019t receive benefits from those plans. And they will be exempt from buying insurance on the health exchanges.\n\nThere are an estimated 280,000 Amish in the United States. The states with the largest populations are Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\nEmmanuel Schmidt said while the Amish like to rely on holistic practices, sometimes they just need to see a doctor.\n\n\"We like to go with natural, but if I cut my arm off, I have to go get medical help,\" he said. \"I have to do the correct thing.\"\n\nSince the Amish don\u2019t have health insurance, when serious medical issues arise, they find ways to pay costly hospital bills.\n\n\"Our group, the whole Amish group across America helps each other,\" Schmidt said. \"Whenever there is one little group like us that needs help, they\u2019ll write up to 50 other churches to get enough money to do it. So its been working pretty good.\"\n\nSchmidt handles medical business for his community, the members of his church. He described the way traditional health care is paid for as backwards.\n\n\"We usually just gather up the money to pay it after it happens,\" Schmidt said. \"We don\u2019t do it before it happens.\"\n\nSchmidt\u2019s community has worked out a deal with UPMC Northwest in Senaca where they pay cash for services, and if they pay within a month\u2019s time, they only have to pay a percentage of what the total bill is.\n\n\"Like our Amish group has made an agreement with the hospital that our group as a whole, the elders and all, are responsible for each individual bill,\" Schmidt said. \"If I make a hospital bill and can't pay it, then it\u2019s the whole group's responsibility to pay that bill see. And then they give us a substantial discount.\"\n\nUPMC wouldn\u2019t comment on the deal except to say that yes, since 2008, it has worked out deals for several Amish and Mennonite communities in northwestern Pennsylvania, and it's not UPMC\u2019s practice to discuss the particulars of those agreements.\n\nOthers in the Amish community say the deal has helped tremendously.\n\n\"With our last baby we were in for five days in the ICU. It was a bill we could handle this way, otherwise it would have been pretty difficult,\" said Danny Zehr, who owns a hardware and roofing store. \"Just last year my brother-in-law fell about 8 foot and ruptured his spleen, and he was in the hospital for five days or something like that, and instead of being 100,000 (dollars), it was 20 (thousand dollars) or whatever, so that\u2019s a big difference.\"\n\nTaking Health Care on the Road\n\nBecause the Amish don\u2019t operate cars, when they go to the hospital they rely on Mik Robertson to drive them.\n\nAs a township supervisor of a majority Amish community, Robertson serves as a bridge to the outside world for them. But some of the questions they ask, like about the Affordable Care Act, he doesn\u2019t know the answers to, and he doesn\u2019t always know where to go to get those answers.\n\nRobertson, a farmer, operates the taxi van with his wife Maggie. He originally bought a van to transport seedlings.\n\n\"We got the van, I don\u2019t think we had the van two days, and one of the Amish neighbors came over and said, 'Oh I see you got a van,'\" he said laughing. \"'We wanna go to...' wherever they wanted to go to that evening, 'Can you take a bunch of us over there?' And it kind of started from there.\"\n\nEven when they do go to hospitals, experts say there are other issues. The Amish, who speak Pennsylvania Dutch, speak English as a second language. There aren\u2019t translators. And even if they do speak English, because there isn\u2019t much interaction with the English-speaking world, they don\u2019t understand all of the medical and legal terminology.\n\nOne way this gap has been bridged is through Dr. Homer Schreckengost, a concierge physician in Kittaning.\n\nTwice a month he travels to Licking Township, sets up at Danny Zehr\u2019s shop and provides health care to the Amish on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n\"It is like a home visit or house call throughout the community, except they all come to one location so I don\u2019t have to bounce from house to house,\" he said.\n\nSchreckengost sees about 30 patients a visit and maintains about 400 active Amish medical charts. While he\u2019s there, he does everything from checking newborns to sebaceous cyst removal to blood testing. A visit averages around $50.\n\n\"I think the Amish community is different than the traditional medical community just because they don\u2019t run to the doctor for every little thing, and things can be let go for a long time before they show up in front of you,\" Schreckengost said. \"So we tend to see a much more advanced disease process when we see it. So from extreme cases of Lyme disease, where most people think they get bit by a tick and they get a bulls eye rash and joint pain, we see the neurological consequences there, the end stage of that disease process.\"\n\nDanny Zehr said there was hesitation at first to let Schrekengost in.\n\n\"He come in here one day and says, 'Hey you guys need a doctor?'\" Zehr said. And we said, well what do we need a doctor at the Amish farms for?\"\n\nSchrenkengost immediately diagnosed some serious medical illnesses, earning the community\u2019s trust. He started off in Zehr\u2019s kitchen. Since then, the doctor has had two rooms built in the basement of the hardware store. That was nearly three years ago.\n\nLike Schmidt, Zehr doesn\u2019t know much about the health care law. He hopes there isn\u2019t anything he has to do.\n\n\"It might affect me more than I think,\" Zehr said, \"but to us, it's something we hope someone else takes care of \u2026 not very involved in how it works or what it's all about.\"", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "In Clarion County\u2019s Licking Township there are vibrant green hills, windy narrow roads and traffic signs posted just as much for the trucks and tractors as", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wesa.fm/post/obamacare-takes-effect-getting-health-care-amish", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/medium/public/201309/amish_dr5.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In Clarion County\u2019s Licking Township there are vibrant green hills, windy narrow roads and traffic signs posted just as much for the trucks and tractors as", "title": "As Obamacare Takes Effect, Getting Health Care to the Amish"}, "story_id": 224364362, "twitter": {"site": "@905wesa", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WesaErika"}, "author": "Erika Beras", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "As Obamacare Takes Effect, Getting Health Care to the Amish"}, "nid": 16604, "datePublished": "2013-09-20", "keywords": "Amish, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Health, Features & Special Reports", "wordCount": 1294, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The Amish don\u2019t pay into Social Security and Medicare, and they don\u2019t receive benefits from those plans.\n\"I\u2019ve wondered, I\u2019ve really wondered what\u2019s going to happen with the health care, I don\u2019t know,\" he said.\nTaking Health Care on the RoadBecause the Amish don\u2019t operate cars, when they go to the hospital they rely on Mik Robertson to drive them.\nAs a township supervisor of a majority Amish community, Robertson serves as a bridge to the outside world for them.\nLike Schmidt, Zehr doesn\u2019t know much about the health care law."}
