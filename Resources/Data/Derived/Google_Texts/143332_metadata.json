As in business, planning community success in a competitive and changing marketplace requires that we in local government understand the demographic and market trends that will affect our cities and the region we\u2019re part of.\n\nTwo recent commentaries criticized the Metropolitan Council\u2019s housing plan with different but equally tired and unproductive perspectives.\n\nKatherine Kersten\u2019s ideologically fueled attack \u2014 \u201cDo we really want to live like this?,\u201d Sept. 27 \u2014 is based in a politically potent but false \u201cboogeyman\u201d narrative of the Met Council pushing around local governments like mine in Eagan.\n\nIn response, Myron Orfield and Will Stancil paint an equally distorted narrative \u2014 \u201cActually, the Met Council is protecting the status quo,\u201d Oct. 4 \u2014 of suburban policymakers who need pushing around because of their proclivity to \u201cuse their zoning powers\u201d to \u201ceffectively ban\u201d housing that is affordable to lower-income families.\n\nBoth are wrong, bordering on offensive.\n\nTo be sure, I was one of the suburban mayors on the council\u2019s Housing Plan Advisory Committee. I\u2019m not 100 percent supportive of every detail in the final housing plan, and I can\u2019t speak for all mayors and suburban policymakers in our region. However, Kersten\u2019s notion that the housing plan somehow empowers a \u201cstrong-arming\u201d Met Council to impose its will on suburban governments is fiction and dangerously devalues the importance of regional planning to a prosperous, vibrant future for our communities.\n\nThe planning partnership between the council and local governments is rooted in a common understanding of regional trends. In that partnership, communities like Eagan are indeed autonomous and control local land-use decisions. Nothing in the housing plan allows the council to \u201cimpose its will\u201d or \u201cits vision of an ideal community.\u201d\n\nConversely, the suburban colleagues I worked with on this housing plan, and those from across the region, genuinely care about affordability, gaps in their community housing stock and the increasingly diverse needs of all their residents. Orfield\u2019s and Stancil\u2019s image of suburban leaders caring only about \u201cexpensive houses on expansive lots\u201d is an all-too-familiar and easy distraction from the very real challenges policymakers and advocates face when trying to encourage affordability in a dynamic and changing housing market\n\nAs we begin work on our own comprehensive plans, cities across the region are taking stock of today\u2019s housing, transit, and transportation options and identifying the challenges of the future. For example, right now, 1 in 3 households are paying 30 percent or more of their income on housing; 1 in 8 pay more than half of their income. That leaves precious little money and fewer choices for other needs. In Eagan today, an estimated 1,300 households cannot find a home their family can reasonably afford. While welcome, the unfortunate reality is that this past Monday\u2019s Eagan dedication of the Dakota County Community Development Agency\u2019s 50-unit Lakeshore Townhome development will make only a small dent.\n\nAffordable-housing options help low-income people who already live in cities like Eagan. A recent Met Council study revealed that there are actually more people living in suburban poverty than in the major cities of our region. It\u2019s not about shifting challenges from the cities to the \u2019burbs; it\u2019s about using good data to inform our planning for the challenges we already face and will face into the future.\n\nUnlike the implications of both attacks on the housing plan, affordability is not just about low-income residents or redistributing urban poverty to suburban communities. Businesses and large employers increasingly identify the costs of having employees trapped in long, unproductive and congested commutes when they can\u2019t afford to live closer. Additionally, other low- and moderate-income jobs follow higher-paying ones to the suburbs \u00ad\u2014 from administrative positions and dry cleaners to coffee shop baristas and office cleaners.\n\nBy 2040, older adults will head 1 in 3 households in our region. Many don\u2019t want to continue living in the four-bedroom house with a big yard. How will they remain a part of our communities if local and regional leaders aren\u2019t using that knowledge to help ensure as best we can that there are options that meet the needs of aging residents?\n\nThe need to anticipate and plan for affordable-housing demand can be a byproduct of a region\u2019s success. Millennials just starting out in cities like Denver and San Francisco are struggling against rising rents and being \u201cpriced out.\u201d The essence of planning is to avoid that struggle and to be able to attract and keep talented professionals and entrepreneurs early in their careers.\n\nBoth Thrive MSP 2040 and the Met Council\u2019s housing plan aim to cultivate a region where all residents have options and opportunities. The goal may not be fully achievable, but it is laudable, and so too is the housing plan.\n\nMike Maguire is mayor of Eagan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the mayor of a successful suburban city, I value good data &mdash; it helps to develop a community plan and a path to prosperity.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "As the mayor of a successful suburban city, I value good data &mdash; it helps to develop a community plan and a path to prosperity.", "title": "Counterpoint: Kersten and her critics are wrong on housing plan", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/counterpoint-kersten-and-her-critics-are-wrong-on-housing-plan/331835881/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the mayor of a successful suburban city, I value good data &mdash; it helps to develop a community plan and a path to prosperity.", "title": "Counterpoint: Kersten and her critics are wrong on housing plan", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/counterpoint-kersten-and-her-critics-are-wrong-on-housing-plan/331835881/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "Eagan"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "Metropolitan Council,housing plan,Katherine Kersten,Myron Orfield,Will Stancil,suburbs,Affordable housing,Eagan"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd60a7\"", "article_summary": "The goal may not be fully achievable, but it is laudable, and so too is the housing plan.\nTwo recent commentaries criticized the Metropolitan Council\u2019s housing plan with different but equally tired and unproductive perspectives.\nTo be sure, I was one of the suburban mayors on the council\u2019s Housing Plan Advisory Committee.\nBoth Thrive MSP 2040 and the Met Council\u2019s housing plan aim to cultivate a region where all residents have options and opportunities.\nUnlike the implications of both attacks on the housing plan, affordability is not just about low-income residents or redistributing urban poverty to suburban communities."}
