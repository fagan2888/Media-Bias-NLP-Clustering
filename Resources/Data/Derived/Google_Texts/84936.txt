"I kind of like the way Ron Paul thought. I'm a libertarian, no question about it, just like John Stossel," says Dennis Hof, owner of the Moonlite Bunny Ranch brothel, famously featured on HBO's Cathouse. In 2008 and 2012, he began raising money to donate to the Ron Paul presidential campaign under the banner "Pimpin' for Paul."

"States rights, make your own decisions. [Paul] doesn't want the Feds dealing with the states, and that's what Nevada's all about," he says, in this Reason TV excerpt.
