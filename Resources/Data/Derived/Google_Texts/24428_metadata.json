These complexes include Baymeadows Apartments, where the individuals named as plaintiffs in the suit reside.\n\nThe suit alleges the City aimed to reduce its minority population by targeting Southeast Ridgeland apartment complexes for destruction and redevelopment. It\u2019s a claim included in a late 2015 complaint from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD.\n\nHUD and the Center for Justice say a desire to remove black and Hispanic residents drove city officials and the Board of Aldermen to enact the sweeping new zoning ordinance that set retroactive building density limits on the apartment complexes, many of which are decades old.\n\nThe result has been \u201cunlawful discrimination based on race,\u201d HUD said in an early December notice to city officials in which the agency said would conclude a further investigation within 100 days.\n\nThe Center\u2019s housing discrimination suit charges the action against the apartment complexes grew out of a long-held belief among city leaders that \u201cchanging demographics\u201d were hurting schools and driving white residents out, depressing property values.\n\nCensus data shows that Ridgeland\u2019s white population dwindled from 76.3 percent in 2000 to 57.5 percent in 2010. Limiting affordable housing options \u201cwas seen as the best way to curb the influx of what was referred to as \u2018Jackson\u2019s rot,\u2019\u201d the Center suit claims.\n\nHUD and the Center say the worries over demographics brought creation of the 2008 Ridgeland Area Master Plan, a strategy that called for replacing apartments predominantly occupied by African-Americans and other minorities with clusters of single-family cottage-style housing.\n\nRidgeland\u2019s mayor and other city officials have declined to address either the 2014 rezoning, the growing number of lawsuits or the HUD complaint. The City\u2019s specially hired lawyers have also declined to comment.\n\nBefore the lawsuits, however, city officials said health and public safety problems involving the apartments put an unjustified burden on the City\u2019s budget.\n\nHowever, if the apartments threatened public health and safety, the City has not tried to prove it, according to the Center for Justice suit.\n\nThe suit accuses the City of rushing through the passage of the new zoning law without adhering to its own procedures for rezoning, without performing any studies or analyses that justified rezoning and, breaking from past practice, without exempting the existing use of the affected properties from the law\u2019s restrictions.\n\nThe Southeast Ridgeland complexes are the only properties targeted for demolition under the new zoning ordinance. Complexes in other parts of the city could be forced to close up or demolish some of their units.\n\nJohn Jopling, a managing attorney at the Center for Justice, said Ridgeland is clear in its goals. \u201cThe 2014 Zoning Ordinance was intended to displace, and will have the effect of displacing, a substantial portion of Ridgeland\u2019s minority population,\u201d Jopling said in a press statement accompanying the lawsuit. \u201cThis is a clear violation of the Fair Housing Act.\u201d\n\nMany residents worry they will be forced to move and take children out of local schools, Jopling said in an interview Friday, and added some residents are even worried they will have nowhere to go.\n\nThe suit seeks to have the rezoning provisions of the 2014 zoning law declared invalid and to prohibit the City from enforcing them.\n\nRidgeland\u2019s rezoning ordinance and the insistence on apartments meeting new unit density rules have led to a dozen lawsuits in state and federal courts on behalf of 15 rental complexes.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "By\u00a0TED CARTER\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi Center for Justice, a public interest law organization, has added a...", "title": "Center for Justice suit: Removing minorities behind Ridgeland war on apartments", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://msbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Van-Mark-apartments_4C-620x330.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-16T10:22:52-05:00", "url": "http://msbusiness.com/2016/02/center-for-justice-suit-removing-minorities-behind-ridgeland-war-on-apartments/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mbjournal", "section": "Govt/Politics", "tag": "Venable LLP", "published_time": "2016-02-14T23:15:23-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-16T10:22:52-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "By\u00a0TED CARTER The Mississippi Center for Justice, a public interest law organization, has added a 38-page lawsuit to a stack of suits against the City of Ridgeland over a 2014 zoning ordinance that targets multi-family rental complexes.
