Scalia\u2019s body will lie in repose at the Court on Friday; but he had not even been removed from the remote ranch where he died before some Republican politicians proclaimed the End of the World. \u201cI don\u2019t think the American people want a Court that will strip our religious liberties,\u201d said GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz. \u201cI don\u2019t think the American people want a Court that will mandate unlimited abortion-on-demand, partial-birth abortion with taxpayer funding, and no parental notification. And I don\u2019t think the American people want a Court that will write the Second Amendment out of the Constitution.\u201d Mitch McConnell, restrained only by contrast, said: \u201cThe American people\u200e should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president\u201d\u2014thereby proclaiming the next nine months a prolonged referendum on the Court. Wednesday\u2019s newspapers brought a hint that the Republican opposition is not entirely united in refusing to consider a White House nominee. But Cruz and other presidential candidates will try to hold them firm by threatening the wrath of the base.\n\nBefore locking the nation in an ultimate-fighting cage, it is worth looking at the one thing the upcoming battle will not be about: It won\u2019t\u2014repeat won\u2019t\u2014be, as Cruz claims, about control of the Supreme Court \u201cfor a generation.\u201d And the Court\u2019s current shorthanded status may produce results more complicated than the series of 4-4 affirmances currently being forecast. To start at the beginning: A 79-year-old man died in his sleep. This entirely unsurprising event stunned millions. I confess I was one. I see the justices regularly; I suspected at some level that Scalia was in decline. His color and posture were not good; his questions from the bench were sometimes puzzling. Nevertheless, the sheer force of the man\u2019s personality made the idea of a world without him seem unthinkable. After 30 years, he had come to define the Court for two generations of lawyers and citizens. Still, he was old, and for all people, great or humble, old age is but the anteroom of death, which comes when it chooses, not when planned for. And that\u2019s my point: At the Court\u2019s marble palace, death\u2019s anteroom is crowded. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be 83 in a few weeks. Justice Anthony Kennedy will be 80 this summer. By the beginning of the next term, Justice Stephen Breyer, the young scamp of the senior crowd, will be 78. I admire all three of these justices, in different ways, and as the Italians do, I wish them each 100 years. But the actuarial tables offer a somber prospect over the next four years. Scalia\u2019s departure is the opening act, not the conclusion, of a historic generational shift. If President Obama\u2019s pick is confirmed, the Court\u2019s moderate liberals will have a slight advantage in the head count. That\u2019s true for at least the next term, but not much longer. The new shape of the Court is much more likely to be determined by the next four years than by the next four months. The \u201cpartisan balance\u201d of the Court may shift more than once. Look at the current 4-4 split. Reporters take for granted that the Court\u2019s high-profile cases\u2014on issues such as abortion, the president\u2019s immigration plan, religious exemptions under the Affordable Care Act, and others\u2014will lead to deadlocks. Each lower-court decision would then be affirmed, leaving a strange patchwork of decisions, some applying nationwide and others only in specific circuits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court justice\u2019s departure doesn\u2019t mark the conclusion of a generational shift.
