4 factors driving the physician shortage

The Association of American Medical Colleges recently found the United States will face a shortage of between 61,700 physicians and 94,700 physicians by 2025, according to Fox Business.

Here are four factors impacting the looming physician shortage.

1. The aging population. Within the next 10 years, the number of Americans over 65 years is expected to increase 40 percent to 45 percent.

2. The Affordable Care Act. Prior to the ACA, reports estimated nearly 44 million Americans lacked health insurance. Since 2013, the uninsured rate has decreased by 5 percent.

3. Residency slots. Medical schools around the country have been increasing class sizes since 2001. However, residency rotations have not followed suit, leaving many medical school graduates without an available residency position.

4. Burnout. Women physicians reported burnout rates reaching 55 percent, compared to 46 percent of their male counterparts. Medical students suffer higher depression rates (between 15 percent and 30 percent) than the general population. Between 300 physicians and 400 physicians commit suicide each year in the United States.
