Hospitals\u2019 exempt status is tied to their meeting prescriptive standards on whether they operate for a community\u2019s benefit, such as providing free care to the uninsured, community health investments, health professional education, and research.\n\nFar from providing \u201csome\u201d community benefit, as Mr. Grunstein suggests, New York\u2019s hospitals provide billions in community benefits annually\u2014significantly in excess of their property tax exemption. And the few New York hospitals that actually are profitable\u2014thanks in part to the charitable contributions and grants their tax-exempt status enables them to receive\u2014channel those profits back into additional community activities.\n\nMr. Grunstein also asserts that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance expansion undercuts hospitals\u2019 tax-exempt status, but the ACA actually includes four tightened requirements for hospitals to maintain their tax exemptions.\n\nAnd in referencing hospital executive compensation, Mr. Grunstein fails to mention that both federal law and the Internal Revenue Service define the procedures and regulations that tax-exempt organizations must follow when establishing executive compensation, and recognize that hospitals compete with the private sector for individuals with the skills and experience to run such complex institutions.\n\nFinally, the New Jersey case that Mr. Grunstein cites sets a potentially dangerous precedent that could jeopardize the vital care that hospitals provide to their communities.\n\nBy any measure, New York\u2019s hospitals earn their tax-exempt status each and every day.\n\nKenneth E.
