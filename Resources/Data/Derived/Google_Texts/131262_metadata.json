Most of us treat walking as a necessity, a mode of transportation or a way to cut some calories.\n\nBut philosophers and scientists agree \u2014 the simple act of walking can do wonders for the mind.\n\nIn a recent podcast, Sasha Weiss, a literary editor at The New Yorker, went on a walk around Manhattan with the writer and commentator Adam Gopnik. They discuss the art of pedestrianism \u2014 or, simply, walking \u2014 and reminisce about the 1980s, a time when Mr. Gopnik would explore New York\u2019s grid of streets, encountering the long-lost world of mafiosos, circus artists and now forgotten landmarks.\n\n\u201cOne of the pleasures of walking in New York is that it randomizes the grid,\u201d says Mr. Gopnik. When you step in to a taxi, bus or subway, you go only straight up, down or across. \u201cVertical or horizontal, those are the two axes that dominate our life.\u201d\n\nBut when you\u2019re on foot, he says, you can go anywhere you wish, \u201cand that feeling of randomizing your own existence is, I think, incredibly rich and welcome.\u201d\n\nThe podcast is an accompaniment to \u201cHeaven\u2019s Gaits, \u201d a piece in The New Yorker by Mr. Gopnik on walking. In the essay, Mr. Gopnik discusses two new books on the pedestrian: one that explores the history of competitive walking, which was a popular spectator sport in the United States in the Civil War era (the premise of which is basically \u201cwalk until you drop\u201d), and another about the philosophy of walking.\n\nThere are different types of urban walking. The classic 19th-century Parisian walker was called a \u201cfl\u00e2neur,\u201d and to be a fl\u00e2neur, Mr. Gopnik says in the podcast, \u201cis to be in a floating state, where you are spiritually at least two feet off the ground, where you are able to observe, but don\u2019t feel compelled to connect.\u201d Walking is the Western form of meditation, Mr. Gopnik writes of this Parisian, contemplative style.\n\nIn New York, however, even the solitary walker never contemplates the world alone. \u201cWalking, even without companions, can still be an expression of companionship, of expansive connection,\u201d writes Mr. Gopnik. It\u2019s \u201ca happy opening out to an enlarged civic self rather than a narrowing down to a contemplative inner one.\u201d\n\nA recent study published in the journal Preventive Medecine found that people who walk or cycle to work report increased concentration and less strain. Researchers from the University of East Anglia who studied 18,000 British workers found that a commute that involves physical activity (walking to a bus included) improved measures like the \u201cfeeling worthlessness, sleepless nights and unhappiness,\u201d according to The Telegraph.\n\nAnd a quick stroll may be especially helpful if you are a writer, says Ferris Jabr at The New Yorker. Mr. Jabr says that many writers, from the peripatetic Greek philosophers to William Wordsworth and Henry David Thoreau, \u201chave discovered a deep, intuitive connection between walking, thinking, and writing.\u201d\n\nWhat is about walking that helps us with the writing process, Mr. Jabr asks? On the physiological level, according to a large body of research, it\u2019s everything from simply getting the blood pumping and oxygenating our brains to stimulating new connections between brain cells and the growth of new neurons.\n\nIt\u2019s also letting the mind roam, in the manner of the Parisian fl\u00e2neur or the engaged New York walker.\n\n\u201cBecause we don\u2019t have to devote much conscious effort to the act of walking, our attention is free to wander \u2014 to overlay the world before us with a parade of images from the mind\u2019s theatre,\u201d Mr. Jabr writes.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to the moment you sit at your desk. Writing and walking are remarkably similar processes, Mr. Jabs says. Both part-mental, part-physical, in both you are mapping something out, creating trails and paths.\n\n\u201cWalking organizes the world around us; writing organizes our thoughts.\u201d\n\nCan I get that treadmill desk?", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140921174553, "BN": "op-talk", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/optalk", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/op-talk/post", "per": "Gopnik, Adam", "org": "New Yorker", "keywords": "Gopnik Adam,Books and Literature,Commuting,Poetry and Poets,Walking,New Yorker,Manhattan (NYC),New York City,Paris (France),Deeper Dive", "GBLC": "Deeper Dive", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/op-talk/Oh, Go Take a Walk ( 20140921 )", "news_keywords": "Adam Gopnik,Books,Commuting,Manhattan,New Yorker,NYC,Paris France,Poetry,Walking", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Hanna Kozlowska", "SCG": "op-talk", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Hanna Kozlowska", "byl": "Hanna Kozlowska", "twitter": {"description": "Philosophers and writers have said it for centuries, and now scientists agree: Walking is not just a way to get from point A to point B or to get your daily dose of exercise \u2014 it also stimulates the mind.", "title": "Oh, Go Take a Walk", "url": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/oh-go-take-a-walk/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/09/18/blogs/18WALKING2/18WALKING2-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytopinion", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003129432, "description": "Philosophers and writers have said it for centuries, and now scientists agree: Walking is not just a way to get from point A to point B or to get your daily dose of exercise \u2014 it also stimulates the mind.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 21, 2014", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "Deeper Dive", "published_time": 1411335953, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-11-05T16:00:18-05:00"}, "geo": "Manhattan (NYC);New York City;Paris (France)", "utime": 20141105160018, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140921, "pdate": 20140921, "des": "Books and Literature;Commuting;Poetry and Poets;Walking", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/09/18/blogs/18WALKING2/18WALKING2-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Op-Talk", "description": "Philosophers and writers have said it for centuries, and now scientists agree: Walking is not just a way to get from point A to point B or to get your daily dose of exercise \u2014 it also stimulates the mind.", "title": "Oh, Go Take a Walk", "url": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/oh-go-take-a-walk/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/09/18/blogs/18WALKING2/18WALKING2-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/oh-go-take-a-walk/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Oh, Go Take a Walk", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/09/18/blogs/18WALKING2/18WALKING2-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 21, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd13\"", "article_summary": "In a recent podcast, Sasha Weiss, a literary editor at The New Yorker, went on a walk around Manhattan with the writer and commentator Adam Gopnik.\n\u201cOne of the pleasures of walking in New York is that it randomizes the grid,\u201d says Mr. Gopnik.\n\u201cWalking, even without companions, can still be an expression of companionship, of expansive connection,\u201d writes Mr. Gopnik.\n\u201cWalking organizes the world around us; writing organizes our thoughts.\u201dCan I get that treadmill desk?\nAnd a quick stroll may be especially helpful if you are a writer, says Ferris Jabr at The New Yorker."}
