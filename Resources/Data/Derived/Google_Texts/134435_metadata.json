To maintain control of the US Senate, the party must turn out voters, especially African Americans, in four key states with Senate races up for grabs. Yet the man who could boost enthusiasm most among black voters - President Obama - is the same person mainstream Democratic candidates are trying to disassociate from on the campaign trail.\n\nBecause of unpopular policies associated with Obama - like the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, or his lackluster initiatives on oil and gas drilling, as is alleged by one candidate - the second-term president is persona non grata for Democratic Senate candidates in battleground states like Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Arkansas.\n\nThe significant numbers of registered black voters in these southern states are now the target of both clandestine voter-outreach efforts led by the White House and more visible operations that seek to register, and turn out, voters in November.\n\nAccording to the Times, Obama has participated in radio interviews, telephone calls, and video advertisements that target African American communities in battleground states.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet there are a whole bunch of folks listening to your show who may not even know that there\u2019s an election going on,\u201d Obama said on Rickey Smiley\u2019s Atlanta-area radio show, the Times reported. \u201cI need everybody to go vote. The election\u2019s on Nov. 4. You can go to a website, Iwillvote.com, to find out what your polling place is.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, prominent Obama surrogates, including former President Bill Clinton and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, have stepped in to campaign in these key states, attending black churches and other venues to encourage turnout.\n\n\u201cAnybody who looks at the data realizes that if the black vote, and the brown vote, doesn\u2019t turn out, we can\u2019t win. It\u2019s just that simple,\u201d US Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told the Times, adding the Latino vote to the midterm equation. \u201cIf we don\u2019t turn out, we cannot hold the Senate.\u201d\n\nBelcher, the pollster, told the Times that despite skeptics, especially Republican doubters, he believes Democrats can win in these races if turnout, especially among African-American communities, exceeds traditionally depressed expectations that come with midterm elections.\n\n\u201cIf you tell me in Georgia that, on the closing of the polls, the electorate is 32 percent African-American, I\u2019m going to tell you we have probably elected a Democratic senator,\u201d Belcher said. \u201cThat\u2019s not theory. It\u2019s basic math.\u201d\n\nYet in these four key states, Democratic Senate candidates, both challengers and incumbents, have calculated against embracing Obama, adding to angst among Democrats nationwide.\n\nFor instance, Michelle Nunn, the Democratic Senate challenger in Georgia, has not said whether or not she would have voted for the Affordable Care Act, the politically unpopular healthcare law, had she been in office during its passage.\n\nDespite its unpopularity, though, Americans seem to be warming to the law\u2019s features. In August, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that though 53 percent of respondents viewed the law unfavorably, even more - 60 percent - said they did not want the law repealed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the US Senate up for the taking this November election, a prominent pollster has warned in a confidential memo that Democrats face \u201ccrushing\u201d losses nationwide if the party cannot turn out black voters to the polls, according to a new report.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "With the US Senate up for the taking this November election, a prominent pollster has warned in a confidential memo that Democrats face \u201ccrushing\u201d losses nationwide if the party cannot turn out black voters to the polls, according to a new report.", "title": "Democrats to suffer big losses if black voters ignore midterms - report", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/30/3d/00/00/democrats-senate-black-voters.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/197584-democrats-senate-black-voters/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "With the US Senate up for the taking this November election, a prominent pollster has warned in a confidential memo that Democrats face \u201ccrushing\u201d losses nationwide if the party cannot turn out black voters to the polls, according to a new report.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/30/3d/00/00/democrats-senate-black-voters.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAnybody who looks at the data realizes that if the black vote, and the brown vote, doesn\u2019t turn out, we can\u2019t win.\nYet the man who could boost enthusiasm most among black voters - President Obama - is the same person mainstream Democratic candidates are trying to disassociate from on the campaign trail.\nIt\u2019s basic math.\u201dYet in these four key states, Democratic Senate candidates, both challengers and incumbents, have calculated against embracing Obama, adding to angst among Democrats nationwide.\nAccording to the Times, Obama has participated in radio interviews, telephone calls, and video advertisements that target African American communities in battleground states.\nTo maintain control of the US Senate, the party must turn out voters, especially African Americans, in four key states with Senate races up for grabs."}
