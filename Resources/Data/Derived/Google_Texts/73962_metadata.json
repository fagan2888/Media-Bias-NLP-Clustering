I\u2019ve heard you, and I understand. I\u2019ve heard you,\" he responded. \"But what I\u2019m saying is, this is just a first step. So, young man, I\u2019m talking to a lot of people here. I\u2019ve been respectful to you, I want you to be respectful to me, all right?\"\n\nBut if the president thought that signing those executive actions would short-circuit heckling by immigration advocates, he learned this week: it's not quite so simple.\n\nIn Chicago Tuesday at an immigration-themed event, Obama was interrupted by several people after he said he planned to focus deportations on \"felons, not families.\"\n\n\u201cThat has been a lie!\u201d one woman shouted, adding that he had deported ordinary immigrants who had not violated other U.S. laws. The shouting continued for several minutes, as other protesters joined in the chorus.\n\n\u201cAll right, I've listened to you. I heard you. I heard you. I heard you,\u201d he finally said, turning in succession to the different speakers. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to listen to me, too. All right? And I understand you may disagree. I understand you may disagree. But we've got to be able to talk honestly about these issues. All right?\"\n\nSometimes the complaints less about actions people want the president to take, and more about actions they don't want to see at all.\n\nThe proposed Keystone XL pipeline has motivated months of Obama speech protesters. For instance, last year the president was interrupted during a speech on health care in Boston by hecklers calling on him to \"stop the pipeline.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re talking about health care today,\" the president responded. \"That is the wrong rally. We had the climate change rally back in the summer. This is the health care rally.\"\n\nIt isn't always anonymous hecklers: some interruptions feature familiar faces.\n\nThe president was heckled during a 2013 speech at the National Defense University by Code Pink founder Medea Benjamin.\n\n\"Can you tell the Muslim people their lives are as precious as our lives? Can you take the drones out of the hands of the CIA?\" yelled Benjamin, who has often interrupted speeches and hearings. \"Will you apologize to the thousands of Muslims that you have killed?\"\n\nSome hecklers get to stay put; not this time. Benjamin was escorted out.\n\nAfter she'd left, Obama spoke up on her behalf. \"The voice of that woman is worth paying attention to,\" Obama said. \"Obviously, I do not agree with much of what she said, and obviously she wasn\u2019t listening to me in much of what I said. But these are tough issues, and the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong.\"\n\nBut the fact is, sometimes, hecklers aren't upset about things Obama has actually done, things he's planning to do or things he's decided not to do. Sometimes...well, it's not quite clear to the president what they're talking about at all.\n\nEarlier this year, someone interrupted Obama's speech at the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting with a request.\n\n\"Tell us about your plans for nuclear war with Russia!\" a man yelled.\n\n\"I'm sorry, who's that back there?\" asked a very confused Obama, putting his hand to his brow and squinting toward the back of the room. \"What the heck are you talking about? ...I don\u2019t know anything about that plan. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been reading.\u201d\n\nHe didn't have much to say -- but that wasn't the point, of course. The heckle is less about getting a response than getting heard at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's an occupational hazard.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "It's an occupational hazard.", "title": "A short history of President Obama\u2019s recent heckler encounters", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/11/26/a-short-history-of-president-obamas-recent-heckler-encounters/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@katiezez"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/11/26/a-short-history-of-president-obamas-recent-heckler-encounters/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Medea Benjamin, immigration, war, Keystone XL, hecklers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Medea Benjamin, immigration, war, Keystone XL, hecklers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf467\"", "article_summary": "\"I\u2019ve heard you, young man.\nI\u2019ve heard you,\" he responded.\nI\u2019ve heard you, and I understand.\nThe proposed Keystone XL pipeline has motivated months of Obama speech protesters.\nEarlier this year, someone interrupted Obama's speech at the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting with a request."}
