The Obama gang\u2019s cover-up continues to unravel, despite its unlawful secrecy and continued slow-rolling of information. Congress, if it ever decides to do its job, cannot act soon enough to put Hillary Clinton, Cheryl Mills, and every other official in these emails under oath.\n\nOn Sept. 11, 2012, at 4:07 PM, Maria Sand, a special assistant to Clinton, forwarded an email to Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Jacob Sullivan, executive assistant Joseph McManus, and her fellow special assistants in the secretary\u2019s office that said:\n\nThe Regional Security Officer reports the diplomatic mission is under attack. Tripoli reports approximately 20 armed people fired shots; explosions have been heard as well. Ambassador Stevens, who is currently in Benghazi, and four COM [Chief of Mission] personnel are in the compound safe haven. The 17th of February militia is providing security support.\n\nAt 6:06 p.m. on Sept. 11, State Department officials received an e-mail with the subject line \u201cAnsar al-Sharia Claims Responsibility for Benghazi Attack (SBU)\u201d confirming that \u201cEmbassy Tripoli reports the group claimed responsibility on Facebook and Twitter and call for an attack on Embassy Tripoli.\u201d\n\nAl-Sharia is affiliated with al-Qaeda.\n\nDespite these State Department e-mails, Clinton issued an official statement shortly after 10:00 PM on Sept. 11 saying that the attack may have been \u201ca response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cinflammatory material\u201d referred to a trailer for a film called \u201cInnocence of Muslims.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 12, Rabbi David Saperstein, then-Director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, issued a statement condemning \u201cInnocence of Muslims\u201d as an effort \u201cclearly crafted to provoke, offend, and to evoke outrage\u201d and called the film the attacker\u2019s motive.\n\nMichael Posner, then-assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, forwarded Saperstein\u2019s statement to other State Department officials calling it \u201cexcellent\u201d and advocating that they \u201cget the Conference of Presidents, the ADL etc. to follow suit and use similar language.\u201d\n\nSaperstein is now ambassador-at-large for International Religious Freedom.\n\nRelated documents obtained by Judicial Watch prove that the U.S. military believed the attack was tied to Islamic terrorism.\n\nThe Sept. 11, 2012 attack resulted in the deaths of four Americans: U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, Foreign Service information management officer Sean Smith, and security officers Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty. Woods and Doherty were former Navy SEALs. Three other Americans were wounded.\n\nJudicial Watch had filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the State Department in order to obtain \u201cany and all records concerning, regarding, or related to notes, updates or reports created in response to the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "State Department aides knew that the American consulate in Benghazi was under attack by armed assailants and that terrorists were claiming credit.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "State Department aides knew that the American consulate in Benghazi was under attack by armed assailants and that terrorists were claiming credit.", "title": "Emails Show State Department Aides Knew Early On Benghazi Attack Had Terror Ties", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericastwelve130787.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1awyCmZ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "State Department aides knew that the American consulate in Benghazi was under attack by armed assailants and that terrorists were claiming credit.", "title": "Emails Show State Department Aides Knew Early On Benghazi Attack Had Terror Ties", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericastwelve130787.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-02-28T15:49:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Benghazi, Benghazi attack, Hillary Clinton, 2016, Cheryl Mills, Ready for Hillary"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd010d\"", "article_summary": "The Sept. 11, 2012 attack resulted in the deaths of four Americans: U.S.\nOn Sept.11, 2012, State Department aides knew that the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya was under attack by armed assailants and soon after, that a terrorist group was claiming credit for the attack, according to documents from the U.S. Department of State obtained by Judicial Watch and released Thursday.\nMichael Posner, then-assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, forwarded Saperstein\u2019s statement to other State Department officials calling it \u201cexcellent\u201d and advocating that they \u201cget the Conference of Presidents, the ADL etc.\nAmbassador Stevens, who is currently in Benghazi, and four COM [Chief of Mission] personnel are in the compound safe haven.\nRelated documents obtained by Judicial Watch prove that the U.S. military believed the attack was tied to Islamic terrorism."}
