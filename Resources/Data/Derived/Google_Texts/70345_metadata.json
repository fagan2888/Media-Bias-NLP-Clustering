Former co-chair of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.\n\nEducation: B.A. University of Texas at Austin.\n\nFamily: Married to Columba Bush (1974), with three adult children. Noelle Bush has made news with her struggle with drug addiction, and related arrests. George P. Bush was elected Texas land commissioner in 2014. Jeb's father George H.W. Bush was the 41st President of the United States, and his brother George W. Bush was number 43.\n\nClaim to fame: Jeb was an immensely popular governor with strong economic and jobs credentials. He is also one of just two GOP candidates who is fluent in Spanish.\n\nAchilles heel: Bush has angered conservatives with his permissive positions on illegal immigration (saying some border-crossing is 'an act of love) and common-core education standards. His last name could also be a liability with voters who fear establishing a family dynasty in the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Christie New Jersey governor\n\nAge on Election Day: 54\n\nReligion: Catholic\n\nBase: Establishment-minded conservatives\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9: Governor of New Jersey. Former U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. Former Morris County freeholder and lobbyist.\n\nGovernor of New Jersey. Former U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. Former Morris County freeholder. Former statehouse lobbyist.\n\nEducation: B.A. University of Delaware, Newark, J.D. Seton Hall University.\n\nFamily: Married to Mary Pat Foster (1986) with four children.\n\nClaim to fame: Pugnacious and unapologetic, Christie once told a heckler to 'sit down and shut up' and brings a brash style to everything he does. That includes the post-9/11 criminal prosecutions of terror suspects that made his reputation as a hard-charger.\n\nAchilles heel: Christie is often accused of embracing an ego-driven and needlessly abrasive style. His administration continues to operate under a 'Bridgegate' cloud: At least two aides have been indicted in an alleged scheme to shut down lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge as political retribution for a mayor who refused to endorse the governor's re-election.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarly Fiorina Former tech CEO\n\nAge on Election Day: 62\n\nReligion: Episcopalian\n\nBase: Conservatives\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9: Former CEO of Hewett-Packard. Former group president of Lucent Technologies. Former U.S. Senate candidate in California.\n\nEducation: B.A. Stanford University. UCLA School of Law (did not finish). M.B.A. University of Maryland. M.Sci. Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nFamily: Married to Frank Fiorina (1985), with one adult step-daughter and another who is deceased. She has two step-grandchildren. Divorced from Todd Bartlem (1977-1984).\n\nClaim to fame: Fiorina was the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company, something that could provide ammunition against the Democratic Party's drive to make Hillary Clinton the first female president. She is also the only woman in the 2016 GOP field, making her the one Republican who can't be accused of sexism.\n\nAchilles heel: Fiorina's unceremonious firing by HP's board has led to questions about her management and leadership styles. And her only political experience has been a failed Senate bid in 2010 against Barbara Boxer.\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsey Graham South Carolina senator\n\nAge on Election Day: 61\n\nReligion: Southern Baptist\n\nBase: Otherwise moderate war hawks\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9: U.S. senator. Retired Air Force Reserves colonel. Former congressman. Former South Carolina state representative.\n\nEducation: B.A. University of South Carolina. J.D. University of South Carolina Law School.\n\nFamily: Never married. Raised his sister Darline after their parents died while he was a college student and she was 13.\n\nClaim to fame: Graham is a hawk's hawk, arguing consistently for greater intervention in the Middle East, once arguing in favor of pre-emptive military strikes against Iran. His influence was credited for pushing President George W. Bush to institute the 2007 military 'surge' in Iraq.\n\nAchilles heel: Some of his critics have taken to call him 'Grahamnesty,' citing his participating in a 2013 'gang of eight' strategy to approve an Obama-favored immigration bill. He has also aroused the ire of conservative Republicans by supporting global warming legislation and voting for some of the president's judicial nominees.\n\n\n\n\n\nBobby Jindal Louisiana governor\n\nAge on Election Day: 45\n\nReligion: Catholic\n\nBase: Social conservatives\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9: Governor of Louisiana. Former congressman. Former Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Planning and Evaluation. Former Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals.\n\nEducation: B. Sci. Brown University. M.Litt. New College at Oxford University\n\nFamily: Married to Supriya Jolly (1997), with three children, each of whom has an Indian first name and an American middle name. Bobby Jindal's given name is Piyush.\n\nClaim to fame: Jindal's main source of national attention has been his strident opposition to federal-level 'Common Core' education standards, which included a federal lawsuit that a judge dismissed in late March. He is also outspoken on the religious-freedom issues involved in mainstreaming gay marriage into the lives of American Christians.\n\nAchilles heel: During his first term as governor, Jindal signed a science education law that requires schools to present alternatives to the theory of evolution, including religious creationism. His staunch defense of businesses that want to steer clear of providing services to same-sex couples at their weddings will win points among evangelicals but alienate others.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Pataki Former New York governor\n\nAge on Election Day: 71\n\nReligion: Catholic\n\nBase: Centrists\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9: Former governor of New York. Former New York state senator and state assemblyman. Former mayor of Peekskill, NY.\n\nEducation: B.A. Yale University. J.D. Columbia Law School.\n\nFamily: Married to Libby Rowland (1973), with four adult children.\n\nClaim to fame: Pataki was just the third Republican governor in New York's history, winning an improbable victory over three-term incumbent Mario Cuomo in 1994. He was known for being a rare tax-cutter in Albany and was also the sitting governor when the 9/11 terror attacks rocked New York CIty in 2001.\n\nAchilles heel: While Pataki's liberal-leaning social agenda plays well in the Empire State, it won't win him any fans among the GOP's conservative base. He supports abortion rights and gay rights, and has advocated strongly in favor of government intervention to stop global warming, which right-wingers believe is overblown as a global threat.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio Florida senator\n\nAge on Election Day: 45\n\nReligion: Catholic\n\nBase: Conservatives\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9: US senator, former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, former city commissioner of West Miami\n\nEducation: B.A. University of Florida. J.D. University of Miami School of Law.\n\nFamily: Married to Jeanette Dousdebes (1998), with two sons and two daughters. Jeanette is a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader who posed for the squad\u2019s first swimsuit calendar.\n\nClaim to fame: Rubio's personal story as the son of Cuban emigres is a powerful narrative, and helped him win his Senate seat in 2010 against a well-funded governor whom he initially trailed by 20 points.\n\nAchilles heel: Rubio was part of a bipartisan 'gang of eight' senators who crafted an Obama-approved immigration reform bill in 2013 which never became law \u2013 a move that angered conservative Republicans. And he was criticized in 2011 for publicly telling a version of his parents' flight from Cuba that turned out to appear embellished.\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump Real estate developer\n\nAge on Election Day: 70\n\nReligion: Presbyterian\n\nBase: Conservatives\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9: Chairman of The Trump Organization. Fixture on the Forbes 400 list of the world's richest people. Star of 'Celebrity Apprentice.'\n\nEducation: B.Sci. Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania\n\nFamily: Married to Melania Trump (2005). Divorced from Ivana Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 (1977-92) and Marla Maples(1993\u201399). Five grown children. Trump's father Fred Trump amassed a $400 million fortune developing real estate.\n\nClaim to fame: Trump's niche in the 2016 campaign stems from his celebrity as a reality-show host and his enormous wealth \u2013 more than $10 billion, according to Trump. Because he can self-fund an entire presidential campaign, he is seen as less beholden to donors than other candidates. He has grabbed the attention of reporters and commentators by unapologetically staking out controversial positions and refusing to budge in the face of criticism.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Ann,Romney,says,Mitt,right,decision,not,run,president,2016", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3262105/Ann-Romney-says-Mitt-right-decision-not-run-president-2016.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Ann Romney, the wife of 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, says she and her husband 'made the right decision' to skip the 2016 race and do not regret it at all, she said in an interview Monday.", "title": "Ann Romney says Mitt 'made the right decision' against 2016 campaign", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3262105/Ann-Romney-says-Mitt-right-decision-not-run-president-2016.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/10/06/17/2D247A3800000578-0-image-a-8_1444147522450.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3262105/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3262105/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3262105, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Ann,Romney,says,Mitt,right,decision,not,run,president,2016", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-10-06T16:07:03.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=J.+Taylor+Rushing,+U.s.+Political+Reporter,+For+Dailymail.com", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-10-06T18:39:20.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Ann Romney says Mitt right decision not run president 2016"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Ann Romney, the wife of 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, says she and her husband 'made the right decision' to skip the 2016 race and do not regret it at all, she said in an interview Monday.", "title": "Ann Romney says Mitt 'made the right decision' against 2016 campaign", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3262105/Ann-Romney-says-Mitt-right-decision-not-run-president-2016.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/10/06/17/2D247A3800000578-0-image-a-8_1444147522450.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/bc/rtmp_uds/1418450360/2012/08/29/1418450360_1811697947001_ANN-ROMNEY.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Ann Romney, the wife of 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, says she and her husband 'made the right decision' to skip the 2016 race and do not regret it at all, she said in an interview Monday."}, "article_summary": "Achilles heel: Bush has angered conservatives with his permissive positions on illegal immigration (saying some border-crossing is 'an act of love) and common-core education standards.\nCarly Fiorina Former tech CEOAge on Election Day: 62Religion: EpiscopalianBase: ConservativesR\u00e9sum\u00e9: Former CEO of Hewett-Packard.\nLindsey Graham South Carolina senatorAge on Election Day: 61Religion: Southern BaptistBase: Otherwise moderate war hawksR\u00e9sum\u00e9: U.S. senator.\nChris Christie New Jersey governorAge on Election Day: 54Religion: CatholicBase: Establishment-minded conservativesR\u00e9sum\u00e9: Governor of New Jersey.\nJeb Bush Former Florida governorAge on Election Day: 63Religion: CatholicBase: ModeratesR\u00e9sum\u00e9: Former Florida governor and secretary of state."}
