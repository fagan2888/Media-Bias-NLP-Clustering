Over 40 percent of them are covered by Medicaid, the single largest provider for people with the virus, while another 30 percent have private health insurance. Around 17 percent of the HIV-positive Americans getting treatment remain uninsured, and could benefit greatly from the law\u2019s coverage expansion.\n\nBut many of them won\u2019t. Over four in ten of uninsured HIV-positive Americans won\u2019t be eligible for Medicaid in the 24 GOP-led states opposed to the health law\u2019s optional expansion of the program:\n\nFortunately, Obamacare represents a step forward despite the ongoing opposition to Medicaid expansion. The KFF report estimates that about 27,000 Americans with HIV will become eligible for Medicaid in the 26 pro-expansion states and another 25,000 people will qualify subsidized private insurance coverage through Obamacare\u2019s statewide marketplaces. And that\u2019s just the people actively pursuing treatment \u2014 the study authors write that \u201can additional 124,000 people with HIV not receiving regular medical care could be newly eligible for coverage either through Medicaid or in the Marketplace,\u201d bringing \u201cthe total estimated number of people with HIV who could gain new coverage to close to 200,000\u201d under Obamacare.\n\nFortunately, the HIV-positive Americans who won\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or subsidized private insurance in the states refusing expansion will have at least some resources available to them. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the largest such program for people with HIV/AIDS, will still assist low-income and under-insured individuals afford treatment (although they may have to get particularly sick before that coverage kicks in). But the fact remains that 96 percent of uninsured Americans with HIV would be able to get either subsidized Obamacare plans or Medicaid coverage if all states expanded the program.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Nearly 200,000 Americans with HIV will have more coverage options under Obamacare.
