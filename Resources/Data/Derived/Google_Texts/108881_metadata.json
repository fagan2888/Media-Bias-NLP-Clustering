And then they count how many drinks the famous 007 consumes in one day.\n\nDoctors in Derby and Nottingham in England decided to sit and read 14 James Bond novels, like Casino Royale and From Russia With Love, jotting down in a notebook each day and every drink the famous spy gulps down. The doctors charted 88 days of alcohol consumption, with Bond drinking some 1,150 units of alcohol within that time frame. They didn\u2019t count the days he was in prison, rehab, or the hospital. They then published a study about their findings in the British Medical Journal.\n\nOn average, James Bond drinks 92 units of alcohol a week, or five vodka martinis a day. That\u2019s four times the recommended maximum alcohol intake for men in the UK, which states that an adult male should drink no more than 21 units a week \u2014 about 4 units a day. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want this person defusing a nuclear bomb,\u201d Patrick Davies, a consultant in pediatric intensive care at Nottingham University Hospitals, told the BBC. \u201cHe\u2019s a very glamorous person, he gets all the girls and that\u2019s totally incompatible with the lifestyle of an alcoholic, which he is.\u201d James Bond would be classified in the \u201ctop whack\u201d of severe alcoholics, Davies continued.\n\nAlcoholics are at risk for liver damage, an early death as well as impotence. So the authors of the study believe that even though it\u2019s a rather light-hearted point of research, it also brings an important message: excessive drinking can be damaging, and it causes up to 2.5 million deaths per year globally.\n\nThere is, of course, such a thing as a \u201cfunctioning alcoholic\u201d \u2014 someone who is able to maintain a high degree of functionality in their daily lives, including their job and some relationships. But the doctors of the study note a person who drinks as much as James Bond most likely wouldn\u2019t even be functioning at that point: \u201cThe level of functioning as displayed in the books is inconsistent with the physical, mental, and indeed sexual functioning expected from someone drinking this much alcohol,\u201d they said. They pointed out that in Casino Royale, Bond consumes over 39 units of alcohol in one sitting before jumping into his car for a high-speed chase. He ends up crashing the car and spending 14 days in the hospital. \u201cWe hope that this was a salutatory lesson,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\n\u201cAlthough we appreciate the societal pressures to consume alcohol when working with international terrorists and high stakes gamblers, we would advise Bond to be referred for further assessment of his alcohol intake,\u201d the authors wrote in their conclusion.\n\nSource: Johnson G, Guha I, Davies P.
