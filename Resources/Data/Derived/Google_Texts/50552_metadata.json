But this framework comes with some issues of its own.\n\nAt the heart of Trump\u2019s statement is the assumption that it\u2019s possible to separate abortion services from the rest of women\u2019s reproductive health care. This conservative approach to abortion, which sets the standard for current U.S. policy in the field of reproductive health, has been harming patients for decades.\n\nU.S. lawmakers have worked to keep abortion segregated from the rest of the health care industry for years. Under the decades-old Hyde Amendment, taxpayer funding isn\u2019t allowed to be allocated toward abortion services, which presents an inherent divide. On top of that, the political nature of the issue has dissuaded many public hospitals from performing abortions, so the procedure has been relegated to stand-alone clinics that are left more vulnerable to anti-abortion harassment. More recently, political fights over the Affordable Care Act have given abortion opponents an opportunity to restrict insurance coverage for the procedure even further, continuing to prevent abortion from being streamlined into the rest of medical care.\n\nAs a result, getting an abortion in the United States can be a confusing and complicated process. Pregnant patients are often surprised to learn that their regular OB-GYN \u2014 the doctor whom they\u2019ve grown comfortable with \u2014 can\u2019t perform the procedure for them. It can be hard to find the closest stand-alone clinic. And then their insurance provider may not cover the cost.\n\nIt\u2019s an inefficient system that doesn\u2019t reflect the true nature of reproductive services. In reality, when it comes to women\u2019s health care, abortion doesn\u2019t stand alone.\n\nThe need for abortion services doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. If a woman is facing an unwanted pregnancy, that obviously means she\u2019s sexually active. She may need to be tested or treated for a sexually transmitted infection. She could be due for her regular gynecological exam. She might need to be screened for signs of intimate partner violence or domestic abuse. She\u2019s probably interested in the birth control options available to help her prevent future pregnancies. Plus, since the majority of U.S. patients who have abortions are already parenting at least one child, she may also be thinking about health services related to her children \u2014 maybe she needs help breastfeeding, or maybe she has questions about her child\u2019s recommended vaccinations.\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t even take into account the blurry line between the health services related to miscarriage and abortion. No matter how a pregnancy loss is officially defined, women typically need the same type of medical care. But if they\u2019re in a hospital that doesn\u2019t perform abortions, they may not get that care \u2014 and their health could seriously suffer as a result.\n\nAside from the practical and logistical questions about the delivery of health care, proponents of abortion rights say there\u2019s another problem with separating out abortion care: It reinforces the stigma against abortion. Ultimately, in a society that already treats abortion as something that\u2019s shameful and immoral, it communicates to the estimated one in three U.S. women who will have an abortion in their lifetimes that this procedure is not routine.\n\n\u201cThere are a million ways in which our laws create institutional stigma and tell women that they\u2019re doing the wrong thing,\u201d Louise Melling, the deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union and an expert who often speaks on abortion stigma, explained in a previous interview with ThinkProgress.\n\nDownplaying Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion services in favor of highlighting the \u201cgood\u201d things that the organization does reinforces this separation and this stigma. It creates an implicit hierarchy for the types of services that \u201cgood\u201d patients visit their local Planned Parenthood clinic to receive. Nonetheless, this is a framework that the pro-choice community itself sometimes falls into. Planned Parenthood officials often assure the public that abortion represents just 3 percent of the organization\u2019s overall health services. The message comes across as: Don\u2019t worry, you can trust us, we\u2019re mainly focused on the right things.\n\nFrom a political perspective, Planned Parenthood\u2019s supporters may assume it\u2019s simply easier to defend the organization without wading into contentious abortion politics. For instance, when President Obama became the first sitting president to address the national organization during an appearance at its 2013 annual conference, he didn\u2019t use the word \u201cabortion\u201d once in his speech to a room full of women\u2019s health proponents.\n\nBut, as a strategy to combat the current controversy swirling around Planned Parenthood \u2014 which has come under attack from anti-abortion activists who have a long history of working to discredit the organization\u2019s work \u2014 the defense is a bit mismatched.\n\nAfter all, Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t being attacked by abortion opponents because it offers STD tests and Pap smears. It\u2019s been a longstanding target since Roe v. Wade specifically because it provides abortions. A more logical response to that, though it\u2019s one that Donald Trump certainly isn\u2019t likely to make, would be a defense of abortion itself as an essential health service for millions of women who say it was the right choice for them.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Defending Planned Parenthood by pointing to its other services isn't a real defense.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Defending Planned Parenthood by pointing to its other services isn't a real defense.", "title": "You Can\u2019t Separate Abortion From The Rest Of What Planned Parenthood Does", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/08/12/3690714/planned-parenthood-abortion-separate/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AP_565930924796.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Defending Planned Parenthood by pointing to its other services isn't a real defense.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AP_565930924796-321x214.jpg", "title": "You Can\u2019t Separate Abortion From The Rest Of What Planned Parenthood Does", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AP_565930924796.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AP_565930924796.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-12T16:04:43+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd660\"", "article_summary": "Downplaying Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion services in favor of highlighting the \u201cgood\u201d things that the organization does reinforces this separation and this stigma.\nUnder the decades-old Hyde Amendment, taxpayer funding isn\u2019t allowed to be allocated toward abortion services, which presents an inherent divide.\nAt the heart of Trump\u2019s statement is the assumption that it\u2019s possible to separate abortion services from the rest of women\u2019s reproductive health care.\nAside from the practical and logistical questions about the delivery of health care, proponents of abortion rights say there\u2019s another problem with separating out abortion care: It reinforces the stigma against abortion.\nPlanned Parenthood officials often assure the public that abortion represents just 3 percent of the organization\u2019s overall health services."}
