A Democrat and huge supporter of the Affordable Care Act revealed that her own health insurance plan was cancelled, despite the president’s claims to the contrary, and that premiums for her replacement plan under ObamaCare were going to almost double.

“If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period,” President Obama repeatedly promised. “No one will take it away. No matter what.”

Well, not quite, noted “The Kelly Files” host Megyn Kelly to her guest, Fox News political analyst Kirsten Powers Thursday.

Powers, who has supported Obamacare from the start, agreed and admitted that it resulted in the cancellation of her previous policy, adding that her new policy monthly premiums jumped significant;y.

“I can get roughly the same insurance — it’s not completely clear,” she said. “But it’ll go up from about $160 a month in a $2,500 deductible. If I want to keep a $2,500 deductible it’ll go up to about $300 a month.”

Powers added, “I don’t think that’s quite the way they sold it.”

No kidding.

Breitbart News’ John Sexton took note and tweeted:

She later said that notwithstanding her experience, she continues to support Obamacare. Watch the video.
