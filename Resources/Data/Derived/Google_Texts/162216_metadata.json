And it\u2019s possible that they\u2019ll be so disgusted with Republican obstructionism that they\u2019ll either vote for Hillary Clinton or skip 2016 altogether. That could happen, for sure.\n\nBut it\u2019s just as likely that the political ramifications of Garland\u2019s snubbing will be minimal, and that the president\u2019s efforts to cast himself as The Only Adult in the Room will, once again, fail for succeeding. He and his proxy, Hillary Clinton, will be seen as stolid and reasonable \u2014 and as a result they\u2019ll gain roughly zero votes that they didn\u2019t have already. This could be a lesser repeat of the Grand Bargain fiasco of 2011, it\u2019s true.\n\nEither way, though, it would be a mistake to interpret the president\u2019s nominating Garland \u2014 rather than a more unapologetically liberal or demographically atypical candidate \u2014 as a sign that Obama still can\u2019t recognize the GOP\u2019s bad faith. He recognizes it plenty. It\u2019s the main reason, in fact, that Obama is trying to camouflage his offer as an open hand when it\u2019s really more of an iron fist.\n\n\u201cIron fist\u201d is a bit much, I admit. Even at his most ruthless, that\u2019s not really Obama\u2019s style. As a former National Security Council official once said, the president is a \u201cgambler\u201d; and like any good gambler, he prefers to make bets that are as close as possible to a win-win. Garland fits that mold, because even if Republicans do accept Obama\u2019s offer, Garland still propels the median vote of the Supreme Court well to the left of where it was just a few months ago.\n\nBut if Senate Republicans still refuse to even hold hearings for Garland, much less give him an up-or-down vote, then the steeliness that undergirds Obama\u2019s plan will start to become more obvious. According to the New York Times, for example, the White House has reassembled much of the team that helped Obama win in 2008 and 2012. And they\u2019re planning one last national campaign to punish GOP intransigence.\n\nThe Times piece is vague with regard to how hard-hitting this mini-campaign will be, but there\u2019s no doubt that a significant portion of its funding, at the very least, will be devoted to attacking Republicans. If Obama\u2019s speech announcing Garland\u2019s nomination is anything to go by, it doesn\u2019t seem like all of those attacks will be from the left, either. And this is where Garland\u2019s reputation for \u201cmoderation\u201d comes in handy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president's nomination of an alleged moderate has some liberals scratching their heads.
