Normandy Beach, NJ Saturday, August 15, 2015 @dhoodhood (Photo: Doug Hood/Staff Photographer)Buy Photo\n\nNEPTUNE \u2013 You name it, and Tamara Wilson-Seidle was involved in it.\n\nHer nine children\u2019s lives. Her church. Her community. Coaching her soccer team.\n\n\u201cShe was like an angel on Earth,\u201d said Adrienne Sanders, president of the Asbury Park-Neptune NAACP, which honored Wilson-Seidle Saturday at its annual Community Pride Block Party.\n\nFriends said they were devastated when Wilson-Seidle \u2014 whose beautiful smile could only be topped by her personality \u2014 was shot and killed on June 16 by her ex-husband, Neptune police Sgt. Philip Seidle.\n\nThe local NAACP hosts the community block party every year as a way to give back to the community, Sanders said. The event provides a free, fun event for the community while also supporting local businesses who attended as vendors, including Meridian, the Visiting Nurses Association and the Asbury Park Press.\n\nSanders, who grew up on the same street a block away as Wilson-Seidle, said the local chapter decided to honor Wilson-Seidle because she was so giving to everyone around her.\n\n\u201cWe are just really making it well known the heart and passion that Tami had,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnyone who knew her knew she was a kind and giving person.\u201d\n\nSanders said it also draws attention to domestic violence and what the community can do to help prevent it.\n\nWilson-Seidle\u2019s oldest daughter Kirsten Seidle thanked the community for all of the support they\u2019ve given the family over the past two months.\n\nDoreen Bagner, of Patterson said she intends to honor Wilson-Seidle, her friend since childhood, by helping other women escape domestic violence.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t rest until we find answers,\u201d she said. \u201cMy goal in life is to build more places where women can reach out for help.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1Nxorw3", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The annual NAACP Community Pride Block Party held Saturday honored Tamara Wilson-Seidle.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "The annual NAACP Community Pride Block Party held Saturday honored Tamara Wilson-Seidle.", "title": "Asbury-Neptune NAACP honors \u201can angel\u201d in Wilson-Seidle", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/neptune-wall/neptune/2015/08/15/naacp-block-party-honors-angel-wilson-seidle/31785699/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The annual NAACP Community Pride Block Party held Saturday honored Tamara Wilson-Seidle.", "title": "Asbury-Neptune NAACP honors \u201can angel\u201d in Wilson-Seidle", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/016572d8068fa6b48de66d89126c07db4b90603d/c=280-0-1000-720&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/15/AsburyPark/B9318471823Z.1_20150815154425_000_GB1BKQRLB.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Tamara Wilson-Seidle, Wilson-Seidle, Neptune, block party, Tamara Wilson Seidle, NAACP, Philip Seidle"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd720d\"", "article_summary": "The local NAACP hosts the community block party every year as a way to give back to the community, Sanders said.\nBuy Photo The Asbury Park and Neptune NAACP chapter holds its annual Community Block Party in honor of Tamara Wilson-Seidle who was killed June 16 in Asbury Park.\n\u201cShe was like an angel on Earth,\u201d said Adrienne Sanders, president of the Asbury Park-Neptune NAACP, which honored Wilson-Seidle Saturday at its annual Community Pride Block Party.\nDoreen Bagner, of Patterson said she intends to honor Wilson-Seidle, her friend since childhood, by helping other women escape domestic violence.\nSanders, who grew up on the same street a block away as Wilson-Seidle, said the local chapter decided to honor Wilson-Seidle because she was so giving to everyone around her."}
