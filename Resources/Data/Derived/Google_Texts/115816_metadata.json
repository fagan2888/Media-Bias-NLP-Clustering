They try to shift it,\u201d Cruz alleged. \u201cThe war on women wasn\u2019t that \u2014 it was contraceptives.\u201d\n\nHe assured the crowd that progressives have tried to make the abortion debate into something it isn\u2019t by bringing contraceptives into the discussion \u2014 incorrectly.\n\n\u201cNow listen, I have been a conservative my entire life,\u201d Cruz continued. \u201cI have never met anybody, any conservative who wants to ban contraceptives.\u201d\n\nA civil rights issue \u2026 really?\n\nThe Canadian-born pro-life advocate then asserted that Leftists have intentionally crafted their abortion campaign to usher in women under the guise of a civil rights movement, calling the so-called \u201cwar on women\u201d to be utterly \u201cconcocted\u201d by the Left. He went on to say that Democrats have targeted pro-lifers for years in order to hide their extreme pro-abortion views.\n\nCruz then tried to figure out where the Clinton camp was coming from in order to come up with such an allegedly far-fetched campaign strategy.\n\n\u201cImagine for a second you\u2019re Hillary Clinton \u2026 You\u2019re trying to think, \u2018How do I run?\u2019\u201d Cruz continued. \u201cWell you can\u2019t run on the economy because we have the lowest percentage of Americans working any year since 1977. You can\u2019t run on Obamacare because millions of people have lost their jobs, lost their health care, lost their doctors, seen their premiums skyrocket. You certainly can\u2019t run on foreign policy because every country you touched as secretary of state is a disaster.\u201d\n\nAfter pondering Clinton\u2019s rationale for her pro-abortion stance against conservatives, Cruz ventured to give the Iowa crowd his own explanation.\n\n\u201cSo what do you do?\u201d Cruz asked Iowans. \u201cYou go, \u2018Ah, ha! Condom police. I\u2019m gonna make up a completely made-up threat and try to scare a bunch of folks into thinking someone\u2019s going to steal their birth control.\u2019 What nonsense.\u201d\n\nAccording to LifeNews.com\u2019s Steven Ertelt, Cruz\u2019s assertion about the Democrat\u2019s pro-abortion rhetoric as being nonsense is right on target\n\n\u201cCruz is correct that Clinton\u2019s abortion stance is out of touch with most Americans,\u201d Ertelt reported.\n\nErtelt then cited a Gallup Poll published in May showing that a majority of Americans (54 percent) would like to see all abortions become illegal, compared to just 29 percent of Americans \u2014 including Clinton \u2014 who believe that abortion should be made legal under any circumstance for women. He also noted a 2014 CNN poll that found that a majority of Americans believe abortion should be made illegal in almost any situation.\n\nVoting for life\n\nAs the son a pastor, Cruz has taken a strong pro-life stance, being very vocal about his support for the Republicans\u2019 fight to defund Planned Parenthood, especially in the wake of its selling baby body parts scandal.\n\nVoting with fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate earlier this month, Cruz made it clear that the government should not support the abortion giant Planned Parenthood with taxpayer dollars.\n\n\u201cThe vote we took today is a significant step towards repealing every word of Obamacare,\u201d Cruz proclaimed once he cast his ballot to defund Planned Parenthood. \u201cThis bill repeals as much of that failed law as we can under arcane Senate rules and the narrow guidelines of the budget.\u201d\n\nCruz added that he was pleased that his vote represented the next step in making sure that abortion facilities across the nation won\u2019t be paid through tax dollars.\n\n\u201cI am also encouraged that this bill prohibits taxpayer funds from going to abortion-providers,\u201d Cruz concluded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In response to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s aggressive pro-abortion campaign coining the pro-life movement as a \u201cwar on women,\u201d GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz shot back, calling her rhetoric \u201cnonsense.\u201d", "og": {"url": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/politics-govt/2015/12/12/cruz-hillary-s-war-on-women-rhetoric-nonsense", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5590237/ted_cruz.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "In response to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s aggressive pro-abortion campaign coining the pro-life movement as a \u201cwar on women,\u201d GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz shot back, calling her rhetoric \u201cnonsense.\u201d", "title": "Cruz: Hillary\u2019s 'war on women' rhetoric 'nonsense'"}, "twitter": {"site": "@onenewsnowcom", "image": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5590237/ted_cruz.jpg", "description": "In response to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s aggressive pro-abortion campaign coining the pro-life movement as a \u201cwar on women,\u201d GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz shot back, calling her rhetoric \u201cnonsense.\u201d", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cruz: Hillary\u2019s 'war on women' rhetoric 'nonsense'"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "keywords": "Ted Cruz,Hillary Clinton,war on women,abortion,pro-life,pro-abortion,Iowa,reproductive rights,civil rights,contraceptives,condoms,Republicans,2016,election,Michael F.
