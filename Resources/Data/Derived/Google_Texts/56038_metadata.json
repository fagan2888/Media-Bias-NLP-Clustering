Trent Franks of Arizona, 40 members of the House have signed onto a lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act on the grounds that it violates the Origination Clause because it failed to originate in the correct house of Congress.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento, Calif., is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. A federal judge sided in June with the Obama administration\u2019s defense of the sweeping health-insurance law.\n\n\u201cGiven that an Origination Clause challenge against a taxing bill of this magnitude has never before been mounted, it is imperative that this Court not sanction the lower court\u2019s superficial analysis of the Origination Clause,\u201d said the House Republicans\u2019 \u201cfriend-of-the-court\u201d brief filed Nov. 8.\n\nDespite its round-one loss, the case, Sissel v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is gaining interest among Obamacare critics who see it as the last best chance to overturn the massive health-care program in the courts.\n\n\u201cThis support from members of the House is especially significant because PLF\u2019s lawsuit defends the constitutional authority of the lower chamber, the legislative body that is closest to the people,\u201d said Paul J. Beard II, the foundation\u2019s principal attorney on the case.\n\nThe bill that became the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was originally a House bill giving housing tax credits to veterans, but the Senate deleted the language and substituted the 2,709-page health-care bill in a process known as \u201cgut and amend.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Senate can introduce the largest tax increase in American history by simply peeling off the House number from a six-page unrelated bill which does not raise taxes and pasting it on the \u2018Senate Health Care Bill,\u2019 and then claim with a straight face that the resulting bill originated in the House, in explicit contravention of the supreme law of the land, then the American \u2018rule of law\u2019 has become no rule at all,\u201d said the brief.\n\nIn her ruling against the lawsuit, District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell held that the ACA\u2019s revenue-raising was \u201cincidental\u201d to its main purpose and thus was not a \u201cbill for raising revenue\u201d as described in the Origination Clause.\n\nJudge Howell, appointed to the court by President Obama in 2010, also ruled that the Senate had merely amended a bill that began in the House.\n\nIn their brief, House Republicans disputed the judge\u2019s reasoning, arguing the Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s sleight of hand in crafting the ACA was deliberately intended to bypass the House\u2019s authority to originate revenue bills.\n\n\u201cWhat is most alarming and dangerous about this case, is that the senators knew exactly what they were doing in circumventing the Origination Clause,\u201d said the brief. \u201cAs explained by Sen. Reid\u2019s own \u2018Senior Health Counsel\u2019: \u201c[B]asically, we needed a non-controversial House revenue measure to proceed to, so that is why we used the Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act. It wasn\u2019t more complicated than that.\u2019\u201d\n\nAn earlier Obamacare lawsuit, which challenged the law\u2019s individual mandate, was rejected by the Supreme Court in June 2012. In the 5-4 majority opinion, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said the mandate was not a requirement to purchase insurance, but rather a tax.\n\n\u201cSince the 2010 elections, the people\u2019s immediate representatives have voted some 40 times to repeal or defund the ACA, but the senators, who sit for six years unchallenged, have never agreed,\u201d said the House Republicans\u2019 brief. \u201cThe Framers\u2019 exact fear of taxation without adequate representation has materialized due to the complete disregard of the mandates of the Origination Clause by the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nMr. Franks, who is chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution and civil justice, in April introduced House Resolution 153, which says the ACA violates the Constitution because it did not originate in the House. The resolution has 53 co-sponsors.\n\nThe Justice Department is expected to file a response to the appeal before the end of the year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Constitution says revenue-raising bills must originate in the House, and since the bill that became Obamacare was written in the Senate, House Republicans say that's a problem.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Constitution says revenue-raising bills must originate in the House, and since the bill that became Obamacare was written in the Senate, House Republicans say that\u2019s a problem.", "title": "Forty House Republicans side with Obamacare Origination Clause suit", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/17/forty-house-republicans-side-with-obamacare-origin/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/17/11172013_ap8871517037278201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/17/11172013_ap8871517037278201.jpg", "description": "The Constitution says revenue-raising bills must originate in the House, and since the bill that became Obamacare was written in the Senate, House Republicans say that's a problem.", "card": "summary", "title": "Forty House Republicans side with Obamacare Origination Clause suit"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Law Crime, House, Senate, Trent Franks"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd36b\"", "article_summary": "The Constitution says revenue-raising bills must originate in the House, and since the bill that became Obamacare was written in the Senate, House Republicans say that\u2019s a problem.\n\u201cGiven that an Origination Clause challenge against a taxing bill of this magnitude has never before been mounted, it is imperative that this Court not sanction the lower court\u2019s superficial analysis of the Origination Clause,\u201d said the House Republicans\u2019 \u201cfriend-of-the-court\u201d brief filed Nov. 8.\n\u201cWhat is most alarming and dangerous about this case, is that the senators knew exactly what they were doing in circumventing the Origination Clause,\u201d said the brief.\n\u201cSince the 2010 elections, the people\u2019s immediate representatives have voted some 40 times to repeal or defund the ACA, but the senators, who sit for six years unchallenged, have never agreed,\u201d said the House Republicans\u2019 brief.\nLed by Rep.
