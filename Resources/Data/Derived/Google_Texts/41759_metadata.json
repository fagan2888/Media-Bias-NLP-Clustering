More guns equals fewer gun deaths. Keeping Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons will give them nuclear weapons. Don\u2019t close Gitmo, no matter how expensive and unnecessary it has become.\n\nYou know the positions. Basically anything opposite of where Obama stands.\n\nAll opposition to closing Guantanamo has been shot down. Are Republicans afraid that prison in the mainland United States can\u2019t be a miserable experience for prisoners?\n\nReasons to oppose include the fear terrorists will attack the communities near where the prisoners are kept. We\u2019ve housed terrorists in federal prisons before and are doing so now and yet, no terrorists attacks.\n\nThey\u2019re afraid the prisoners might escape. Yeah, I don\u2019t see a couple of terrorists tying rope to cell bar windows and yanking them out with horses. Yee ha!\n\nIt costs over $4 million a year to house each prisoner at Guantanamo. That\u2019s a weird position for people who claim to be fiscal conservatives.\n\nThe other thing is, closing Gitmo isn\u2019t not freeing all the prisoners. Also, since we\u2019re the United States and supposedly the greatest country on Earth, when we incarcerate people we should actually charge them with something. I know. Crazy.\n\nThe opposition to this and the other issues is as crazy as wanting Obama impeached, or jailed, even though he hasn\u2019t broken any laws\u2026or even had a real scandal. You\u2019re thinking of the Reagan, Bush, and Bush administrations.\n\n\n\nThis post and cartoon are by Clay Jones and are cross posted from his website www.claytoonz.com", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.audience": "Global", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.7", "og": {"site_name": "The Moderate Voice", "description": "Republicans and the Closing of Gitmo by Clay Jones I\u2019m not interested having a political discussion with someone whose position doesn\u2019t require thought.
