(DRI).\n\nThe move to a private health insurance exchange from coverage provided directly from a company is significant, with a reported 160,000 workers who will be eligible for coverage.\n\nWhile private health-exchanges are entirely separate from the ACA\u2019s exchanges, Walgreen\u2019s spokesman Michael Polzin says the drugstore chain decided to offer this coverage to 160,000 workers in order to keep them off government exchanges and provide them with broader coverage options.\n\nPolzin says while 160,000 of its 240,000 employees across the country will be eligible for coverage, with dependents of workers\u2019 families on the exchange, a total of 180,000 are expected to enroll.\n\n\u201cWe are currently only offering employees two high-deductible plans, and this was an opportunity for us to broaden the options for coverage,\u201d he says. \u201cOur exchange is a completely separate thing from the state-run exchanges for individuals. This is a corporate private exchange.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSears and Darden Restaurants plan to run their own private exchanges for employees ahead of Obamacare, and media giant Time Warner (TWX) and IBM (IBM) also recently announced plans to move retirees onto such benefit exchanges, and may move full-time workers to these plans in the future.\n\nPrivate exchanges are still a minority in the marketplace. But new research shows that by 2017, private exchange participation will approach public exchange enrollment levels. Global management consulting firm Accenture predicts projects nearly 18% of the American public will purchase insurance through these employer and insurance-run marketplaces now, and that one in four employers are expressing interest in these exchanges.\n\nWalgreen\u2019s private exchange will be run by Aon Hewitt, and will include offerings from major insurance companies including United HealthCare (UNH), Kaiser and Anthem. Walgreen\u2019s declined to comment on how much cash it would be giving to employees to shop in its exchange.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to send our employees to the state or government exchanges\u2014we want to continue providing health-care benefits to our employees, and this was a way to continue doing that,\u201d Polzin says. \u201cWe can provide them options, and continue providing wellness programs like we do today, such as getting paid for healthy behaviors, and having 100% of preventive health-care services covered.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification":
