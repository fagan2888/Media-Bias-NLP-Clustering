Seventy-five thousand are eligible to apply for federal tax credits. Health insurance companies have also begun dropping coverage for policies that do not conform to rules in the Affordable Care Act, according to published reports.\n\nImpact of delay had been discussed\n\nBecca Pearce, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, did not confirm or deny the Friday meeting, but instead provided Mayland Reporter with the following response:\n\n\u201cLast Monday, the Producer Advisory Council held a meeting that was open to the public,\u201d Pearce wrote in an email. \u201cAmong the topics discussed was the potential impact of launching the SHOP later than currently planned. What we heard from producers was that the impact on the small group market would be minimal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe frequently seek input from our advisory councils on a wide range of topics,\u201d Pearce continued. \u201cSeeking such feedback does not necessarily mean we will adopt a change. The Maryland Health Benefit Exchange board would have to adopt a change to the opening of SHOP, and it has not done so.\u201d\n\nSources said problems plaguing the launch of the individual health insurance exchange and an attempt to keep \"bad news down\" were brought up at Friday\u2019s meeting as reasons to potentially delay the launch of the small business exchange. As of last Wednesday, the Maryland Health Connection, the state's health insurance marketplace, had enrolled only 3,100 households since opening Oct. 1.\n\nMaryland\u2019s enrollment problems and IT glitches have mirrored those of the federal health exchange. News of another major problem associated with the Maryland Health Connection could affect consumer confidence and provide further reasons to delay implementation.\n\nLack of confidence in the roll out\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the federal rollout of the health care exchange program has added to the growing uncertainty and lack of confidence in this government healthcare program,\u201dsaid Ellen Valentino, Maryland state director of the National Federation of Independent Business. \u201cI suspect that lack of confidence will likely trickle down to the state level. It will be interesting to see if the Maryland SHOP exchange for small business can be rolled out as planned in January. We certainly hope so and are prepared to inform our membership.\u201d\n\nAlong with the cancellation of SHOP workshops, which were apparently removed from the exchange website without any notice, Tequila Terry, the exchange director responsible for partnerships with the commercial insurance industry no longer works for the health benefit exchange.\n\nAccording to an Oct. 22 Insurance and Financial Advisor article, Terry's last day with the agency was Oct. 18. Pearce said the exchange knew about Terry\u2019s decision to leave several weeks prior to it becoming public and she left for personal reasons.\n\nDelay would not surprise a major player\n\nKathy Simmons, who sits on the Exchange Implementation Advisory Committee (IAC), which oversees the individual and small business exchanges, said she was unaware of any meeting held last Friday.\n\n\"If there was a meeting, I think I would have been notified,\" Simmons said. \"But, if it was a board meeting, I don't necessarily get notified of those.\" Simmons is CEO of Group Benefit Services, a major benefits provider contracted by the exchange to help administer the exchange.\n\nSimmons also said a SHOP advisory committee meeting scheduled for Thursday had been cancelled without being rescheduled. She also had no knowledge of the cancelled SHOP workshops.\n\n\"Considering the difficulties they've had with the individual exchange, it would not surprise me that they would delay it another month or two, just to make sure the same types of technical difficulties aren't experienced in the SHOP,\" Simmons said.\n\nLast spring Maryland Health Secretary Joshua Sharfstein announced the exchange would push back the Oct. 1 SHOP launch to Jan. 1.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An abrupt cancellation of a series of small business exchange workshops by Maryland health officials has fueled speculation that for the second time this year the launch of the small business health insurance exchange, known as SHOP, will be delayed.", "original-source": "http://marylandreporter.com/2013/10/27/state-weighing-delay-of-jan-launch-for-small-business-health-exchange/", "og": {"site_name": "MarylandReporter.com", "description": "An abrupt cancellation of a series of small business exchange workshops by Maryland health officials has fueled speculation that for the second time this year the launch of the small business health insurance exchange, known as SHOP, will be delayed.", "title": "State weighing delay of Jan. launch for small business health exchange", "url": "http://marylandreporter.com/2013/10/27/state-weighing-delay-of-jan-launch-for-small-business-health-exchange/", "image": "http://marylandreporter.com/files/2015/07/maryland-SQ-771x771.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@mdreporter", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://marylandreporter.com/2013/10/27/state-weighing-delay-of-jan-launch-for-small-business-health-exchange/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Becca Pearce, Health, Joshua Sharfstein, Maryland Health Exchange, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd832\"", "article_summary": "As many as 85,000 Maryland small businesses will qualify to shop for health insurance plans when the small business exchange opens.\nBy Glynis KazanjianGlynis@marylandreporter.comAn abrupt cancellation of a series of small business exchange workshops by Maryland health officials has fueled speculation that for the second time this year the launch of the small business health insurance exchange, known as SHOP, will be delayed.\nAs of last Wednesday, the Maryland Health Connection, the state's health insurance marketplace, had enrolled only 3,100 households since opening Oct. 1.\n\"We postponed the [workshops] to focus our outreach efforts on the individual exchange,\" said Maryland Health Benefit Exchange Communications Director Danielle Davis.\nLast spring Maryland Health Secretary Joshua Sharfstein announced the exchange would push back the Oct. 1 SHOP launch to Jan. 1."}
