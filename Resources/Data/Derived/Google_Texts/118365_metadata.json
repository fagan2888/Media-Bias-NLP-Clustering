The company would not say where the cuts will take place. More than 1,500 of the system\u2019s 40,000 employees work in Joplin.\n\n\u201cMercy is managing the impact of market changes, including reimbursement reductions from government and commercial payers, lack of Medicaid expansion in most of the states we serve and declining inpatient utilization,\u201d the company said in a statement announcing the cuts.\n\nThe 2012 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of the provision in the health care law requiring Americans to either purchase health insurance or pay a fine also included something of a poison pill for President Barack Obama\u2019s health care plan: It said that the federal government could not force states to expand their Medicaid programs.\n\nIn order for the health care law to work, it is practically essential for Medicaid to be expanded. That\u2019s because cuts to Medicare\u2019s Disproportionate Share Hospital program, which helps reimburse hospitals for uncompensated care, were supposed to be made up for by Medicaid expansion. Advocates for Medicaid expansion \u2014 like the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry or the Missouri Hospitals Association \u2014 have dubbed this the \u201cObamacare cuts\u201d and are demanding lawmakers find a cure.\n\n\u201cMedicaid was a critical part of funding the bill,\u201d Peters said.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2019, Mercy expects about $100 million in federal cuts, on top of more the $13.8 million sequestered by the bill to avert the 2012 \u201cfiscal cliff.\u201d Last year, Freeman Health System\u2019s Joplin campuses received nearly $10 million in Medicare DSH payments. This year, the system expects a reduction of about $500,000, and when the federal health care law goes into full effect (including the cuts that have been delayed to DSH), they expect those payments to be completely eliminated.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely a threat for hospitals,\u201d said Paula Baker, CEO of Freeman Health Systems. She said she is not forecasting any layoffs similar to Mercy\u2019s yet. \u201cI think as we experience cuts, we have to step back and evaluate,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at this point, I\u2019m not seeing layoffs on our horizon.\u201d\n\nJoplin is one of the most conservative cities in the state. Its delegation to the General Assembly is broadly opposed to expanding Medicaid.\n\nBaker said she has sensed a shift in thought among local legislators.\n\n\u201cI think they understand the impact it has on the patients in the areas they serve and the impact on hospitals. There are smaller hospitals that are going to have a difficult time surviving with the types of cuts that are projected,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that they are open to looking at ways to make this work as we go into the next session.\u201d\n\nAt one point this year, a Republican plan did begin to float around the Capitol. Two Kansas City-area Republicans, Sen. Ryan Silvey and Rep. Noel Torpey, developed a plan that Governing magazine described as the \u201cmost conservative plan\u201d yet to expand Medicaid. Their plan coupled long-sought Republican reforms to entitlement programs like food stamps with efforts to expand Medicaid and leverage federal dollars to help those making between $23,550 and $33,000 purchase plans in the exchange.\n\nIn his budget for 2015, Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon called for the use $1.6 billion in federal funds to expand Medicaid coverage. According to his projections, that would save the state $86 million by shifting some of the state\u2019s Medicaid bill up to the federal government. \u201cWe make money as far as our budget,\u201d he said during an interview Friday at The Joplin Globe.\n\nNixon said the Mercy job cuts are a prime example of the economic case he\u2019s been making for Medicaid expansion all along.\n\n\u201cI tried to lay out that bad things could happen. Since they haven\u2019t moved forward, bad things are. The 200 Mercy employees, when they go home and don\u2019t have a paycheck, that\u2019s noticeable,\u201d he said. \u201cAs things get a little worse, the pressure builds.\u201d\n\nTheir plan did not get a vote, but Nixon said the fact that it was even introduced on the Senate floor was cause for optimism.\n\n\u201cThe problem you have is a political problem, not a policy problem,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cI think that elections mark a point, and you move forward from there.\u201d\n\nMore on The Joplin Globe.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.0.1", "og": {"site_name": "PoliticMo", "description": "JOPLIN, Mo. \u2014 For Missouri hospitals, the federal health care law has caused quite a conundrum.
