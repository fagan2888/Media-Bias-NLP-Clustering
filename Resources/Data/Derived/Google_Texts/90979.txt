The NFL has cleared the Broncos without penalty or fine after investigating whether quarterback Peyton Manning and offensive coordinator Adam Gase were in violation of the collective bargaining agreement by showing up at the University of Alabama football offices on the same day in early April.

The CBA forbids players from having individual meetings with their coaches before teams begin their offseason workout programs. However, Alabama head coach Nick Saban clarified that while he talked one-on-one with Manning about football, Gase was not in the room. Gase was formerly Saban’s assistant at Michigan State and LSU.

“I’m like shocked that anybody would think someone did anything wrong on their part,” Saban told the Denver Post on April 18. “I never met with Adam. When I talked with him I talked about his family. Peyton, we talked an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon. Adam had been talking to our assistant coaches. I never talked with Adam about football.”

Saban’s Crimson Tide opened its 2014 season Saturday with a 33-23 victory against West Virginia and plays it’s second game this Saturday against Florida Atlantic.

Gase and Manning open the Broncos’ season Sunday night against the Indianapolis Colts.
