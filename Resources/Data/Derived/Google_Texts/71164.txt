Special Spaces of Panama City held a fundraising event Saturday to help with the upcoming room makeover projects they have in October.

The event took place at Margaritaville in Panama City Beach.

All of the groups four previous participants of the room makeovers attended the event. There was music, a bake sale, a raffle and even a silent auction.

"To be able to bring them out and show them you know we appreciate them being here and what they've done for us, as well as us for them because all of our kids that we've done rooms for their families all now volunteer with us and help with the next room," said Sherry Melton, Director of Special Spaces of Panama City.

"Making dreams come true, for the kids, it's enabling them to express happiness toward the volunteers and the family members who come out to assist to re building their dream makeovers," said Dale Green, Margaritaville manager.
