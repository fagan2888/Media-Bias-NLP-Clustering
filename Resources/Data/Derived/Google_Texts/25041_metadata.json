You can listen to Beck\u2019s commentary in our follow-up story.\n\nFor the original news story, read below.\n\n\u2013\n\nAfter repeatedly criticizing senators such as Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) over their crusade to defund Obamacare, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called for the \u201ctotal repeal\u201d of the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday. It\u2019s a quick turnaround after the longtime senator, in September, proclaimed that it was \u201cnot rational\u201d to think Obamacare could be defunded or repealed.\n\nMcCain outlined his \u201csolution\u201d during an interview with Greta Van Susteren, which culminated in an admission that the law should be repealed completely.\n\n\u201cThe solution is, first of all, to let people keep their insurance if they want to,\u201d he said. \u201cOr at least reinstate them.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cSecond of all, let the insurance companies give a menu of whatever they want to provide. Third of all, medical savings account. Fourth of all, medical malpractice reform. Let people go across state lines to, in order to, if they can get a better insurance policy in another state. And remove this whole tax incentive for employers to provide employees health insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is repeal,\u201d Van Susteren said, pointing out the obvious.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly right,\u201d McCain replied. \u201cThat is total repeal in every other way. Because what Obamacare is, is an experiment in social engineering \u2014 in other words, making healthy people pay more\u2026in order to subsidize the health care for people that are older and unhealthy. That is the ultimate in social engineering.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that McCain misspoke in calling for the full repeal of the Affordable Care act as the TV producers seemingly placed the caption \u201cSen. John McCain Calls for Total Repeal of Obamacare\u201d on the screen before he actually did, hinting that it may have been planned.\n\nWatch the segment via Fox News:\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nNow, flashback to September of 2013, when McCain criticized Cruz and other Republicans who were relentlessly trying to defund Obamacare through a series of political maneuvers.\n\n\u201cI can tell you, in the United States Senate, we will not repeal or defund Obamacare. We will not, and to think we can is not rational,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.\n\nMcCain has also argued on several occasions that American voters \u201cspoke\u201d on Obamacare when they re-elected President Barack Obama, and that Republicans lost the fight to repeal the law. In the same speech on the Senate floor, McCain said lawmakers should continue trying to \u201crepair Obamacare.\u201d\n\nWatch both videos below:\n\nIt should also be noted that McCain has called for the repeal of Obamacare in the past.\n\nFeatured image via AFP/Getty\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to reflect the fact that McCain has called for the repeal of Obamacare in the past while campaigning and during other speaking engagements.\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "UPDATE: On his radio show Thursday, TheBlaze's Glenn Beck called out McCain for his comments in September in light of his most recent remarks.
