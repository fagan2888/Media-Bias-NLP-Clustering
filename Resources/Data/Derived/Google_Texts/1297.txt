Arson is suspected in 20-mile swath of brush fires in south-central Kansas.

Reno County Sheriff Randy Henderson says the first of the 14 fires was reported around 7 a.m. Saturday in the southern part of the county. The Hutchinson News reports that the fires ended near Langdon.

Most of the fires were within 2 miles of the same road in open pastures and Conservation Reserve Program grass.

No structures were involved in any of these fires. The largest fire damaged several hundred acres of land.

The public is urged to look for suspicious activity.
