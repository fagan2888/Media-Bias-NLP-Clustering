It\u2019s just heating up.\n\nSure, Congress has decided how much money the government should spend overall, but not how to allocate that money among the many things the government does. And right now, the biggest sticking point involves \u201criders,\u201d a term you should expect to hear a lot in the coming weeks.\n\nSo what exactly is a rider? It\u2019s a provision that \u201crides\u201d on the coattails of a must-pass bill that it otherwise seems unrelated to, often because the provision couldn\u2019t get voted into law on its own.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s a legislative parasite.\n\nThese parasites are not new. One famous rider, which restricts use of government funds for abortions, has been around in some form since 1976. Riders have been used (and abused) by both parties.\n\nBut riders have been multiplying in the current Republican-controlled legislature, and they\u2019re being applied to a broader range of policy objectives than in the past. Perhaps that\u2019s not surprising in a Congress where fewer and fewer bills can break through the gridlock on their own. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, has also openly endorsed using riders as a tool to curb, change or reverse White House policies.\n\nOne form of rider was unusually common in the appropriations bills that we saw this year (and that will probably serve as a template in budget negotiations). This kind of rider basically kills an existing policy by defunding it.\n\nSee, for the most part, appropriations bills have language that looks like this: \u201cFor carrying out titles I and II of the Imaginary Piece of Legislation Act, $10,000,000 shall be available.\u201d\n\nBut lately legislators have been littering appropriations bills with language that looks more like this: \u201cNone of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement [law/rule/regulation we hate].\u201d\n\nIn other words, a backdoor repeal. If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, defund \u2019em.\n\nCan\u2019t successfully repeal Obamacare, despite more than 50 votes to do so? No worries. Just craft a health-care appropriations bill that explicitly prevents any funds from being \u201cused to implement, administer, enforce, or further any provision\u201d of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDon\u2019t like the White House\u2019s proposed rule requiring brokers who give retirement advice to always act in the best interests of their clients? Simply add language to an appropriations bill barring government funds from being \u201cused to finalize, implement, administer, or enforce\u201d it.\n\nDon\u2019t like the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s new net neutrality regulations? Don\u2019t want government scientists researching climate change? Don\u2019t like the laws and regulations intended to protect migratory birds, keep wetlands and waterways clean, or fulfill various other Environmental Protection Agency initiatives?\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nThis is about Congress using its \u201cpower of the purse,\u201d as House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) recently phrased it \u2014 but using that purse in the same way that an old lady walking in the bad part of town might use hers (i.e., to beat opponents into submission).\n\nOther provisions from bills considered this year wouldn\u2019t defund specific government initiatives entirely but instead cut funding just enough to cripple them. For example, proposed cuts to the Labor Department\u2019s Wage and Hour Division, which enforces minimum wage and overtime laws, would effectively prevent the division from recovering an estimated $70 million to $80 million in back wages on behalf of workers. Other provisos would roll back parts of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and pull funding promised to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nWe have no way of knowing which of these riders will make it through the current round of budget negotiations. The net neutrality rider is reportedly off the table, and it seems unlikely legislators will again sink all their political capital into defunding Planned Parenthood. But you never know. Recent comments by Ryan and other senior Republicans have indicated they may throw a bone to the Freedom Caucus.\n\nDemocrats can argue, and have argued, that these \u201cvexatious\u201d and \u201cideological\u201d riders have no place in legislation intended to keep the government up and running. And Republicans can argue, and have argued, that it would be petty for Obama to veto important spending bills just to protect some pet project.\n\nIn other words, come December, when the rider fight almost certainly threatens to trigger a government shutdown, both sides will blame one another.\n\nI hope you like poultry, America, because a game of chicken awaits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP \u201criders\u201d on spending bills portend a shutdown fight in December.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/crampell", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "GOP \u201criders\u201d on spending bills portend a shutdown fight in December.", "title": "The budget battle isn\u2019t over.
