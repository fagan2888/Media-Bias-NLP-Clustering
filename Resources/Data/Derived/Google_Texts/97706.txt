MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) — While it may not make it glow in the dark, neon green dye released into the water in the Everglades will help scientists working on projects aimed at restoring its natural flow through the wetlands.

Starting Tuesday, officials are substantially increasing the flow of water from the wetlands north of Everglades National Park south toward Florida Bay. They’ll track the dye over the next three months through several miles of the Everglades in an area drained by a system of canals and levels.

U.S. Geological Survey scientist Jud Harvey says the tracking experiment will show how increased water flows will improve wildlife habitat and protect freshwater supplies.

Officials expect the results of the large-scale experiment to help them make decisions about setting targets for increased water flows and about whether to plug canals that are no longer in use.
