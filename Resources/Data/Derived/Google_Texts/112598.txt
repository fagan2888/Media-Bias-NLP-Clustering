Alvin Liew, senior economist at UOB, describes the factors affecting the city-state's growth outlook.

Singapore's economy expanded 4.4 percent on year in the final quarter of 2013, below market expectations, data on Thursday showed.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a rise of 4.7 percent. The number also marked a slowdown from a revised 5.9 percent rise in the third quarter.

Measured on a quarterly, annualized basis, economic growth in the city state fell 2.7 percent in the last quarter of 2013 compared with analyst expectations for a 1.6 percent fall.

"Because of a better Q3 revised number, the slowdown in the quarterly Q4 number got bigger," Alvin Liew, senior economist at UOB told CNBC Asia's "Squawk Box" on Thursday.

"But be mindful that this is an initial number itself. Next month, we might get another slight revision so the full-year growth numbers could be a bit higher," he added.
