According the group\u2019s website, it was created when Blue Cross of California split into the nonprofit California Endowment and the big-name, big-profit insurance company WellPoint Health Benefits.\n\nAnd of course, WellPoint stands to benefit greatly from Obamacare. WellPoint-Anthem Blue Cross won the largest enrollment of any insurer on the California exchange, accounting for 30 percent of the state\u2019s Obamacare sign-ups at the end of the open enrollment period April 15, according to the L.A. Times. They\u2019re duly hiking premium rates by 4.6 percent for 2015.\n\nBut now the insurer-linked nonprofit is asking Californians to support a campaign to extend Obamacare to illegal immigrants \u2014 which would create even more Obamacare customers for the top insurer.\n\n\u201c1.4 Million Tax-Paying Californians are Denied Health Coverage,\u201d according to brochures the group is handing out across California. The group claims that extending eligibility for the Obamacare exchange \u2014 and taxpayer subsidies \u2014 to \u201cundocumented Californians\u201d is another \u201cbasic human right,\u201d according to the pamphlets.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for our state\u2019s leaders to finish the job so that all Californians, regardless of their immigration status, have access to affordable health coverage.\u201d\n\nAccording to The California Endowment, extending Obamacare eligibility to undocumented immigrants would expand coverage to up to 1.4 million more people. President Obama pledged that Obamacare benefits would not apply to illegal immigrants \u2014 inciting Republican Rep. Joe Wilson\u2019s infamous interruption \u2014 but the exchanges have so far struggled to handle the division between legal and illegal immigrants. (RELATED: Joe Wilson Says \u2018You Lie\u2019 Has Been Justified)\n\nLegal immigrants, who are typically eligible for exchanges, have stayed away from Obamacare in droves. A poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that many legal immigrants fear signing up through the government exchange because it may cast light on relatives\u2019 immigration status.\n\nAnd still, HealthCare.gov alone \u2014 not including California, with its sizable legal and illegal immigrant population \u2014 has received close to 1 million applications for coverage with inconsistencies related to citizenship and immigration. The Obama administration has only resolved about half its backlog and has promised to cancel coverage for another 300,000 Obamacare customers if they don\u2019t submit documentation by Sept. 5.

WellPoint\u2019s doing unexpectedly well in Obamacare exchanges so far this year, according to Forbes.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "A spin-off nonprofit with links to a top insurance company is pushing for Obamacare benefits to be extended to illegal immigrants.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A spin-off nonprofit with links to a top insurance company is pushing for Obamacare benefits to be extended to illegal immigrants.
