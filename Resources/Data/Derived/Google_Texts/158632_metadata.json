The delays have caused persistent issues for the agency, which faced a federal lawsuit this summer over noncompliance with application processing deadlines.\n\nTennCare hired consulting firm and Big Four auditor KPMG in December to help decide whether to select a new vendor.\n\n\"The state and current vendor have mutually decided it to be in their respective best interests to terminate the current contract early,\" the agency said in a press release.\n\nAccording to budget documents filed with the state, $4.6 million of the $35 million has been paid to Northrup Grumman, of which $468,000 was state funding.\n\nTennCare will begin the process of selecting a new vendor for the eligibility system development, according to the release, though a timeline has not been announced. The state will continue to use the federal health insurance marketplace to process TennCare applications.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Bureau of TennCare has dropped Northrop Grumman as the developer of the state's uncompleted Medicaid eligibility system.The Virginia-based aerospace a...", "og": {"image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://r1.nashvillepost.com/files/base/scomm/nvp/image/2015/01/640w/tennessee_icon.jpg", "height": 360}, "site_name": "Nashville Post", "description": "The Bureau of TennCare has dropped Northrop Grumman as the developer of the state's uncompleted Medicaid eligibility system.The Virginia-based aerospace a...", "title": "TennCare drops Northrop Grumman | Nashville Post"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "o_O5_bdskNaHgbV0mHqd8wA_IMrDlmcgCIhZcz_QpYU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Bureau of TennCare has dropped Northrop Grumman as the developer of the state's uncompleted Medicaid eligibility system.\nThe state will continue to use the federal health insurance marketplace to process TennCare applications.\nTennCare will begin the process of selecting a new vendor for the eligibility system development, according to the release, though a timeline has not been announced.\nAccording to budget documents filed with the state, $4.6 million of the $35 million has been paid to Northrup Grumman, of which $468,000 was state funding.\nTennCare hired consulting firm and Big Four auditor KPMG in December to help decide whether to select a new vendor."}
