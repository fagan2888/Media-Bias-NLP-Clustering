However, the Stevens Institute of Technology College Republicans chapter hosted American conservative social Ann Coulter yesterday evening to jump-start conversation regarding politics.\n\nCharles Shotmeyer, President of the College Republicans, commented \u201cMost people would agree that Stevens is politically asleep. That\u2019s why we brought Ann Coulter to campus.\u201d\n\nAfter her introduction, Coulter joked \u201cYou all thought I was here to talk about Brian Williams and ISIS.\u201d She warned the audience, \u201cISIS poses no threat to America\u2026 as long as you don\u2019t go to Syria.\u201d Instead, she dove directly into her opinions regarding President Obama\u2019s recent proposed immigration amnesty.\n\nAs it stands, the proposed immigration amnesty would benefit the 12 to 20 million undocumented illegal immigrants currently living in the United States. Coulter argued that amnesty will be an incorrigible mistake on the government\u2019s doing and is actually devastating the low-income Americans.\n\nCoulter believes that it is impossible to discuss immigration policy with Democrats. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a rational discussion about immigration because Democrats will use that magical \u2018racist\u2019 word. Amnesty is going to hurt the low-income, African-American communities in America.\u201d As a conservative, Coulter is critical of Democrats and Republicans alike. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Republicans are helping them\u2026 Democrats just want the votes, Republicans want the campaign cash, and rich people want cheap labor.\u201d She articulated that immigrants are the biggest supporters of big government, and therefore fuel the Democratic party. \u201cDemocrats care about immigrants only until they place their vote.\n\nCoulter fears that amnesty will be the end of politics. Speaking directly to the technical students in the audience, she said half-jokingly, \u201cYou\u2019re all engineers so maybe you won\u2019t care. But if Republicans do not block Obama\u2019s federal amnesty, there will be no reason to care about politics anymore.\u201d\n\nCoulter also went into detail regarding her views on the Affordable Healthcare Act. \u201cFor those who have an Obama-care waiver, you have no idea what is coming.\u201d She believes that the current healthcare system is a \u201cgiant welfare program designed to look like healthcare.\u201d She finds the system to be completely flawed, and argued that it is \u201cmathematically impossible\u201d to cover all of the costs that Obama-care currently encompasses. She verbalized her disappointment in the passing of the healthcare legislation. \u201cNever has such a major piece of legislation been passed purely on party lines.\u201d\n\nDino Favetta, Class of \u201980 and adjunct professor at Stevens, agreed with Ms. Coulter\u2019s perspective regarding healthcare. \u201cHealthcare is an absolute socialist poison, bordering on communism. I agree with Ms. Coulter with respect to the healthcare system and how it is not benefiting anyone.\u201d\n\nHer solution? \u201cThe free market, where everything in the history of time, over time, gets better and cheaper, whereas everything provided by the government gets more expensive and worse.\u201d She provided examples of free market solutions, such as the flat-screen TV, cell phones, Netflix, and air travel. \u201cWe need to get our healthcare on the system that created the iPhone and FedEx.\u201d She blames Democrats for not recognizing the problems at large. \u201cMollusks can learn from what is in front of them. Clearly, Democrats cannot.\u201d\n\nCoulter ended her own presentation and opened the floor for questions from the audience. Slowly, students stepped up to the microphone to question the 10-time New York Times Best-Selling Author. Stevens student Hart Welles asked Coulter about robots taking jobs. She responded, \u201cI\u2019m all for it because it\u2019s technology\u2026 I don\u2019t have to pay welfare for robots.\u201d\n\nAnother student questioned Coulter about whether her ideas about gender and race are bona-fide or just a method of getting attention. Ms. Coulter paused and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think my opinions are controversial. I do think we should take the women\u2019s right to vote away, so maybe that\u2019s controversial.\u201d She clarified that denying women\u2019s suffrage was a joke, however she did state, \u201cwomen who have liberal ideals should not be able to vote.\u201d\n\nA Chinese student posed the question \u201cIf liberals and democrats all turned over to a more Republican and conservative view, do you think this country would improve?\u201d to which Coulter replied, \u201cI\u2019d rather take the Chinese approach and kill them all.\u201d Ms. Coulter did much to show the audience her stance on liberalism, and has dedicated several of her works including Demonic: How the Liberal Mob is Changing America and her newest book, Never Trust a Liberal Over Three\u2014Especially a Republican.\n\nAfter the Q&A session ended, Ms. Coulter thanked the audience and ended her time at Stevens with a book signing. Several students lingered in Bissinger, either to discuss Ms. Coulter\u2019s opinions or to debate amongst themselves. TJ Walters, a Stevens undergraduate student, disagreed with much of what Ms. Coulter stands for: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with how she doesn\u2019t view people as equals. Why shouldn\u2019t you be allowed to vote if you have liberal ideals?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca51c\"", "article_summary": "I agree with Ms. Coulter with respect to the healthcare system and how it is not benefiting anyone.\u201dHer solution?\nAfter the Q&A session ended, Ms. Coulter thanked the audience and ended her time at Stevens with a book signing.\nTJ Walters, a Stevens undergraduate student, disagreed with much of what Ms. Coulter stands for: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with how she doesn\u2019t view people as equals.\nHowever, the Stevens Institute of Technology College Republicans chapter hosted American conservative social Ann Coulter yesterday evening to jump-start conversation regarding politics.\nMs. Coulter paused and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think my opinions are controversial."}
