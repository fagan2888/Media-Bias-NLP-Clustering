(Photo: Francesca Cocchi/Staff Photo )Buy Photo\n\nWhen the high schoolers in Chris Aviles\u2019 sophomore English class weren\u2019t studying American literature, they might have been creating graffiti art or launching flames in the air.\n\nAubrey Bowie, 16, taught herself to tattoo on synthetic skin with tools she purchased from Amazon; Reese Hardy, 16, worked with a cobbler in Manahawkin to customize his Nike soccer cleats; Brenna Lutz, 16, fed sea turtles at the Wetland Institute in Stone Harbor.\n\nMegan Jelinski, Sarah Thompson and Taylor Marcotte, all 16, volunteered for 10 days in Costa Rica over the winter break. Brienna Cooney and Erika Brechka, both 15, designed and hand-stitched a pink-and-black jazz dance costume without prior sewing experience.\n\nAviles, 30, told his 72 students in October to explore a free-choice project, requiring only that they share their experiences with the class in an online journal and discuss what they learned at the end of the year.\n\nAviles repeated the words \u201cautonomy, mastery and purpose\u201d for seventh months, encouraging students to set high goals and make their \u201cBe About It\u201d projects memorable.\n\n\u201cThey all struggled at some point,\u201d Aviles said. \u201cThat was part of the process; I just tell them to figure it out.\u201d\n\nBryanna Mesimer, 15, did just that by launching her own floral arrangement business and making a profit. Mesimer uses a website she created as well as Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter and Etsy to promote Jolie Fleur Amour.\n\nThe exercise\u2019s name comes from a saying Aviles used between friends: \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it, be about it.\u201d\n\nThe students showcased a total of 58 projects on stage in the auditorium June 3 in front of about 250 guests from the school and community. On Twitter, #BeAboutIt trended during the day of demonstrations and presentations, which the students modeled after Ted Talks, according to Aviles.\n\nJohn Michael Purdon, 16, demonstrated his homemade flame thrower for students outside the building on June 5. The gadget, which has a 330-volt capacitor, insulated wires, lighter fluid and a disposable camera\u2019s circuit board attached to a glove, launches flames vertically when Purdon inserts the battery.\n\n\u201cEvery little kid wants to be a superhero, so why not take that a little further,\u201d said Purdon, who spent months modifying his design to make it work safely.\n\nAlyx Wianecki, 16, sent 28 boxes of shampoo, conditioner, snacks and games to troops in Afghanistan, where her dad was based with the Department of Defense.\n\nDave Wianecki, who currently is on leave and joined his daughter on stage during her presentation, said he saw the people who received the packages \u2014 some who didn\u2019t usually receive any from family of their own.\n\nThe combination of Aviles\u2019 creativity and Principal Steve Nichol\u2019s support was key to the project\u2019s success the last two years, according to Superintendent Karen Wood.\n\nAviles, Nichol and Wood discussed expanding the project in the future. It places students in the community, fosters engagement and treats them like young adults, Wood said.\n\nAlyssa Lagstrom, 16, \u201cBe About It\u201d was a project in which she said she could take pride. After creating original patterns and designs, Lagstrom hand-stitched stuffed animals and gave them to friends.\n\n\u201cI got what I wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cThey all smiled.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1qaPfr0", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Chris Aviles repeated the words \u201cautonomy, mastery and purpose\u201d for seventh months.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Chris Aviles repeated the words \u201cautonomy, mastery and purpose\u201d for seventh months.", "title": "Barnegat teacher: \u201cBe about it.\u201d", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/education/2014/06/17/barnegat-teacher/10717799/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chris Aviles repeated the words \u201cautonomy, mastery and purpose\u201d for seventh months.", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a0ed4ada9ae3f00c5559e217887c49740bab914/c=608-0-3040-2432&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/06/17/dsc07962.jpg", "title": "Barnegat teacher: \u201cBe about it.\u201d", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ae1\"", "article_summary": "Buy Photo Bryanna Mesimer, 15, places a flower in classmate Aubrey Bowie\u2019s hair.\nAlyx Wianecki, 16, sent 28 boxes of shampoo, conditioner, snacks and games to troops in Afghanistan, where her dad was based with the Department of Defense.\nJohn Michael Purdon, 16, demonstrated his homemade flame thrower for students outside the building on June 5.\n\u201cThat was part of the process; I just tell them to figure it out.\u201dBryanna Mesimer, 15, did just that by launching her own floral arrangement business and making a profit.\nMegan Jelinski, Sarah Thompson and Taylor Marcotte, all 16, volunteered for 10 days in Costa Rica over the winter break."}
