During the interview, Steyn did not hold back and berated newspapers around the world for censoring Mohammed cartoons produced and published by Charlie Hebdo, the magazine where Islamists killed 12 people yesterday. He also slammed Secretary of State John Kerry for failing to recognize radical Islam as the motivation for the attacks.\n\n\"I see these candlelight vigils and everyone claiming suddenly to be for freedom of speech. I think one consequence of this is that a lot of people will retreat even further into self-censorship. The New York Daily News won\u2019t even show [the cartoons], dishonors the dead in Paris by not even showing properly the cartoons,\" Steyn said. \"They pixelated Mohammed out of it so it looks like Mohammed has entered the witness protection program but they left the hooked-nose Jew in and that exactly gets to the double standard here. You can say anything you like about Christianity, you can say anything you like Judaism. But these guys, everyone understands the message that if you say anything about Islam, these guys will kill you. We will be retreating into a lot more self-censorship if the pansified Western media doesn\u2019t man up and decide to disperse the risk so they can\u2019t kill one small, little French satirical magazine. They\u2019ve gotta kill all of us.\"\n\n\n\n\"The fact they [media outlets] didn\u2019t even have the courage to show these cartoons after they became a news story is why these brave men like Charlie Hebdo had to bear the burden almost single-handed,\" he continued.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Courage. .05/27/2016 4:33:59AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Courage.", "title": "- Mark Steyn: Newspapers Dishonor The Dead By Censoring Charlie Hebdo Mohammed Cartoons", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/01/08/watch-mark-steyn-call-on-media-to-man-up-n1940423", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/1/8/30.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Courage.", "title": "- Mark Steyn: Newspapers Dishonor The Dead By Censoring Charlie Hebdo Mohammed Cartoons", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/01/08/watch-mark-steyn-call-on-media-to-man-up-n1940423", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/1/8/30.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Mark Steyn: Newspapers Dishonor The Dead By Censoring Charlie Hebdo Mohammed Cartoons , Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The New York Daily News won\u2019t even show [the cartoons], dishonors the dead in Paris by not even showing properly the cartoons,\" Steyn said.\nDuring the interview, Steyn did not hold back and berated newspapers around the world for censoring Mohammed cartoons produced and published by Charlie Hebdo, the magazine where Islamists killed 12 people yesterday.\nLast night author and conservative analyst Mark Steyn made an appearance on The Kelly File to talk about the horrific Islamic terror attacks in Paris yesterday.\nHe also slammed Secretary of State John Kerry for failing to recognize radical Islam as the motivation for the attacks.\nBut these guys, everyone understands the message that if you say anything about Islam, these guys will kill you."}
