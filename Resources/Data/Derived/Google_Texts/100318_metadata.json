That\u2019s not to say cancer, diabetes, and heart disease aren\u2019t as bad, but that they can be treated and sometimes cured, at least. There is no cure for Alzheimer\u2019s and it\u2019s still not entirely clear how it develops. According to a new study, it\u2019s for these reasons, as well as others, that many doctors aren\u2019t telling their patients when they\u2019ve been diagnosed with the disease.\n\nAccounting for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases, the National Institutes of Health estimates that as many as five million Americans over 65 years old have the Alzheimer\u2019s . It\u2019s is a progressive, deadly disease that worsens at a faster pace than typical dementia. This pace is quickened because of the development of proteinous plaques and tangles, which hinder neuronal connections and kill them. It\u2019s still unknown how these develop, and current treatments only improve symptoms \u2014 either way, the patient will eventually die from the disease, with the average lifespan after symptoms become apparent being eight years.\n\nThe study, from the non-profit Alzheimer\u2019s Association, found that 45 percent of patients reported not being told they had Alzheimer\u2019s. Oftentimes, doctors and health care providers neglect to inform patients because they see their diagnosis as a death sentence.\n\n\u201cI think part of it has to do with, back in the day, if someone was given the diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it was the social kiss of death, because the impression was there was nothing to do,\u201d Pierre Tariot, a geriatric psychologist and director of the Banner Alzheimer\u2019s Institute, told The Washington Post. \u201cAnd people are terribly afraid of a disease that robs you of your identity. They tend to look away.\u201d\n\nAnother reason doctors find it hard to tell patients they had Alzheimer\u2019s is because it\u2019s often difficult to determine whether a person is experiencing early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s or simply age-related memory loss. The two are profoundly different. Whereas age-related memory loss may include forgetting simple things like where the keys are or someone\u2019s name, Alzheimer\u2019s causes a person to forget how to conduct tasks they\u2019ve been doing for decades, such as forgetting common words and taking longer to complete familiar tasks. It turns out the study also found people were more likely to be told they had Alzheimer\u2019s if they were in later stages.\n\nResearchers from the Alzheimer\u2019s Association conducted the study by looking at Medicare records and surveys from Medicare recipients. They also surveyed family members and caregivers to ensure the patients\u2019 Alzheimer\u2019s wasn\u2019t confusing them about the truth. Only 53 percent of these people said doctors told them about the patient\u2019s diagnosis.\n\nSpeaking to NPR, Tariot said that despite the difficulty of telling patients, it should be done. While it uncomfortable at first, he said he\u2019s learned to anticipate the questions patients will ask, such as, \u201cAm I going to get worse\u201d and, \u201cWhen am I going to die.\u201d He said patients are appreciative of his honesty. \u201cPeople are relieved, not distressed,\u201d he told NPR. \u201cThey\u2019re relieved to have somebody who knows what\u2019s going on and gives a message of at least some hope\u2026 a message that \u2018We will stand by and navigate this process with you.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "many, doctors, are, scared, diagnose, alzheimers, and, fail, disclose, condition, patients", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Because Alzheimer's disease is often seen as a death sentence, many doctors would rather not disclose their patients' diagnoses.", "title": "Many Doctors Find It Hard To Diagnose Patients' Alzheimer's, So They Don't", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/many-doctors-are-scared-diagnose-alzheimers-and-fail-disclose-condition-patients-327432", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/29/alzheimers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Because Alzheimer's disease is often seen as a death sentence, many doctors would rather not disclose their patients' diagnoses.", "title": "Many Doctors Find It Hard To Diagnose Patients' Alzheimer's, So They Don't", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/many-doctors-are-scared-diagnose-alzheimers-and-fail-disclose-condition-patients-327432", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/29/alzheimers.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/29/alzheimers.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-29T11:42:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-29T11:42:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Because Alzheimer's disease is often seen as a death sentence, many doctors would rather not disclose their patients' diagnoses."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1750\"", "article_summary": "They also surveyed family members and caregivers to ensure the patients\u2019 Alzheimer\u2019s wasn\u2019t confusing them about the truth.\nSpeaking to NPR, Tariot said that despite the difficulty of telling patients, it should be done.\nThe study, from the non-profit Alzheimer\u2019s Association, found that 45 percent of patients reported not being told they had Alzheimer\u2019s.\nOnly 53 percent of these people said doctors told them about the patient\u2019s diagnosis.\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, but it\u2019s probably the only one with such a grim outlook."}
