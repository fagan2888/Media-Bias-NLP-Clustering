While some argue that such rules are necessary in light of the childhood obesity epidemic, others lament that the regulations are too restrictive. If the Republican bill passes, however, schools would have the ability to waive the standards if they have a net loss on school food programs for six months. The writer of the bill, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.) said that he had been responding to letters from school food directors, who argue that the regulations are too expensive and limiting.\n\nAccording to the director of Obama's \"Let\u2019s Move!\" campaign, Sam Kass, the Republican bill that would let schools dip out of the health standards would be a \u201creal assault\u201d on the government\u2019s attempt to make school lunches healthier. \u201cShe wants to have a conversation about what is really happening out in the country,\u201d Kass said. \u201cThese standards are working.\u201d The event is meant to highlight the successes of schools who have implemented these health standards, and will involve school nutrition officials speaking about their positive impact. The White House's schedule states that Obama \u201cwill stress the importance of students, parents, school officials, community leaders, and health advocates coming together to protect and advance the tremendous progress that has been made in schools across our country.\u201d\n\nThe standards ensure that school lunches provide kids with more whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy products. They also aim to reduce the amount of fat, sodium, and sugar present in school lunches and monitor portion sizes. Earlier this month, the Agriculture Department (USDA) said it would allow some schools to delay the whole grains requirement, seeing as several critical school nutrition officials noted they were too difficult to implement.\n\nThe GOP spending bill was released on Monday, and a House Appropriations subcommittee approved it on Tuesday. According to Aderholt, who is also chairman of the agriculture appropriations panel, the lunch standards have \u201cupset the economics of the school meals program by driving the cost of the plate up while pushing participation down.\u201d However, supporters of Michelle Obama\u2019s initiative say that the government and schools are responsible to help instill healthier eating habits among America\u2019s students. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, obesity among children in America has more than doubled over the past 30 years.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "michelle obama, let's move!, school lunch standards", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "First lady Michelle Obama will be hosting an event to highlight the successes of her healthy standards program, which provides rules for schools to implement better eating habits.", "title": "Michelle Obama Fights Republican Critics Of Healthy School Lunches", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/healthy-lunches-optional-schools-following-republican-spending-bill-michelle-obama-fights-back", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/school-lunch.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "First lady Michelle Obama will be hosting an event to highlight the successes of her healthy standards program, which provides rules for schools to implement better eating habits.", "title": "Michelle Obama Fights Republican Critics Of Healthy School Lunches", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/healthy-lunches-optional-schools-following-republican-spending-bill-michelle-obama-fights-back", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/school-lunch.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/school-lunch.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-05-27T17:28:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T17:28:34-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "First lady Michelle Obama will be hosting an event to highlight the successes of her healthy standards program, which provides rules for schools to implement better eating habits."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfad1\"", "article_summary": "They also aim to reduce the amount of fat, sodium, and sugar present in school lunches and monitor portion sizes.\ncampaign, Sam Kass, the Republican bill that would let schools dip out of the health standards would be a \u201creal assault\u201d on the government\u2019s attempt to make school lunches healthier.\nOver the past two years, the health standards out of Obama\u2019s \"Let\u2019s Move!\"\nIf the Republican bill passes, however, schools would have the ability to waive the standards if they have a net loss on school food programs for six months.\ncampaign have been rolled out in schools across the nation, forcing cafeterias to provide students with healthier options."}
