More importantly they talked with Hoosiers who have benefitted from the Affordable Care Act.According to Burwell, hearing the personal stories from people about the ACA helps her office improve the program as well as encourage others to sign up for coverage.\u201cAs a follow up to the State of the Union, one of the things the president\u2019s cabinet is doing is going all over the country to have real conversations with real people about the issues that our departments have worked on,\u201d said Burwell. \u201cAs a law it was about three fundamental things \u2014 access, affordability and quality \u2014 and changing that dynamic for everyone in the country.\u201dEach story painted a different picture of need and access, but the underlying theme was the same \u2014 the Affordable Care Act offers financial and health security to people in need of medical care. One consumer described a situation that included a loss of employment coupled with a pre-existing condition that made acquiring affordable health insurance nearly impossible. Another self-employed woman described an $800 savings in monthly premiums for her family of three. A minister discussed how having options in the marketplace helped him and his congregation save thousands on his annual health insurance premiums. And one college student working on her undergraduate degree stated it was nice to know she was still covered under her parents\u2019 insurance until she turns 26. She added that she really didn\u2019t fully understand how important health insurance was or the benefits of being covered under her parents\u2019 policies until she became a navigator helping others learn and understand their options in the marketplace.It may have been a coincidence that all of the people discussing their personal stories were Caucasian and that eight of the nine participants were female. But the observation did make Carson\u2019s question about how to encourage more people to take advantage of the opportunity even more poignant.The conversation supported the idea that the terminology and overall issue of health insurance is intimidating, especially for someone who has never had it before. But the group also agreed that the assistance provided by the navigators is more than enough to overcome most obstacles. Ultimately they determine it comes down to awareness \u2014 something the United Way of Central Indiana also works to overcome.Part of Carson and Burwell\u2019s visit included a little time spent in the 2-1-1 \u201cconnect-2-help\u201d call center hub. The 2-1-1 system is an information call center that Hoosiers can reach out for any type of assistance. The information and referral hotline maintains a centralized database of over 20,000 programs and services. And while a caller may inquire about rent assistance, veterans\u2019 benefits or legal assistance, call center specialists are also trained to ask callers if they have health insurance. If the answer is no, the offer is made for them to walk through a simple pre-screening to determine if they might be eligible for HIP 2.0 \u2014 Indiana\u2019s alternative to Medicare \u2014 or if options are available for them in the healthcare marketplace.\u201cI\u2019m proud of my vote,\u201d says Carson about his support of the ACA. \u201cAnd I want to encourage Hoosiers who haven\u2019t done so to get enrolled.\u201dThe deadline for enrollment is January 31.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Content Default", "description": "\u201cAs a law it was about three fundamental things \u2014 access, affordability and quality \u2014 and changing that dynamic for everyone in the country.\u201d", "title": "The benefits of affordable healthcare | News | NUVO News | Indianapolis, IN", "og": {"site_name": "NUVO", "description": "\u201cAs a law it was about three fundamental things \u2014 access, affordability and quality \u2014 and changing that dynamic for everyone in the country.\u201d", "title": "The benefits of affordable healthcare", "url": "http://www.nuvo.net/indianapolis/the-benefits-of-affordable-healthcare/Content?oid=3736909", "image": {"width": 590, "identifier": "http://media1.fdncms.com/nuvo/imager/u/slideshow/3736911/fullsizerender_3.jpg", "height": 343}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media1.fdncms.com/nuvo/imager/u/slideshow/3736911/fullsizerender_3.jpg"}, "title": "The benefits of affordable healthcare", "description": "\u201cAs a law it was about three fundamental things \u2014 access, affordability and quality \u2014 and changing that dynamic for everyone in the country.\u201d", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@AmberLStearns"}, "oid": 3736909, "fb": {"app_id": 207070172674679}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Andre Carson, healthcare, News, Indianapolis, Indiana, Indy, independent, updates, events, news, Indianapolis, Indy, current events, social justice, environment, politics, local, business, NUVO, news, Indianapolis, Indiana. newsweekly, alt-weekly, altweekly, Hoosier, music, sports, arts, entertainment, local food", "thumbnail": "http://media1.fdncms.com/nuvo/imager/u/slideshow/3736911/fullsizerender_3.jpg", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, andre carson, healthcare, news, indianapolis, indiana, indy, independent, updates"}, "article_summary": "One consumer described a situation that included a loss of employment coupled with a pre-existing condition that made acquiring affordable health insurance nearly impossible.\n\u201cAnd I want to encourage Hoosiers who haven\u2019t done so to get enrolled.\u201dThe deadline for enrollment is January 31.\nA minister discussed how having options in the marketplace helped him and his congregation save thousands on his annual health insurance premiums.\nAnd while a caller may inquire about rent assistance, veterans\u2019 benefits or legal assistance, call center specialists are also trained to ask callers if they have health insurance.\nThe 2-1-1 system is an information call center that Hoosiers can reach out for any type of assistance."}
