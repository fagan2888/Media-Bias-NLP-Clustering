It is not always easy to aggregate data between hospitals and physicians to truly create actionable and meaningful analytics.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t manage and be efficient if we don\u2019t have the data to allow us to direct our efforts and be able to work efficiently and as streamlined as possible,\u201d Jose Rivera, CMPE, Orlando Health\u2019s Corporate Director of Physician and Professional Services, explained.\n\nLooking at population health needs in terms of evolving quality and outcome improvements is imperative as both reimbursements and care delivery models continue to evolve away from fee-for-service payment.\n\n\u201cWhat providers absolutely must have are really powerful analytics that are able to take clinical and outcomes data, a lot of which resides in clinical systems, and combine it with financial data to accurately measure where we improve quality based on outcomes results,\u201d asserted Deanne Kasim, Research Director of Payer Health IT at IDC Health Insights.\n\nPhysician practices in particular are reportedly struggling to adapt to a new payment model environment and manage data as it comes their way.\n\nAccording to research from the RAND Corporation and the American Medical Association (AMA), performance measures tied to various alternative payment models \u2013 including ACOs, bundled payments, shared savings, pay-for-performance, capitation models, and retainer-based practices \u2013 are too varied to be effective.\n\n\u201cFor alternative payment methods to work best, medical practices also need support and guidance. It\u2019s the support that accompanies a new payment model, plus how well the model aligns with all of a practice\u2019s other incentives, that could determine whether it succeeds,\u201d stated the study\u2019s lead author, Mark Friedberg, MD, Senior Natural Scientist.\n\nParallel findings from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform (CHQPR) asserted that physicians find it difficult to deliver cost-effective, high quality care.\n\n\"Many of the alternative payment models currently being implemented in Medicare not only fail to solve the problems in the current payment system, they can actually make things worse for physicians who want to improve care and reduce spending,\u201d stated Harold D. Miller, CHQPR\u2019s President and CEO.\n\n\u201cProperly designed APMs can give physicians the ability to achieve far greater improvements in the quality and affordability of care for their patients than MIPS, because APMs can overcome the barriers to better care that exist in the current payment system in ways that MIPS cannot,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe future success of payment models is yet to be determined, he said. What happens next is dependent on what types of law provision implementations unfold.\n\nMiller looks to Congress, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a gauge to predict next steps.\n\n\u201cThe decisions [CMS/HHS] make and the processes they establish could either encourage rapid development and implementation of innovative and successful payment models, or deter innovation and impede the progress in payment reform that Congress wanted to support,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this month, CMS confirmed that alternative payment models still have room for\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d said Patrick Conway, MD, MSc, CMS Chief Medical Officer.\n\nCommunication issues need to be addressed, he said. The average healthcare consumer does not quite understand what true system reform is about.\n\n\u201cThe last five years have seen the most positive delivery system improvements in our nation\u2019s history, and we are committed to accelerating that progress,\u201d Conway wrote on CMS\u2019s blog last November.\n\nThere has reportedly been a notable surge in alternative payment model interest within recent years. This interest will likely only grow in time.\n\nAs the healthcare payment system realigns itself, providers will continue to learn more about what types of alternative payment models best suit their general risk needs, especially as new Medicare initiatives fall into place.\n\nImage Credit: [AMA / CHQPR] (Image 1)\n\nImage Credit: [AMA / CHQPR] (Image 2)", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the healthcare payment system realigns itself, providers will continue to learn more about what types of alternative payment models best suit their goals.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/examining-the-value-based-alternative-payment-model-basics", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2015-08-12-bar-graphs.png", "type": "article", "title": "Examining the Value-Based Alternative Payment Model Basics"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the healthcare payment system realigns itself, providers will continue to learn more about what types of alternative payment models best suit their goals.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2015-08-12-bar-graphs.png"}, "title": "Examining the Value-Based Alternative Payment Model Basics", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Figuring out how alternative payment models will evolve under a waning fee-for-service payment system is not easy.\nAlternative payment models like the accountable care organization (ACO) and the bundled payment model have been gaining popularity under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA) mandates.\nThere has reportedly been a notable surge in alternative payment model interest within recent years.\nThe transition away from traditional fee-for-service payment models towards value-based reimbursement continues; the clock is ticking.\nEarlier this month, CMS confirmed that alternative payment models still have room for\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d said Patrick Conway, MD, MSc, CMS Chief Medical Officer."}
