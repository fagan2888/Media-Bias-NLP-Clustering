Worse, they were one of his most reliable voting blocs. Yet Hillary Clinton, the Democrats\u2019 likely 2016 presidential candidate, says, \u201cI don\u2019t think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for digging us out of the ditch Republicans put us in\u201d? Obama, when asked to name the accomplishment for which he is most proud, brags, \u201cI\u2019m proud of saving the American economy.\u201d\n\nThe numbers are stark.\n\nThe Obama recovery, which began after the recession ended in June 2009, has averaged 2.2 percent inflation-adjusted annual GDP growth over the next 25 quarters, as opposed to the average recovery\u2019s 3.9 percent GDP growth for the last eight recessions dating back to 1960.\n\nPresident Obama, to date, is the first modern president to reign over a recovery in which not a single year\u2019s economy grew at least 3 percent. Since 1 percent of annual growth roughly translates to one million jobs per year of recovery, this means Obama\u2019s subpar recovery has produced some seven million fewer jobs than he would have had he simply skipped work and played golf the last seven years. By contrast, the Ronald Reagan recovery averaged 4.8 percent GDP growth, which translates, according to Heritage Foundation economist Stephen Moore, into a per-family average of $20,000 more in income.\n\nEnter a 74-year-old Vermont socialist.\n\nWhile careful not to explicitly criticize Obama, Bernie Sanders denounces the \u201crigged\u201d economic system that enriches \u201cmillionaires and billionaires.\u201d He promises to further tax \u201cthe rich,\u201d who do not \u201cpay their fair share,\u201d and evil corporations that pay no taxes because they \u201care stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens.\u201d He rails against \u201cWall Street speculation\u201d and their \u201cgreed and corruption\u201d that \u201ccrashed the economy.\u201d Through their political donations, Sanders explains, Wall Streeters \u201ccontrol the politicians,\u201d thus ensuring that \u201cthe rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\u201d\n\nIf you are a left-wing millennial voter, defined as one aged 18 to 35, this kind of scapegoating rings true.\n\nSanders offers \u201cfree\u201d tuition, paid for with a \u201ctax on Wall Street speculation,\u201d a better sounding deal than Clinton\u2019s proposal for \u201cdebt-free\u201d tuition.\n\nOn health care, Clinton wants to \u201cbuild on\u201d Obamacare. During one debate Clinton even confirmed her position that Obamacare\u2019s higher premiums and higher copays are just \u201cglitches.\u201d Sanders offers \u201cfree health care\u201d through \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d financed, of course, by taxing \u201cthe rich.\u201d\n\nNot to be out race-carded, Sanders promises to \u201cend institutional racism\u201d when he becomes president. He rejects writing a check for slavery reparations, but says: \u201cWhat we should be talking about is making massive investments in rebuilding our cities, in creating millions of decent paying jobs \u2026 basically targeting our federal resources to the areas where it is needed the most and where it is needed the most is in impoverished communities, often African-American.\u201d\n\nClinton, by contrast, looks positively reactionary. After all, President Bill Clinton got rid of Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era regulation that prevented commercial banks from engaging in investment banking. Sanders says: \u201cI was proud to lead the fight in the House against repealing the Glass-Steagall Act. I predicted then that such a massive deregulation of the financial services industry would seriously harm the economy.\u201d\n\nThe Bernie \u201cfeel the Bern\u201d Sanders phenomenon is simply the logical extension of decades of left-wing indoctrination against \u201cthe rich\u201d who supposedly \u201crip off\u201d everybody else. He is an \u201cauthentic\u201d class warrior who believes capitalism is a racist, exploitative system that benefits corporate America, unfairly creating winner and losers \u2014 and if you are the latter it\u2019s because capitalism is \u201crigged.\u201d He\u2019s un-rich (by Washington standards), unkempt and unwedded to the standard wealthy Democratic mega-donor class. He is out-raising Hillary, his money primarily coming from people donating $200 or less. He\u2019s Fidel Castro without the guns and battle fatigues.\n\nThe irony, of course, is that Hillary Clinton and her party have longed used the same rhetoric employed by Sanders. For example, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz says Republicans want to \u201cliterally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws.\u201d Similarly, when wealthy former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cynically derides \u201cbig oil,\u201d it\u2019s anti-Republican Politics 101.\n\nBernie Sanders seems to truly believe this us-versus-them, zero-sum stuff.\n\nNever mind that his policies would continue the same subpar job and GDP numbers we\u2019ve seen under Obama, putting us on a course for the kind of sclerotic job and GDP growth typical of Western European democracies. Sanders offers Obamanomics \u2014 on steroids. And don\u2019t get him started on \u201cclimate change\u201d and the supposed moral imperative to end our planet-destroying reliance of fossil fuels.\n\nTo the left-wing jobless, angry and young, Bernie Sanders is far beyond simple \u201chope and change.\u201d He\u2019s hope and nirvana \u2014 on someone else\u2019s dime.
