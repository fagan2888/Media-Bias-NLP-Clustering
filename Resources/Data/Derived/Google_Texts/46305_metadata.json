He was 61.\n\nThe cause was hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, said his sister, Valerie Campbell Morris, his only immediate survivor.\n\nMr. Campbell was a proud heir to the legacy of 1960s free jazz as established by trailblazers like the saxophonist Albert Ayler, the pianist Cecil Taylor and the trumpeter Don Cherry, one of Mr. Campbell\u2019s idols. Combining a pugnacious sound with an open-minded approach, Mr. Campbell worked with an array of colleagues in that lineage. He was a fixture at the Vision Festival in New York, an annual celebration of avant-gardism, and recorded his most recent album, \u201cAkhenaten Suite\u201d (Aum Fidelity), in concert there in 2007.\n\nAs a composer and bandleader he favored strong rhythm and folkloric texture, putting those elements together in Tazz, an energetic quartet featuring piano, bass and drums, and Pyramid Trio, with the bassist William Parker and a succession of drummers. \u201cEthnic Stew and Brew,\u201d a Pyramid Trio album released on Delmark in 2001, was one of Mr. Campbell\u2019s most critically acclaimed.\n\nFor more than 20 years, off and on, he also stood front and center in Other Dimensions in Music, a ruggedly spontaneous band with Daniel Carter on reeds and flute (and sometimes trumpet), Mr. Parker on bass and Rashid Bakr on drums. He held a similar role as a member of the Nu Band, and in ensembles led by Mr. Parker, the pianist Matthew Shipp and the guitarist Marc Ribot.\n\nRoy Sinclair Campbell Jr. was born in Los Angeles on Sept. 29, 1952, and raised from the age of 2 in the Bronx. His mother, Erna Arene Forte Campbell, worked at P.S. 21 in the Bronx; his father was a Wall Street communications specialist and a trumpeter himself. Roy Jr. began his musical training on piano and also learned flute and violin.\n\nThe trumpet became his focus during his senior year in high school, and from then on he moved quickly. Through the nonprofit music-outreach organization Jazzmobile, he studied with Lee Morgan, Kenny Dorham and Howard McGhee, assertive trumpeters from different points on the bebop spectrum. He majored in trumpet at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, where he also studied theory and composition with the esteemed multi-reedist Yusef Lateef, who died last month at 93.\n\nMr. Campbell formed his first band, Spectrum, at 20, and began playing widely as a sideman, notably with Ensemble Muntu, a fixture on New York\u2019s 1970s loft-jazz scene. He released his debut album, \u201cNew Kingdom\u201d (Delmark), in 1992, around the time he ended a two-year stint in the Netherlands; its opening track was \u201cI Remember Lee,\u201d a pledge of allegiance to Morgan. (On his following album, Mr. Campbell would include a waltz titled \u201cBooker\u2019s Lament,\u201d after another influence, the trumpeter Booker Little.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBeyond his affinities with hard bop and free jazz, Mr. Campbell worked in a range of styles including funk, hip-hop and reggae. And he was an encouraging mentor to younger trumpeters, both informally and in his capacity as a founder of the stylistically broad Festival of New Trumpet Music, which he established with Dave Douglas in 2003.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140118231427, "twitter": {"description": "Mr. Campbell combined a pugnacious, hard-bop sound with an open-minded approach, working
