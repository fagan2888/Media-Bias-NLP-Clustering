Barbourville ARH will soon begin a community needs assessment. Because of the Affordable Care Act, all non-profit hospitals must complete a hospital-specific survey to be provided to the IRS.

“We look at it as an opportunity,” said Maria Aull, Extension Specialist with Community and Economic Development Initiative of Kentucky. “This is free information that the hospital can use to see where they need to spend their money.

Aull asked the Knox County Health Coalition to brainstorm at their February meeting. She asked the coalition what their vision was for a healthy Knox County.
