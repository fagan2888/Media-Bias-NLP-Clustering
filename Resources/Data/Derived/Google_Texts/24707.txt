Trinity Health is set to expand its risk-based care operations, announcing last week that it will partner with Heritage Provider Network to form accountable care networks linking Trinity’s 86 hospitals with the 37,000 physicians in league with Heritage.

Livonia, Michigan-based Trinity said the new venture, Trinity Health Partners, will operate in several markets across the United States.

"This joint venture allows us to rapidly expand our capabilities to contract with payer-partners for full-risk, capitated arrangements that will result in better health, better care and lower costs in the communities we serve,” Trinity Chief Executive Richard J. Gilfillan, M.D., said in a statement. “This approach is a key part of our strategy to build a people-centered health system."

Population health isn’t new for either company. California-based HPN is already one of the largest accountable care organizations in the country, while Trininty, which operates in 21 states, runs dozens of ACOs itself. In fact, Trinity said it enrolled nine new ACOs in Medicare’s Shared Savings Program as of Jan. 1.

The new venture plans to set up new care models to coordinate primary care, care management, hospitalist services, post-acute care and high-risk clinics.

“Population health management requires collaboration, new ideas and continued commitment to quality and safety," Scott Nordlund, Trinity executive vice president for growth, strategy and innovation, said in a statement. "Partnerships with organizations like Heritage allow us to bring new ideas and capabilities to our ministries faster.”

Trinity, which pulls in close to $14 billion in revenue annually, recently purchased a three-hospital system in Connecticut.
