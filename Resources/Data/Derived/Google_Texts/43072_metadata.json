A similar change had already been made for the federal exchange used in most states, but now it applies to troubled state-based exchanges as well.\n\nThere's a catch: small businesses must sign up for coverage equivalent to policies that would be sold on the exchange, subject to Affordable Care Act requirements. Also, Oregon has to apply for permission.\n\nCover Oregon and U.S. Sens. Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden had been pushing for the change. Merkley on Friday released a statement, saying \"small businesses and their employees should not lose access to quality health insurance because of a broken website.\"\n\nQualifying Oregon small businesses will be able to qualify for tax credits covering half their costs for coverage under the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n--Nick Budnick", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "cover oregon, health exchange, health reform, health, living", "title": "Small businesses can bypass troubled Cover Oregon health insurance exchange to get tax credits, feds say", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Small businesses can bypass troubled Cover Oregon health insurance exchange to get tax credits, feds say\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/03/small_businesses_can_bypass_tr.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/13480326-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12433524\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-15T00:24:04Z\", \"author\": \"Nick Budnick | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"tags\": [\"@breaking-news\",\"@business\",\"@finance\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@politics\",\"cover oregon\",\"health exchange\",\"health reform\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/13480326-standard.jpg", "description": "Oregon small businesses can qualify for tax credits without using the troubled Cover Oregon health insurance exchange, under a federal rule change announced Friday.", "site": "@Oregonian", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Small businesses can bypass troubled Cover Oregon health insurance exchange to get tax credits, feds say"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, March 14, 2014,  5:24 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.oregonlive.com/health_impact/photo/jimhouserhealthexchange2013jpg-a5ca63f99029d336.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"nbudnick\", \"author_nickname\": \"Nick Budnick | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"author_id\": \"9643439\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Health & Fitness News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "Oregon small businesses can qualify for tax credits without using the troubled Cover Oregon health insurance exchange, under a federal rule change announced Friday.", "title": "Small businesses can bypass troubled Cover Oregon health insurance exchange to get tax credits, feds say", "url": "http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/03/small_businesses_can_bypass_tr.html", "image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/13480326-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "OregonLive.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, March 14, 2014,  5:20 PM", "article_author": "Nick Budnick | The Oregonian/OregonLive", "Description": "Oregon small businesses can qualify for tax credits without using the troubled Cover Oregon health insurance exchange, under a federal rule change announced Friday."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb409\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration announced Friday that small businesses can qualify for tax credits without going through the troubled Cover Oregon health insurance exchange.\nThe move is good news for small businesses in Oregon since the exchange's function for small businesses is on hold indefinitely.\nQualifying Oregon small businesses will be able to qualify for tax credits covering half their costs for coverage under the plan.\nThere's a catch: small businesses must sign up for coverage equivalent to policies that would be sold on the exchange, subject to Affordable Care Act requirements.\nMerkley on Friday released a statement, saying \"small businesses and their employees should not lose access to quality health insurance because of a broken website.\""}
