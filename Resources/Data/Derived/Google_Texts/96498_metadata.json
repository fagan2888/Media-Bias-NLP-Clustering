His press conference was over and Pierce wanted something to eat. He groaned when rising from his plastic chair. Plugging a burst pipe can be tiring work, especially when you are a double-teamed 37-year-old.\n\nPierce\u2019s buzzer-beating bank shot took Game 3 out of the scrap yard and turned it into a 103-101 win on Saturday night that gave the Washington Wizards a 2-1 series lead. The top-seeded Atlanta Hawks once led 2-0, and that was their last moment in front against the John Wall-less Wizards, who led by 21 points in the fourth quarter during a nightlong and collective we\u2019ll-show-you statement in the absence of the injured all-star.\n\nNene was forceful and accurate, scoring his first field goal of the series less than three minutes into the game. He finished with a 2015 postseason-high 17 points.\n\nOtto Porter is yet to legally switch his name to Playoff Otto, his new social media moniker, but that did not stop another potent night off the bench. Porter\u2019s Game 3 line of 17 points, nine rebounds and four assists has graduated to commonplace.\n\n\u201cI think he could have played better,\u201d Drew Gooden said. \u201cWhen you start having those types of games and guys think you can play better, you\u2019re on to something.\u201d\n\nWill Bynum made two free throws with 22.1 seconds to play to put the Wizards back up three points. Three months ago, Bynum was injured and playing in China. He was nonplussed by the perceived pressure of the moment, noting that being unemployed with kids is pressure. Those were just free throws.\n\nFive Wizards players scored in double figures, compiling the kind of distribution necessary to counter Wall\u2019s absence for the second consecutive game because of five fractures in his left wrist and hand. The Wizards did not update his status beyond his lack of participation in Game 3.\n\nAtlanta went \u201cradical,\u201d to steal Wizards coach Randy Wittman\u2019s term, when trying to stop its three-quarter-long paddling. Coach of the year Mike Budenholzer clamped his starters to the bench. Backup point guard Dennis Schroder ran things. Another backup point guard, Shelvin Mack, joined him. Mike Muscala was at center. Mike Scott was the power forward. Kyle Korver was the only recognizable face among Atlanta\u2019s closing group, though the dab of bleached hair on Schroder\u2019s head makes him memorable.\n\nA 21-point, fourth-quarter Washington lead went away against Atlanta\u2019s alternative lineup. It was dragged down to 13. Then eight. Five. Three. One. Misery was minutes away.\n\n\u201cStay composed, let\u2019s be solid,\u201d Pierce said he advised his teammates. \u201cThe Hawks did a good job. They took us out of a lot of our offense with their trapping, with their speed. We missed a lot of shots. They forced us to play until the shot clock wound down to where we got to throwing up late shots.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not us. We\u2019ve got to be able to execute for four quarter. \u2026 For it to end up like that, it\u2019s a little disappointing because we know we\u2019re better than that.\u201d\n\nUndone by their lack of pace and own odd fourth-quarter lineup \u2014 Washington started the quarter with Bynum, Garrett Temple, Porter, Gooden and Marcin Gortat \u2014 the Wizards dabbled with a staggering defeat.\n\nSchroder was a nightlong scourge off the dribble, providing Bynum and Sessions difficulty with keeping the youngster in front of them. Twice earlier in the game, Gortat fouled Schroder after he drove past his defender. When Schroder accelerated toward the basket on the Hawks\u2018 final possession, Gortat ran into the paint. Schroder slipped, fell on the floor and was without an option if, with a three-point lead, Gortat stayed on the perimeter with Muscala.\n\nInstead, Gortat was a heartbreak\u2019s distance away when the big man dropped a 3-pointer to tie the game. The lone fourth-quarter sighting of the Hawks\u2018 starters followed. They sprinted onto the floor to congratulate the unlikely backups in what has become a series wrapped in unlikely occurrences.\n\n\u201cYou do your teaching and all that afterward,\u201d Wittman said. \u201cUp three, you can\u2019t leave the three-point line to go run [and] try to block a layup.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards made a note of what the small, oddball Hawks lineup was doing to defend. They were switching often, a counter that began in Game 2. In Friday\u2019s practice, the Wizards put in a new play for Pierce that would get him the ball at the elbow \u2014 where he has scored so many times while dancing on the grave of the mid-range offensive game \u2014 against a smaller player. With nine seconds to play, Wittman yelled, \u201cGo!\u201d to Bynum, who left the elbow, popped his shoulder into Korver and cracked Pierce loose. Schroder, six inches shorter than Pierce, a factor amplified by Pierce\u2019s preference to step back and shoot, switched onto him.\n\nPierce stumbled to the floor just as the ball hit the backboard. He shot over Schroder and just beyond Kent Bazemore, who came running over only to swing and miss at Pierce\u2019s shot. By the time the ball banked through, Pierce was flat on his back with his arms outstretched in joy. His teammates were wise enough not to pile on top of a body that may soon need carbon dating to determine its origin.\n\nLuck is involved with a banked-in game-winner. Proverbs explain luck is also related to preparation. Waiting for practice to start at a downtown college gym in Toronto during round one, Pierce asked Gortat, \u201cHammer, you want to get some?\u201d The two play brief and occasional games of one-on-one, which typically do not go well for Gortat. During these, Pierce will shoot step-backs over the 6-foot-11 center. It\u2019s amusement that additionally allows Pierce to hone what is already sharp.\n\n\u201cThose types of shots go in due to hard work,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something I just pull out my back pocket. This is stuff I work on. I work on jabbing at the elbow. Step-back jumpers, shooting over the top. I mean, I\u2019ve done it for a long time. Just because I\u2019m in my 17th year, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going to continue to work.\n\n\u201cYou get put in those positions, which are rare, especially with me in this stage of my career with the young stars we have on this team. Usually, end of the game we would have put the ball in [Bradley] Beal\u2019s hands or Wall\u2019s hands, but it came to me today and I was ready.\u201d\n\nPierce is getting old, which he admits. So far, he\u2019s not too old for this. He\u2019s just tired and hungry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Wizards blew a 21-point, fourth-quarter lead.
