That's two blocks east of Grove.\n\nAccording to Wichita Police, a 40-year-old man walked into the store, which is owned by his 31-year-old ex-girlfriend. He was carrying a shotgun and asked everyone inside to leave, saying he was looking for two people.\n\nHis ex-girlfriend left the store through the backdoor at the same time her current 46-year-old boyfriend walked in.\n\nThe suspect confronted the other man, then shot him in the leg/groin area. The 46-year-old was able to get out of the store, then heard two more shots. He peeked in through a window and saw the suspect had shot himself in the head.\n\nPolice arrived, and both men were rushed to a local hospital.\n\nThe victim is now listed in good condition and is expected to be released on Saturday.\n\nThe suspect passed away at around 5 p.m. Friday, his sister said. She also said that despite police reports saying he was expected to recover, he had a slim chance of survival. No names were released.\n\nPolice believe the shooting was domestic-related. Officers say the suspect had sought out his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend.\n\nThe 46-year-old had earlier reported to police earlier this month that the suspect had threatened him over the phone.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The shooting happened Thursday afternoon inside a store near Douglas & Green.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"description": "The shooting happened Thursday afternoon inside a store near Douglas & Green.", "title": "UPDATE: Suspect in east Wichita shooting dies", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/BREAKING--Two-people-shot-in-east-Wichita-236608621.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/F9F/5F1/F9F5F103B3874F47BC7735192EB4BA9E", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/10E/00E/10E00E29DA7344C888C652B0CD97D403.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The shooting happened Thursday afternoon inside a store near Douglas & Green.", "title": "UPDATE: Suspect in east Wichita shooting dies", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/BREAKING--Two-people-shot-in-east-Wichita-236608621.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/douglas-shooting-1.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Suspect in east Wichita shooting dies", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Suspect in east Wichita"}, "article_summary": "More Video...
