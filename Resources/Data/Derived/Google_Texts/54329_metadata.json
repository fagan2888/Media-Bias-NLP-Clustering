The letter has since gone viral on the blogosphere.\n\nRecommended: How about this Canada quiz, eh?\n\nBrunt's message, essentially, was \"What is wrong with you people?\"\n\n\"Many of us Canadians are confused by the US midterm elections,\" he began, before running down a list of accomplishments he credited to the president, including falling unemployment, gas prices, and interest rates, along with a record high dollar, stock market, and corporate profits.\n\nHe lists similar triumphs on the foreign-policy front.\n\n\"America is leading the world once again and respected internationally \u2014 in sharp contrast to the Bush years. Obama brought soldiers home from Iraq and killed Osama bin Laden.\"\n\n\"So, Americans vote for the party that got you into the mess that Obama just dug you out of? This defies reason,\" Brunt writes. \"When you are done with Obama, could you send him our way?\"\n\nThe letter has brought some on the liberal left - many of whom have long been disillusioned with Obama, and many of whom seem to have disappeared during the midterm election and its aftermath - out of the woodwork.\n\n\"[H]e\u2019s right,\" wrote John Prager at Americans Against the Tea Party. \"Apathetic and delusional voters alike allowed Republicans like hog-castrating psychopath Joni Ernst to rise to a position of authority, Mitch McConnell to keep his job, and a majority that seems to believe the best and only solution to our nation\u2019s problems is to rid itself of the Affordable Care Act,\" he wrote. \"Unfortunately, the midterm elections will prove to be a hard lesson for voters: You get what you ask for, and sometimes you ask for total destruction.\"\n\nBut Brunt's letter also highlights a perennial trend among our hockey-loving, Mountie-policing, queen-honoring, polite northern neighbors: they love Barack Obama.\n\nThrough the \"hope and change\" highs and the 2014 midterm lows, Canadians have generally stuck by Obama - certainly more so than Americans, and even liberal Americans, it appears. When it comes to supporting the US President, Canadians, you might say, are a more loyal bunch than Americans.\n\nFor example, in the lead-up to the 2012 election between Obama and Republican Mitt Romney, polls showed Canadians overwhelmingly preferred Obama.\n\nIf they could, 65 percent of Canadian voters would have cast a ballot for Obama in 2012, reports Canada's Globe and Mail. Just 9 percent would have voted for Romney.\n\n\"We love him,\" writes Macleans in an article headed \"Canada's love affair with Barack Obama.\" \"The broad-band smile, the Lincolnesque bearing, the sense of the man as an avatar of multiculturalism\u2014it all makes Barack Obama the perfect US president in the eyes of Canadians.\"\n\nHeck, there's even a Facebook page for \"Canadians for Obama.\"\n\nWhy the Obama love up north?\n\nFor starters, Obama has generally enjoyed international support, though that has been slipping more recently.\n\nAnd when it comes to Canadians, at least, Obama had a relatively easy act to follow: Most Canadians hated George W. Bush as much as they love Obama.\n\nOf course, Canadians tend to skew more liberal than Americans, and Obama's policy objectives align more closely with the political predilections of many Canadians.\n\n\"[A]s we all know, even most conservative Canadians become liberal Democrats once they cross the border, because they support public health care, gun control, multiculturalism and minority rights,\" writes the Globe and Mail in a 2012 article. \"If Stephen Harper ran for political office in the United States on current Conservative policies, he\u2019d be so far to the American left his only hope for success might lie in Vermont.\"\n\nAnd then there's this: \"Beyond that, Mr. Obama is cool. He is the first president who can wear sunglasses without embarrassing himself. He can switch convincingly from professorial to colloquial. He has more charisma than any president since Jack Kennedy, and he\u2019s happily married to boot.\"\n\nVoting based on good hair, stature, and style? Turns out Americans aren't alone in that.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "2601889d3919e8acb4bc8b2b3e3c9369", "sailthru.author": "Husna Haq", "description": "Through the 'hope and change' highs and the 2014 midterm lows, Canadians have generally stuck by Obama - certainly more so than Americans.", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2014/11/1110-obama.png?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "Through the 'hope and change' highs and the 2014 midterm lows, Canadians have generally stuck by Obama - certainly more so than Americans.", "title": "After midterm sweep, Canadian asks: 'What were you thinking, America?'", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2014/1110/After-midterm-sweep-Canadian-asks-What-were-you-thinking-America", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2014/11/1110-obama.png?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2014/11/1110-obama.png?alias=standard_380x253", "description": "Through the 'hope and change' highs and the 2014 midterm lows, Canadians have generally stuck by Obama - certainly more so than Americans.", "site": "@csmonitor", "card": "summary", "title": "After midterm sweep, Canadian asks: 'What were you thinking, America?'"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-10", "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-10T15:33:50-05:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2014/1110/After-midterm-sweep-Canadian-asks-What-were-you-thinking-America", "sailthru.tags": "section-the-vote,section-politics,section-usa,class-blog-post,storysource-monitor", "article": {"section": "The Vote", "published_time": "2014-11-10T15:33-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "Charles Dharapak/AP"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc54a\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama is saluted by a Royal Canadian Mounted Police as he arrives in Ottawa, Canada, in 2009.\nBut Brunt's letter also highlights a perennial trend among our hockey-loving, Mountie-policing, queen-honoring, polite northern neighbors: they love Barack Obama.\nWhen it comes to supporting the US President, Canadians, you might say, are a more loyal bunch than Americans.\nAs Canada's National Post once put it, \"Barack Obama is Canada\u2019s American president.\"\n\"We love him,\" writes Macleans in an article headed \"Canada's love affair with Barack Obama.\""}
