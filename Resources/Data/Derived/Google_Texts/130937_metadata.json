For a detailed list, click here.\n\nThe lowest score came from Florida Healthcare Plus, which already is under state and federal suspension and is unable to enroll new members. All four plans offered by the Coral Gables company -- Sunrise, Sunny Days, Clear Skies and Day Break -- earned a below-average score.\n\nThe plans scored poorly in dozens of categories, like failure to properly manage chronic conditions, provide enough preventative health measures such as flu shots, or adequately handle member complaints. Medicare Advantage plans offering prescription drug coverage also are judged on criteria such as customer service, drug safety and accurate pricing.\n\nThree plans from UnitedHealthcare earned an average rating: AARP Medicare Complete, the AARP Medicare Complete Choice and the Dual Complete plan. The plans are offered in 15 Florida counties, mostly in the Tampa Bay region, Central Florida and the Treasure Coast.\n\nUnited HealthCare spokeswoman Jessica Pappas said the company offers a variety of plans, and tries to make improvements in its star ratings every year.\n\n\u201cUnitedHealthcare continues to strive to make year-over-year improvement in our quality performance and in the health care experience for millions of Medicare beneficiaries,\u201d she said in a written statement.\n\nCMS created the Star Rating system as a way to track plan quality, on a scale of one to five. This year, just 16 plans in the nation earned the prestigious five-star rating, including Humana\u2019s CarePlus Health Plans Inc. in Florida.\n\nAvalere\u2019s national analysis of the ratings noted that the number of Medicare beneficiaries who choose top-performing plans continues to increase, especially in the prescription-drug plans. In 2015, about 40 percent of the nation\u2019s Medicare Advantage plans that also offered drug coverage earned four stars or better. Those contracts cover approximately 60 percent of all plan enrollees, the analysis said.\n\nThe managed care plans are a popular option for many seniors looking to get the most coverage for their money. Florida\u2019s market is so competitive that a bevy of plans charge no monthly premium beyond the $104.90-a-month monthly premium for Medicare Part B, which is usually withheld from beneficiaries' Social Security checks. In Florida, some plans even pay part or all of the Part B premium.\n\nBut consumer demand isn\u2019t the only reason why plans are improving, according to Avalere. CMS offers financial bonuses to plans earning four or five stars, and those earning top scores can enroll members year-round. That\u2019s an enormous boost considering open enrollment runs just Oct. 15 to Dec. 7.\n\nThe incentives have a direct impact on the quality of Medicare plans, Avalere Chief Executive Dan Mendelson and his analysts wrote. The better performers tend to be older, more-established programs.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act put in place strong financial incentives to improve quality, and health plans are responding with improvements that are exceeding most expectations,\u201d Mendelson said.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
