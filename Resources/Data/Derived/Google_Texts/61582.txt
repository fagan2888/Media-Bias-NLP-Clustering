"I am so happy to be out of the house!" Letterman joked. "I retired and I had no regrets, none. I was happy. I was complacent. I was satisfied. I was content. And then a couple of days ago, Donald Trump said he was running for president. I have made the biggest mistake of my life, ladies and gentlemen."

Much to the audience's delight, Letterman then pulled out a Top 10 list of interesting facts about the controversial businessman.

"No. 10: That thing on his head was the gopher in Caddyshack," he teased. "No. 9: During Sex Donald Trump calls out his own name."

Then then poked some fun at himself, quipping, "No. 6: Trump walked away from a moderately successful television show for some delusional bulls--tâ€¦oh wait, that's me."
