Martin Dempsey said during a security conference.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore we are preparing a strategy that has a series of options to present to our elected leaders on how we can initially contain, eventually disrupt, and finally defeat ISIL over time,\u201d he said.\n\nISIL remains a dangerous group whose religion calls for setting up a caliphate. The group has gained credibility among other elements who view its recent successes in seizing major parts of Iraq as a key to its future.\n\n\u201cThis is a group that has aspirations and seeks a sense of religious legitimacy,\u201d he said, noting its claim to being the political heir to the Muslim caliphate.\n\nThe group\u2019s use of extraordinary brutality\u2014such as mass executions and public beheadings\u2014has allowed it to gain followers, even though its formal membership numbers around 7,000 fighters.\n\nISIL has used misinformation and information warfare to recruit fighters and achieve some objectives while exploiting youth and disenfranchised elements, he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very dangerous,\u201d Dempsey said, noting that the group is \u201cgoverning in northern and western Iraq.\u201d\n\nDempsey did not rule out the future use of close air support against ISIL if the group becomes a more direct U.S. threat.\n\nUltimately, the defeat ISIL will require \u201cpressure from multiple directions and with multiple partners,\u201d the four-star general said.\n\nDefeating the group also will require a reliable government in Baghdad and moderate Sunnis in the region to reject ISIL, including Turks and Kurds.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about us deciding that ISIL is the latest in a series of threats and taking it on unilaterally,\u201d he said.\n\nDempsey also rejected any suggestion that the United States should cooperate with Iran against ISIL, noting that Tehran is responsible for killing many Americans during the Iraq war.\n\nThe failure of the U.S.-trained Iraqi army during the recent ISIL incursion reflects a lack of unity among the Iraqi security forces, he said.\n\nMilitary leaders \u201cdid come to the conclusion that there was no reason to defend the Maliki government,\u201d he said, referring to the regime of Iraqi President Nouri al Maliki.\n\nOn Ukraine, Russian military annexation of Crimea fundamentally altered Moscow\u2019s relations with the United States and Europe.\n\nThe Obama administration is studying whether to supply weaponry and other military support to Kiev and is bolstering security among the NATO allies who are concerned with growing Russian aggression, Dempsey said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t define what that change means but there is a change in that relationship,\u201d he said.\n\nDempsey also expressed concerns about Russia\u2019s military buildup that has included both conventional and strategic forces modernization as well as an increasing military readiness.\n\n\u201cThey are clearly on a path to assert themselves differently not just in Europe but toward the United States,\u201d Dempsey said, noting increased strategic bomber flights by the Russian air force.\n\nDempsey said he fears that Russian aggression will set off a wave of pro-Russian nationalism in ethnic enclaves near Russia that could threaten the stability of the entire region.\n\n\u201cMy fear, if I have a fear about this, is that Putin may actually light a fire that he loses control of,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a rising tide of nationalism, and nationalism can be a very dangerous end state and impulse.\u201d\n\nInstead of lowering tensions, \u201cPutin has actually taken a decision to escalate,\u201d he said.\n\nDempsey dismissed suggestions that a lack of U.S. leadership around the world is encouraging instability and aggression, such as China\u2019s maritime claims in Asia.\n\n\u201cAs to whether our deterrent value is as great as it should be, I think it is,\u201d he said.\n\nChina is pushing toward its regional objectives while the U.S. is trying to block Beijing from trying to \u201cpick off our allies one by one,\u201d Dempsey said.\n\nDempsey\u2019s comments were made during a keynote speech to the Aspen Security Forum, an annual gathering of current and former military, intelligence, and national security officials.\n\nEarlier, Michael Vickers, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, said the greatest threats to U.S. security today emanate from Syria, where Islamist rebels have gained strength and the group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has expanded insurgent operations from Syria into Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe most dangerous threats to the American homeland emanate from Syria,\u201d Vickers said, noting that ISIL has aspirations to conduct global attacks and is in competition with other terrorists for global leadership.\n\nJohn Pistole, director of the Transportation Security Administration, said the major threat to aviation today remain the non-metallic improvised explosive device carried on board by a suicide bomber or stored secretly in cargo.\n\nThe hard-to-detect bomb made with non-metal components is a \u201cclear and present danger,\u201d Pistole said. \u201cThe non-metallic IED is our top threat,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the recent shoot-down of a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, Pistole said he initially suspected a suicide bomber on board had taken down the plane but eventually learned of the surface-to-air missile attack.\n\nFor U.S. airports, shoulder-fired missiles are a remote worry and the TSA has no indication that terrorists have obtained shoulder-fired anti-aircraft rockets, he said.\n\nNonetheless, major U.S. airports have been surveyed to gauge where a terrorist would conduct a missile attack on a commercial jet or cargo aircraft taking off or landing, he said.\n\nTSA security is on the look out for liquid explosives that could be combined with bomb initiators that could pass through airport metal detectors, Pistole said.\n\nNon-metal bombs can be concealed in clothing\u2014like the so-called underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried unsuccessfully to blow up a U.S. jetliner in 2009.\n\nPistole said Abdulmutallab\u2019s bomb failed because he carried it, presumably while wearing it, for two weeks and as a result the components became degraded.\n\nOther concealed bombs can be made in cameras and laptop computers, he said.\n\nDuring a session on security and liberty, Raj De, general counsel of the National Security Agency, said disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have cause damage to U.S. intelligence-gathering capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing targets communicate specifically about leaked information and indicating their intent on how they plan their communications,\u201d De said.\n\nAlso, the full extent of the damage caused by Snowden may not be known for years, he said.\n\nDe said government officials have been urged not to discuss the damage because of the ongoing criminal case against Snowden and because of concerns that public discussion will inflict further national security damage.", "article_metadata":
