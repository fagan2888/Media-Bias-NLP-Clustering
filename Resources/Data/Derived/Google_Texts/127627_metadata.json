By the end of the long-range projection period, Medicare prices for many services would be less than half of their level without consideration of the productivity price reductions. Before such an outcome would occur, lawmakers would likely intervene to prevent the withdrawal of providers from the Medicare market and the severe problems with beneficiary access to care that would result. Overriding the productivity adjustments, as lawmakers have done repeatedly in the case of physician payment rates, would lead to substantially higher costs for Medicare in the long range than those projected in this report.\"\n\nObamacare, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is to spend more than $1.8 trillion over 10 years to expand insurance coverage -- spending that is supposed to be offset by a combination of tax increases and extracting savings from Medicare.\n\nOne of the misleading arguments that the Obama administration has been making since the debate over the passage of the law is that the the same dollars of savings could simultaneously be used improve the solvency of Medicare while paying for a new expansion of entitlements.\n\nBut as the CBO put it in Jan. 2010, \"the majority of the [Hospital Insurance] trust fund savings under [the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act] would be used to pay for other spending and therefore would not enhance the ability of the government to pay for future Medicare benefits.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Monday, Obama administration officials were crediting his health care law with extending the solvency of Medicare for four years, to 2030, citing the latest report from the program's trustees.
