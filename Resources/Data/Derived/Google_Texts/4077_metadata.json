Robert Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and part of the GOP House leadership team working on immigration reform.\n\nHe and other Republican lawmakers argued that the administration is relaxing rules designed by Congress to protect the country from terrorists.\n\nAnd Missouri GOP Sen. Roy Blunt on \"Fox News Sunday\" repeated the concerns of fellow Republicans and others about Obama repeatedly saying that \"he can use his pen and his telephone\" to work around Congress.\n\nThe change is one of Obama's first actions on immigration since he pledged during his State of the Union address last month to use more executive directives.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and the State Department now say that people considered to have provided \"limited material support\" to terrorists or terrorist groups are no longer automatically barred from the United States.\n\nA post-Sept. 11 provision in immigrant law, known as terrorism-related inadmissibility grounds, had affected anyone considered to have given support to terror groups. With little exception, the provision has been applied rigidly to those trying to enter the U.S. and those already here but wanting to change their immigration status.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled Senate last year passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill that includes a 13-year path to citizenship to some of the estimated 11 million people now living illegally in the United States. The Republican-led House has shown signs recently about a desire to at least offer legal status for some illegal immigrants, but suggested last week such legislation will not get passed this year.\n\nFor Morteza Assadi, a 49-year-old real estate agent in northern Virginia, the law has left him in a sort of immigration purgatory while his green card application has been on hold for more than a decade.\n\nAs a teenager in Tehran, Iran, in the early 1980s, Assadi distributed fliers for a mujahedeen group that opposed the government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and was at one time considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. government. Assadi said he told the U.S. government about his activities when he and his wife applied for asylum in the late 1990s. Those requests were later granted and his wife has since become a U.S. citizen. But Assadi's case has remained stalled.\n\n\"When we are teenagers, we have different mindsets,\" Assadi said. \"I thought, I'm doing my country a favor.\"\n\nAssadi said he only briefly associated with the group, which was removed from Washington's list of terrorist organizations in 2012, and that he was never an active member or contributor to its activities. Now he's hopeful that the U.S. government will look at his teenage activities as \"limited.\"\n\nHis lawyer, Parastoo Zahedi, said she has filed a case in federal court to force U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to process Assadi's green card application, but now hopes the government will act on its own.\n\n\"In the past, the minute your name was associated with a [terrorist] organization you were being punished,\" Zahedi said. \"Not every act is a terrorist act and you can't just lump everyone together.\"\n\nThe Homeland Security Department said in a statement that the rule change, which was announced last week and not made in concert with Congress, gives the government more discretion, but won't open the country to terrorists or their sympathizers. People seeking refugee status, asylum and visas, including those already in the United States, still will be checked to make sure they don't pose a threat to national security or public safety, the department said.\n\nIn the past, the provision has been criticized for allowing few exemptions beyond providing medical care or acting under duress. The change now allows officials to consider whether the support was not only limited but potentially part of \"routine commercial transactions or routine social transactions.\"\n\nThe change does not specifically address \"freedom fighters\" who may have fought against an established government, including members of rebel groups who have led revolts in Arab Spring uprisings.\n\nIn late 2011, Citizenship and Immigration Services said about 4,400 affected cases were on hold as the government reviewed possible exemptions to the rule. It's unclear how many of those cases are still pending.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the rule change will help people he described as deserving refugees and asylum-seekers.\n\n\"The existing interpretation was so broad as to be unworkable,\" Leahy, D-Vt., said in a statement. He said the previous rule barred applicants for reasons \"that no rational person would consider.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-01-30 05:04:20 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The Obama administration's use of an executive directive to ease the rules for people trying to enter the United States or stay in the country even though they have given \u201climited\u201d support to terrorists or terror groups is causing problems for Republicans working on immigration reform.", "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration's use of an executive directive to ease the rules for people trying to enter the United States or stay in the country even though they have given \u201climited\u201d support to terrorists or terror groups is causing problems for Republicans working on immigration reform.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/09/house-republicans-object-to-obama-easing-immigration-rules-for-terror.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/020814/0/0/020814_ff_terror_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "GOP objects to Obama administration easing immigration rules for terror supporters", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"GOP objects to Obama administration easing immigration rules for terror supporters\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/020814/0/0/020814_ff_terror_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-09T14:03:58Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/09/house-republicans-object-to-obama-easing-immigration-rules-for-terror.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"6f6111ea-4400-421e-80cb-51589c7c712a\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "The Obama administration's use of an executive directive to ease the rules for people trying to enter the United States or stay in the country even though they have given \u201climited\u201d support to terrorists or terror groups is causing problems for Republicans working on immigration reform.", "dc.identifier": "6f6111ea-4400-421e-80cb-51589c7c712a", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "pagetype": "article", "description": "The Obama administration's use of an executive directive to ease the rules for people trying to enter the United States or stay in the country even though they have given \u201climited\u201d support to terrorists or terror groups is causing problems for Republicans working on immigration reform.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "Gop Objects To Obama Administration Easing Immigration Rules For Terror Supporters", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-30 05:04:20 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "The Obama administration's use of an executive directive to ease the rules for people trying to enter the United States or stay in the country even though they have given \u201climited\u201d support to terrorists or terror groups is causing problems for Republicans working on immigration reform.", "title": "GOP objects to Obama administration easing immigration rules for terror supporters | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/09/house-republicans-object-to-obama-easing-immigration-rules-for-terror.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/020814/0/0/020814_ff_terror_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-02-09", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"GOP objects to Obama administration easing immigration rules for terror supporters\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/020814/0/0/020814_ff_terror_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-09T14:03:58Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/09/house-republicans-object-to-obama-easing-immigration-rules-for-terror.html\",\"post_id\":\"6f6111ea-4400-421e-80cb-51589c7c712a\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f01\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
