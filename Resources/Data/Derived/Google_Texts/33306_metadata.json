In the wake of terrorist attacks in France, many asked why the mass slaughter of civilians in Lebanon the day before or Nigeria the Tuesday after (or in the six non-European sites which faced deadlier terrorist attacks this year), wasn\u2019t given similar coverage. The implication was that media attention skewed in the direction of lost white lives.\n\nSome overly defensive members of the press refused to concede even the premise. The problem was not that journalists were not covering Middle Eastern and African deaths, many a journalist insisted, but that people weren\u2019t reading (and subsequently sharing) stories about them. These underappreciated news items were and would continue to be available for those who sought them out. The bias, however, is readily apparent once we expand the definition of \u201cmedia\u201d beyond foreign news bureaus. The point was that even the least engaged consumers knew about the attacks in Paris: late night hosts paid tribute to the city, Facebook offered convenient functionality which allowed users to watermark their profile pictures with French flags in solidarity, and, as I write, though Boko Haram has ouptaced ISIS as the world\u2019s deadliest terror group, Paris retains higher billing on the homepages of most major news sites. The complaints weren\u2019t about the news people found, but the news that found them.\n\nMost thoughtful grapplings with the subject conceded a media bias, but explained the discrepancy by pointing to the strong connection many Americans feel to Paris. It is true that the United States has deep historic and cultural ties to France, but not readily apparent that these ties ought to translate to a heightened emotional bond. That such deaths are a rare occurrence in Paris but more common in more turbulent regions, another common refrain, ought only to intensify our concern and sense of injustice. But admittedly limited coverage of terrorism in Africa and the Middle East tends to be met with indifference at best. The media serves as a funhouse mirror, reflecting back a biased picture that then further warps our perspective.\n\n***\n\nA more celebratory conversation was, meanwhile, taking place on other corners of the Internet. Calls for greater representation of minorities in scripted television have grown louder and more prominent this year. \u201cMaster of None,\u201d a new series from \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d veterans Aziz Ansari and Alan Yang, has been a welcome entrant to the dialogue since it premiered on Netflix earlier this month. The show itself openly plays with these issues, but its stars and creators have also been refreshingly candid and outspoken about the industry\u2019s deeply-ingrained racism and their very active and conscious efforts to counter it.\n\nIn interview after interview, the \u201cMoN\u201d creative team has stressed the importance of not just more roles for minority actors, but different kinds of roles \u2014 ones that reject tokenism and singularity and instead embrace greater sophistication and variety. Scripted television is, perhaps, best-suited for these fleshed out portrayals because, in the same way that the segmented structure of cable news rejects complexity, the medium demands it. It is astonishingly difficult to retain audience interest in flat characters over a long time frame, and even minority characters who embody trite stereotypes tend to attract sympathy and offer something of an emotional inner life.\n\nIt is, then, understandable that in his activism, \u201cMoN\u201d co-creator Ansari, who plays the show\u2019s protagonist Dev, has drawn from his own experiences. Writing in the New York Times, he describes the alienation he felt as a child, when the only on-screen Indians at his reach were cab drivers or convenience store workers. Here, he\u2019s echoing a point made in \u201cMoN,\u201d when in an illustratively short montage a young Dev is blasted with cultural portrayals of Indians, featuring Apu from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and the monkey brain-eating villain of \u201cIndiana Jones.\u201d Ansari closes his Times piece with an appeal to the marketability of minority actors in leading roles. \u201cYou know what? No one really cares,\u201d he writes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Western media coverage of the Paris terror attacks outweighed others.
