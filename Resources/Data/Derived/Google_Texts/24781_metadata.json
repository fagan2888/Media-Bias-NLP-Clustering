The republication of their stories was big news last year, bringing them to the mass audiences denied them in their lifetimes. Lit Hub even declared 2015 \u201cThe Year of Rediscovered Women Writers,\u201d in its list of the top five literary stories of the year. How could these gifted writers have been erased from history, so many wondered? We shouldn\u2019t be so surprised. There are many worthy writers languishing in moldy archives, and I would venture to say that the majority of them are women.\n\nFeminist scholars spent much of the 1980s and 1990s recovering forgotten women writers, generations of Shakespeare\u2019s and Melville\u2019s sisters, as some called them. But virtually all of the dozens of writers they reclaimed, with the exception of Zora Neale Hurston and Kate Chopin, never made it out of academia\u2019s cloistered walls and into the public consciousness. As a result, many of them are disappearing again.\n\nA case in point is the phenomenally talented American writer Constance Fenimore Woolson, one of the most highly regarded American writers of the 19th century. Critics hailed her as America\u2019s \u201cforemost novelist\u201d and the only American woman writer in the same league as George Eliot. Her friend Henry James paid tribute to her in his collection \u201cPartial Portraits\u201d (1888), finding in her stories \u201ca remarkable minuteness of observation and tenderness of feeling on the part of one who evidently did not glance and pass, but lingered and analyzed.\u201d After Woolson\u2019s death in 1894, her editor at Harper\u2019s, which had an exclusive contract to publish all of her writings, called her \u201ca true artist\u201d whose writings possessed a \u201crare excellence, originality, and strength [that] were appreciated by the most fastidious critics.\u201d\n\nYet, almost as soon as she died, Woolson faded from view, so much so that her closest successor, Edith Wharton, never acknowledged her existence, despite the fact that they shared a close friend (James) and Wharton must have been aware of Woolson\u2019s work. But Wharton was keen to distance herself from other women writers, just as they were being relegated as a class to the dustbin of literary history. At the turn of the 20th century, the cadre of male critics and scholars busy forming the American literary canon decided to completely ignore all of the dozens of women writers who had made names for themselves since the Puritan Anne Bradstreet. Emily Dickinson and Wharton were let in later, although as anomalies. And for nearly a century, it appeared as if women writers simply didn\u2019t exist, except perhaps as third-rate magazine writers who churned out sentimental drivel.\n\nThe writings of Woolson and many other significant American women writers of the 19th century were simply left to molder on library shelves for feminist scholars to discover them. As they brought these texts out of the mothballs, cries of \u201cbut are they any good?\u201d echoed in the scholarship of the period. Some texts, particularly those by early American women writers, could only be reclaimed by reformulating literary value, privileging cultural work over time-bound aesthetic criteria. Others were considered worthy of comparison to canonical male writers such Emerson, Hawthorne or James. In this way, Margaret Fuller, Elizabeth Stoddard, Sarah Orne Jewett, Mary Wilkins Freeman, Woolson and others were brought back into print in their own volumes or in anthologies. The reputations of Jewett and Freeman have been particularly well recuperated. But Fuller, Stoddard and Woolson, or many of the other extremely talented women writers rediscovered in the 1980s and \u201990s (such as Rose Terry Cooke, Frances Harper, Rebecca Harding Davis, Sui Sin Far or Zitkala-Sa), may go back into the black hole of unknown women writers once again.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Feminist scholars have done the hard work of recovering women writers, but we're not there yet.
