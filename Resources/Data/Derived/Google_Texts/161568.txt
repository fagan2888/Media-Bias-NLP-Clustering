Ted Cruz shops for health care through ObamaCare while vowing to repeal it

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) — who this week declared he was running for president and vowed to repeal ObamaCare if elected — said Tuesday that he was enrolling for family health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Cruz told The Des Moines Register that his wife, Heidi Cruz, had lost workplace coverage when she took a leave of absence from Goldman Sachs to work on his campaign, so they are looking at plans on the federal marketplace. "I believe we should follow the text of every law, even [a] law I disagree with," he told CNN.
