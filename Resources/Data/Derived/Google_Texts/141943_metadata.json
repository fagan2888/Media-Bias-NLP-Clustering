(AP) - It was exactly a month ago that No. 25 UCLA upset then-No. 1 Kentucky to serve notice that the Bruins were an elite team.\n\nOn Sunday night, UCLA lost 85-78 to Washington State, a team it has utterly dominated for decades, to show that the Bruins are a mystery.\n\nThe loss followed a double-overtime loss at Washington and left UCLA 0-2 in the Pac-12.\n\n\u201cThis is not the way we want to start the league and now it becomes a very long, tough road,\u201d UCLA coach Steve Alford said.\n\nAlford refused to blame the double-overtime loss for his team\u2019s play at Washington State.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just part of college basketball and being fatigued, that\u2019s a mental softness and we can\u2019t have that,\u201d Alford said. \u201cWe have to be tougher.\u201d\n\nWashington State\u2019s Josh Hawkinson had 20 points and 10 rebounds, his ninth consecutive double-double, to lead the Cougars.\n\nIt was his 11th double-double of the season and 31st of his career. The 6-foot-10 forward added four blocked shots and three assists.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s comfortable with anyone on the floor, I think,\u201d Washington State coach Ernie Kent said.\n\nThe Cougars went with a smaller lineup to add some speed against the Bruins.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to create tempo and pace and we wanted it to be fast,\u201d Kent said. \u201cWe are better that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought that was a very, very good effort we put together against a very good basketball team,\u201d Kent said, \u201cplaying smart, playing heady and playing tough defensively.\u201d\n\nQue Johnson and Renard Suggs each scored 14 points for Washington State (9-5, 1-1 Pac-12), while Charles Callison had 12, and Conor Clifford 10. The Cougars lost to Southern California in the conference opener Friday night.\n\nIsaac Hamilton scored 27 points for UCLA (9-6). UCLA\u2019s Bryce Alford, coming off a 30-point performance at Washington, was held to nine points.\n\nThe Bruins got 13 points and 10 rebounds from Thomas Welsh.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was exactly a month ago that No. 25 UCLA upset then-No. 1 Kentucky to serve notice that the Bruins were an elite team.", "Author": "NICHOLAS K.
