The number of Arkansans approved as eligible to enroll in the state’s expansion of Medicaid, known as the private option, has surpassed 250,000 people. That’s an upward tick of 8,696 people deemed eligible from March 31st to April 30th.

A release Friday by the state Department of Human Services reports 234,791 people have actually been enrolled, up from 229,599 in the previous month.

The average monthly per person cost of the state’s version of the Affordable Care Act program for those earning up to 138 percent of the poverty remained near flat. It rose by just under 10 cents from $481.53 in April 2015 to $481.61 in May 2015.

Republican State Senator David Sanders, one of those widely credited with crafting the private option, hailed the per person costs as falling below federal limits.
