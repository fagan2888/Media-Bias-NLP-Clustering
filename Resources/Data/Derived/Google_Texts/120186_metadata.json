FDA officials recently issued broad guidelines on nanotechnology, but didn\u2019t go so far as to establish regulatory definitions of what it is, saying the science hasn\u2019t progressed to the point where it can be fully understood.\n\nAgency spokesman Jeff Ventura said the FDA doesn\u2019t make \u201ca categorical judgment that nanotechnology is inherently safe or harmful.\u201d\n\nThe watchdog group As You Sow says the FDA needs to go farther, and points out that without a definition for nanotechnology, manufacturers can come up with their own definition of \u201cnanotech-free\u201d products.\n\n\u201cThe guidance is simply insufficient,\u201d said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, based in Oakland, Calif. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t provide clarity. It doesn\u2019t provide a standard to industry,\u201d\n\nFugere adds: \u201cCompanies are saying they don\u2019t use nanotechnology because they are defining nanotechnology as the majority of particles are larger than one to one hundred nanometers. When they deny they are using nano, we believe they are.\u201d\n\nAs You Sow contends Kraft Foods Group Inc. /quotes/zigman/11825124/delayed /quotes/nls/krft KRFT and several other major food firms are also using nanotechnology, Fugere says.\n\n\u201cWe identified titanium dioxide as ingredients in their foods,\u201d she said, referring to an ingredient used in paint and sunscreen. \u201cWhat that means is we have also detected titanium dioxide from most of the major manufacturers.\u201d\n\nOn Kraft\u2019s website, the Chicago-based processed food giant says it is \u201cnanotech-free.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some ingredients in our products that may be nano-sized,\u201d said Russ Dyer, Kraft spokesman. \u201cBut that would be infrequent because they are not intentionally engineered on the nano-scale.\u201d\n\nFugere adds sub-microscopic particles of titanium dioxide have been found in Dunkin\u2019 Donuts /quotes/zigman/5986556/delayed /quotes/nls/dnkn DNKN goods as well.\n\nAs You Sow filed an open letter requesting the board of Dunkin\u2019s Brand to publish a report by Nov. 1, on policies regarding public health concerns of nanomaterials in its products or packaging.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about liability arising from use of nanotechnology in food products,\u201d the group said in the letter. \u201cBecause of their small size, nanoparticles are more likely to enter cells, tissues, and organs where they may interfere with normal cellular function and cause damage and cell death.\u201d\n\nMichelle King, Dunkin\u2019s senior director of global public relations, said the company is \u201creviewing the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s new guidance on nanomaterials in food products.\u201d\n\nOut of 1,795 nano-enabled products identified by The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, backed by The Woodrow Wilson Center, a Washington research institute, 117 were listed under the food and beverage sector.\n\nOne nano-enabled product is adhesive for McDonald\u2019s Corp.\u2019s /quotes/zigman/233369/delayed /quotes/nls/mcd MCD burger containers, the project says, but company spokeswoman Terri Hickey rejects the claim. There is concern that whatever material may be on the containers could creep into the\n\n\u201cAt this time McDonald\u2019s does not support using nano-engineered materials in production of any of our food, packaging and toys,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will evaluate this position as progress is made in further understanding the potential impact of nanotechnology and nano-engineered materials.\u201d\n\nMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:\n\nReport notes Obamacare data flaws, but HHS says they\u2019re clearing up\n\nWhat happens to contraception coverage after Hobby Lobby?\n\nSupreme Court rules some firms don\u2019t have to cover birth control\n\nKindred warns Gentiva to stay away from Amedisys", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-07-01T15:35:59-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "The FDA recently set guidelines for nanotechnology but at least one watchdog group says the agency didn't go far enough to keep minute amounts of toxins out of food products.", "title": "Nanotechnology: What substances may be creeping into food products?", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/07/01/nanotechnology-what-substances-may-be-creeping-into-food-products/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CL262_donuts_MG_20140701151625.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Shu Zhang", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "health,nanotechnology,U.S. Food and Drug Administration", "article.headline": "Nanotechnology: What substances may be creeping into food products?", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "health,nanotechnology,U.S. Food and Drug Administration", "author": "Shu Zhang", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "The FDA recently set guidelines for nanotechnology but at least one watchdog group says the agency didn't go far enough to keep minute amounts of toxins out of food products.", "article.published": "2014-07-01T15:35:59-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/07/01/nanotechnology-what-substances-may-be-creeping-into-food-products/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "The FDA recently set guidelines for nanotechnology but at least one watchdog group says the agency didn't go far enough to keep minute amounts of toxins out of food products.", "title": "Nanotechnology: What substances may be creeping into food products?", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/07/01/nanotechnology-what-substances-may-be-creeping-into-food-products/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CL262_donuts_MG_20140701151625.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2768", "article.updated": "2014-07-01T15:35:59-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2399\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are concerned about liability arising from use of nanotechnology in food products,\u201d the group said in the letter.\nGrowing concerns over infinitesimal substances that are finding their way into everyday food and cosmetic products via the growing field of nanotechnology is setting off alarm bells among public health watchdogs, who fret over what ingredients may be creeping into the culinary process.\nWhen they deny they are using nano, we believe they are.\u201dAs You Sow contends Kraft Foods Group Inc. /quotes/zigman/11825124/delayed /quotes/nls/krft KRFT and several other major food firms are also using nanotechnology, Fugere says.\n\u201cWe identified titanium dioxide as ingredients in their foods,\u201d she said, referring to an ingredient used in paint and sunscreen.\nAs You Sow filed an open letter requesting the board of Dunkin\u2019s Brand to publish a report by Nov. 1, on policies regarding public health concerns of nanomaterials in its products or packaging."}
