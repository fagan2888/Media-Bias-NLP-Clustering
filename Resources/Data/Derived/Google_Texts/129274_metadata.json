So far we\u2019ve had two. The first is that Obamacare may make it by the skin of its teeth. The second is that\u2019s it\u2019s a total failure and the worst thing since unsliced bread. Time for a third: It\u2019s a huge success and a triumph and a historic achievement and an immeasurable benefit to the American people.\n\nI\u2019ll stake out this lonely ground, because the allowed media narratives have other things to do. The allowed narratives are, first, the hysterical made-up Republican one, which we must all treat with feigned respect and write it up as spoken as if it makes sense or is sincere. And the other allowed narrative is that the hysterical made-up Republican narrative may not be ENTIRELY the whole story, and maybe the truth lies somewhere in the middle between this and the never-reported or discussed actual liberal point of view (single payer). The next-best alternative, a robust defense of Obamacare has also been next to impossible to find. I\u2019m here today to (not for the first time) provide this missing piece of the conversation.\n\nHere it is, in brief. The American healthcare system was a disgraceful mess before Obamacare, leaving growing numbers of people uncovered in a system of unchecked and runaway wasteful costs. Since Obamacare was passed the standard has changed and we are moving toward humane universal coverage, like every other advanced nation. And the costs and delivery systems are finally subject to at least the beginnings of a discussion about costs and results. Sanity and humanity prevailed, for once.\n\nNow you may return to the endless river of disingenuous carping.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I\u2019ll stake out this lonely ground, because the allowed media narratives have other things to do.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tomtoles", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "I\u2019ll stake out this lonely ground, because the allowed media narratives have other things to do.", "title": "Obamacare a Huge Success", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2014/04/02/obamacare-a-huge-success/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2014/04/02/obamacare-a-huge-success/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obamacare wins, obamacare huge success, obamacare triumph,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tomtoles"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare wins, obamacare huge success, obamacare triumph,"}, "article_summary": "Time for a third: It\u2019s a huge success and a triumph and a historic achievement and an immeasurable benefit to the American people.\nSince Obamacare was passed the standard has changed and we are moving toward humane universal coverage, like every other advanced nation.\nThe first is that Obamacare may make it by the skin of its teeth.\nThe American healthcare system was a disgraceful mess before Obamacare, leaving growing numbers of people uncovered in a system of unchecked and runaway wasteful costs.\nThe next-best alternative, a robust defense of Obamacare has also been next to impossible to find."}
