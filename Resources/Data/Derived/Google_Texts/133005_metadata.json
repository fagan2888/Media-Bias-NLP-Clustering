Burwell decision looming. That ruling could result in a huge number of Americans losing their health insurance subsidies.\n\n\u201cAlthough we've taken some positive rating actions on hospital companies in 2015 due to better operating performance, we remain cautious about the sector's longer-term prospects given persistent reimbursement pressure, including scheduled future cuts to government subsidies,\u201d the report said.\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of high-deductible plans, which shifts much more of the cost burden to patients and has a seasonal effect since these limits reset at the start of each year.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\n\u201cCommunity Health, for example, noted a $20 million hit to EBITDA compared to the fourth quarter from bad debt expense related to deductibles and copays that reset on Jan. 1. LifePoint noted that copay and deductible revenue before the provision for bad debt increased 29 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, and the company raised its provision for doubtful accounts related to these revenues for the second consecutive quarter,\u201d it said.\n\nStill, the report said many of these people in high-deductible plans were previously uninsured. And since more people are covered, bad debt is falling across the sector.\n\nTwitter: @HenryPowderly", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/profit-hospitals-see-strong-first-quarter-payer-mix-higher-admissions-report-says", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Tenet-Healthcare-HQ-google-feature_1.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "New report by Standard & Poor's claims a more diverse payer mix brought about by the Affordable Care Act and a surge in admissions as more Americans have health insurance lifted the sector.", "title": "For-profit hospitals see strong first quarter on payer mix, higher admissions, report says"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Tenet-Healthcare-HQ-google-feature_1.gif"}, "description": "New report by Standard & Poor's claims a more diverse payer mix brought about by the Affordable Care Act and a surge in admissions as more Americans have health insurance lifted the sector.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "For-profit hospitals see strong first quarter on payer mix, higher admissions, report says"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Acute care, for-profit hospitals had a better first quarter than expected, according to a new report by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, due mostly to a more diverse payer mix brought about by the Affordable Care Act and a surge in admissions as more Americans have health insurance.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "According to the report, the higher rate of insured lifted patient admissions to new levels in the quarter, which resulted in higher profits and greater cash flow.\nAnd since more people are covered, bad debt is falling across the sector.\nAll of that is also leading to employment growth for these healthcare providers, the report said.\nPhoto of Tenet Healthcare Headquarters from GoogleAcute care, for-profit hospitals had a better first quarter than expected, according to a new report by Standard & Poor\u2019s, due mostly to a more diverse payer mix brought about by the Affordable Care Act and a surge in admissions as more Americans have health insurance.\nStill, the report said many of these people in high-deductible plans were previously uninsured."}
