Anthony List\u2019s recent Supreme Court victory, they\u2019ve revived their malicious narrative that SBA was fighting for a \u201cright to lie\u201d when they characterized ex-Ohio Rep. Steve Driehaus\u2019s vote for ObamaCare as a de-facto vote for taxpayer funding of abortion.\n\nThat, you may recall, was real lie in this case. As I\u2019ve summarized before, ObamaCare\u2019s supposed barriers to abortion funding don\u2019t change the fact that insurance plans are eligible for federal subsidies even if they cover abortion, that its contraception mandate includes abortifacient methods, and that it dumps millions of bucks into Planned Parenthood\u2019s lap.\n\nAt The Federalist this week, Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel Casey Mattox explains that this isn\u2019t theoretical anymore\u2014as we speak, people\u2019s consciences are under attack by the law Driehaus and his colleagues forced on them:\n\nExhibit A is the Bracy family in Connecticut, a family forced by Obamacare to pay an abortion surcharge used solely for others\u2019 elective surgical abortions. The Bracys are required to pay this surcharge in order to enroll in any plan on the Connecticut exchange and avoid substantial fines under the individual mandate. They aren\u2019t alone. Every Connecticut resident must pay this abortion surcharge to enroll in an exchange plan.\n\nNot that a little thing like SBA List being right would stop prenatal violence apologists from serving up multiple flavors of deceit.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the classic lie masquerading as hard news reporting, demonstrated by the Huffington Post\u2019s Laura Basset. Her piece matter-of-factly declares in the headline, \u201cSupreme Court Moves to Legalize Lying In Campaigns,\u201d and falsely claims the law \u201cprevented [SBA] from making false statements about a political candidate in 2010.\u201d\n\nThe closest she comes to balance is a lone statement by SBA president Marjorie Dannenfelser that doesn\u2019t address the accuracy of her group\u2019s claims, and from which a reader would never know that SBA has put forth detailed explanations of their side of the story.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s the lie wrapped in legal assessment, written by RH Reality Check\u2019s closest substitute for a \u201csenior legal analysis,\u201d Jessica Mason Pieklo. Sadly, she hasn\u2019t improved since I last called her out on this case for missing a First-Amendment violation that was obvious even to the ACLU. She\u2019s still lying about SBA\u2019s statements being \u201cclearly false,\u201d and in a truly impressive bit of hypocrisy, suggesting \u201cthe anti-choice right refuses to accept as truth statements of fact that undercut their political agenda.\u201d To paraphrase the old saying: if you have the facts on your side, argue the facts. If you have the law on your side, argue the law. If you have neither, go write for RHRC.\n\nNext, there\u2019s my personal favorite, the truly audacious \u201clie while pretending to help the person you\u2019re lying about.\u201d At ThinkProgress, Ian Millhiser endorses SCOTUS\u2019s ruling and condemns the free-speech implications of the Ohio law, but fills his ostensible defense of SBA with potshots at them. \u201cThe Case Against Cracking Down On An Anti-Abortion Group That Deceived Voters,\u201d reads his headline, under which he regurgitates the pro-ObamaCare spin and claims \u201cSBA was either lying when they made this allegation against Driehaus, or they did not understand how the Affordable Care Act works.\u201d Oh, they know. And they\u2019ve backed it up. Ball\u2019s in your court, Ian.\n\nAnd finally, there\u2019s the most (relatively) honest form of dishonesty, the good old-fashioned hit-piece editorial. At The Daily Beast, pro-abortion partisan Sally Kohn writes that the ruling has \u201cexpose[d] the right\u2019s pernicious habit of false-fact smear campaigns.\u201d Calling SBA\u2019s messaging a \u201cflat-out lie\u201d on little more than the basis of PolitiFact and Guttmacher said so, Kohn deploys a true marvel of logical knot-tying:\n\nTo be clear, the Court did not rule as to whether the Ohio False Statement Law is constitutional\u2014it simply ruled that the Susan B. Anthony List has legal justification in suing. And without a doubt, part of the reason that the Susan B. Anthony List has standing is because they lie [\u2026] To even file this lawsuit in the first place, the Susan B. Anthony List had to admit it lied. The lying wasn\u2019t an accident or even a momentary lapse in good judgment. It was conscious and deliberate.\n\nSo in Sally Kohn\u2019s dementedly self-serving version of reality, someone else can accuse you of violating a particular law, and the very act of defending yourself against the allegation is a de facto admission of guilt. Heads I win, tails you lose. Apparently she\u2019s suggesting that the only way SBA could have standing to challenge an anti-lying law would be if they\u2019re liars, but that\u2019s manifestly absurd\u2014a false charge can wreak havoc with your life just as a true one can.\n\nBasset, Pieklo, Millhiser, Kohn, and their pals are all lying. And they know it. If lying about political issues and candidates is an outrage warranting legal action, then why aren\u2019t lies printed on a website or in print at least as deserving of punishment as lies on a billboard?\n\nHopefully the judiciary\u2019s eventual decision on the merits of the case will keep government from both, but in the meantime pro-aborts can deceive with the comforting knowledge that most of the speech police are on their side. Pro-lifers will have to settle for having the facts on ours.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "5 Like4 Tweet1 +10Pro-aborts know all too well that repeating a lie at every possible opportunity is the key to passing it off as truth, which is why, in response to the Susan B.
