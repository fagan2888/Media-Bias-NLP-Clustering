They cite the ongoing criticism of Planned Parenthood and a movement in many state legislatures to restrict access to abortion.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court in Michigan on behalf of its members against Trinity Health, a group of 86 hospitals in 21 states that has in recent years engaged in a number of mergers with other health care facilities. The complaint, obtained by Al Jazeera, alleges that Trinity hospitals have refused \u201cappropriate emergency care to women suffering pregnancy complications, including miscarriages.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor many women experiencing pregnancy complications, even when the pregnancy isn\u2019t viable, abortion is the standard of care necessary, or they can develop infections, become septic or experience hemorrhaging,\u201d ACLU attorney Alexa Kolbi-Molinas told Al Jazeera.\n\nRights advocates say Trinity Health emergency rooms and physicians often send patients home instead of offering them procedures such as tubal ligations (commonly referred to as tube tying) or the removal of an unviable fetus in an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n\u201cWomen are told, \u2018There's nothing we can do for your miscarriage, go home,\u2019 and think they are getting medical advice but in fact are getting religious advice,\u201d said Washington state abortion rights advocate Mary Kay Barbieri. She has been collecting testimony from women who say they have experienced such treatment at Catholic hospitals.\n\nThe Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, written by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), prohibits its medical facilities from terminating pregnancies, \u201ceven if such care is urgently needed to protect a woman\u2019s health or life,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nThe USCCB did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe suit argues that the refusal to perform emergency abortions amounts to a violation of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires health care providers to \u201cprovide such medical treatment of the condition as may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to occur during the transfer of the individual from a facility.\u201d\n\nTrinity Health rejected that argument.\n\n\u201cThis case has no merit,\u201d Trinity Health spokeswoman Eve Pidgeon said in an email. \u201cThe Ethical and Religious Directives are entirely consistent with high-quality health care, and our clinicians continue to provide superb care throughout the communities we serve.\u201d\n\nBarbieri has long been at the forefront of the battle against Catholic health care facilities\u2019 refusal to offer emergency or elective abortions as well as other health care like end-of-life care. She says a number of Catholic hospital mergers with non-religiously-affiliated facilities have made Washington a hot spot for what she calls an erosion of reproductive rights. Nearly half of hospital beds in Washington are Catholic-owned, she estimates.\n\n\u201cCatholic hospitals have been well positioned to take part in mergers,\u201d she said, explaining that the majority of mergers happened after small, rural hospitals struggled to contend with quality standards mandated by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now beginning to understand how seriously the Catholic doctrine is affecting women in life or death issues or decisions on when to have a child,\u201d she said.\n\nThe ACLU lawsuit comes days after Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards\u2019 appearance before Congress to defend the organization\u2019s use of federal funds. Her treatment during the appearance, particularly by Republican members of Congress, has been criticized as an assault on women\u2019s rights.\n\nCompared with the campaign against Planned Parenthood, the moves by Catholic hospital systems to restrict access to abortion \u2014 particularly for people in rural areas who must depend on a Catholic facility for health care \u2014 has gone unnoticed, advocates say.\n\n\u201cThe advocacy community has highlighted when waiting periods or gestational restrictions\u201d are imposed, said Sara Hutchinson Ratcliffe, the domestic program director for abortion-rights advocacy group Catholics for Choice. \u201cThe difference with [the fact] that Catholic health care systems and restrictions by the bishops\u2019 directive is that people are unaware.\u201d\n\nA federal judge in July tossed out an ACLU lawsuit against Muskegon, Michigan, hospital Mercy Health Partners, a Trinity subsidiary, for repeatedly turning Tamesha Means away while she was miscarrying. The ACLU says it is appealing the ruling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Activists hope lawsuit, filed in Michigan, will raise awareness about attempts to restrict access to abortion", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/10/1/aclu-sues-catholic-hospital-over-emergency-abortions.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/10/1/aclu-sues-catholic-hospital-over-emergency-abortions/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.pregnancygeneric.1443811927234.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "Activists hope lawsuit, filed in Michigan, will raise awareness about attempts to restrict access to abortion", "title": "ACLU sues Catholic hospital for denying patients emergency abortions"}, "LastModifiedDate": "Fri, 02 Oct 2015 18:52:15 GMT", "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/10/1/aclu-sues-catholic-hospital-over-emergency-abortions/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.pregnancygeneric.1443811927234.jpg", "description": "Activists hope lawsuit, filed in Michigan, will raise awareness about attempts to restrict access to abortion", "card": "summary", "title": "ACLU sues Catholic hospital for denying patients emergency abortions"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Religion, Spirituality & Ethics, Planned Parenthood, Abortion, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "She has been collecting testimony from women who say they have experienced such treatment at Catholic hospitals.\n\u201cThis case has no merit,\u201d Trinity Health spokeswoman Eve Pidgeon said in an email.\nCivil liberties advocates filed a lawsuit Thursday against one of the nation\u2019s largest Catholic health care groups for allegedly denying women reproductive health procedures \u2014 such as emergency abortions \u2014 in what the advocates argue is a violation of federal law.\n\u201cThe Ethical and Religious Directives are entirely consistent with high-quality health care, and our clinicians continue to provide superb care throughout the communities we serve.\u201dBarbieri has long been at the forefront of the battle against Catholic health care facilities\u2019 refusal to offer emergency or elective abortions as well as other health care like end-of-life care.\nThe lawsuit aims in part to call attention to what reproductive rights advocates call Catholic hospitals\u2019 role in an \"overwhelming\" attempt by social conservatives to erode the availability of reproductive health care."}
