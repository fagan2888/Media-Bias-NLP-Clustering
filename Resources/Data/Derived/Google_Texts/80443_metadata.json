Pending results in Colorado, the brand will then go national.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cross between Starbucks and an Amazon online concept,\u201d said Jeff Dyke, executive vice president of operations for Charlotte, N.C.-based Sonic Automotive.\n\nEchoPark will be built on a hub-and-spoke model, with the hub store on East 104th Avenue in Thornton carrying 500 to 700 cars at any given time. Smaller spoke stores in other metro Denver locations will carry 75 to 100 vehicles. Where physical layout allows, the car lots will be located behind the stores instead of in front.\n\nEchoPark will be \u201cvery different from the experience at a traditional dealership, including ours,\u201d Dyke said.\n\nIn Colorado, Sonic owns Mountain States Toyota, Don Massey Cadillac, and Murray BMW and Mercedes-Benz.\n\n\u201cThis will be nontraditional. People won\u2019t see a big-box car dealership with the bright lights and big flagpoles and all that junk,\u201d Dyke said.\n\nCustomers will deal with only one associate compared with other systems where buyers may interact with separate staffers for sales, finance and appraisals. Dyke said EchoPark\u2019s goal is to complete transactions in less than one hour, with minimal paperwork.\n\nHe said metro Denver was chosen as the launch location because it has a high volume of used-car sales and because Sonic is familiar with the market.\n\nSome analysts have compared the new concept to used-car retailer CarMax Inc., a national dealership with Colorado outlets in Littleton, Federal Heights and Colorado Springs.\n\nTim Jackson, chief executive of the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association, said EchoPark\u2019s competitive impact on other Colorado dealerships will start small but is likely to grow over time.\n\nHe said that as the company expands its national footprint, it will benefit from the ability to move cars from one region to another to fill particular demands.\n\n\u201cIt will create more competition,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt about it.\n\n\u201cI think it will elevate the marketplace for Colorado consumers, and elevate the standards in that (used-car) segment.\u201d\n\nSteve Raabe: 303-954-1948, sraabe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/steveraabedp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Sonic Automotive launches new used-car sales concept in metro Denver", "title": "Sonic Automotive launches new used-car sales concept in metro Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/18/sonic-automotive-launches-new-used-car-sales-concept-in-metro-denver/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-18T15:00:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-18T15:00:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd831\"", "article_summary": "Sonic plans to open three branches in metro Denver by the end of the year, with plans for more next year.\nHe said metro Denver was chosen as the launch location because it has a high volume of used-car sales and because Sonic is familiar with the market.\nIn Colorado, Sonic owns Mountain States Toyota, Don Massey Cadillac, and Murray BMW and Mercedes-Benz.\nSmaller spoke stores in other metro Denver locations will carry 75 to 100 vehicles.\nSome analysts have compared the new concept to used-car retailer CarMax Inc., a national dealership with Colorado outlets in Littleton, Federal Heights and Colorado Springs."}
