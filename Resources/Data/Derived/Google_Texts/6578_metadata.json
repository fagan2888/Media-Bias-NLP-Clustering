Please check the conference agenda on the website periodically for updates.\n\nGuest Speaker: Joe Quinlan, Managing Director & Chief Market Strategist, U.S. Trust, Bank of America, Private Wealth Management\n\nMr. Quinlan's talk will cover the main drivers of long-term change as key to investment success in the 21st century. We are at the beginning of a secular growth phase for the U.S. economy driven largely by the rebalancing of global growth from the developed to the developing world. Joe will discuss the long-term drivers, the macro forces and investment themes at play across industries that are taking us into the next growth cycle.\n\nPanel Discussion: A CEO's View of Managing and Interacting with Your Board of Directors and Audit Committee\n\nThis panel will bring together a seasoned group of industry veterans to discuss the current life sciences challenges presented and the opportunities and the role of the CFO in supporting the company and Board of Directors. Also, CEOs will discuss their perspectives on the role of finance in an organization and how the CFO can go from being a number cruncher to a trusted advisor to the CEO and Board.\n\nPanel Discussion: Washington Update\n\nThis panel will provide an inside look at the issues facing the life science industry and how legislators in Washington DC and state capitals have an influence over how management runs companies. The Jobs Act, and Affordable Care Act are just two examples of major pieces of legislation that were influenced by our panel members and impacted the industry. The IPO window many companies took advantage of was propelled by the initiatives in the Jobs Act. The $5 billion R&D grants from the Affordable Care Act provided life science companies a needed shot in the arm as we struggled to raise capital in the depths of the recession and was the only portion of the bill where Washington actually paid out funding to assist an industry. SEC reporting, IRS tax rules, and the FDA approval process are all in the hands of our legislators and are on the forefront of advocacy issues our panel will discuss.\n\n\"We are pleased that the ABFO Conference continues to provide a venue for financial officers to come together to discuss the state of the industry,\" commented, Vanessa Jacoby, Vice President, Finance at PharmAkea Therapeutics and co-chair of the 2016 National Conference. \"The national participation of speakers and attendees provides a unique perspective of this innovative industry.\"\n\nDan Chevallard, Vice President, Finance and Accounting at Regulus Therapeutics and co-chair of the conference, said, \"In addition to learning from industry leaders, participants can earn over 17 CPE credits and network with peers.
