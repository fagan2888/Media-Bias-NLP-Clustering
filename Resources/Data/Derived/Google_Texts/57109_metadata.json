She trains their bosses. She\u2019s president of Southeast Wisconsin\u2019s Quality Plus Consulting, she does a weekly tech radio show BreakfastBytes on the local NPR station, and she\u2019s considered a leading Midwest computer consultant.\n\nAnd the other thing? She\u2019s one of the few carbon-based life forms left on the planet who will never join Facebook or use Google.\n\nThat said, she knows you can\u2019t live without your best friend\u2019s second cousin\u2019s wedding updates, and that Android phones, for example, are automatically tied to Google.\n\nSo, can you do anything on the Internet these days without Facebook, Google, the NSA, et al, watching what you do?\n\nFirst, the phones:\n\nWindows Phones can be encrypted, patched, and fire-walled with the right add-ons, says King, but \u201cAndroid phones provided by cell phone providers are a security disaster.\u201d\n\nThe exception, she says, is the Android \u201cBlackPhone,\u201d which still allows you to use Google and Facebook, but has security written into its core DNA.\n\nA step up from BlackPhone is Cryptophone, used by law enforcement, government types, and serious security-minded company executives. It\u2019s not cheap \u2014 around $3,500 \u2014 but it blocks \u201cstingrays,\u201d those cellphone tower-mimicking devices that scoop up bulk data of any phone within the stingray\u2019s reach.\n\nIt was Cryptophone users who first identified the stingray phenomenon last summer. King calls law enforcement\u2019s use of stingrays \u201cdownright evil, a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d\n\nKing herself is a member of many sites that are privately-run and operated \u2014 and are not housed in the United States. Some are free and open to the public, others are paid. She points to the uncensored sharing network, https://share.naturalnews.com, which she says is housed outside of government control and is a place where your identity is not being sold to anyone.\n\nKing says anyone who encrypts their iPhone, then puts all their stuff in the iCloud, is just defeating themselves. \u201cApple and everyone that has access to that data still has it, and that includes the government.\u201d\n\nCloud backups are only viable, she says, if you own the encryption keys. At that point, the data is encrypted at the client side before it leaves your system, and the provider has no way to decrypt your data.\n\nAs for sites like Facebook and Google, yes, you can keep them out of your business \u2014 to a point.\n\nSocializing Without Suspicion\n\nFacebook, obviously, tracks you when you\u2019re on it. But what are you allowing Facebook to put on your computer \u2014 cookies \u2014 and what cookies are you allowing all the other websites you surf to put on your computer that Facebook can track?\n\nKing is a big fan of the free website \u201cTails,\u201d \u201cfor hardcore anonymity,\u201d to clean up those cookies. \u201cEvery time you boot up (with Tails), you\u2019re clean, there\u2019s no history, nothing.\u201d And the free \u201cCookie Wall\u201d does the same.\n\nEven easier to use, says King, are the cookie management tools called \u201cIE Cookies View\u201d and \u201cMozilla Cookies View,\u201d offered by the company Nirsoft.net. The applications allow you to selectively delete cookies.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what really sucks,\u201d says King. \u201cYou\u2019ve got these legitimate websites, that you go to frequently, and you want those cookies, those are OK, but you don\u2019t want this other garbage. If you go to Firefox or Internet Explorer, and \u2018say delete all my stuff,\u2019 that\u2019s a nuclear option, and that\u2019s not all that great.\u201d\n\nAs for social media in general, King says there is an entire world that\u2019s disconnected from government-owned, -reported, and -controlled space. Some of it is run through private servers and is invitation-only.\n\nKing herself is a member of many sites that are privately-run and operated \u2014 and are not housed in the United States. Some are free and open to the public, others are paid. She points to the uncensored sharing network, https://share.naturalnews.com, which she says is housed outside of government control and is a place where your identity is not being sold to anyone.\n\nKing calls it a \u201cwelcome online sanctuary\u201d from corporate-and-government controlled media, where the goal, she says, is to watch and/or exploit you.\n\n(Facebook did not respond to WhoWhatWhy\u2019s request for comment.)\n\nSearching Un-Spied\n\nKing points out that for the longest time \u2014 until January of this year \u2014 many search engines used http for data communication, which allowed anyone with the ability to sniff the traffic between you and your destination to see everything you were searching.\n\nBut with https, the contents of the search are not visible, even if the destination still is. She recommends the plugin tool for Firefox called \u201cHTTPS Everywhere,\u201d \u201cPrivacyBadger,\u201d or \u201cAdBlockPlus.\u201d\n\nIn addition, she advises using a VPN service in a country where you are not a resident, a country that has no mandatory retention laws, and a country with a strong legal support of privacy. And check to see if the VPN company retains logs of activity. She recommends \u201cVyprVPN\u201d and \u201cHide.me.\u201d\n\nKing recommends other simple things to her clients: The longer the password, the better. And don\u2019t cross-purpose your devices. A computer or phone that\u2019s just used for work or accounting purposes should stay that way. No writing personal emails or checking football scores or doing games on them, and vice versa.\n\nSadly, she says, you have to presume that US providers have a backdoor built into everything and that NSA or FBI can force them to do anything.\n\nAs for Google? Try getting into the habit of using alternate search engines like StartPage or DuckDuckGo, which don\u2019t track your searches.\n\n(When asked for a comment by WhoWhatWhy, the press office at Google responded, \u201cWe are unable to accommodate your request at this time.\u201d)\n\nCaring about Sharing\n\nLike Google and Facebook, Dropbox is another popular website that has King shaking her head. The company\u2019s \u201cpathologically one-sided\u201d user agreement means \u201cthat all Dropbox employees can look at your stuff. You better encrypt it before you upload.\u201d\n\nBetter yet, she says, file-sharing companies such as Mega, Spider Oak, and Wuala have designed their systems from the ground up so that they don\u2019t know what your files are, and cannot read them. If you lose your encryption key, says King, \u201ctough noogies!\u201d But not even the government will be able to look at your files.\n\nThe Retired Librarian\n\nPlenty of King\u2019s security-minded clients are in the business world, but one is a retired librarian in southeast Wisconsin. \u201cEllen\u201d didn\u2019t want us to use her last name, but she says she\u2019s not paranoid. She says her only motivation for turning to King ten years ago was just feeling \u201coverwhelmed by all the options\u201d when it came to computer security.\n\nEllen has two user accounts, one for day-to-day use, and the second one for administrative access use, to download patches and security software.\n\nShe follows King\u2019s advice to update her operating system every two weeks, which sometimes takes 45 minutes at a time.\n\n\u201cI guess I feel like it\u2019s worth it, \u201c says Ellen. \u201cIt\u2019s like oil changes on the car, and tune-ups on the furnace.\u201d\n\nOver time, Ellen has realized that the spying eyes of thieving hackers aren\u2019t all that different from the prying eyes of corporate websites. Some of her software alerts her to malware that exposes her to both hackers and corporate eyes.\n\nKing recommends other simple things to her clients: The longer the password, the better. And don\u2019t cross-purpose your devices. A computer or phone that\u2019s just used for work or accounting purposes should stay that way. No writing personal emails or checking football scores or doing games on them, and vice versa.\n\nKing herself says she\u2019s got \u201cseven layers of stuff protecting me. It\u2019s not because I think I\u2019m Fort Knox or because the information I have is so wonderful, it\u2019s because I don\u2019t want my stuff to stop working!\u201d\n\nIf it all feels a little depressing to be constantly on guard, King reminds us of something that you\u2019ve probably heard before, but bears repeating: Facebook, Google, Dropbox, and their ilk are not \u201cfree.\u201d\n\nThe price you pay is your identity.\n\nGoogle, in particular, increasingly horrifies King.\n\n\u201cThey used to have a mantra of \u2018don\u2019t be evil,\u2019 but that has changed. It\u2019s quite obvious they want to be Skynet (of \u2018The Terminator\u2019). They have their own military robots, and have stated that they desire to create a profile on every human.\u201d\n\nFelicia King doesn\u2019t plan on being one of them.\n\nwww.perspecsys.com / Flickr) Related front page panorama photo credit: Cloud Computing ( Perspecsys Photos /\n\nSpeak Truth To Power We are 100% reader funded.
