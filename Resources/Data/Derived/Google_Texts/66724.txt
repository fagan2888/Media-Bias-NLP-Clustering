Two extensions have been offered to people who missed Tuesday's deadline for enrolling in new health insurance plans for next year.

Shoppers have been offered a two-day extension to enroll in plans that take effect New Year's Day - allowing them to sign up for coverage until 11:59 p.m. Thursday.

Another extension was offered to people whose health insurance carriers went out of business this year, or whose plans will not be offered in 2016.

Those shoppers - which include former policyholders with ColoradoHealthOP and Access Health Colorado - have until Dec. 31 to purchase a plan taking effect Jan. 1. Some Rocky Mountain Health Plans are eligible for the special enrollment period.

The extensions only apply to people seeking coverage that begins on New Year's Day. Shoppers can still purchase plans for next year through Jan. 31, however that coverage will begin later in 2016.

The two-day extension came amid a heavy rush of shoppers to Colorado's exchange, which was established in light of the Affordable Care Act as a one-stop marketplace to purchase health insurance plans. It is the only place for Coloradans to receive federal tax credits that reduce monthly insurance premiums.

On Wednesday, Connect for Health Colorado announced that slightly more than 116,000 people had enrolled in plans through the exchange. That included people who had coverage in 2015 and who were automatically re-enrolled in plans.

People who go without health insurance in 2016 will face a much larger tax penalty than in 2015 - $695 per adult ($347.50 per child younger than 18) or 2.5 percent of a person's yearly household income, whichever is greater. Several different exemptions are available.
