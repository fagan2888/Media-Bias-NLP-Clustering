As a result, the federal background check system, known as the NCIS, has significant gaps on people disqualified from owning guns because of mental illnesses.\n\nNew rules issued Monday by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are intended to make it clear that legal authorities can pass along mental health records that could be valuable in a background check.\n\nThe rules from the Obama administration, to be published Tuesday, clarify that only limited information about the patient is shared \u2013 only a person\u2019s name and the entity that made the ruling.\n\n\u201cUnderlying diagnoses, treatment records, and other identifiable health information are not provided to or maintained by the NICS,\u201d the rule reads.\n\nUnder the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution or found \u201cnot guilty\u201d in court by reason of insanity cannot purchase firearms. Every licensed firearms dealer is required to perform a background check of each buyer to determine whether they\u2019re eligible for the purchase.\n\nThose checks are intended to keep out any person who has a history of severe mental illness as judged by a court. The system, however, has been much-criticized for its record-keeping.\n\nOnly two-thirds of states require mandatory reporting of mental health records, in part because people have raised concerns about privacy.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The rules are intended to make it easier to pass on records.", "description": "The rules are intended to make it easier to pass on records.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The rules are intended to make it easier to pass on records.", "title": "Rules eased on providing mental health records for background checks", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/264712-obama-administration-tackles-privacy-concerns-with-gun-background-checks", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/berdooguns120515getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/264712-obama-administration-tackles-privacy-concerns-with-gun-background-checks", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-04T17:16-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-04T17:16:05-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/264712-obama-administration-tackles-privacy-concerns-with-gun-background-checks", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The rules are intended to make it easier to pass on records.", "card": "summary", "title": "Rules eased on providing mental health records for background checks"}, "dcterms.title": "Rules eased on providing mental health records for background checks"}, "article_summary": "Only two-thirds of states require mandatory reporting of mental health records, in part because people have raised concerns about privacy.\nThe Obama administration is seeking to make it easier for people to pass along mental health records for people legally banned from owning a firearm.\nNew rules issued Monday by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are intended to make it clear that legal authorities can pass along mental health records that could be valuable in a background check.\nSome health providers, courts and state officials have been hesitant to share records because of strict privacy laws.\nAs a result, the federal background check system, known as the NCIS, has significant gaps on people disqualified from owning guns because of mental illnesses."}
