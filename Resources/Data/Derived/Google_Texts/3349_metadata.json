A service officer will be available to help regarding VA disability benefits and other issues.\n\n\"We have a lot of information that we need to get out to our veterans that because they don\u2019t come to the post meetings, they\u2019re not getting,\" said post commander Timothy Welker, who hosts a monthly meeting featuring speakers on topics ranging from the Affordable Health Care Act to assisted living at its hall on 46146 Cass Ave. in Utica. \"It's gotten to the point where we're fighting to survive.\"\n\nJohn Knox, a past state commander, explained that Post 351 has declined in membership from a peak of about 795 to 315 largely due to the passing of World War II veterans in recent years. Declines have affected membership to the point where printing a regular newsletter is no longer a viable option, he said.\n\nHow to help\n\nThere is reason for optimism. Knox estimates that in the area, there lives about 1,000 veterans who are not yet involved with the legion, which is the nation's largest wartime veterans service organization. In addition to the open house in October, there are two more outreach events scheduled this year:\n\nThe post will hold its annual steak dinner on Saturday, Sept. 21, from 5:30 to 8 p.m. It features steaks grilled to order, corn on the cob and potatoes. Tickets are $11 for adults and if you purchase your ticket in advance you will receive a free raffle ticket. Call (586) 731-9833 or (586) 801-0081 for more information.\n\nA craft and vendor show is scheduled for Dec. 7 at the post from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The event is being held to raise money and items to support deployed troops. Santa will be there for photo opportunities and there will be materials available for anyone to make a Christmas card for the military members who will be overseas for the holidays. Each crafter and vendor will also be donating a phone card to send with the packages so the deployed troops can reach out to their families for the holidays. It is open to the public and will feature local crafters with handmade products like jewelry, soaps, wire creations and lots of local food products, and vendors such as Avon, 31 Gifts, Tupperware, Paparazzi Jewelry, Origami Owl, Tastefully Simple, Pampered Chef, Partylite and Pure Romance.\n\nFabric of the community\n\nPost 351 also sponsors the Utica Wiley Elementary Cub Scout troop and hosts flag retirement ceremonies twice annually. The post is home to the Macomb County Marine Corps League veterans group and the Utica Lions Club. Various other charities use the hall for their community fundraisers.\n\nHowever, in the age of social media, Knox said, younger veterans tend to stay away from leaving the home to network and find information. He's hopeful, but confident that that trend will reverse it.\n\n\"We've never done it before at this post, but we've done it at many posts in the state,\" he said. \"If there's a need in the community as there is here, we'll be able to bring it back.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Shelby-Utica, MI Patch", "description": "The post is working to boost its sagging membership by targeting area veterans who are not already involved with guidance.", "title": "American Legion Post 351 in Utica 'Fighting to Survive'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.patch.com/users/127244/2013/09/T800x600/7e1dba5718d444fdd235dc4fb379b3c.jpg", "url": "http://patch.com/michigan/shelby-utica/american-legion-post-351-in-utica-fighting-to-survive", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": 116541048368485, "section": "Community Corner", "published_time": "2013-09-15T22:06:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-15T22:06:31-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521361477908471}, "description": "Shelby-Utica, MI - The post is working to boost its sagging membership by targeting area veterans who are not already involved with guidance.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e54\"", "article_summary": "To fight a rapid decline in membership in recent years, the veterans of the Utica/Shelby American Legion Post 351 are working with the legion's state-level Post Revitalization Team to help it stay open.\nThe post is working to boost its sagging membership by targeting area veterans who are not already involved with guidance.\nThe post is home to the Macomb County Marine Corps League veterans group and the Utica Lions Club.\nFabric of the communityPost 351 also sponsors the Utica Wiley Elementary Cub Scout troop and hosts flag retirement ceremonies twice annually.\n\"We've never done it before at this post, but we've done it at many posts in the state,\" he said."}
