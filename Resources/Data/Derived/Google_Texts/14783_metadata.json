Pat Quinn (and his spokespeople) are apparently just about all the state government Illinois needs.\n\nIn the grasp of a \u201cpolar vortex,\u201d Illinois closed state government offices and told all non-essential government workers to stay home.\n\n\u201cWe said to all of those in critical response, \u2018You gotta be here,\u2019\u201d Quinn said at an apparently critical news conference in Chicago on Monday. \u201cMy job is to be here when people really need our help\u2026I think it\u2019s important that our government be here when people need us.\u201d\n\nBut that begs the question, who is a non-essential government worker?\n\nThousands of people who answer phones in the massive state bureaucracy were told to stay home. Same with the folks who sell license plates and the people who run Illinois\u2019 universities. Even the folks implementing Obamacare got a day off because they are not needed.\n\nThe danger from the winter storm that has frozen the United States is real. Illinois\u2019 Department of Transportation spent the weekend plowing miles of interstates. The Illinois National Guard was deployed to help stranded drivers and the Illinois State Police have been trying to help keep the roads safe and clear.\n\nThe cost for that, Quinn said, will not be known for a while. Though the governor doesn\u2019t sound as if he cares.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t scrimp when it comes to public safety,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cIn the end we will calculate it. \u201c\n\nSchools across the state canceled classes (more for a fear of the cold wait at the bus stop than anything else), and cities and counties also closed their doors.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Illinois closes state government for non-essential workers in wake of winter storm, but who is essential in government work?", "title": "Winter storm proves Illinois has plenty of 'non-essential' government workers - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/01/closed.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-06T15:58:39+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/122476/winter-storm-proves-illinois-plenty-non-essential-government-workers/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Illinois", "tag": "closed,Gov.
