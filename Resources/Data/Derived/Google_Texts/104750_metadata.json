Swearinger talks too much. He is too cocky. His confidence doesn\u2019t match his resume. All were among the Broncos\u2019 complaints about the Houston Texans\u2019 loquacious defensive back last week.\n\nWhen it comes to assessing fines, the NFL doesn\u2019t calculate popularity. Swearinger was not fined for the hit that left Wes Welker concussed last Saturday, an NFL source told the Post. Peyton Manning was docked $8,268 \u2014 his first league fine \u2014 for taunting Swearinger after completing a touchdown pass.\n\nTexans coach Bill O\u2019Brien and Swearinger both felt the defensive back did not merit additional discipline. He was penalized 15 yards for unnecessary roughness for a shoulder/forearm shiver hit into a ducking Welker after the receiver caught a 9-yard pass in the second quarter.\n\nWelker exited with his third concussion in 10 months, and while he\u2019s jogging and running routes, he has not been cleared to participate in a game. Swearinger\u2019s actions during last week\u2019s joint practices and smashing hit on Welker shoved Manning over the edge.\n\nThe next play after Welker\u2019s catch, Manning lofted a touchdown pass to a diving Emmanuel Sanders. Rather than greet Sanders, Manning confronted Swearinger and cursed at him.\n\n\u201cI made a Hall of Famer mad,\u201d Swearinger said.\n\nTroy E.
