A user poll on the popular travel website TripAdvisor this summer ranked this beach city’s Super Scoops the third best ice cream parlor in the United States.

Since Isle of Capri residents Monty and Diane Null opened the shop five years ago at 11025 Gulf Blvd., they have earned praise from customers from around the globe, many of whom put tacks on a giant map of the world inside the business. “We have every country except one in the world represented with at least one tack,” Monty Null said.

The shop stocks 40 varieties of ice cream from St. Petersburg-based Working Cow Homemade Ice Cream — in regular, soft serve and Italian ice. One of the ways they’ve gained local loyalty from younger customers is by offering free ice cream to young students who bring in report cards with As and Bs.

The TripAdvisor ranking came as a surprise.

“We didn’t even know there was a contest going on,” Monty Null said.
