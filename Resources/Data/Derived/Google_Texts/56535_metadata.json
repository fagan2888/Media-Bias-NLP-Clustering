(Nasdaq: NEWS).\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, funds managed by Franklin Square have committed to purchase $300 million in 10-year 8.25 percent subordinated notes and warrants for up to 12 million shares of common stock. Boston-based NewStar expects to use proceeds from the transaction to increase origination volume and facilitate asset growth.\n\nThe Franklin Square funds are sub-advised by GSO Capital Partners, the credit division of Blackstone (NYSE: BX).
