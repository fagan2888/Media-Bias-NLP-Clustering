Check out the video below!\n\nAs Gossip Cop has reported, Trump announced he was running for president in June. He\u2019s since become one of the most outspoken and controversial candidates on both sides of the political aisle. While seven \u201cbottom-tier\u201d candidates had their own debate on Thursday afternoon, in which many ripped Trump, he had to share the spotlight with nine others for the primetime debate at Cleveland\u2019s Quicken Loan Arena.\n\nDonald Trump got booed right off the bat when he was the only candidate to say he\u2019d couldn\u2019t guarantee he would support another nominee and not run independently should he not get the nomination. The first question just to Trump was about his history of degrading comments about women, and he shot back, \u201cOnly Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\u201d Asked about being part of the \u201cwar on women,\u201d Trump said, \u201cPart of the big problem this country has is being politically correct.\u201d He went on to insult moderator Megyn Kelly, and said he would not apologize for not being more careful with his words.\n\nThe next question to Trump was about his infamous comments about Mexican immigrants, and he responded, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for me, you wouldn\u2019t even be talking about illegal immigration.\u201d Put on the spot to share \u201cspecific evident\u201d that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border, Trump cited his own conversations with border patrol, and blamed the \u201cstupid leaders\u201d of the United States for allowing it to happen.\n\nTrump was the first to be asked about Obamacare, and he reiterated his stance that it\u2019s a \u201ccomplete disaster.\u201d He was next confronted about previously supporting liberal policies and candidates, which he used to as an opportunity to slam Hillary Clinton. And that was all in the first half of the two-hour debate.\n\nIn regards to the economy, Trump was asked why he should be trusted given the bankruptcies he\u2019s had with his businesses, which he tried to spin as wisely using America\u2019s laws. He went on to point out that he personally hasn\u2019t been bankrupt, and once again touted how he\u2019s supposedly worth more than $9 billion. Later, Kelly asked Trump point-blank when he actually became a Republican.\n\nThe mogul responded by saying he\u2019s \u201cevolved\u201d on issues over the years, just like Ronald Reagan. When Jeb Bush denied calling Trump a \u201cbuffoon\u201d and \u201casshole,\u201d based on a report released earlier Thursday, Trump actually thanked him. Interestingly, Trump later said he doesn\u2019t want to call President Obama \u201cincompetent\u201d because that\u2019s \u201cnot nice.\u201d\n\nIn his closing statement, which he was the last to give, Trump said, \u201cOur country is in serious trouble. We don\u2019t win anymore. We don\u2019t beat China in trade. We don\u2019t beat Japan with their millions and millions of cars coming into the country in trade. We can\u2019t beat Mexico at the border. We can\u2019t do anything right. Our military has to be strengthened. Our vets have to be taken care of. We have to end Obamacare, and we have to make our country great again, and I will do that.\u201d\n\nCheck out video of Trump highlights, including the O\u2019Donnell jab, below.
