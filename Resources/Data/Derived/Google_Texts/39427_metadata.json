The folks who brought us healthcare.gov cannot seem to keep the site from freezing up and shunting people seeking insurance coverage to a virtual waiting room with no doors. Meanwhile, the cyber-spies at the NSA are apparently smart enough to break into the telephones and electronic communications of every head of state from Berlin to Rio.\n\nWhy does one set of government techies seem as smart as Q, James Bond\u2019s gadgets guy, and another set seem as knuckle-headed as Dwight Schrute on \u201cThe Office\u201d? Associated Press science writer Seth Borenstein may have found the answer.\n\n\u201cThe same government that reportedly intercepted the communications of America's leading consumer technology firms, Google and Yahoo, without leaving a trace is scorned because it can't build a working federal website for health insurance,\u201d Borenstein writes. The fallacy, he says, is to equate the two jobs. Hacking is one thing, building a website is quite another. Both are complex, but one is just a lot more fun.\n\nThe fun job is with the NSA. The spy agency is working with a nearly bottomless budget and high-tech specialists who are the best in the business. The NSA gets the best because the work is engaging and exotic. Website construction? Not so much.\n\n\"Breaking in, it feels like special ops,\" Chris Wysopal, a former hacker, told Borenstein. \"Building something feels probably like you're in the Corps of Engineers. You're just moving a lot of dirt around.\"\n\nThose dirt movers working on the Obamacare site are simply not the same caliber as the whiz kids at the NSA. That\u2019s why the federal government has had a devil of a time getting you signed up for a health plan that you want, but can keep a file of every phone call you make and every message you send, even if you would rather they didn\u2019t.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Maybe NSA spies could save the Obamacare website", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Exclusive", "author": "Los Angeles Times Exclusive", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "If we could get National Security Agency hackers to go to work on the Obamacare website, healthcare for every American would be delivered before Christmas.", "title": "Maybe NSA spies could save the Obamacare website", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-nsa-spies-save-website-20131031-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-52733eef/turbine/la-na-tt-nsa-spies-save-website-20131031", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "National Security Agency, hackers, Obamacare", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/78009211", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2013-11-01", "Description": "If we could get National Security Agency hackers to work on the Obamacare website, healthcare would be delivered before Christmas.", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "National Security Agency, hackers, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5a0\"", "article_summary": "Those dirt movers working on the Obamacare site are simply not the same caliber as the whiz kids at the NSA.\nIf we could get National Security Agency hackers to go to work on the Obamacare website, healthcare for every American would be delivered before Christmas.\nMeanwhile, the cyber-spies at the NSA are apparently smart enough to break into the telephones and electronic communications of every head of state from Berlin to Rio.\nThe NSA gets the best because the work is engaging and exotic.\nThe spy agency is working with a nearly bottomless budget and high-tech specialists who are the best in the business."}
