Nobilette, Life News\n\nIt only took 13 seasons, but \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d finally has its first openly gay contestant.\n\nOn Wednesday\u2019s show, before saying whether she was going to become one of the show\u2019s top 15 females, Jennifer Lopez circuitously told 20-year-old M.K. Nobilette, \u201cYou\u2019re not the typical American Idol.\u201d Harry Connick Jr. added, \u201cDo you fit in, do you not fit in?\u201d And Nobilette looked at them and point-blank told the judges what they\u2019d been hemming and hawing about. \u201cI\u2019m very obviously gay,\u201d she said, \u201cand there are always gonna be people in America and everywhere else who will definitely hate me. But I think that in the last two years there have been a lot of things that have really changed that, and have made it a positive thing.\u201d \u201cThank goodness,\u201d Connick Jr. replied, before sending her through to the next round.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the venerable talent competition has lacked for gay contestants over the years. Season 1 runner-up and current North Carolina congressional candidate Clay Aiken is an outspoken advocate for LGBT rights \u2013 but he didn\u2019t come out until five years after his \u201cIdol\u201d near-victory. And his fellow Season 1 competitor Jim Verraros had kept a public online journal in which he wrote about being gay \u2013 until Fox, concerned his orientation might sway voters, asked him to remove it during the season\u2019s run. He came out after the Season 1 Idols tour. Season 8 runner-up Adam Lambert played coy about his sexuality all through his run \u2013 and courted controversy over whether America was ready for such a \u201ctheatrical\u201d contender, but didn\u2019t confirm he was gay until his season was over. Season 9 contender Crystal Bowersox likewise came out as bisexual only after her run ended.\n\nSince then, the show, especially in its early, competitor rich-episodes, has featured plenty of contestants who aren\u2019t making an effort to play it straight. Last week, Keith London belted out \u201cIf I Were a Boy\u201d and tweeted afterward, \u201cWait, did I just basically come out on National TV? Oh well cats out of the bag!\u201d (He was eliminated this week.) And current still-in-the-running competitor, the self-described \u201cextremely fierce\u201d Emmanuel Zidor, has posted online about his desire for a boyfriend.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"American Idol\" gets its first openly gay contestant -- finally", "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"American Idol\" gets its first openly gay contestant -- finally", "title": "An \u201cIdol\u201d comes out", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/13/an_idol_comes_out/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/mk_nobilette.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"American Idol\" gets its first openly gay contestant -- finally", "creator": "@embeedub", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/mk_nobilette.jpg", "title": "An \u201cIdol\u201d comes out", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "An \u201cIdol\u201d comes out", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Adam Lambert, American Idol, clay aiken, Crystal Bowersox, LGBT, M.K.
