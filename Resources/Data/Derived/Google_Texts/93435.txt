Pierre, SD

Attorney General Marty Jackley says a dangerous synthetic drug that's become popular with young people is surfacing on the state's college campuses.



Jackley confirmed this week that the drug known as 25i or NBOMe is being sold in South Dakota.



The drug has been used nationwide for a few years and has been blamed for the death of several young people since 2012. It's among a series of synthetics made to mimic the effects of illegal drugs.



Jackley says the drug comes in many forms, including as a powder or liquid. It has similar effects to LSD and can cause hallucinations, disorientation and violent behavior.



Jackley says under South Dakota law it's a felony to possess, distribute, or manufacture synthetic drugs that have similar characteristics and properties as controlled substances.
