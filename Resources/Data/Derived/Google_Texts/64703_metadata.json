Back then physicians enjoyed the upper hand, selling their practices for as much as 10 times what a practice it was actually worth, in some cases. The outlay was based to a large extent on goodwill value\u2014the reputation the practice enjoyed with patients. This intangible asset seemed to promise hospitals a steady income for the foreseeable future.\n\nUnfortunately, the economics didn\u2019t pan out as hoped, and acquisition prices swooned. \u201cThe first go-round went bust, and most of those doctors were spun off and went away,\u201d recalls David J. Cooke, former CFO at Park Nicollet Health Services, a healthcare delivery system comprised of two hospitals and a 650-group medical practice in Minneapolis, with annual revenues of approximately $1 billion. \u201cNow there are different dynamics at play. Hospitals want to buy only hard assets now, not accounts receivables or goodwill.\u201d\n\nCooke, who recently left Park Nicollet to become CFO at New Orleans-based LSU Medical Center, explains that hospitals are no longer snapping up physician practices for their intangible assets. \u201cThis is not about increasing (the number of patients), as much as decreasing patient admissions and length of stay, avoiding re-admits, and finding other means than surgery to care for them,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the old days, it was all about the physician doing things to maximize the returns in his or her practice, which was in alignment with what the hospital wanted then. Now, the economics have changed.\u201d\n\nAlignment in the New Era\n\nToday, finance has a different objective when it comes to acquiring a private practice. William McCauley, MD, president and CEO of Susquehanna Health Medical Group, points out that in the past Susquehanna required financial and productivity records, tax and income statements, and volume statistics as the premier analytical tools when evaluating private practices for employment acquisition. Today, the focus is not nearly as sharp on these factors.\n\n\u201cThe old business model mirrored how a typical small business would run, with a profit/loss statement at the end of the day to show their value,\u201d Dr. McCauley explains. \u201cNowadays, the business information about a practice is just one small piece of the puzzle and does not reflect the new definition of `value\u2019 at all.\u201d\n\nRather, to be successful as a healthcare organization, a hospital must acquire physician practices able to work in a world that is essentially foreign to what they are used to. \u201cThe `new normal\u2019 is based on value, outcomes and patient satisfaction,\u201d Dr. McCauley says. \u201cGone are the days where the financial bottom line tells the story. Instead, our new healthcare environment requires consistent, positive outcomes with well managed expectations throughout the continuum of care. \u2026 Our job is to be the vehicle carrying the support resources to ensure the practitioners can be successful in this new world.\u201d\n\n[See also: Reforecast: The end of the budget.]\n\nWhen conferring with a practice on the block, Susquehanna Health emphasizes its culture, stewardship and care teams supporting patients. It points out that from a compensation standpoint, physicians are valued on patient satisfaction scores and how well they manage diseases in the outpatient setting, rather than how many inpatient hospital admissions are credited to their name.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve changed our compensation model to reward physicians\u2019 leadership and participation in a culture that fosters positive outcomes and healthcare management for our population,\u201d says Melissa Davis, Susquehanna Health vice president and Chief Operating Officer. \u201cIf our patients are satisfied, receive good care, and require less significant medical intervention, the payers will reward them with high quality scores and accolades for being efficient and effective.\u201d\n\nThis, in turn, guides greater compensation, as opposed to the old model of rewarding physicians for volume alone. \u201cOur practitioners actually welcome the new model, as they prefer to be graded on value and good, clinical outcomes, rather than production line numbers that don\u2019t have a face or a name,\u201d she says.\n\nCooke confirms this model, noting that it is not unusual to see physician compensation tied to RVU production after a one or two-year guarantee. An RVU or Relative Value Unit is a metric assigned to a CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) code describing medical, surgical and diagnostic services. Medicare pays physicians for services based on the CPT code. \u201cIt is more common today to see bonuses for achieving certain quality outcomes or patient satisfaction measures,\u201d he says. \u201cThe new rules are productivity related to patient outcomes and quality care.\u201d\n\nNew Rules\n\nObviously, these changes have import for physicians selling their practices. \u201cSuccessful integration between the hospital and the practice requires tough discussions pre-acquisition,\u201d says Cooke. \u201cFor instance, the practice owner will be told he or she must now refer their patients to a specific set of specialists, which likely won\u2019t be the specialists they referred their patients to in past. They will need to participate in the hospital\u2019s readmission avoidance programs, and expand their hours to accommodate same day appointments.\u201d\n\nThis is the price of acquisition for many hospitals and not just Park Nicollet, he notes.\n\nThis helps explain why so few hospitals are interested in partial practice ownership, given the focus on patient care and related physician productivity. MD Anderson Center at the University of Texas in Houston, for instance, favors a total physician practice ownership model, rather than partial alignment with practice owners. \u201cWe have our own physician practices (set aside) as a separate entity, where we can watch their income statements, in terms of the practice\u2019s plans and the financials behind them,\u201d says Juan C. Castro, associated vice president, financial planning and analysis.\n\nNot that this silo treatment is without challenge. \u201cWe need to make sure the doctors generate the revenue we expect from them to hit the bottom line,\u201d Castro explains. \u201cIf they say they will be 60 percent clinical and 40 percent research-oriented (MD Anderson is an academic medical center), and then those percentages are switched, it doesn\u2019t help us do what we need to do, economically.\u201d\n\nBy managing the practices together through the separate entity, greater accountability can be applied. \u201cIf a doctor\u2019s practice is plastic surgery and he or she says they\u2019re 60-40, clinical versus research, we need good operating metrics behind that 60 percent,\u201d Castro says. \u201cWe need to see how many surgery cases the practice has, how many patients, and the RVUs.\u201d\n\nWhile every hospital\u2019s billing system is tied to the CPT codes, the problem is the definition behind the 60 percent clinical work, \u201cwhat constitutes it,\u201d Castro says. \u201cIt needs to be documented and benchmarked, which is difficult. And when it is discerned that the physician is not hitting the numbers, management must step in and hold them accountable.\u201d This might lead to disciplinary actions like termination or probation, he adds.\n\nObviously, they heyday of physician practices striking gold is long gone. Selling the practice to a hospital or achieving some form of partial alignment are fraught with difficulties. For physicians at the threshold of their vocations, employment by a hospital, as Cooke pointed out, is increasingly the more viable career path.\n\n\u201cThe private practice in most markets is numbered, although there are some pockets where this is not true,\u201d he says. \u201cIn small to medium-size communities, the independent practice has pretty much disappeared.\u201d\n\nAnd with this change, another slice of American enters the history books.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/reforecast-new-business-models-hospitals-buying-medical-practices", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "To be successful, a hospital must acquire physician practices able to work in a world that is essentially foreign to what they are used to.
