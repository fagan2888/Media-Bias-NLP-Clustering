It was the morning of June 8th, 1998, when a massive explosion ripped through the DeBruce grain elevator near Haysville. Emergency workers who were first on the scene knew they were going to be there a long time.

Some workers went to the roof in an effort to be rescued, but authorities weren't sure how many people were inside.

Emergency workers had to figure out how to get from one area of the elevator to another. In the end, seven men died in the explosion, ten more were hurt. It would take six weeks to recover all of the bodies.

An investigation determined grain dust inside the elevator ignited, causing the explosion.
