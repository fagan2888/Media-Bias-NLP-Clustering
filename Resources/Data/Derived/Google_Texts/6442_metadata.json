How did we find ourselves in this very same space?'\u201d\n\nFrancois said the sentiment behind the sign comes from her days as a student at Florida State University when she protested the death of Martin Lee Anderson, a 14-year-old who died after being beaten by boot camp personnel. After months of silence from authorities over his death, Francois, along with other students from Tallahassee Community College, Florida A&M University and Florida State University staged a 34-hour sit-in at then-governor Jeb Bush\u2019s office in Tallahassee.\n\nShe took to Twitter to explain her feelings further: \u201cA feeling of rage and powerlessness gripped us in Tallahassee, and students and citizens marched into the streets, and sat down. We shut down the busiest street in Tallahassee with dozens of students linking hands and forming a circle. The police came and the black police chief soon followed. He said to me, \u2018I understand how you guys feel. I\u2019m going to LET YOU do this.\u2019 He didn\u2019t realize we were ready then for whatever they had planned; we\u2019d been preparing for jail, dogs, anything for over a year. He could not have stopped our civil disobedience even if he had tried.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Frances Francois never expected her profane sign at a rally in Tallahassee to go viral.
