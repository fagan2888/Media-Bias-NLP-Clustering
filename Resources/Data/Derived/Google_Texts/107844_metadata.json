And then some insurers did not price their plans accordingly. And now they\u2019re finding out that more people are using services than they bargained for.\u201d\n\nPeople receiving health care from Premera Blue Cross or LifeWise through Medicaid will not be affected by the companies leaving Chelan, Douglas and Kittitas counties.\n\nIn Washington overall, insurance providers are seeking to boost premiums an average 13.5 percent because of rising costs. The state hasn\u2019t decided whether to grant the requests.\n\nThe issue has been addressed on the political front by Republicans. Four Washington GOP Congress members \u2013 Representatives Dan Newhouse, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Dave Reichert and Janie Herrera Beutler \u2013 sent a letter to Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler expressing concern over the loss of Premera Blue Cross and LifeWise.\n\nThe lawmakers also linked the Affordable Care Act to rising costs and reduced insurance options. Kreidler, a Democrat, responded that more companies are doing business in the state under the act, also known as Obamacare, than before. He also said health care costs were increasing by double digits every year before Washington implemented its exchange under the act.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KPQ", "description": "The state Insurance Commissioner\u2019s disappointed, but not surprised over a reduction in health care options in central Washington.
