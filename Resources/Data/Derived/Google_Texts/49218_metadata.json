They carried a simple message \u2014 Let\u2019s make history. One more time. \u2014 that balanced the prospects of the team\u2019s current playoff push with the specter of what it had once accomplished.\n\nFollowing this season, the Islanders will move roughly 30 miles west to Barclays Center and abandon the facility they\u2019ve called home since their inception in 1972. Several proposals have been made over the years to overhaul the building, which is adjacent to Hofstra University, but all have failed.\n\nThus, whether it\u2019s Wednesday, when the teams play Game 4 of their series, or some future date, an arena that hosted four consecutive Stanley Cup-winning teams, from 1980 through 1983, will bid adieu to its beloved tenant and await its next use.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some tremendous games here this year, the atmosphere,\u201d Capitals coach Barry Trotz said on Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s something to be said about the older buildings. You see it in every sport. You see it at Wrigley Field, at Fenway. You see it at all these places. \u2026 They have that good feel.\u201d\n\nThe accommodations are cramped and the d\u00e9cor is dated, but the building\u2019s cozy interior makes for an intricate fan experience. It was constructed without interior columns or supports \u2014 a rarity at the time that allowed patrons to witness the action unobstructed \u2014 and is built into the ground, meaning the arena rises only 75 feet above the surface of the surrounding parking lots.\n\nOnly Madison Square Garden, which recently underwent a $1 billion renovation, is older than Nassau Coliseum among arenas hosting an NHL team. Edmonton\u2019s Rexall Place, originally known as Northlands Coliseum, is the third-oldest arena and opened in 1974.\n\nDefensemen Matt Niskanen and Brooks Orpik are the only two players on the Capitals who have played in a postseason game at the arena. They both played for the Pittsburgh Penguins, who defeated the Islanders in six games in the teams\u2019 first-round playoff series two years ago.\n\n\u201cThey hadn\u2019t been to the playoffs in some time,\u201d Niskanen said. \u201cExciting, new young team, you know? That was good. That was a really fun atmosphere \u2014 the best I\u2019ve seen. The best I\u2019ve played in. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been fun other places, but it\u2019s the best I\u2019ve played in.\n\n\u201cNow, with the situation here, with it potentially the last series or, for sure, the last spring for these guys in this building, it\u2019s going to be good.\u201d\n\nThe Islanders won 25 of their 41 home games this season, nearly doubling their win total at Nassau Coliseum from a year ago. They have markedly improved \u2014 a year after finishing with the fifth-fewest points in the standings in the league, the Islanders cracked the 100-point mark this season \u2014 but coach Jack Capuano credited the improvement at home in part to the crowds that have showed up to say goodbye to their beloved team.\n\n\u201cNo matter what building you\u2019re at, when you get to play at home, obviously, it\u2019s an exciting time \u2014 not only for the players, but for the fans,\u201d Capuano said. \u201cWe\u2019ve fed off this crowd all year. I think our home record\u2019s improved. We\u2019ve done a good job. Like I said, we could have won a few more games here, but it\u2019s a big reason why we have the home record we have.\u201d\n\nBarclays Center wasn\u2019t constructed with hockey in mind, and will need to undergo a bit of a facelift to comfortably fit a sheet of ice and other requisite features before the Islanders can use it next year. The team has signed a 25-year lease with the arena, and despite the location \u2014 though technically still on Long Island \u2014 will keep its nickname and colors.\n\nWhat players and coaches will experience then is virtually certain to be completely different from what they have now. The home dressing room is cramped and outdated, and the Islanders logo at both ends of the carpet is so worn that the colors have started to bleed together.\n\nStill, passion runs deep at Nassau Coliseum, which is why the atmosphere during Game 3 will likely be unlike anything either team has experienced in a long time.\n\n\u201cI think all year, we\u2019ve had an understanding of what this season has meant to everybody, but it\u2019s important we just try to focus on tomorrow\u2019s game,\u201d Islanders center John Tavares said Saturday. \u201cWe want to win this series and we want to compete for the Cup and we want to go as far as we can, and I think that goes hand-in-hand. This is just part of the process, part of the journey, and this is a fun time of the year, so we\u2019ll be looking forward to tomorrow\u2019s game.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Following this season, the Islanders will move roughly 30 miles west to Barclays Center and abandon the facility they've called home since their inception in 1972.
