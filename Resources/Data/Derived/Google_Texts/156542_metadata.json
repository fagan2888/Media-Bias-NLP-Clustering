The latter means they can easily be adapted to meet the changing needs of residents as they get older.\n\nMichael Farr, executive director of property and development with Isos, added: \u201cThe UK is simply not building enough homes for those in need, so it's our responsibility to deliver as many new properties as possible to help tackle the shortage.\n\n\u201cIn Rural Housing Week, it\u2019s important to remember the vital role that developments like this one in Belford play in keeping villages alive.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, Isos has delivered schemes like this one across Northumberland \u2013 in villages like Falstone, Lesbury, Beadnell and Chatton.\n\n\u201cThey can be the difference between families being able to stay in their communities, and being obliged to move away to find a home they can afford.\n\n\u201cWe are operating region wide in both rural and urban communities and would welcome approaches from anyone who has a site where we could build new homes in order to support a healthy pipeline of new projects and bolster our development programme.\u201d\n\nIsos supports both Rural Housing Week, and the National Housing Federation\u2019s \u2018Yes to Homes\u2019 campaign, calling for grassroots support to build \u2018the right homes, in the right places, at the right price.\u2019", "article_metadata": {"DC.language": "en-GB", "DC.identifier": "http://www.24dash.com/news/housing/2014-07-04-New-affordable-housing-development-for-rural-Northumberland", "description": "A new \u00a3550,000 \u2018affordable\u2019 property development has just been completed in north Northumberland, happily coinciding with the National Housing Federation\u2019s Rural Housing Week.\r\nAlongside main contractor NB Clark, social landlo...", "title": "New \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcaffordable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 housing development for rural Northumberland", "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.publisher": "24dash.com", "displayDate": "Friday, July 4, 2014", "channel": "News", "DC.date.created": "2014-07-04", "DC.title": "New \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcaffordable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 housing development for rural Northumberland", "thumbnail": "http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/24dash-media/image/2014/07/04/55864/580_Image_1._Belford_Lindsay_view.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "PublicationDate": "2014-07-04"}, "article_summary": "New \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcaffordable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 housing development for rural NorthumberlandPublished by Anonymous for 24dash.com in Housing and also in Communities, DevelopmentFriday 4th July 2014 - 9:23amNew \u2018affordable\u2019 housing development for rural NorthumberlandA new \u00a3550,000 \u2018affordable\u2019 property development has just been completed in north Northumberland, happily coinciding with the National Housing Federation\u2019s Rural Housing Week.\n\u201cIn Rural Housing Week, it\u2019s important to remember the vital role that developments like this one in Belford play in keeping villages alive.\nIsos says the scheme highlights the situation faced by many in rural Northumberland who face having to leave their home area due to \u201cexorbitant housing costs\u201d \u2013 eight or nine times the average wage.\nVince Walsh, development and regeneration manager with Isos, said: \u201cThese are our first homes in the village of Belford and demonstrate our commitment to providing social housing in rural areas.\nAccording to Isos, Belford is a beautiful rural village but quite isolated, being 16 miles from both Berwick and Alnwick, the nearest towns, and nearly 50 miles from Newcastle, the nearest city."}
