Photo: Graham Tidy\n\nFormer federal Liberal Party leader John Hewson has hit out at Joe Hockey for criticising wind farms, saying the Treasurer should drive past a coal-fired power station and have \u201ca bit of a smell\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe may not personally like the look of them but it's bigger than him, this issue, it\u2019s bigger than any generation of politicians today,\u201d Dr Hewson said on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI can't imagine Joe hockey driving past a dirty old coal-fired power station and thinking that\u2019s a good look, with the guts spewing out into the air and polluting the atmosphere and not recognising the broader damage they do.\n\n\u201cI suggest he drives by a couple of those old ones and has a bit of a smell and a bit of a look and come back and say this is pretty good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Hewson also took issue with NSW Coalition MPs in areas near the ACT who oppose the Gallagher government\u2019s plan to give 20-year government-backed contracts to developers of wind farms whose projects have been stalled by uncertainty.\n\n\u201cI think where you have obvious locations as there are around here [Canberra] for wind farms to be located and they can make a significant contribution to the power load, I think we should have an objective assessment of what they are and what contribution they can make,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Hewson was at Parliament House for a \u201cstop the dinosaurs\u201d campaign urging Parliament to save the carbon tax and renewable energy laws.\n\n\u201cBut the laws are now under threat. If the dinosaurs of politics and business win, we all lose,\u201d the campaign slogan says.\n\nTwo life-sized dinosaur puppets, appearing as props for the launch, managed to scare small children with their growls.\n\nJohn Connor, CEO of the Climate Institute, said the laws were working and the energy system was becoming cleaner.\n\n\u201cWe are launching this stop the dinosaurs campaign as a last-ditch plea to parliamentarians,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018There are dinosaurs in politics and business who want to hold back progress, who actually want to take us back to when big polluters could pollute for free.\u201d\n\nThe Senate has already rejected the carbon tax repeal once. The government will re-introduce legislation to \u00adrepeal the carbon tax on Monday. It will pass the House of Representatives and will be ready for the new Senate on July 1.\n\nDr Hewson declined to include Prime Minister Tony Abbott as one of the dinosaurs.\n\nHe said the repeal was the most important issue ever to go before federal Parliament.\n\n\u2018\u2018We can\u2019t afford as a nation to get this wrong,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe called for a Senate inquiry into options to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a mature debate about the science,\u201d he said.\n\nIn May Mr Hockey launched an unprompted attack on wind farms near Lake George, just outside the ACT, saying he found them \u201cutterly offensive\u201d and \u201ca blight on the landscape\u201d.\n\n\u201cI drive to Canberra to go to Parliament \u2026 and I must say I find those wind turbines around Lake George to be utterly offensive,\u201d he said then.\n\nDr Hewson said he recently visited the Acciona wind farm near Gunning.\n\n\u201cThe landowner said not only has it made a significant difference to the viability of his farm but it had made a difference to the broader community,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think that's the sort of sentiment that we've got to have [but] we have the old syndrome in this country, not by my backyard, NIMBY.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of money invested in wind over the last 10 years in this country since the renewable energy target was launched.\n\n\u201cI think they are quite ingenious really, and produce relatively cheap power and that's the trend of the future.\n\n\u201cI think the price of electricity generated by wind is now lower than it is from coal-fired power plants.\n\n\u201c[Mr Hockey] mightn\u2019t like the way they look as he drives by them but the fact is they are making a significant contribution to saving the planet.\u201d\n\nDr Hewson said the science surrounding climate change had become firmer.\n\n\u201cThe risk is no longer just a two-degree warming, it\u2019s more like four-degree warming or six-degree warming.\n\n\u201cThere is a fair bit of work being done now saying we\u2019re pretty much at the tipping point.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ACT News, Federal Politics, Climate Change", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Former federal Liberal Party leader John Hewson has hit out at Joe Hockey for criticising wind farms, saying the Treasurer should drive past a coal-fired power station and have &amp;#8220;a bit of a smell&amp;#8221;.", "title": "John Hewson urges Joe Hockey to take a breather &#8211; at a coal-fired power station", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/john-hewson-urges-joe-hockey-to-take-a-breather-8211-at-a-coalfired-power-station-20140622-zsi08.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/a/m/3/5/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zsi08.png/1403496646267.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/a/m/3/5/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zsi08.png/1403496646267.jpg"}, "title": "John Hewson urges Joe Hockey to take a breather &#8211; at a coal-fired power station", "description": "Former federal Liberal Party leader John Hewson has hit out at Joe Hockey for criticising wind farms, saying the Treasurer should drive past a coal-fired power station and have &#8220;a bit of a smell&#8221;.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Former federal Liberal Party leader John Hewson has hit out at Joe Hockey for criticising wind farms, saying the Treasurer should drive past a coal-fired power ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd922\"", "article_summary": "Photo: Graham TidyFormer federal Liberal Party leader John Hewson has hit out at Joe Hockey for criticising wind farms, saying the Treasurer should drive past a coal-fired power station and have \u201ca bit of a smell\u201d.\n\u201cI think the price of electricity generated by wind is now lower than it is from coal-fired power plants.\nIn May Mr Hockey launched an unprompted attack on wind farms near Lake George, just outside the ACT, saying he found them \u201cutterly offensive\u201d and \u201ca blight on the landscape\u201d.\nDr Hewson was at Parliament House for a \u201cstop the dinosaurs\u201d campaign urging Parliament to save the carbon tax and renewable energy laws.\n\u201cI think they are quite ingenious really, and produce relatively cheap power and that's the trend of the future."}
