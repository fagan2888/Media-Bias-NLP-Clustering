A man and woman face multiple charges after their 3-year-old daughter tested positive for marijuana ingestion.

The Denver district attorney’s office said Wednesday that Mario Hollerway, 34, has been charged with possession of a controlled substance, possession of 6 to 12 ounces of marijuana and child abuse. Alysia Lombard, 26, has been charged with possession of 6 to 12 ounces of marijuana and child abuse.

According to the DA’s office, on Nov. 13, the couple’s daughter was diagnosed at a hospital with marijuana ingestion. Further investigation revealed an illegal amount of marijuana and suspected crack cocaine in the family home.

According to an affidavit obtained by 7News, the mother told police that she had some marijuana-infused butter in the refrigerator, where the child can’t reach it.

The mother told police the cannabutter was the only marijuana edible in the house, “unless there was something under the couch.”

Hollerway is scheduled to appear in Denver County Court on Dec. 26; Lombard’s court date has not been set.
