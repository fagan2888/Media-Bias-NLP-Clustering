Seniors are pressured to forego life-sustaining procedures to go into hospice. That enriches the booming hospice industry and also frees up dollars for the left\u2019s favored social causes.\n\nWhy is the government meddling with how we cope with death? The Institute of Medicine doesn\u2019t mince words. Scrimping on seniors will free up money \u201cto fund highly targeted and carefully tailored social services for both children and adults.\u201d Just like Obamacare. Robbing Grandma to spread the wealth.\n\nIn 2009, President Obama said seniors are getting too many procedures and maybe they\u2019re \u201cbetter off not having the surgery, but taking the painkiller.\u201d Obama\u2019s health guru Ezekiel Emanuel argues the elderly should be a lower priority because \u201cthey have already had more life-years.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect storm of ideology and industry greed, with hospice providers lobbying lawmakers to make end-of-life counseling the standard.\n\nAnd not just once. Hospice advocates want to drill their morbid message into patients\u2019 heads. \u201cIt has to be a series of recurring conversations over years,\u201d an industry representative insists.\n\nImported from Europe, the hospice industry has boomed \u2014 and taken a sharp turn from nonprofit to aggressively for-profit. Revenues are up 500 percent since 2000, and the industry is flexing its muscle in state capitols and Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 2010, industry lobbyists convinced New York lawmakers to compel all doctors to offer end-of-life counseling to patients with terminal illnesses. New York\u2019s law imposes heavy fines, even jail time, on doctors who don\u2019t.\n\nThe state\u2019s physicians protested that some patients will break down at the mention of hospice and give up on life. Other patients are religiously or culturally opposed.\n\nBut the law prohibits exemptions.\n\nForcing New York doctors to say things violates their First Amendment rights. Just last week, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a ruling to stand that struck down a North Carolina law dictating what doctors said to certain patients.\n\nHow about pressure on patients? Advocates say end-of-life counseling is always voluntary for the patient. Technically that may be true, but if your doctor faces penalties for not doing it, you\u2019re going to feel forced to go along.\n\nThat was the problem with the end-of-life counseling provision in an early draft of Obamacare in 2009. It said Medicare would pay doctors for end-of-life counseling. Fine.\n\nBut the bill went on to prescribe what doctors would have to discuss. That\u2019s not fine. Uncle Sam can\u2019t possibly know better than your family, the doctor at your bedside, and maybe your minister or rabbi.\n\nEven worse, the provision would have punished doctors who didn\u2019t comply, something the Institute of Medicine is calling for again.\n\nA doctor\u2019s quality rating (and pay from Medicare) would have depended partly on the proportion of patients who had advanced directives and how many adhered to them. How voluntary is it if your doctor\u2019s pay is affected by whether you stick to your Do Not Resuscitate order. That\u2019s what\u2019s ahead with this latest proposal.\n\nAlready, some seniors who could survive their illness and go home are pushed into refusing medical care. Advocates parrot the statistic that 25 percent of Medicare hospital expenditures are for the last year of life. That\u2019s like harping on how often Babe Ruth struck out.\n\nThree-quarters of the time, this care is helping seniors. A major study of 208 California hospitals in the Annals of Internal Medicine proves that spending more on Medicare patients leads to substantially higher survival rates. The money isn\u2019t wasted. In the hospitals that spend more, seniors have a better chance of recovering, going home, and resuming life.\n\nDespite the hazards of end of life counseling, Jeb Bush is on the bandwagon, saying seniors should be forced to fill out an advanced directive to get Medicare. His Republican rivals should make it clear they don\u2019t support government interfering in this highly personal decision.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09f8\"", "article_summary": "That was the problem with the end-of-life counseling provision in an early draft of Obamacare in 2009.\nIt said Medicare would pay doctors for end-of-life counseling.\nThat enriches the booming hospice industry and also frees up dollars for the left\u2019s favored social causes.\nHow voluntary is it if your doctor\u2019s pay is affected by whether you stick to your Do Not Resuscitate order.\nDespite the hazards of end of life counseling, Jeb Bush is on the bandwagon, saying seniors should be forced to fill out an advanced directive to get Medicare."}
