Lawrence Convention Center for a seminar titled the Power of Pink recently. The crowd of primarily young women and men in attendance gathered to share ideas and strategize how best to organize and rally support for Planned Parenthood facilities and the politicians who protect reproductive rights.\n\nThis seminar was part of Planned Parenthood\u2019s calls for voters to #PinkOutTheVote, which they describe as an attempt to keep reproductive rights from sliding backwards in the face of backlash and conservative rhetoric in this electoral season.\n\nThis gathering was the largest and most diverse in Planned Parenthood\u2019s 100 years of operation. This comes as no surprise to Cecile Richards, the President of Planned Parenthood who spoke at the rally on the final day of the seminar. Richards says that the majority of voters in the US are supportive of access to safe abortions and family planning care.\n\n\u201cEveryone needs [reproductive health care] regardless of their party identification, their gender, their background,\u201d says Richards.\n\nAlthough reproductive care is a need for many, it\u2019s not supported by all. Planned Parenthood has been a controversial and targeted group for all 100 years it has been around. In the past year, a group of individuals released a heavily edited video accusing Planned Parenthood of selling fetal tissue.\n\nNot only did a Texas Grand Jury clear Planned Parenthood of all charges, but the two main individuals behind the footage were indicted for a number of charges related to the footage. Richards says unfortunately for those opposed to Planned Parenthood, the attacks on the integrity of the organization has had a perhaps surprising result.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we are used to being under attack by those people in this country who would like to end access to safe and legal abortions and access to birth control as well,\u201d says Richards. \u201cOne of the unintended consequences of these attacks on us and our patients and our clinics is the rallying of young people.\u201d\n\nRichards says that many millennial voters are not just tolerant of, but enthusiastically believe in the mission of Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we stand for at Planned Parenthood, just making sure every woman has a right to the best medical care possible,\u201d says Richards.\n\nVictories of Planned Parenthood include the inclusion of free birth control within the Affordable Care Act as well as historic 30 and 40 year lows for unintended pregnancies among both teenage and adult women.\n\nThreatening these victories are attempts and successful defunding endeavors by various state legislators including those in Ohio. Texas is a place where Richards reports that the defunding forced many facilities to shutter their doors. As more clinics closed, the rate of unintended pregnancies has risen in Texas.\n\nRichards hopes that the millennial voter block, the largest in this election, will lead the country towards more progressive and productive politicians. The attendees of the weekend\u2019s seminar, she believes, are a good start.\n\n\u201cThey all went back to their states, fired up and ready to go for the next five months.\u201d\n\nMore Essential Pittsburgh segments can be heard here.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Essential Pittsburgh", "description": "Over 1000 activists for women\u2019s reproductive rights gathered at the David L.
