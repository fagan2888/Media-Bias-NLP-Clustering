Why is it then that in the United States of America the 610,042 individuals currently experiencing homelessness have limited, if no means, to cleaning themselves? In San Francisco, one woman found this fact intolerable and decided to do what she could to ensure that those living on the streets have a chance to get free showers.\n\nSan Francisco alone has around 3,500 homeless people living on the streets, but only seven public wash rooms for them to clean up. Rather than thinking about this unfortunate fact momentarily before moving on with her day, Doniece Sandoval founded Lava Mae, Jezebel reported. The company converts old Muni buses into showers and toilets for the homeless. \u201cEach of our buses has two complete bathrooms with a shower, sink, toilet and changing room. It\u2019s been in idea stage for so long, to actually see the result is unbelievable,\u201d Sandoval told CBS San Francisco.\n\nThe mobile bathroom run off the city\u2019s fire hydrants, and CBS SF reported that the company has worked out a deal with San Francisco, allowing them to use and pay for the water. The buses give the homeless so much more than a sense of cleanliness, its gives them a sense of self-worth. \u201cWith hygiene comes dignity, and with dignity comes opportunity,\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cSo hopefully, it will open other doors for people,\u201d Sandoval told CBS SF. Starting from June 28, the showers will be available to the public on Saturdays from 7 a.m. to 12 p.m. CBS SF reports that one bus could offer as many as 130 showers to the homeless of San Francisco.\n\nA common misconception of the homeless is that they do not take care of themselves. In reality, joining a gym is one way that some homeless are able to ensure their personal hygiene, The Huffington Post reported. Public libraries with free restrooms are another area where the homeless will try to clean themselves up, but \u201cthey don\u2019t like that too much,\u201d one homeless lady explained in the promotional video for Lava Mae. Personal hygiene is not only important to ones health, it can also make the difference in helping a homeless person land a job and be able to get off the streets. The Better Health Channel reports that personal hygiene is one of the most effective ways to protect both ourselves and others from illness.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "homeless, people, san, francisco, get, mobile, showers, thanks, lava, maes, mobile, public", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In San Francisco, Lave Mae mobile restrooms are giving the city's homeless population access to free showers, toilets, and changing rooms.", "title": "San Fran's Homeless Clean Up Nicely With Mobile Showers", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/homeless-people-san-francisco-get-mobile-showers-thanks-lava-maes-mobile-public-restrooms-289992", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/25/showers_0.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In San Francisco, Lave Mae mobile restrooms are giving the city's homeless population access to free showers, toilets, and changing rooms.", "title": "San Fran's Homeless Clean Up Nicely With Mobile Showers", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/homeless-people-san-francisco-get-mobile-showers-thanks-lava-maes-mobile-public-restrooms-289992", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/25/showers_0.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/25/showers_0.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-25T17:54:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-25T17:54:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In San Francisco, Lave Mae mobile restrooms are giving the city's homeless population access to free showers, toilets, and changing rooms."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e59\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s been in idea stage for so long, to actually see the result is unbelievable,\u201d Sandoval told CBS San Francisco.\nSan Francisco alone has around 3,500 homeless people living on the streets, but only seven public wash rooms for them to clean up.\nThe mobile bathroom run off the city\u2019s fire hydrants, and CBS SF reported that the company has worked out a deal with San Francisco, allowing them to use and pay for the water.\n\u201cSo hopefully, it will open other doors for people,\u201d Sandoval told CBS SF.\nRather than thinking about this unfortunate fact momentarily before moving on with her day, Doniece Sandoval founded Lava Mae, Jezebel reported."}
