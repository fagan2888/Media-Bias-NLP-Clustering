Sam Brownback now says he regrets his triumphant prediction that the tax cuts would be a \u201cshot of adrenaline\u201d to the state\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cI probably would have chosen words better at different times, because you go through a campaign where you\u2019ve got to eat the words you inartfully said,\u201d Brownback told the Topeka Capital-Journal.\n\nBesides his \u201cshot of adrenaline\u201d sound bite, Brownback also regrets calling the tax cuts an \u201cexperiment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe objective was the same \u2014 to get growth happening where we hadn\u2019t had growth in 35 years as a state \u2014 and we\u2019d gone from six congressional districts headed down to four headed to three if we don\u2019t change these trajectories,\u201d he said.\n\nBrownback\u2019s post-campaign contrition comes as dire new figures will force the governor to make some painful budgetary choices. In order to close a projected $280 million revenue shortfall by a June deadline, Brownback has reduced state contributions to Kansas\u2019 pension fund \u2014 already one of the worst-funded in the nation \u2014 and cut highway funding. In an ironic twist, the vociferously anti-health reform governor is also relying on Obamacare to help fill the state\u2019s budget gap; Brownback is transferring $55 million in revenue from a Medicaid drug rebate program expanded in the Affordable Care Act into the state\u2019s general fund.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kansas governor says he spoke \"inartfully\" when predicting tax cuts would be major boon to economy", "author": "Luke Brinker", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Kansas governor says he spoke \"inartfully\" when predicting tax cuts would be major boon to economy", "title": "Sam Brownback is sorry he predicted his tax cuts would work", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/23/sam_brownback_is_sorry_he_predicted_his_tax_cuts_would_work/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/sam_brownback.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kansas governor says he spoke \"inartfully\" when predicting tax cuts would be major boon to economy", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/sam_brownback.jpg", "title": "Sam Brownback is sorry he predicted his tax cuts would work", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Sam Brownback is sorry he predicted his tax cuts would work", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Kansas, paul davis, R-Kan., Sam Brownback, Supply-side economics, Tax cuts, topeka capital-journal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd90\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Kansas, paul davis, R-Kan., Sam Brownback, Supply-side economics, Tax cuts, topeka capital-journal, Politics NewsFresh off a re-election bid that he nearly lost because of the disastrous impact of his massive income tax cuts, Kansas Gov.\nSam Brownback now says he regrets his triumphant prediction that the tax cuts would be a \u201cshot of adrenaline\u201d to the state\u2019s economy.\nBrownback\u2019s post-campaign contrition comes as dire new figures will force the governor to make some painful budgetary choices.\n\u201cI probably would have chosen words better at different times, because you go through a campaign where you\u2019ve got to eat the words you inartfully said,\u201d Brownback told the Topeka Capital-Journal.\nIn order to close a projected $280 million revenue shortfall by a June deadline, Brownback has reduced state contributions to Kansas\u2019 pension fund \u2014 already one of the worst-funded in the nation \u2014 and cut highway funding."}
