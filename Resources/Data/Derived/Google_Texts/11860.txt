The Orlando getaway is intended to bring in cash for Vitter’s Louisiana Reform PAC Donald Duck and David Vitter?

David Vitter’s next campaign is right out of the funny pages.

The Louisiana senator, who already has entered his state’s 2015 governor’s race, is set to raise money later this fall with an array of cartoon characters at the Four Seasons Resort at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO.

The invitation was circulated Tuesday under the subject line “Join Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Senator Vitter at Disney!”

The Orlando getaway runs from Nov. 7-9 and is intended to bring in cash for Vitter’s Louisiana Reform PAC, a group supporting his gubernatorial ambitions. It requests $3,000 for each participant’s getaway package.

“Golf and the Disney Character breakfast will be on site and the kids will love the Explorer Island — the hotel’s own waterpark. The whole family will enjoy a fun filled Disney Dinner Show on Saturday night at Disney’s Fort Wilderness,” the invitation advertises.

Other activities listed include a “day of golf with Senator David Vitter” and a Saturday night “Disney’s Hoop-Dee-Doo BBQ & Musical Revue”: “Located at The Campsites at Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort in the Magic Kingdom Resort Area. A hilarious, high-spirited hootenanny the whole family will enjoy, accompanied by a finger lickin’ countrified feast.”

Vitter is expected to face a competitive GOP primary in the race to succeed outgoing Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal.
