SOUTH FORSYTH — Once graduation ceremonies are finished and students begin their summer break, several construction projects will begin at Forsyth County’s largest high school.

During a special called meeting Thursday, the Board of Education approved Charles Black Construction Company as the general contractor to oversee the work at Lambert, which has an enrollment of about 2,700. The project is expected to start later this month when the school year ends.

According to Jennifer Caracciolo, spokeswoman for school system, the projects include a classroom wing, extra restrooms off of the cafeteria and an expansion of the band room.

The school board found the company’s proposal the “most advantageous” at a contract price of about $6.3 million.

This will be paid for with about $1.4 million in state funding — reimbursed through a Georgia Department of Education Capital Outlay for which Lambert qualified — and about $4.8 million in local funds.

Projects should be ready by August 2016.

While Lambert’s construction projects are just beginning, development at North and South Forsyth high schools is visible.

The board assigned Chris’ Mobile Home Service & Transporting Inc. to remove 19 modular classrooms from North for $14,000 and Trammell Lawn Car to remove six modular classrooms from South for $5,550.

Caracciolo said the units being removed have become obsolete according to district standards and will be replaced with newer “mod pods.”

High schools were not the only campuses receiving the go-ahead for construction projects Thursday.

Midway Elementary is slated for a heating and air replacement project to be completed by July 31. The board approved Georgia Air Contractors Inc. as the contractor to replace the units in the southwest Forsyth school.

The project cost is $194,000, which will be partially reimbursed by the state, with the remainder taken from the system’s life cycle bond budget.
