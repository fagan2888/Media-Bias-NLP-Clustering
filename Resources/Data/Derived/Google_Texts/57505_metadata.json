He promises broad tax cuts, a reduction in the size of government and a balanced federal budget within eight years.\n\nFour of the seven tax brackets will be eliminated, bringing the top income rate down from 39.6 percent to 28 percent. The corporate tax will be reduced to 25 percent, a 10 percent cut, the long-term capital gains rate will be slashed to 15 percent and the estate tax will be eliminated. It will also increase the earned income tax credit by 10 percent.\n\nKasich, who formerly served as the chairman of House Ways and Means Committee for six years, says he will freeze non-defense discretionary spending at $593 billion annually, while increasing military spending by 17 percent.\n\nThe campaign says Congress will receive a comprehensive plan within his first 100 days in office.\n\nThe Ohio governor is calling for a shift in power back to the states in areas including education, transportation and Medicaid. Block grants and the revenue from the federal gas tax will be provided for a more localized approach, resulting in a major downsize of federal agencies.\n\nA one-year restriction on new major rules and regulations will also be put in place.\n\nDemocrats are bashing the plan, saying it will have detrimental effects on the government\u2019s functionality.\n\n\u201cKasich\u2019s \u2018plan\u2019 is simply unserious,\u201d TJ Helmstetter, a spokesman for the DNC, says in a statement. \u201cIt would not balance the budget, but it would choke off critical programs that people depend on and cripple the federal government\u2019s ability to function. It would either explode the deficit or destroy the economy.\u201d\n\nThe Republican candidate will unveil separate plans addressing the Affordable Care Act and Social Security.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
