A North Carolina man was charged with circumventing airport security after bringing a collapsible baton in his carry-on luggage yesterday, according to state police.

Police said Freddy Detres, 44, of Jacksonville, North Carolina, tried to go through security with the baton in his bag and state police from Troop H and Bradley Airport security staff members took him into custody.

Detres was released yesterday in a $5,000 surety bond.

He is due in court on Dec. 8 in Enfield.
