For some time, Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code has contained a \u201ccommunity benefit\u201d standard, requiring nonprofit hospitals to generate activities promoting community health.\n\nHowever, researchers have determined that many hospitals devote less than 8 percent of their revenue to these initiatives, which led lawmakers to include new community benefit requirements in the ACA. This policy brief examines the new guidelines, part of a strategy to complement the ACA\u2019s preventive care and population health priorities.\n\nThe brief explains how the community benefit reporting requirements for hospitals have changed since the first income tax code was enacted in 1913. The most significant change came about in 2008, when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) added the requirement that hospitals add a worksheet to their annual Form 990, detailing their community benefit activities. It also describes the new Section 501(r), added to the Internal Revenue Code as a result of the ACA, which spells out the requirements related to community benefits that nonprofit hospitals must meet to maintain their tax-exempt status.\n\nAbout Health Policy Briefs\n\nHealth Policy Briefs are aimed at policymakers, congressional staffers, and others needing short, jargon-free explanations of health policy basics.
