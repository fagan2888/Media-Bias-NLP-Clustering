More than half had not seen a doctor in more than a year.\n\n\u201cThese findings reveal a painful reality that often goes unacknowledged,\u201d said Imelda Plascencia, project coordinator of the study and an undocumented immigrant.\n\nAnother report, a joint effort of the UC Berkeley Labor Center and research centers at UCSF and UCLA, detailed the health coverage of undocumented youth legally protected from deportation \u2014 participants of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u2014 and proposed policy solutions for immigration reform.\n\nSolutions detailed in the report, \u201cRealizing the Dream for Californians Eligible for DACA: Demographics and Health Coverage,\u201d include comprehensive reform to help immigrants gain citizenship and expansion of their eligibility for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCalifornia Senate Bill 1005, authored by Senator Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, is a proposed solution to the lack of health coverage for undocumented immigrants in California. Dubbed the \u201cHealth for All Act,\u201d the bill would expand Medi-Cal eligibility and establish a new health exchange through which undocumented residents could buy health care coverage. The bill\u2019s funding and potential cost to taxpayers is still being determined.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve made enormous strides to reduce California\u2019s uninsured population \u2026 we won\u2019t have a truly healthy state until everyone has access to quality, affordable coverage,\u201d Lara said in a press release from Feb. 14.\n\nEfforts to increase accessibility have been made in some counties, such as the implementation of Healthy San Francisco, which provides affordable health care services for the uninsured, including undocumented residents.\n\nEven with increased accessibility, however, fear of deportation for undocumented immigrants or their family members can result in overall lower health care enrollment, said Ken Jacobs, chair of the UC Berkeley Labor Center.\n\nKim LaPean, communications manager at the Tang Center, said all UC students are extended coverage through their schools\u2019 health insurances, regardless of immigration status.\n\nLaPean noted that some undocumented students come from a place where they mistrust and are unfamiliar with health care, and the Tang Center has worked to ameliorate the issue by promoting access to services.\n\n\u201cWe really believe that when the whole community has access to health care \u2026 the whole community is better off,\u201d LaPean said.\n\nContact Angel Jennings at [email protected] and follow her on Twitter @angeljenningss.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Californian", "description": "University of California researchers released two studies Tuesday detailing the accessibility of healthcare for undocumented students, following the introduction of a state senate bill aimed at providing health care for undocumented immigrants.Read More\u2026", "title": "UC research reveals undocumented youth are largely uninsured | The Daily Californian", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.dailycal.org/assets/uploads/2014/04/fbimage1410x738.png", "url": "http://www.dailycal.org/2014/02/25/uc-research-reveals-undocumented-youth-largely-uninsured/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailycal", "section": "Research & Ideas", "tag": "University of California", "published_time": "2014-02-25T20:51:13-08:00"}, "fb": {"admins": 877855486}, "twitter": {"description": "University of California researchers released two studies Tuesday detailing the accessibility of healthcare for undocumented students, following the introduction of a state senate bill aimed at providing health care for undocumented immigrants.Read More\u2026", "creator": "@dailycal", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.dailycal.org/assets/uploads/2014/04/fbimage1410x738.png", "title": "UC research reveals undocumented youth are largely uninsured | The Daily Californian", "site": "@dailycal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "University of California researchers released two studies Tuesday detailing the accessibility of health care for undocumented students after the introduction of a state Senate bill aimed at providing health care for undocumented immigrants.\nThe studies illustrate the necessity and potential for health care coverage for undocumented youth by analyzing survey data collected from young adult immigrants across the state.\n\u201cWe really believe that when the whole community has access to health care \u2026 the whole community is better off,\u201d LaPean said.\nCalifornia Senate Bill 1005, authored by Senator Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, is a proposed solution to the lack of health coverage for undocumented immigrants in California.\nDubbed the \u201cHealth for All Act,\u201d the bill would expand Medi-Cal eligibility and establish a new health exchange through which undocumented residents could buy health care coverage."}
