They have blocked expanding Medicaid under Obamacare, which would unlock tens of millions of federal dollars that would buttress Virginia\u2019s hospitals and its economy, on the argument that the state might not be able to afford it.\n\nThen the state\u2019s hospitals, desperate for the federal funds, came up with a novel idea they had previously opposed: Tax us on our revenue, the hospitals said, and earmark those new funds, rather than other tax-supported general revenue, to trigger the gusher of federal dollars.\n\nThe proposal is fiscally sound, humane and elegant. It would extend health insurance to an estimated 400,000 indigent Virginians, bail out struggling hospitals and cost the state\u2019s residents \u2014 who have already paid for Medicaid expansion through their federal tax payment returns \u2014 no additional money in the foreseeable future.\n\nEager for a way to break the Medicaid impasse, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) embraced the hospitals\u2019 proposal, including it in the two-year budget he submitted recently to the GOP-controlled legislature.\n\nAnd still the Republicans said no.\n\nWhile Mr. McAuliffe surely knew the Republicans would say no \u2014 for their opposition springs mainly from their undying hostility toward anything remotely affiliated with Obamacare, of which Medicaid expansion is a constituent part \u2014 he must nonetheless be savoring the spectacle of the Republicans\u2019 recalcitrance, which has the effect of not only hurting Virginia but also cutting off the Republicans\u2019 own noses to spite their faces.\n\nAfter all, the governor\u2019s proposal would yield federal funding that would substitute for state spending on Medicaid amounting to $156 million over two years, savings the governor proposed could be redirected to priorities dear to the GOP\u2019s heart: tax cuts for corporations and individuals, additional funds for a popular economic development program, and various other morsels tempting to conservatives.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 stated reason for opposing Medicaid expansion is that Virginia would be financially liable if, at some indefinable date in the future, the federal government reneged on its commitment to cover at least 90 percent of the cost. That\u2019s true. It\u2019s also true that Virginia receives tens of billions of dollars in other federal funding each year, and withdrawal of any portion of it would similarly tear a major hole in the state budget. Yet the GOP does not reject those funds.\n\nHouse Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) has been fond of saying he prefers an \u201calternative\u201d to Medicaid expansion that spares Virginia taxpayers, although he has never offered such a proposal in the form of legislation and has no other vision for covering the hundreds of thousands of people who now lack health insurance. Now, presented with just such an alternative, he barely bothers to explain his refusal to budge, saying merely the governor\u2019s budget has \u201coverpromised.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Mr. Howell is content with Virginia\u2019s status quo, in which, in one of the nation\u2019s wealthiest states, hundreds of thousands of people have no health insurance. That ongoing disgrace will be an undeniable part of Mr. Howell\u2019s legacy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers still won\u2019t extend health insurance to thousands of poor, even if hospitals spare taxpayers the cost.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Lawmakers still won\u2019t extend health insurance to thousands of poor, even if hospitals spare taxpayers the cost.", "title": "No budging by Virginia Republicans on Medicaid expansion", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-budging-by-virginia-republicans-on-medicaid-expansion/2015/12/19/c7dfa1e4-a536-11e5-b53d-972e2751f433_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/02/05/Local-Politics/Images/State_Of_The_Commonwealth-0690f-889.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "postopinions"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-budging-by-virginia-republicans-on-medicaid-expansion/2015/12/19/c7dfa1e4-a536-11e5-b53d-972e2751f433_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "virginia, medicaid expansion, obamacare, william howell, republicans, terry mcauliffe, virginia hospitals, virginia budget, virginia federal funding", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions"}, "eomportal-uuid": "c7dfa1e4-a536-11e5-b53d-972e2751f433", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "virginia, medicaid expansion, obamacare, william howell, republicans, terry mcauliffe, virginia hospitals, virginia budget, virginia federal funding"}, "article_summary": "EVEN AS state after state has elected to expand Medicaid, thereby extending health insurance to millions of poor people who would otherwise remain without coverage, Virginia Republicans have stood pat.\nTerry McAuliffe (D) embraced the hospitals\u2019 proposal, including it in the two-year budget he submitted recently to the GOP-controlled legislature.\nThe Republicans\u2019 stated reason for opposing Medicaid expansion is that Virginia would be financially liable if, at some indefinable date in the future, the federal government reneged on its commitment to cover at least 90 percent of the cost.\nIt would extend health insurance to an estimated 400,000 indigent Virginians, bail out struggling hospitals and cost the state\u2019s residents \u2014 who have already paid for Medicaid expansion through their federal tax payment returns \u2014 no additional money in the foreseeable future.\nWhile Mr. McAuliffe surely knew the Republicans would say no \u2014 for their opposition springs mainly from their undying hostility toward anything remotely affiliated with Obamacare, of which Medicaid expansion is a constituent part \u2014 he must nonetheless be savoring the spectacle of the Republicans\u2019 recalcitrance, which has the effect of not only hurting Virginia but also cutting off the Republicans\u2019 own noses to spite their faces."}
