That\u2019s how all Americans should feel when it comes to ObamaCare -- because Barack Obama\u2019s failed and discredited campaign promise to lower health insurance premiums has cost the average American family an amount equal to the price of many new cars.\n\nDuring his 2008 campaign, one of then-Senator Obama\u2019s most audacious promises was that his health plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 for the average family. His repeatedly made his pledge on videotape; you can view those promises here. But health insurance premiums have continued to rise -- not just despite ObamaCare, but in many cases because of the law\u2019s new regulations and mandates.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nA new analysis by the think-tank America Next, where I serve as honorary chairman, quantifies the massive scope of the broken promise. Compared to 2008 -- the year President Obama was elected -- Americans have faced a cumulative $6,388 per individual, and $18,610 per family, in higher costs because President Obama\u2019s health plan has failed to achieve its promised premium reductions. Overall, that amounts to $1.2 trillion in higher premium costs due to ObamaCare\u2019s failure to deliver.\n\nThe administration has put forth all sorts of excuses about why its law hasn\u2019t met the expectations the president himself set. One of them is that the law\u2019s major provisions only took effect in January, so ObamaCare needs more time to achieve savings.\n\nBut, in July 2008, Jason Furman\u2014then the Obama campaign\u2019s economic policy director, and now the Chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors\u2014told the New York Times that \u201cwe think we could get to $2,500 in savings by the end of the first term, or be very close to it.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Democrats delayed full ObamaCare implementation until 2014 to hide the legislation\u2019s true cost shouldn\u2019t absolve President Obama for failing to deliver on his promise one whit.\n\nThe administration also now claims that ObamaCare is working, because premiums are \u201conly\u201d rising by 6 or 8 percent per year. But that\u2019s not what then-candidate Obama himself promised in 2008; he spoke frequently of \u201ccutting,\u201d \u201creducing,\u201d and \u201clowering\u201d premium costs. Whether premiums go up by 1 percent or 101 percent, any increase represents a promise broken.\n\nIn August 2012, Politifact nicely summed up ObamaCare\u2019s discredited premium pledge: \u201cAn author of the $2,500 figure has disavowed its use as it relates to premiums alone. An independent health care analyst projects that premiums will go up for the typical family. The federal agency implementing [ObamaCare] did not provide evidence that premiums will go down for the typical family. We rate this a Promise Broken.\u201d\n\nEven as ObamaCare has failed to deliver, there is a better way. The America Next health plan can provide the relief from rising costs that Americans need and deserve. Rather than focusing on a massive expansion and restructuring of the health care system, the America Next plan focuses like a laser beam on reducing health costs. The plan creates incentives for states to reform their insurance markets, thereby reducing plan premiums. It also includes other reforms with a proven track record of lowering costs, including tax equity between employer-based and individually-purchased insurance plans, lawsuit reforms, and new incentives for Health Savings Accounts.\n\nAnalysis by independent, non-partisan experts confirm the plan\u2019s effectiveness. When considering proposals similar to those in the America Next plan, the Congressional Budget Office concluded in 2009 that they would lower small business health insurance premiums by 7 to 10 percent, and reduce individual health insurance premiums by 5 to 8 percent. Compared to the premium increases projected under ObamaCare, the reforms in the America Next plan could provide thousands of dollars in real relief for families struggling from high insurance premiums.\n\nThe America Next report confirms that the average American family has paid a price equal to the sum of many new cars because ObamaCare has failed to meet the president's commitments. And, as with any balky automobile, it\u2019s time for the American people to trade in this ObamaCare lemon, and replace it with something that works. Coupled with ObamaCare\u2019s full repeal, the America Next health plan can provide what the American people need\u2014real relief from skyrocketing health costs.\n\nRepublican Bobby Jindal is governor of Louisiana and a former Republican candidate for president of the United States.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-31 05:06:04 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"description": "Barack Obama\u2019s failed and discredited campaign promise to lower health insurance premiums has cost the average American family an amount equal to the price of many new cars.", "title": "Your health care: Obama's $18,000 broken promise", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/07/15/obama-18000-broken-promise.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/opinion/2014/07/15/obama-18000-broken-promise/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422701217214.jpg?ve=1", "creator": "@foxnews", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\"],\"author\":\"Bobby Jindal\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"Your health care: Obama\\\\u0027s $18,000 broken promise\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/opinion/2014/07/15/obama-18000-broken-promise/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422701217214.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-15T23:15:30Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/07/15/obama-18000-broken-promise.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"a62a406e-745c-4639-9e0c-3172e4417bbb\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "Barack Obama\u2019s failed and discredited campaign promise to lower health insurance premiums has cost the average American family an amount equal to the price of many new cars.", "dc.description": "Barack Obama\u2019s failed and discredited campaign promise to lower health insurance premiums has cost the average American family an amount equal to the price of many new cars.", "dc.identifier": "a62a406e-745c-4639-9e0c-3172e4417bbb", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "healthcare", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "opinion", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Your Health Care: Obama's $18,000 Broken Promise", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-31 05:06:04 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Barack Obama\u2019s failed and discredited campaign promise to lower health insurance premiums has cost the average American family an amount equal to the price of many new cars.", "title": "Your health care: Obama's $18,000 broken promise | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/07/15/obama-18000-broken-promise.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/opinion/2014/07/15/obama-18000-broken-promise/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422701217214.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.abstract": "Barack Obama\u2019s failed and discredited campaign promise to lower health insurance premiums has cost the average American family an amount equal to the price of many new cars.", "dc.date": "2014-07-15", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\"],\"author\":\"Bobby Jindal\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"Your health care: Obama\\\\u0027s $18,000 broken promise\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/opinion/2014/07/15/obama-18000-broken-promise/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422701217214.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-15T23:15:30Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/07/15/obama-18000-broken-promise.html\",\"post_id\":\"a62a406e-745c-4639-9e0c-3172e4417bbb\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}", "dc.creator": "Bobby Jindal"}, "article_summary": "Coupled with ObamaCare\u2019s full repeal, the America Next health plan can provide what the American people need\u2014real relief from skyrocketing health costs.\nBut health insurance premiums have continued to rise -- not just despite ObamaCare, but in many cases because of the law\u2019s new regulations and mandates.\nRather than focusing on a massive expansion and restructuring of the health care system, the America Next plan focuses like a laser beam on reducing health costs.\nDuring his 2008 campaign, one of then-Senator Obama\u2019s most audacious promises was that his health plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 for the average family.\nThe America Next health plan can provide the relief from rising costs that Americans need and deserve."}
