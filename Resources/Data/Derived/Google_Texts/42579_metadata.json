The measure also includes a reauthorization of the controversial Export-Import Bank\u2019s charter, which has been held up in Congress since it expired in June. The extension, which was included in the Senate\u2019s highway bill and left unchanged by the House, reauthorizes the bank\u2019s expired charter until 2019. The House voted to approve the bill in a 363-64 vote. It calls for spending $261 billion on highways and $55 billion on transit over six years. The legislation authorizes highway funding for six years, but only if Congress can come up with a way to pay for the final three years.\n\nPassing bills that do something other than repeal Obamacare? This is so weird, I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.\n\n* The TPP is finally public:\n\nThe Obama administration says an expansive 12-nation Pacific Rim trade pact released Thursday would rewrite the rules of trade and investment in a fast-growing region, reducing barriers of entry for U.S. businesses and safeguarding intellectual property, while also protecting the rights of workers and the environment. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would lower tariffs on thousands of goods and services, including beef, pork, dairy and automobiles, and it would establish an international tribunal to litigate disputes between member countries and multinational corporations. Nations including Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam, in special implementation plans agreed to with the United States, have promised to change their laws to allow trade unions to form and operate freely, to improve protections for foreign workers and those who may have been illegally trafficked, and to outlaw employment discrimination.\n\nThe part about us sending the cast of \u201cThe Suite Life of Zack & Cody\u201d to work in a garment factory in the Philippines was a little unexpected, but I guess you have to do what\u2019s necessary to make a deal.\n\n* According to a new Elon University poll, Ben Carson leads in North Carolina by 12 points over Trump.\n\n* Rosie Gray reports that Carson has managed to take the lead in the Republican primary despite focusing almost exclusively on evangelical voters.\n\n* There was a lot of chatter today about Carson\u2019s zany views about the Pyramids, but as James Downie notes, what matters far more is Carson\u2019s folly about policy. \u2014 gs\n\n* Ryan Cooper tries to figure out how many Kentuckians will die if new governor-elect Matt Bevin goes through with his plan to dismantle the state\u2019s insurance exchange and turn away from the Medicaid expansion. Wait, policy has actual consequences?\n\n* Elias Isquith has a smart take on how the Kentucky outcome undermines core Democratic assumptions about the politics surrounding Obamacare, and liberal policy gains in general. \u2014 gs\n\n* Francis Wilkinson suggests Kentucky may now become the perfect test of the Tea Party health reform vision, which is to say, repealing Obamacare and replacing it with nothing. \u2014 gs\n\n* Jonathan Cohn offers the chart of the day, showing that Marco Rubio\u2019s tax plan does indeed give more benefits to the wealthy than to anyone else, to the tune of this:\n\nThe richest 5 percent of Americans would pocket nearly half of the tax cut while the richest 1 percent alone would receive more than one-third.\n\nBut Rubio\u2019s tax plan would of course benefit bartenders like his father, so what\u2019s the problem? \u2014 gs\n\n* Ed Kilgore develops an interesting theory on why Rubio\u2019s handling of his finances could end up being a bigger political liability than Trump\u2019s bankruptcies. \u2014 gs\n\n* Simon Maloy reads Donald Trump\u2019s new book and returns with an absolutely terrific, super-classy, premium quality review. Believe me, you\u2019re not even gonna believe it.\n\n* Lauren French interviews Nancy Pelosi, who is not going anywhere so don\u2019t even think about it.\n\n* Jonathan Easley reports that many important conservative media figures like Laura Ingraham still haven\u2019t forgiven Marco Rubio for supporting comprehensive immigration reform (even though he doesn\u2019t anymore) and are going after him with renewed vigor.\n\n* At The Week, I explained why everyone who says they\u2019re angry about Washington dysfunction is lying, mostly to themselves.\n\n* Dan Drezner insists in the face of Star Wars revisionist history that no Just War Theory can justify the Tarkin Doctrine under which Alderaan was destroyed, and therefore the Empire is still evil. Also, people force-choking each other in the situation room is a pretty big tip-off.\n\n* And Ben Terris investigates why so many comedians love Bernie Sanders, despite the fact that Sanders is almost completely without a sense of humor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "title": "Happy Hour Roundup", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/05/happy-hour-roundup-728/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/04/04/Production/Daily/A-Section/Images/Rubio_Romney_02354.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/05/happy-hour-roundup-728/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "plum line", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "plum line"}, "article_summary": "* At The Week, I explained why everyone who says they\u2019re angry about Washington dysfunction is lying, mostly to themselves.\nBut Rubio\u2019s tax plan would of course benefit bartenders like his father, so what\u2019s the problem?\nThis is so weird, I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.\nThe extension, which was included in the Senate\u2019s highway bill and left unchanged by the House, reauthorizes the bank\u2019s expired charter until 2019.\nIt calls for spending $261 billion on highways and $55 billion on transit over six years."}
