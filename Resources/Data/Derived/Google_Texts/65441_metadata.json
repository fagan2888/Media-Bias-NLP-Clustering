That care setting may be a patient\u2019s home, and telemedicine is an effective way to deliver care there.\n\nAs a result of this growth, telemedicine vendors are finding it easier to raise capital. One such vendor, Teladoc announced it has raised $50.2 million in fresh capital which it will use to reinforce its leadership position and support the acceleration of its growth strategy.\n\nTeladoc provides telephone and video teleconferences to address routine health issues that might otherwise be treated in an ER or urgent care center. Patients are evaluated by a health professional, and if a referral or prescription is needed, they can be arranged for during the call.\n\n\u201cTeladoc has experienced phenomenal growth. After doubling revenue in each of the last two years, we look to accelerate this trend,\u201d said Jason Gorevic, CEO of Teladoc. \u201cThis sizeable investment will allow us to quickly develop new products and services \u2026 while simultaneously expanding into new markets and distribution channels.\u201d\n\nTeladoc is set to pursue further growth both organically and through additional strategic partnerships and targeted acquisitions. The company is anticipating record-setting growth in January 2015 on the heels of its strongest selling season ever. A year ago it acquired Consult-A-Doctor, which works with small- and medium-sized employer health plans. Earlier this year, it purchased Ameridoc.\n\nTeladoc is anticipated to complete more than a quarter-million medical consults across the U.S. this year, with an average physician call-back time of less than 16 minutes. Some of the largest healthcare companies and insurers use Teladoc services including Blue Shield of California; Cash America; Gallup; Highmark Inc.; Ignite Restaurants, the holding company for Romano\u2019s Macaroni Grill, Brick House Tavern + Tap and Joe\u2019s Crab Shack; Rent-A-Center; and T-Mobile.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>Telemedicine is gaining traction amongst the healthcare community and, as it does, brings in millions of dollars in capital. <em>By Christine Kern, contributing writer</em></p>", "title": "Acceptance Of Telemedicine Drives Investment", "image": {"src": "http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/1b16e9ee/1b16e9ee-1deb-4ad1-87d9-1ae312de6179/virtual_doc_2.jpg"}, "creator": "Christine Kern", "site": "HITOutcomes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Telemedicine is gaining traction amongst the healthcare community and, as it does, brings in millions of dollars in capital.
