— A Cary man was arrested Sunday afternoon for allegedly killing his brother, police said, marking the town's first homicide of the year.

Kevin Leroy Bodden, 54, shot and killed his brother, Mark Gregory Bodden, 44, Sunday morning inside the apartment they shared with their mother at 2101 Talking Rock Drive, at the Bexley at Triangle Park Apartments, police said.

The siblings' mother called 911 at 8:47 a.m. to report the shooting.

"He went out this morning, and he said he was going to the store to buy some things, but he didn't have enough money, so he come back wanting money from my son," said the mother, who detailed the incident in a calm tone to emergency dispatchers.

The Mark Bodden then asked his brother about rent, the mother said. Kevin Bodden then shot Mark Bodden three times in the chest and twice in the back, the mother said.

Mark Bodden was breathing when his mother called 911. He died after being shot with a .9 mm handgun, police said.

Police found Kevin Bodden in Durham. He has been charged with first-degree murder.

"This is an awful tragedy for the Bodden family, and we hope everyone will keep them in their thoughts as they work through this terrible ordeal,” Cary police Capt. Don Hamilton said.

Kevin Bodden had been staying with his mother and brother, who leased the apartment, police said. The mother said in the 911 call that he moved to Cary from Columbia five months ago.
