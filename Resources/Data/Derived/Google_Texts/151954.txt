“Long term, we see significant opportunities to continually expand our data center services margin, and that’s really based off of the shift that we have made toward core data center services in our company-controlled locations,” he said.

He also said INAP expects to grow margins through utilization of its data centers.

“In addition, we’ll continue to increase the utilization of our recently deployed data center expansion footprints. As I mentioned earlier, we’re currently at 54% utilization, and we expect that utilization to allow us further upside to the margins that we delivered in Q2,” he said.

Ruffolo was confident Internap‘s strategy would be able to increase revenue, as well as growth for shareholders and customers.

“Short term, through the end of this year and into 2016, we expect to continue to drive profitable topline revenue growth as well as continue to improve our EBITDA profitability, and those improvements will be driven around customers adopting our new products and services, as well as us doing a better job of execution. As the CEO, I’m very confident in our strategy, and I believe our ability to execute against this strategy and grow will become clearly evident as we go through Q3 and Q4 and into next year. Personally, I think all of us are excited about the future, and we look forward to delivering long-term profitable growth for our shareholders, and increasing customer value to our prospects and customers around the world,” he said.
