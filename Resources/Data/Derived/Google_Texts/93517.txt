A Liberty County man is facing kidnapping and possible murder charges.

On January 14th, Liberty County Sheriff's officials responded to a verbal altercation at a home in Bristol. Tiffany Sims, called 911 and requested a temporary injunction against her ex-boyfriend, Robert McCandless.

Two days later, at around 4 a.m. Sheriff's officials received another call from Sims saying that McCandless had returned to her house, and entered by kicking in the front door. When deputies arrived, McCandless had already fled the scene, and Sims and both of her children were unharmed.

But around 11 a.m. that same day Sheriff's officials got a call from Sims' employer saying she was not at work. When deputies arrived back to her home, they did not find Sims, or her children and a number of their items had been packed.

After tracking Sims' car, Liberty County Sheriff's officials found that the vehicle was in Clarendon County, South Carolina. Authorities in South Carolina spotted the car, and pulled them over.

When authorities got to the vehicle, they saw that Sims was severely beaten. They arrested McCandless, and Sims was taken to a local hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Liberty County Sheriff's deputies and Federal officials are investigating the case.
