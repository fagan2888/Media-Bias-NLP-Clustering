In fact, if I could increase it, I would.\u201d That\u2019s because bottled water is big business, even in a country where most people have clean, safe tap water readily and cheaply available. (Although it should be noted that Starbucks agreed to stop sourcing and manufacturing their Ethos brand water in California after being drought-shamed.)\n\nProfits made by the industry are much to the chagrin of nonprofits like Corporate Accountability International (CAI), a corporate watchdog, and Food and Water Watch (FWW), a consumer advocacy group, both of which have waged campaigns against the bottled water industry for years. But representatives from both organizations say they\u2019ve won key fights against the industry in the last 10 years and have helped shift people\u2019s consciousness on the issue.\n\nA Battle of Numbers\n\nIn 2014 bottled water companies spent more than $84 million on advertising to compete with each other and to convince consumers that bottled water is healthier than soda and safer than tap. And it seems to be paying off: Americans have an increasing love of bottled water, particularly those half-liter-sized single-use bottles that are ubiquitous at every check-out stand and in every vending machine. According to Beverage Marketing Corporation (BMC), a data and consulting firm, in the last 14 years consumption of bottled water in the U.S. has risen steadily, with the only exception being a quick dip during the 2008-2009 recession.\n\nIn 2000, Americans each drank an average of 23 gallons of bottled water. By 2014, that number hit 34 gallons a person. That translates to 10.7 billion gallons for the U.S. market and sales of $13 billion last year. At the same time, consumption of soda is falling, and by 2017, bottled water sales may surpass that of soda for the first time.\n\nBut there is also indication that more eco-conscious consumers are carrying reusable bottles to refill with tap. A Harris poll in 2010 found that 23 percent of respondents switched from bottled water to tap (the number was slightly higher during 2009 recession). Reusable bottles are now chic and available in myriad designs and styles. And a Wall Street Journal story tracked recent acquisitions in the reusable bottle industry that indicate big growth as well, although probably not enough to make a dent in the earnings of bottling giants like Nestl\u00e9, Coke and Pepsi.\n\nWhy the Fight Over Bottled Water\n\n\u201cThe single most important factor in the growth of bottled water is heightened consumer demand for healthier refreshment,\u201d says BMC\u2019s managing director of research Gary A. Hemphill. \u201cConvenience of the packaging and aggressive pricing have been contributing factors.\u201d\n\nThat convenience, though, comes with an environmental cost. The Pacific Institute, a nonprofit research organization, found that it took the equivalent of 17 million barrels of oil to make all the plastic water bottles that thirsty Americans drank in 2006 \u2014 enough to keep a million cars chugging along the roads for a year. And this is only the energy to make the bottles, not the energy it takes to get them to the store, keep them cold or ship the empties off to recycling plants or landfills.\n\nOf the billions of plastic water bottles sold each year, the majority don\u2019t end up being recycled. Those single-serving bottles, also known as PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles because of the kind of resin they\u2019re made with, are recycled at a rate of about 31 percent in the U.S. The other 69 percent end up in landfills or as litter.\n\nAnd while recycling them is definitely a better option than throwing them away, it comes with a cost, too. Stiv Wilson, director of campaigns at the Story of Stuff Project, says that most PET bottles that are recycled end up, not as new plastic bottles, but as textiles, such as clothing. And when you wash synthetic clothing, microplastics end up going down the drain and back into waterways. These tiny plastic fragments are dangerous for wildlife, especially in oceans.\n\n\u201cIf you start out with a bad material to begin with, recycling it is going to be an equally bad material,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cYou\u2019re changing its shape but its environmental implications are the same.\u201d PET bottles are part of a growing epidemic of plastic waste that\u2019s projected to get worse. A recent study found that by 2050, 99 percent of seabirds will be ingesting plastic.\n\nIngesting plastic trash is deadly for seabirds, like this unfortunate albatross. (image: USFWS)\n\n\u201cWe notice in all the data that the amount of plastic in the environment is growing exponentially,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cWe are exporting it to places that can\u2019t deal with it, we\u2019re burning it with dioxins going into the air. The whole chain of custody is bad for the environment, for animals and the humans that deal with it. The more you produce, the worse it gets. The problem grows.\u201d\n\nEven on land, plastic water bottles are a problem \u2014 and in some of our most beautiful natural areas, as a recent controversy over bottled water in National Parks has shown. According to Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), more than 20 national parks have banned the sale of plastic water bottles, reporting that plastic bottles average almost one third of the solid waste that parks must pay (with taxpayer money) to have removed.\n\nAfter Zion National Park in Utah banned the sale of plastic water bottles, the park saw sales of reusable bottles jump 78 percent and kept it 60,000 bottles (or 5,000 pounds of plastic) a year out of the waste stream. The park also made a concerted effort to provide bottle refilling stations across the park so there would be ample opportunity to refill reusable bottles.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last year, Americans drank more than 10 billion gallons of bottled H2O.
