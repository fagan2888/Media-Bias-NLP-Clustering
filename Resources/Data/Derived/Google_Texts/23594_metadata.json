And those who received subsidies were required to fill out new forms, answer a slew of additional questions and do some complicated math.\n\nDuncan said the extra paper work hasn\u2019t been as burdensome for his firm as some others because most of his clients have insurance through their employers. But the Obamacare subsidies have had a dramatic impact on some of his clients\u2019 tax returns, he said.\n\n\u201cWe had one case in our office where a woman, who was not working at the time she received a subsidy, later found out that she had a bunch of investment income that put her over the income limit for a subsidy,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cShe had to give back close to $5,000 in subsidies.\u201d\n\nThe subsidies \u2014 available to most adults earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level who were not eligible for Medicaid or employee-sponsored insurance \u2014 are based on taxpayers\u2019 estimated income during 2014.\n\nBut because most filers earned more or less than they originally estimated, some filers will have to pay part of their subsidy back while others will receive an additional refund.\n\nA recent study from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that half of all filers will have to pay some money back \u2014 about $794 on average.\n\nIn addition, taxpayers who went without coverage last year will be subject to a tax penalty of $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is greater.\n\nAnd most taxpayers subject to the penalty appear to be paying more than the $95 flat fee, based on a recent analysis of tax returns by H&R Block, which found the average tax penalty for not having insurance was $172.\n\nBut it\u2019s not too late to sign up for coverage and avoid the tax penalty for some.\n\nOpen enrollment for Obamacare ended in February, but the government is allowing a special enrollment period for people who were uninformed or unaware of the tax penalty or who received incorrect tax information after signing up for coverage under the law.\n\nAbout 800,000 Americans who received Obamacare subsidies received incorrect tax information, according to the Obama administration.\n\nJoel Veldt, a tax preparer at Ladd & Carter Tax Service in Dayton, said many of his clients were completely unaware of the law\u2019s so-called individual mandate, which requires most Americans to obtain health coverage or pay a fine.\n\nAnd while some of his clients simply decided to pay the penalty, the decision was more complicated than they expected.\n\n\u201cThe clients who knew about the tax penalty and decided to take it figured paying the penalty would be a whole lot cheaper than buying insurance,\u201d Veldt said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t count on all this extra paperwork. It\u2019s a lot of work. It has even got some of us thinking about quitting the business.\u201d\n\nThe fee for people who don\u2019t have coverage increases in 2015 to $325 per person or 2 percent of your household income \u2013 whichever is greater.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Duncan, a partner in the accounting firm Thorn Lewis & Duncan, refers to the Affordable Care Act as the \u201cAccountants Crying Act\u201d because of the additional tax forms required for clients who received government subsidies for health insurance under the law.", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/taxpayers-stung-by-obamacare-fines-and-penalties/nktJb/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/de/42/DDN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "Bill Duncan, a partner in the accounting firm Thorn Lewis & Duncan, refers to the Affordable Care Act as the \u201cAccountants Crying Act\u201d because of the additional tax forms required for clients who received government subsidies for health insurance under the law.", "title": "Taxpayers stung by Obamacare fines and penalties"}, "twitter": {"site": "@daytondailynews", "description": "Bill Duncan, a partner in the accounting firm Thorn Lewis &amp; Duncan, refers to the Affordable Care Act as the &ldquo;Accountants Crying Act&rdquo; because of the additional tax forms required for clients who received government subsidies for health insurance under the law.", "card": "summary", "title": "Taxpayers stung by Obamacare fines and penalties"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/taxpayers-stung-by-obamacare-fines-and-penalties/nktJb/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2878629/news/news/taxpayers-stung-by-obamacare-fines-and-penalties/nktJb/", "keywords": "b2bnewsletter", "google-site-verification": "fR8PW_DfizdYW0uymF5VkAzfbNKqKxqfnhqsbXSP7oI", "news_keywords": "b2bnewsletter"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae3b\"", "article_summary": "About 800,000 Americans who received Obamacare subsidies received incorrect tax information, according to the Obama administration.\nBut the Obamacare subsidies have had a dramatic impact on some of his clients\u2019 tax returns, he said.\nAnd those who received subsidies were required to fill out new forms, answer a slew of additional questions and do some complicated math.\nBut it\u2019s not too late to sign up for coverage and avoid the tax penalty for some.\nIn addition, taxpayers who went without coverage last year will be subject to a tax penalty of $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is greater."}
