Some scams are widespread, getting a lot of people for small amounts. Others are more narrowly focused, but take people for thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. The Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Consumer Sentinel Data Book estimates that Americans lost $1.4 billion to scams in 2012.\n\nThe Council of Better Business Bureaus, the umbrella organization for the 113 local BBBs across the U.S. and Canada, culls its annual \u201cTop Ten Scams\u201d list from a variety of sources, including reports from consumers, some of whom have been victims of scams; from federal agencies; and from other reliable information sources.\n\n\u201cThese are not necessarily the scams with the biggest losses, or those with the most victims, as many people don\u2019t report scams or even know they\u2019ve been victimized,\u201d said Katherine Hutt, CBBB spokesperson. \u201cThese are the scams that seemed to be the most widespread, aimed at the most vulnerable, growing in popularity, or just plain audacious. Scams are every-changing, but we want to help people recognize them and be prepared the next time they get a suspicious call, email, text or solicitation.\u201d\n\nBBB Top Ten Scams of 2013\n\nMedical Alert Scam \u2013 A new twist to the telemarketing scam hit 2013 hard. With promises of a \u201cfree\u201d medical alert system, the scam targeted seniors and caretakers and claimed to be offering the system free of charge because a family member or friend had already paid for it. Inmany cases, seniors were asked to provide their bank account or credit information to \u201cverify\u201d their identity and, as a result, were charged the monthly $35 service fee. The system, of course, never arrived and the seniors were left with a charge they had trouble getting refunded. Easy rule of thumb \u2013 be wary of \u201cfree\u201d offers that require your personal information upfront and always verify with the supposed friend or family member that the caller says paid for the service.\n\nAuction Reseller Scam \u2013 Many people turn to Ebay and other online auctions sites to sell used items they no longer need, and relatively new electronics seem to do especially well. But scammers have figured out a way to fool sellers into shipping goods without receiving payment. Usually the buyer claims it\u2019s an \u201cemergency\u201d of some sort \u2013 a child\u2019s birthday, a member of the military shipping out \u2013 and asks the seller to ship the same day. The seller receives an email that looks like it\u2019s from PayPal confirming the payment, but emails are easy to fake. Always confirm payment in your Ebay and PayPal accounts before shipping, especially to an overseas address.\n\nFor infographic, click here.\n\n\n\nArrest Warrant Scam \u2013 This one seemed to really take off last autumn. In this scam, con artists are taking advantage of technology that can change what is visible on Caller ID, and allowing them to pose as the office of the local sheriff or other law enforcement agency. They call to say there is a warrant out for your arrest, but that you can pay a fine in order to avoid criminal charges. Of course, these \"police\" don't take credit cards; only a wire transfer or pre-paid debit card will do. Sometimes these scams seem very personal; the scammer may refer to a loan or other financial matter. It may just be a lucky guess, but don\u2019t be fooled into thinking you are about to be arrested.\n\nInvisible Home Improvements \u2013 Home improvement scams vary little from year to year, and most involve some type of shoddy workmanship from unlicensed or untrained workers. The hardest for homeowners to detect, and therefore the easiest for scammers to pull off, are repairs or improvements to the areas of your home that you can\u2019t see: roofs, chimneys, air ducts, crawl spaces, etc. Scammers may simply knock at your door offering a great deal because they were \u201cin the neighborhood,\u201d but more and more they are using telemarketing, email and even social media to reach homeowners. Helpful videos on YouTube can add legitimacy to a contractor, but consumers have no way of knowing if the video is real or \u201cborrowed\u201d from a legitimate contractor. Check out home contractors at bbb.org before saying yes.\n\nCasting Call Scam \u2013 This is not as widespread as some other scams, but it seems to have really been on the increase in recent years, thanks to the popularity of television talent shows like \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and \u201cProject Runway.\u201d Scammers pose as agents or talent scouts looking for actors, singers, models, reality show contestants, etc., and use phony audition notices to fool aspiring performers into paying to try out for parts that don't exist. There are several ways this plays out. It can simply be an unscrupulous way to sell acting lessons, photography services, etc., or it can be an outright scam for things like fees for online \u201capplications\u201d or upcoming \u201ccasting calls.\u201d Even worse, the information provided on an online application could be everything a scammer needs for identity theft.\n\nForeign Currency Scam \u2013 Investments in foreign currency can sound like a great idea, and scammers frequently use real current events and news stories to make their pitches even more appealing. They advertise an easy investment with high return and low risk when you purchase Iraqi Dinar, Vietnamese Dong or, most recently, the Egyptian Pound. The plan is that, when those governments revalue their currencies, increasing their worth against the dollar, you just sell and cash in. Unlike previous hoaxes, you may even take possession of real currency. The problem is that they will be very difficult to sell, and it's extremely unlikely they will ever significantly increase in value.\n\nScam Texts \u2013 With online and mobile banking skyrocketing, it\u2019s not a surprise that scams quickly follow. One major tactic recently is the use of scam texts, known as \u201csmishing,\u201d to steal personal information. They look like a text alert from your bank, asking you to confirm information or \u201creactivate your debit card\u201d by following a link on your smart phone. Banks of all sizes have been targeted, and details of the scam vary, but the outcome is the same: scammers get your banking information, maybe even your ATM number and PIN. You may even inadvertently download malicious software that gives the scammer access to anything on your phone.\n\nDo Not Call Scams \u2013 The National Do Not Call Registry (U.S.) or the National Do Not Call List (Canada) offer consumers a free way to reduce telemarketing calls. Scammers call anyway, of course, and they\u2019ve even found a way to scam consumers by pretending to be a government official calling to sign you up or confirming your previous participation on the Dot Not call list! In one variation, scammers ask for personal information, such as your name, address and Social Security/Social Insurance number. In another, scammers try to charge a fee to join the registry. Either way, just hang up. These services are free, but sharing personal information with a scammer could cost you a lot.\n\nFake Friend Scam \u2013 Did you ever get a Friend Request on Facebook from someone you already thought was your Friend? If you hit Accept, you may have just friended a scammer. A popular recent scam has been the theft of people\u2019s online identities to create fake profiles, which can be used in a variety of ways. A new Friend can learn a lot about you to scam you later, \u201crecommend\u201d sketchy websites that download malware, use your account to scrap information on your other Friends, even impersonate a military officer or other trustworthy person to perpetrate a romance scam. Be careful on social media, keep your privacy settings high, and don\u2019t share confidential information. You can\u2019t always be sure that your Friends are really your friends.\n\nScam of the Year: Affordable Care Act Scam\n\nScammers had a field day with the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d), using it as a way to fool Americans into sharing their personal information. Scammers would call claiming to be from the federal government and saying the would-be victim needed a new insurance card or Medicare card. However, before they can mail the card, they need to collect personal information. Scammers do a lot to make their requests seem credible. For example, they may have your bank's routing number and ask you to provide your account number. Or, they may ask for your credit card or Social Security number, Medicare ID, or other personal information. But sharing personal information with a scammer puts you at risk for identity theft.\n\nMore information for consumers:\n\nFor more information on these and other scams, go to BBB Scamstopper.
