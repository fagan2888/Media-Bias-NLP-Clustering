Suddenly foes of the deal were back in the news, accusing Iran of breaking the agreement.\n\nThe White House and Iran countered that the launch did not violate the nuclear deal because it does not include missile testing. Even so, a group of Senate Democrats responded with a letter to Secretary of State John F. Kerry denouncing Iran\u2019s move as a violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 and calling for \u201cunilateral and multilateral responses.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Top 10 U.S. fighter jets\n\n\u201cThere must be no ambiguity in our willingness to enforce Iran\u2019s obligations under UN resolutions and the JCPOA,\u201d said the Oct. 21 letter signed by 11 Democratic senators.\n\nOnly two of those \u2014 Sens. Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland and Charles E. Schumer of New York \u2014 voted against the deal.\n\nThe episode exemplifies a worst-case scenario for Democrats as they head into next year\u2019s election, namely that Iran will give Republicans ample \u201cI-told-you-so\u201d opportunities by breaking the agreement, violating other international sanctions or keeping the issue in the public eye with recurring acts of aggression or anti-U.S. rhetoric.\n\nPHOTOS: BOOM! U.S. military turns ISIS targets to rubble\n\nHouse Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman Edward R. Royce weighed in after the formal adoption of the nuclear agreement on Oct. 18, known as Adoption Day, by ticking off a list of Iran\u2019s recent transgressions, including Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani\u2019s travel to Moscow in violation of sanctions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sure tough to look at Iran\u2019s actions over the last three months \u2014 let alone 35 years \u2014 and think Tehran will live up to its end of the nuclear bargain,\u201d Mr. Royce said in a statement. \u201cIf this is what the last 90 days look like, the next few years look like a disaster.\u201d\n\nOne day after the long-range missile launch, Iran was hit with more criticism for convicting Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian on espionage charges, prompting a blast from House Speaker John A. Boehner.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s gamble that a nuclear deal would lead to a more responsible Iran has already failed,\u201d Mr. Boehner said. \u201cThis sham of a trial violated every international standard and made a mockery of Iran\u2019s own legal system.\u201d\n\nSenate Republicans, joined by four Democrats, approved a resolution of disapproval Sept. 10 by 58-42 but were unable to muster the 60 votes needed to override President Obama\u2019s veto.\n\nThe advocacy group J Street, which ran ads in favor of the nuclear deal leading up to the Senate vote, agreed that the ICBM test was a \u201cgratuitous violation of a U.N. Security Council Resolution\u201d but insisted that it did not breach the JCPOA itself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that groups who oppose the JCPOA are seeking to cast every instance of Iranian bad behavior as a violation of it,\u201d said J Street Vice President of Government Affairs Dylan Williams. \u201cIt would be much better for U.S. and Israeli security if those still hoping to kill the deal pivoted to working with the U.S. government to ensure its strict implementation.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little indication, however, that opponents of the JCPOA intend to back off given the enormous media and political campaign waged over the summer in an effort to defeat the agreement, which lifts economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear capability.\n\nOpponents like the American Security Initiative and Citizens for Nuclear Free Iran outspent supporters like J Street as of Sept. 4 by a margin of $13 million to $2 million, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing Kantar Media.\n\nMichael Pregent, executive director of Veterans Against the Deal, said his organization is weighing the possibility of more ads tied to the ICBM launch even before the election season gets underway.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re contemplating putting something out talking about these violations,\u201d said Mr. Pregent. \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely be getting these up before implementation during the presidential election. We\u2019ll highlight Iran\u2019s violations. If the last 90 days are any indication of what Iran plans to do over the next 15 months, then we know that it\u2019s not going to be a good year.\u201d\n\nThe National Iranian American Council said on its blog that recent events may represent an initial response to the deal by Iranian \u201chardliners digging in\u201d over \u201ctrepidation with shifting events while foreshadowing a continued struggle over Iran\u2019s direction,\u201d not a sign of things to come.\n\n\u201cThis was far from unexpected, as many observers predicted an initial hardening as factions seek to balance against the success and popularity of [President Hassan] Rouhani and his team,\u201d said the Oct. 16 post.\n\nEven so, Mark Dubowitz, executive director of Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the ICBM test has direct implications for Iran\u2019s compliance with the deal, which is aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cIran is already in violation of the key U.N. Security Council Resolution (1929) that prohibits the development and testing of ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead,\u201d Mr. Dubowitz said.\n\n\u201cThis prohibition extends to the new USCR (2232) that will come into effect after Iran has complied with its nuclear commitments and that also gives effect to the JCPOA,\u201d he said. \u201cTo permit Iran to develop with impunity one of the key elements of the nuclear trinity (ballistic missile, warhead, weapons-grade uranium) is to run a grave risk that Iran will continue on the path to the development of an atomic weapon.\u201d\n\nAdam Turner, general counsel and legislative affairs director at the Endowment for Middle East Truth, said the JCPOA\u2019s actual prohibitions are still something of a moving target given reports that the Iran parliament approved an amended version earlier this month.\n\nIn addition, the official JCPOA is \u201cvery ambiguous, so it is hard to tell if even that is violated,\u201d Mr. Turner said.\n\nCertainly Republicans see the agreement as a winning issue given the polling prior to the Senate vote. A Pew Research Center poll released Sept. 8 found that those approving of the deal had fallen to 21 percent, with 49 percent disapproving.\n\n\u201cThe Iran nuclear agreement is likely to be one of the major issues in 2016 because foreign policy has a Republican advantage,\u201d said Denver political analyst Floyd Ciruli, \u201cand they intend on highlighting it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "For any Democrat anxious to see the unpopular Iran nuclear agreement fade from public view between now and November 2016, it's been a rough couple of weeks.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "For any Democrat anxious to see the unpopular Iran nuclear agreement fade from public view between now and November 2016, it\u2019s been a rough couple of weeks.", "title": "Iranian aggression since Obama nuclear deal looms as 2016 headache for Democrats", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/25/iranian-aggression-since-obama-nuclear-deal-looms-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/25/IranMissile.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/25/IranMissile.jpg", "description": "For any Democrat anxious to see the unpopular Iran nuclear agreement fade from public view between now and November 2016, it's been a rough couple of weeks.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Iranian aggression since Obama nuclear deal looms as 2016 headache for"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Gop Senate, Iran"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3252\"", "article_summary": "For any Democrat anxious to see the unpopular Iran nuclear agreement fade from public view between now and November 2016, it\u2019s been a rough couple of weeks.\nThe White House and Iran countered that the launch did not violate the nuclear deal because it does not include missile testing.\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s gamble that a nuclear deal would lead to a more responsible Iran has already failed,\u201d Mr. Boehner said.\n\u201cThe Iran nuclear agreement is likely to be one of the major issues in 2016 because foreign policy has a Republican advantage,\u201d said Denver political analyst Floyd Ciruli, \u201cand they intend on highlighting it.\u201d\nSuddenly foes of the deal were back in the news, accusing Iran of breaking the agreement."}
