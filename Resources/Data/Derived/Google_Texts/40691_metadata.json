More than 10 points separated White from the rest of the field for the entire contest as he unleashed his frustration after finishing last in Friday\u2019s slopestyle contest.\n\nOregon\u2019s Ben Ferguson, 21, was smooth in the transitions and explosive in the air, earning silver with lofty double-corks on his final run. U.S. Open defending champion Taku Hiraoka, of Japan, which boasts a stable of up-and-coming riders who are challenging America\u2019s long-standing dominance, took silver with the contest\u2019s only front-side 1440 at the bottom of the pipe, finishing 0.4 points behind Ferguson.\n\nThe crowd favorite was unquestionably Judd Henkes, a 14-year-old who climbed into the finals after winning the U.S. Open\u2019s pre-event junior jam. While lacking the veterans\u2019 technicality, Henkes had some of the most stratospheric airs of the contest.\n\nThe women\u2019s halfpipe contest was, once again, the Chloe Kim show. Adding an exclamation point to a virtually perfect season, the 15-year-old Kim linked consecutive 1080s to soar past any other competitor. China\u2019s Cai Xuetong earned silver, followed by 32-year-old Kelly Clark, who battled through a hip injury to stick a run that included the front-side 1080 she pioneered, a trick that has enabled her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Kim, to reach the highest level ever seen in women\u2019s halfpipe riding.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Shaun White, Chloe Kim claim titles with great runs", "title": "Shaun White, Chloe Kim claim titles with great runs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/05/shaun-white-chloe-kim-claim-titles-with-great-runs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160305__SBDShaunWhite1.jpg", "height": 493}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160305__SBDShaunWhite1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-05T19:48:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:05:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The women\u2019s halfpipe contest was, once again, the Chloe Kim show.\nAdding an exclamation point to a virtually perfect season, the 15-year-old Kim linked consecutive 1080s to soar past any other competitor.\nMore than 10 points separated White from the rest of the field for the entire contest as he unleashed his frustration after finishing last in Friday\u2019s slopestyle contest.\nVAIL \u2014 In maybe one of the most progressive halfpipe contests ever, a dynamic collection of multitalented snowboarders \u2014 from a Cinderella-story 14-year-old newcomer to technically versed, style-rich veterans \u2014 thrilled thousands gathered at the Vail halfpipe Saturday.\nOregon\u2019s Ben Ferguson, 21, was smooth in the transitions and explosive in the air, earning silver with lofty double-corks on his final run."}
