During Super Bowl week, Peyton Manning stood before the media and talked like a man ready to prove something. He began working out maniacally in February, between trips, between hunts, between speaking engagements.\n\nHe arrived back at Dove Valley in April, appearing ready and rested. He returned to training camp, stronger and leaner, roughly 5 pounds lighter, according to Seattle Seahawks broadcaster and former Manning backup Brock Huard.\n\nManning will make his preseason debut Saturday at Houston, expected to log at least a quarter and possibly as much as a half. He enjoyed a successful training camp \u2014 he\u2019s healthy \u2014 as he reluctantly adjusted to a three days on, one day off routine.\n\nSomething interesting emerged in the process. Teammates began talking. It\u2019s fair to wonder if their praise is because it\u2019s Manning. But this praise, unsolicited in some cases, is based on what they are witnessing in practice.\n\nWATCH: Is it dangerous to play Peyton Manning this weekend against J.J. Watt and the Texans?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different than a year ago. It\u2019s crazy, but he\u2019s throwing the ball a lot harder and even more accurate than last year,\u201d defensive end DeMarcus Ware said. \u201cI think that goes to diet, preparation and how the practices are tailored so they aren\u2019t taxing on the body. He\u2019s the player he\u2019s always been with a little bit more edge.\u201d\n\nManning\u2019s adjustments have extended to his equipment. This has not been the summer of glove. Wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders roused interest last week when he suggested Manning\u2019s velocity improves when he isn\u2019t wearing a glove.\n\n\u201cI feel like he\u2019s trying to get more catches or something, like he\u2019s going through you to try to butter me up,\u201d said Manning, who threw 34 touchdown passes in the first 11 games last season, but only five in the final five. \u201cFor four years, it seems like when there\u2019s not a lot to talk about, the glove is kind of a go-to move.\u201d\n\nManning wears the glove in the cold and poor weather as a concession to the nerve issues he\u2019s experienced since undergoing multiple neck surgeries before joining the Broncos. Does the lack of handwear indicate the nerves are regenerating or that his grip is improving? He smirked and said he wasn\u2019t sure.\n\n\u201cI practiced with (the glove) in the spring, but I haven\u2019t worn it as much during training camp. I don\u2019t really have a set play one way or the other. I feel pretty comfortable with both,\u201d Manning said. \u201cYeah, I should (try) a pickle jar or something (to test his grip). Can I unscrew it?\u201d\n\nComfort remains a theme Saturday as Manning shows how he fits in coach Gary Kubiak\u2019s offense, which centers on a zone-blocking running attack and more under center work. He will work with the first team, minus receiver Emmanuel Sanders who likely will sit out with a hamstring injury. Pro Bowler Demaryius Thomas and tight end Owen Daniels will see their first playing time. Running back C.J. Anderson will receive more carries. And all eyes will be on the offensive line, where center Matt Paradis, left guard Max Garcia and left tackle Ty Sambrailo bring zero regular-season experience. They will attempt to keep Manning safe against the fang-bearing Houston Texans\u2019 J.J. Watt.\n\nWATCH: Why Brock Osweiler must have a good game against Texans\n\n\u201cThose guys have worked hard. They\u2019ve improved just during camp,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThis will be a good test. You\u2019re trying to get ready for a four-quarter game. I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll stay in there, but you want to try to convert some third downs, and I\u2019d think it would be ideal to get some red-zone work and some goal-line short yardage.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
