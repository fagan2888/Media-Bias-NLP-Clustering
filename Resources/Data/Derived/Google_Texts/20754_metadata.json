Hobby Lobby, the Obama Administration has doubled down on its coercive, anti-life policies, refusing to respect the beliefs of those who do not wish to provide coverage of life-ending drugs and devices,\u201d said Americans United for Life President Charmaine Yoest.\n\nIncluding these two cases, AUL has filed 23 briefs in challenges to Obamacare\u2019s HHS Mandate that requires employers to offer life-ending drugs and devices in health insurance policies. In our briefs, AUL defends the constitutional rights of all Americans when it comes to healthcare purchases.\n\nACTION: Sign the Petition to SUPPORT the Duggar Family! Keep 19 Kids and Counting on the air!\n\nYoest tells LifeNews that the Obama administration didn\u2019t back down int he face of the Hobby Lobby decision. Instead, Obama officials doubled down by releasing new guidelines for how employers who object to the abortion mandate because of their religious views can supposedly opt out. The problem is that the new guidelines just repeat the previous ones and offer no accommodation for employers who don\u2019t want to pay for abortion-causing drugs.\n\nAs AUL tells LifeNews, in a recent and meaningless \u201caccommodation,\u201d the Obama Administration announced that those with religious beliefs opposed to life-ending drugs and devices must hand over to the federal government the name and contact information \u201cfor any of the plan\u2019s third party administrators and health insurance issuers.\u201d The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) made clear its intention to use the information to force the religious employer\u2019s insurance provider to include the objected-to items and services.\n\n\u201cRather than respecting the beliefs of Americans concerned about the impact of deadly drugs on women and their unborn children, the Obama Administration uses its power to forcibly violate the conscience rights of pro-life Americans,\u201d said Dr. Yoest. \u201cThe accounting gimmicks touted as a fix change nothing.\u201d\n\nAs noted in the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision, if a non-profit religious employer does not \u201cyield to this demand\u201d by the Obama Administration to facilitate coverage for life-ending drugs and devices \u201cthe economic consequences will be severe.\u201d\n\nImportantly, the U.S. Supreme Court in the Hobby Lobby decision held that the Green and Hahn families \u201csincerely believe that providing the insurance coverage demanded by the HHS regulations lies on the forbidden side of the line, and it is not for us to say that their religious beliefs are mistaken or insubstantial.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere, as in Hobby Lobby, it is not for the Obama Administration to determine what \u2018lies on the forbidden side of the line\u2019 for these employers who deserve to enjoy their constitutionally-guaranteed freedom of conscience,\u201d said Yoest.\n\nOne brief (available here) was filed in the Fifth Circuit in the consolidated cases of East Baptist University v. Burwell, University of Dallas v. Burwell, Catholic Diocese of Beaumont v. Burwell, and Catholic Charities, Diocese of Fort Worth v. Burwell. The second brief (available here) was filed in the Eighth Circuit in Archdiocese of St. Louis v. Burwell. In each of the cases, a lower court had ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, and the Obama Administration appealed.\n\nIn the briefs, AUL demonstrates that the life of a new human being begins at fertilization (conception), that so-called \u201cemergency contraception\u201d has a post-fertilization effect that can prevent a new human being from implanting in the uterus and thus ending his or her young life, and that forcing employers to provide coverage for life-ending drugs or devices violates their freedom of conscience.\n\nThe briefs were filed on behalf of Association of American Physicians & Surgeons, American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Christian Medical Association, Catholic Medical Association, The National Catholic Bioethics Center, Alabama Physicians for Life, National Association of Pro Life Nurses, and National Association of Catholic Nurses.\n\n\u201cReal healthcare respects life,\u201d noted Dr. Yoest. \u201cWhether the issue is punishing Americans for their beliefs, pushing life-ending drugs that have been deceptively labeled as contraception, or creating new income streams for the abortion industry, the anti-life implications of Obamacare are far reaching.\u201d\n\nAbortion is woven into Obamacare at multiple levels, making repeal of the law a pro-life necessity.
