(Newser) – A doctor in Germany says Fox medical drama House helped him find the right diagnosis for a heart failure patient whose symptoms had baffled others for months. The 55-year-old patient reportedly went from doctor to doctor for a year, but none of them could figure out why he was going deaf, blind, and suffering from extreme heart failure. But Dr. Juergen Schaefer, who is reportedly a huge fan of the show and uses it to teach medical students about diagnosing strange diseases, quickly realized the man's symptoms were almost identical to those suffered by one of the fictional patients featured on House. It turned out the real-life patient had the same problem—and was cured.
