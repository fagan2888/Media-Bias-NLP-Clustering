Had Xi arrived a year ago, he\u2019d have done so at the helm of a country expanding prodigiously through trade and investment while slowly opening its markets to global companies all but begging for access to its growing middle class.\n\nWhat a difference a year makes. These days, just about the only person warning about China\u2019s economic dominance is billionaire presidential candidate Donald Trump, who constantly complains that China is \u201ceating our lunch\u201d in global trade.\n\nRelated: The Pope Was a Breeze for Obama\u2026China\u2019s President Xi Is Another Story\n\nThe Chinese economic model \u201chas run out of steam, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson told CNBC earlier this week.\u201dThe only way to have real competition that's going to benefit the Chinese economy is to open up to foreign competition so you have the best businesses and the most efficient businesses competing there.\u201d\n\nNow though, Xi is being forced to confront business leaders who are a little more wary about getting involved in China than they\u2019ve been in the past.\n\nThey have watched Chinese manufacturing activity drop to levels not seen in nearly seven years.\n\nXi began his trip to the U.S. on the West Coast, where on Tuesday he had to defend the growth prospects of the Chinese economy before an audience of business leaders. They have watched Chinese manufacturing activity drop to levels not seen in nearly seven years, even as the country\u2019s nascent stock market continues to writhe from the aftereffects of the recent crash that sent shockwaves around the globe.\n\n\u201cOur economy is under pressure but that is part of the path on the way toward growth,\u201d Xi told the group.\n\nRelated: Why U.S. Investors Shouldn\u2019t Be So Worried About China\n\nThat same day, however, the Asian Development Bank released its latest estimate of Chinese GDP growth for 2015 and 2016, and the news was not good. The bank cut its growth estimate from 7.2 percent to 6.8 percent for 2015, and from 7.0 percent to 6.7 percent for 2016.\n\nWhile these numbers remain high relative to growth rates in developed countries, they represent a real decline in China, where the booming economy, just five years ago, was growing at more than 10 percent per year.\n\nTo be sure, China\u2019s long-term growth prospects are still very positive \u2013 something the Asian Development Bank remarked on even as it cuts its GDP estimates for this year and next.\n\n\u201cIn addition to less favorable demographics and higher wage costs, the PRC\u2019s adjustment to a new growth model that is based more on innovation, consumption, and services will bring with it more moderate growth,\u201d ADB Chief Economist Shang-Jin Wei said in a press release. \u201cAs long as the country continues to pursue pro-market reforms, there is a good chance for the PRC to realize productivity gains and relatively strong future growth rates.\u201d\n\nRelated: China v. Yellen \u2013 3 Scenarios that Will Determine the Fate of the Global Economy\n\nHowever, as recent events in the country have made clear, China\u2019s journey toward a modern, market-based economy is unlikely to follow a smooth path.\n\nThe Chinese government made rising share prices a point of national pride, and encouraged investors to pour money into the market.\n\nThe recent travails of the country\u2019s stock market are instructive. The country\u2019s communist government, perhaps not surprisingly, seems to have been unfamiliar with the \u201cmarket\u201d element of the stock market. Rather than allowing the markets to decide for themselves whether companies listed on the exchange were worth investing in, the Chinese government made rising share prices a point of national pride, and encouraged investors to pour money into the market, artificially inflating a bubble and removing, in large part, the skepticism and due diligence necessary for a smoothly functioning system.\n\nThe result was the August crash that combined with the government\u2019s ham-handed attempts to stabilize the situation \u2013 including forcing large shareholders in public companies to retain their holdings for a minimum of six months \u2013 kept global markets on a roller coaster for more than a month.\n\nRelated: 3 Major Lessons from the China Crisis that Wasn\u2019t\n\nIn addition to the ban on selling shares, the government also devalued the renminbi, China\u2019s currency, and slashed reserve requirements at banks. The combined and ineffective efforts to stop the bleeding in the markets made global investors nervous for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it looked as though the government didn\u2019t really have control over its economy. Second, it signaled that the ruling Communist Party\u2019s first instinct in the event of a market panic was to restrict the ability of investors to act freely.\n\nXi was forced to defend the government\u2019s handling of the crisis when he addressed business leaders in Seattle, insisting that they had worked, and that the markets had reached what he called \u201ca phase of self-recovery.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s clearly hoping that his visit to the U.S. will spur some recovery in China\u2019s attractiveness to foreign businesses as well.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Had Chinese President Xi Jinping come to the U.S. a year ago, representatives of the U.S. business community would likely have been falling all over themselves to get in his good graces.
