The final rule also requires covered health programs and activities to treat individuals consistent with their gender identity. For individuals with disabilities, the final rule requires covered entities to make all programs and activities provided through electronic and information technology accessible; to ensure the physical accessibility of newly constructed or altered facilities; and to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services for individuals with disabilities. Covered entities are also prohibited from using marketing practices or benefit designs that discriminate on the basis of disability and other prohibited bases. Covered entities must take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to each individual with limited English proficiency eligible to be served or likely to be encountered in their health programs and activities. In addition, covered entities are encouraged to develop and implement a language access plan. The final rule on Section 1557 does not include a religious exemption; however, the final rule does not displace existing protections for religious freedom and conscience.\n\nDuring a week of threats of the loss of federal funding to states and schools that do not bow down to its contrived gender ideology, the Obama administration now forces doctors and hospitals to do the same \u2013 or else have their Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursements eliminated.\n\n\u201cAs bad as the ACA is, it\u2019s laughable to suggest that when Congress referred to \u2018sex\u2019 in Section 1557 it was referring to anything other than biological sex,\u201d says Breitbart News Legal Editor and religious liberty lawyer with First Liberty Institute Ken Klukowski, adding:\n\nThis is Orwellian. But beyond that, it is an unconstitutional assault on the First Amendment that the Obama administration is forcing their rejection of biological fact onto people whose faith teaches that \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 refer to what they have meant for thousands of years, and that God purposefully created them that way.\n\nFamily Research Council (FRC) voiced its opposition to the new rule: \u201cFamily Research Council is strongly opposed to the new Obamacare final rule mandating federally funded health care providers offer services that include gender transition and even abortion,\u201d said FRC Vice President of Government Affairs David Christensen on Friday. \u201cHHS\u2019s final rule concocts out of thin air a redefinition of sex discrimination to include both gender identity and abortion.\u201d\n\nChristensen explains:\n\nThis intolerant and unjust rule, in turn, threatens to force health care providers to participate in and perform services that substantially violate their consciences. HHS\u2019s regulatory overreach to force \u201cgender identity\u201d into Obamacare through the language of \u201csex discrimination\u201d mirrors the administration\u2019s actions earlier today imposing gender identity on America\u2019s public schools. Despite concerns raised by FRC and others that the proposed rule also included abortion, the administration chose instead not to exclude it. This action erodes Americans\u2019 freedom to believe and act in accordance with their beliefs, not only as it relates to the privacy of the bathrooms but also now when it comes to the taking of innocent human life. We urge Congress to address this gross injustice.\n\nDr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, tells Breitbart News the new rule amounts to the Obama administration attempting to turn the traditional code of medical ethics on its head.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the government is presuming to dictate medical ethics, and to turn them upside down: Thou SHALT do whatever we say, rather than thou SHALT NOT do evil things, such as killing, harming, or lying to patients,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the Oath of Hippocrates, physicians swear to God, not government to \u201cfollow that method of treatment which, according to my ability and judgment, I consider for the benefit of my patients\u201d \u2013 not to follow bureaucratic guidelines for the benefit of \u2018population health.\u2019\u201d\n\nOrient added:\n\nTransgender treatment, especially to minors, inflicts irreversible harm on persons too young to consent. It constitutes radical, nonconsented social experimentation. Chemical or surgical castration should be considered a crime against humanity. Affirming a patient\u2019s delusions (e.g. that he really is a she) is considered psychiatric malpractice in other contexts.\n\nOrient said that such a rule will lead conscientious doctors and hospitals to stop accepting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements from the federal government in order to be free to conduct their medical practices using their own ethics and consciences as their guide.\n\n\u201cTo preserve their integrity and avoid being an accessory to crimes against humanity, doctors and hospitals will have to turn down the government money,\u201d she explained. \u201cThis will also free them from a suffocating burden of costly regulations, enabling them to offer superior care at a fraction of today\u2019s prices\u2013and to preserve patient privacy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama Admin Rule Forces Hospitals, Doctors Accepting Federal Funds to Provide Gender Transition Services and Abortions", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama Admin Rule Forces Hospitals, Doctors Accepting Federal Funds to Provide Gender Transition Services and Abortions", "title": "Obama Admin Rule Forces Hospitals, Doctors Accepting Federal Funds to Provide Gender Transition Services and Abortions - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Dr.-in-Treatment-Room-Paul-White-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/05/14/obama-admin-rule-forces-hospitals-doctors-accepting-federal-funds-provide-gender-transition-services-abortions/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama Admin Rule Forces Hospitals, Doctors Accepting Federal Funds to Provide Gender Transition Services and Abortions", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Dr.-in-Treatment-Room-Paul-White-AP.jpg", "title": "Obama Admin Rule Forces Hospitals, Doctors Accepting Federal Funds to Provide Gender Transition Services and Abortions - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, coercion, Family Research council, federal funding, first amendment, gender ideology, HHS, LGBT agenda, medicaid, Medicare, Obama administration, Religious freedom, transgender treatment,Abortion, Big Government, Medicine,Obama rule", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Abortion", "tag": "transgender treatment", "published_time": "2016-05-14T10:49:11-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Abortion,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The final rule on Section 1557 does not include a religious exemption; however, the final rule does not displace existing protections for religious freedom and conscience.\nThe Obama administration claims its new rule \u201cbuilds on\u201d prior federal civil rights laws to prohibit sex discrimination in health care.\nThe final rule also requires covered health programs and activities to treat individuals consistent with their gender identity.\nHHS\u2019s regulatory overreach to force \u201cgender identity\u201d into Obamacare through the language of \u201csex discrimination\u201d mirrors the administration\u2019s actions earlier today imposing gender identity on America\u2019s public schools.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Obama administration is capping off a week of forcing Americans to accept gender ideology as normal with a final rule on Obamacare\u2019s nondiscrimination policies in healthcare."}
