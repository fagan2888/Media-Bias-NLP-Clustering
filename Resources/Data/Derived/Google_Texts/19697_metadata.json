When eaten at periodic intervals, the candy was found to fight the harmful effects of acid-producing bacteria that can eventually lead to cavities.\n\nGerman researchers from the Berlin-based firm Organobalance GmbH initiated their pilot study hoping to find a way to counteract the effects of poor oral health. When \u201cbad\u201d bacteria in sugary foods exceeds the good bacteria in saliva and other remineralization factors, such as those from calcium and fluoridated toothpastes, the bad bacteria begins to erode the hard tissues surrounding teeth. If not properly cleaned, these teeth eventually develop dental caries, or, as they\u2019re more commonly known, cavities.\n\nAround the world, cavities stand as perhaps the most prevalent condition plaguing oral health, with some 2.43 billion people \u2014 or 36 percent of the world\u2019s population \u2014 having one or more dental caries. In the U.S. alone, they are the most common chronic childhood disease, at least five times more prevalent than asthma, according to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. More often than not, a person\u2019s cavities are caused by one of two bacteria, or a combination of both: Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Lactobacillus paracasei (L. paracasei). Observing S. mutans to play a larger role, the researchers focused their attention solely on the one bacterium to conduct their study.\n\nThe double-blind, randomized trial included 20 participants per study group: a placebo-controlled group, a test of 1mg-bacteria candies, and a test of 2mg-bacteria candies. Participants weren\u2019t allowed to perform any oral health activities from the night before the trial to the morning after, excluding from their diet coffee, tea, wine, and probiotic foods (to minimize bacteria exposure). Over the 1.5-day study period, the participants consumed three candies, one 10 minutes after each meal, and produced a saliva sample for later testing.\n\nThe results showed the test group\u2019s candies to be significantly more effective at reducing bad bacteria levels than the placebo. Some 80 percent of test group subjects experienced reduced S. mutans bacteria, compared to the placebo group, at 59 percent. Over the two days of tests, the placebo group\u2019s bacteria levels dropped at slowing rates. Meanwhile, the test group\u2019s effectiveness continued to rise over the study period.\n\n\u201cWe think it remarkable that this effect was observed after exposure to only \ufb01ve pieces of candy containing 1 or 2 mg of dead L. paracasei DSMZ16671 (the good bacteria) consumed in 1.5 days,\u201d the researchers explained. However, they still conceded that \u201cwhile this represented \u2018real-life conditions,\u2019 it did probably contribute to statistical variation. Future studies are planned with larger populations with more homogeneous mutans streptococcal level subjects.\u201d\n\nSource: Holz C, Alexander C, Balke C.
