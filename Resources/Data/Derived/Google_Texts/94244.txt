Huffington Post “honored” Fox News’ 19th birthday last week in the best way possible: by highlighting its most ridiculous moments, one for each year. I’m adding two of my own.

From Huffington Post:

Since launching on Oct. 7, 1996, Fox has grown into a reliable ratings juggernaut among cable news stations by elevating bombastic personalities, keeping its coverage unabashedly right-leaning and frequently stoking conservative fears. To commemorate the anniversary of America's most controversial cable network, we've compiled some of the most outlandish, offensive and off-putting moments Fox News has ever aired.

Some of my faves from their list: Megyn Kelly insisting that Santa Claus is white, Andrea Tantaros talking up how good she'd look on a food stamp diet, the War on Christmas, the “terrorist fist jab” and the epic confrontation between the anti-war son of a 9/11 victim and Bill O’Reilly.

But here are the two I’d add:

1) Sean Hannity’s slavery-apologist pal complaining that, “Most blacks, not all but most in Tennessee, especially in the Memphis, Tennessee area” are "so racist" and use race “to intimidate white America.” Hannity refused to allow his other guest to object.

2) Red Eye’s mocking and smearing of the Canadian army which was fighting in one of the most dangerous areas in Afghanistan and taking a disproportionately high number of casualties. The segment caused such an outcry that host Greg Gutfeld was later forced to apologize.

Watch those two below and let me know what you think belong in the list of most ridiculous or outrageous.
