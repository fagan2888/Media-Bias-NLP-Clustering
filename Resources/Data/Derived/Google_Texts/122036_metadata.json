The effort also may help them get housing and other necessary services.\n\nHomeless patients often delay care and end up at the hospital, where doctors are left to manage their complex health conditions as well as their social needs. \u201cThey are very complicated patients,\u201d said Michael Cousineau, a health policy expert at University of Southern California\u2019s Keck School of Medicine. \u201cIt creates tremendous challenges for the system and the providers.\u201d\n\nEngaging homeless people and bringing them into medical care, Cousineau said, \u201cis a very important first step to helping stabilize this population.\u201d\n\nOutreach and enrollment among the homeless is challenging, however, in large part because many are addicted to drugs or are mentally ill, and they distrust government and public programs. Homeless people are transient and usually lack permanent mailing addresses. And while many live in plain sight, others are harder to find, hidden beneath bridges or under freeway overpasses.\n\nMack knows the barriers well. A former addict himself, he spent decades on the streets before getting clean.

Medi-Cal will help patients get better access to neurologists, gastroenterologists and others, health officials said.\n\nBut the coverage doesn\u2019t guarantee regular medical care, experts said. There is already a shortage of both primary care doctors and specialists, and budget cuts in California have led to among the lowest reimbursement rates for Medicaid doctors and hospitals in the nation.\n\n\u2018God Bless You\u2019\n\nAt the busy JWCH clinic the morning after Mack\u2019s Skid Row visit, enrollment workers were busy signing up patients for Medi-Cal coverage and making sure they knew where to go for care.\n\nGeorge Farag, 56, who sleeps at a local mission each night, said he lost his job as a security guard when he fell asleep on duty.
