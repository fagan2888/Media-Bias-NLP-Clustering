After all, the United States has produced many of the world\u2019s finest entrepreneurs, from Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford to Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg. The American obsession with innovation has even invaded popular culture. Shark Tank, a reality television show in which entrepreneurs pitch to potential angel investors, has reached its sixth season and draws more than six million viewers a week. Silicon Valley, a new comedy on HBO, follows the founders of a technology start-up as they attempt to strike it rich. Meanwhile, the near-celebrity status of prominent tech entrepreneurs, such as Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, has spurred interest in the so-called STEM subjects\u2014science, technology, engineering, and math\u2014and in entrepreneurship more generally.\n\nThe numbers, however, tell a different story. Over the past 30 years, the rate of start-up formation in the United States has slowed markedly, and the technology industry has come to be dominated by older companies. This presents a risk to innovation, because the most transformative leaps forward tend to come not from established firms but from entrepreneurs with little to lose. Indeed, start-ups commercialized most of the seminal technologies of the past several centuries, including the car, the airplane, the telegraph, the telephone, the computer, and the Internet search engine. If the United States wishes to reclaim its status as an innovation hub, it must reform a wide swath of policies\u2014including those covering immigration, business regulation, health care, and education\u2014", "article_metadata": {"description": "Over the past 30 years, the rate of start-up formation in the United States\u00a0has slowed down.\u00a0To reclaim its status as a hub of innovation, the United States must tackle reforms in many areas, from immigration and business regulation to health care and education.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Foreign Affairs", "description": "Over the past 30 years, the rate of start-up formation in the United States\u00a0has slowed down.\u00a0To reclaim its status as a hub of innovation, the United States must tackle reforms in many areas, from immigration and business regulation to health care and education.", "title": "Start-Up Slowdown", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2014-12-15/start-slowdown", "image": {"width": 784, "secure_url": "https://files.foreignaffairs.com/styles/large-crop-landscape/s3/legacy/images/Litan_StartupSlowdown_graph.jpg?itok=gzailZcA", "identifier": "https://files.foreignaffairs.com/styles/large-crop-landscape/s3/legacy/images/Litan_StartupSlowdown_graph.jpg?itok=gzailZcA", "height": 620}, "updated_time": "2016-02-22T19:32:16-05:00", "type": "article"}, "abstract": "Over the past 30 years, the rate of start-up formation in the United States\u00a0has slowed down.\u00a0To reclaim its status as a hub of innovation, the United States must tackle reforms in many areas, from immigration and business regulation to health care and education.", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "keywords": "Entrepreneurship, innovation, start-ups, business, government, uber news, oakland startups,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ForeignAffairs", "published_time": "2016-02-22T19:32:16-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-22T19:32:16-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Over the past 30 years, the rate of start-up formation in the United States\u00a0has slowed down.\u00a0To reclaim its status as a hub of innovation, the United States must tackle reforms in many areas, from immigration and business regulation to health care and education.", "creator": "@foreignaffairs", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2014-12-15/start-slowdown", "image": {"src": "https://files.foreignaffairs.com/styles/large-crop-landscape/s3/legacy/images/Litan_StartupSlowdown.jpg?itok=OgrS0lK9, https://files.foreignaffairs.com/styles/large-crop-landscape/s3/legacy/images/Litan_StartupSlowdown_graph.jpg?itok=gzailZcA", "width": "3994, 784", "height": "2486, 620"}, "title": "Start-Up Slowdown", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1cc\"", "article_summary": "Silicon Valley, a new comedy on HBO, follows the founders of a technology start-up as they attempt to strike it rich.\nOver the past 30 years, the rate of start-up formation in the United States has slowed markedly, and the technology industry has come to be dominated by older companies.\nAfter all, the United States has produced many of the world\u2019s finest entrepreneurs, from Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford to Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg.\nIf the United States wishes to reclaim its status as an innovation hub, it must reform a wide swath of policies\u2014including those covering immigration, business regulation, health care, and education\u2014\nThis presents a risk to innovation, because the most transformative leaps forward tend to come not from established firms but from entrepreneurs with little to lose."}
