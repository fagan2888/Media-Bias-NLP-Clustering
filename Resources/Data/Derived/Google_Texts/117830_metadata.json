Over the last ten years, significantly in the last few months with the emergence of ISIS, that figure has dropped to about 400,000.\n\nIn a region where Christians predate Muslims by centuries, over one million Christians have been killed or have had to flee because of jihadi persecution, while America is basically standing by and watching. This is the sad news that Breitbart\u2019s National Security Editor and one of the world\u2019s leading experts on asymmetric warfare, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, brought to Breitbart News Saturday, hosted by Editor in Chief Alex Marlow on Sirius XM Patriot Radio.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nDr. Gorka explained that \u201cin the last 48 hours, ISIS, which is now called the Islamic State in Mosul, has painted the letter \u201cN\u201d for Nazarene on the houses of all the surviving Christians in the city. ISIS has basically given an ultimatum to all the Christians left: You can either flee or convert to Islam, or we will kill you.\u201d\n\nGorka points out that, over the last 20 years, America has stood up around the world to save Muslims. \u201cWhether it was to save the Muslims in Bosnia or the Albanians, Kosovars, and Muslims in Serbia, it is now time for a humanitarian operation to save the remaining Christians in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is time for the American people and our representatives to do something for our co-religionists remaining in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nMarlow observed that the blatant religious cleansing is horrifying and asked Gorka: \u201cWhy is it that the mainstream press is not interested in the story?\u201d Gorka first responded by saying \u201cLet\u2019s face it, this is a Christian version of the Holocaust and nothing less.\u201d\n\nThe Middle East expert went on to explain that the mainstream media is in full support of the White House narrative \u201cthat the President single-handedly killed Osama Bin Laden, and that Al Qaeda is now on the ropes; therefore, jihad must be shriveling up around the world.\u201d This myopic strategy of only targeting Al Qaeda has provided great opportunities for other jihadists and has given rise to ISIS.\n\n\u201cOn top of that,\u201d Gorka asserts that, \u201cthe mainstream media are warped in terms of their world view.\u201d According to Breitbart\u2019s national security expert, the media is \u201cpost-modernist, sophisticated, and secularist. So when it comes to the idea of religious persecution, they say, \u2018Well who really cares because I don\u2019t believe in God. If you are not sophisticated enough to be a post-modernist secularist\u2026 tough on you!'\u201d\n\nGorka didn\u2019t finish there with his scathing indictment of the mainstream media. He added that it is their racism that will let this genocide of Christians continue. \u201cTo the mainstream media,\u201d Gorka charged, \u201cthe dark skin person always has to be the victim. Either the Hamas terrorist in Gaza, the Nicaraguan gang bangers coming across the border likened to juvenile political refugees\u2026 the idea that the white skin Christian or the Israelis as victims, that goes against every narrative this media wishes to pedal. They are necessarily so locked into their own ideological vision of the world.\u201d\n\nMarlow summed it up by saying, \u201cChristians are politically targeted in America frequently; they are being physically targeted in Africa, Syria, and Iraq.\u201d Gorka emphasized that, from his first hand experiences in Africa, Christians will always be blamed for starting any upheaval.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sebastian Gorka: Christian Holocaust Underway in Iraq, USA and World Look On", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Sebastian Gorka: Christian Holocaust Underway in Iraq, USA and World Look On", "title": "Sebastian Gorka: Christian Holocaust Underway in Iraq, USA and World Look On - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/07/19/Iraq-Church-AP-3.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/07/19/christian-holocaust-underway-in-iraq-as-usa-and-world-looks-on/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sebastian Gorka: Christian Holocaust Underway in Iraq, USA and World Look On", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/07/19/Iraq-Church-AP-3.jpg", "title": "Sebastian Gorka: Christian Holocaust Underway in Iraq, USA and World Look On - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Iraq, ISIS, Mainstream Media,National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "National Security", "tag": "Mainstream Media", "published_time": "2014-07-19T19:18:00-07:00", "categories": "National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cTo the mainstream media,\u201d Gorka charged, \u201cthe dark skin person always has to be the victim.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWhen U.S. troops invaded Iraq in 2003, there were at least 1.5 million Christians in Iraq.\n'\u201dGorka didn\u2019t finish there with his scathing indictment of the mainstream media.\n\u201cOn top of that,\u201d Gorka asserts that, \u201cthe mainstream media are warped in terms of their world view.\u201d According to Breitbart\u2019s national security expert, the media is \u201cpost-modernist, sophisticated, and secularist.\nOver the last ten years, significantly in the last few months with the emergence of ISIS, that figure has dropped to about 400,000."}
