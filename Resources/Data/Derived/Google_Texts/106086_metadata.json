Boehner and other House Republicans who contend that the Obama administration is spending billions of dollars without the necessary appropriations from Congress.\n\nThe government is also trying to fend off dozens of lawsuits challenging rules that require health plans to offer women coverage for contraceptives without co-payments or deductibles.\n\nThe suit filed by Mr. Boehner, in the name of the House of Representatives, is not just a bookkeeping dispute. It involves fundamental questions of executive power and Congress\u2019s power of the purse.\n\nAt issue is a provision of the health care law that requires insurance companies to reduce co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for certain low-income people. The federal government reimburses insurers for the \u201ccost-sharing reductions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn their lawsuit, House Republicans say the Obama administration needed, but never received, an appropriation to make these payments to insurance companies. As a result, they contend, the spending violates the Constitution, which says, \u201cNo money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama requested the money as part of the budget he sent to Congress in April 2013, but Congress did not act on the request. Seeing the issue as an urgent priority, the administration began making the payments in early 2014, using money from a separate account established for tax refunds and tax credits.\n\nMore than seven million people have insurance purchased through the federal marketplace. About 60 percent of them receive cost-sharing reductions, which lower their out-of-pocket costs for doctors\u2019 services, hospital care and prescription drugs.\n\nThe discounts are available to people with incomes from 100 percent to 250 percent of the poverty level (roughly $11,700 to $29,300 a year for an individual).\n\nThis type of assistance is different from the subsidies upheld by the Supreme Court on Thursday. The subsidies, in the form of tax credits, help people pay insurance premiums.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that the government will provide $599 billion worth of premium tax credits and $136 billion in cost-sharing payments to insurance companies in the coming decade.\n\nIn their lawsuit, House Republicans say, \u201cCongress has not, and never has, appropriated any funds\u201d for the cost-sharing reductions.\n\nThe Obama administration contends that the House does not have standing to sue because its members have not suffered a concrete injury or specific harm. The case is \u201ca generalized institutional dispute between the executive branch and one chamber of the legislative branch,\u201d the Justice Department said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut at a hearing in Federal District Court here in May, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer expressed skepticism about the government\u2019s argument that she should dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nThe government is also juggling more than 50 cases involving the requirement for coverage of contraceptives. The Supreme Court ruled last year that family-owned for-profit corporations like Hobby Lobby could not be required to provide coverage of contraceptives for their employees if the companies objected on religious grounds.\n\nAfter that decision, the administration issued a rule that it said was intended to accommodate the objections of religious groups.\n\nAt least four federal appeals courts have sided with the government, saying the new rule does not violate rights protected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, upheld the rule this week, saying it did not place a substantial burden on religious employers or require them to \u201cauthorize or facilitate the use of contraceptives.\u201d\n\nCourts elsewhere are considering similar lawsuits, including one filed by the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Roman Catholic nuns.\n\nMark L. Rienzi, senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents plaintiffs in several of the cases, said Friday: \u201cWith its contraceptive mandate, the government is trying to take over the health plans of religious ministries and use them in ways that violate their beliefs. The government can give out contraceptives in other ways without conscripting the Little Sisters of the Poor and their health plans.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials said they were confident that they would prevail in those cases, as they did this week in the subsidies case, King v. Burwell.\n\nSylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, described her relief when she learned of the decision allowing subsidies for people in more than 30 states that use the federal exchange.\n\n\u201cIt was very emotional,\u201d Ms. Burwell said Friday, because she had \u201cmet all these people\u201d who benefited from the law in the last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Burwell said she hoped to persuade more states to expand Medicaid. She said she believed that she could work out agreements with officials from Montana, Tennessee and Utah, for example.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150626203055, "twitter": {"description": "Lawsuits from House Republicans, who say the law spends billions of dollars without the necessary appropriations from Congress, and faith groups challenge the law\u2019s rule on providing contraceptives.", "title": "Legal Challenges Remain for Health Law", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/legal-challenges-remain-for-health-law.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003767591"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/27/us/27HEALTH/27HEALTH-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/legal-challenges-remain-for-health-law.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003767591", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/legal-challenges-remain-for-health-law.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Legal Challenges Remain for Health Law", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 26, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Birth Control and Family Planning,United States Politics and Government,Law and Legislation,Boehner  John A,United States", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/27/us/27HEALTH/27HEALTH-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Boehner, John A", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Lawsuits from House Republicans, who say the law spends billions of dollars without the necessary appropriations from Congress, and faith groups challenge the law\u2019s rule on providing contraceptives.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/27/us/27HEALTH/27HEALTH-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Lawsuits from House Republicans, who say the law spends billions of dollars without the necessary appropriations from Congress, and faith groups challenge the law\u2019s rule on providing contraceptives.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 26, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2015-07-01", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States", "published": "2015-06-26", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "slug": "27health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150701170135, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/legal-challenges-remain-for-health-law.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/27/us/27HEALTH/27HEALTH-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Lawsuits from House Republicans, who say the law spends billions of dollars without the necessary appropriations from Congress, and faith groups challenge the law\u2019s rule on providing contraceptives.", "title": "Legal Challenges Remain for Health Law"}, "pdate": 20150626, "des": "Law and Legislation", "articleid": 100000003767591, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Legal Challenges Remain for Health Law", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd218b\"", "article_summary": "At issue is a provision of the health care law that requires insurance companies to reduce co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for certain low-income people.\nThe Obama administration contends that the House does not have standing to sue because its members have not suffered a concrete injury or specific harm.\nPhotoWASHINGTON \u2014 The Affordable Care Act survived another major test at the Supreme Court this week, all but assuring its place in the social safety net, but the legal challenges to the law are far from over.\nThe suit filed by Mr. Boehner, in the name of the House of Representatives, is not just a bookkeeping dispute.\n\u201cIt was very emotional,\u201d Ms. Burwell said Friday, because she had \u201cmet all these people\u201d who benefited from the law in the last year."}
