The federal Obamacare exchange had ts biggest week so far this season â€” and could break that record this week.

About 1.3 million people signed up for health insurance plans between Dec. 6 and last Saturday, officials said Wednesday.



The surge of customers, which came as a key deadline for enrollment approached, brings HealthCare.gov's sign-up tally to 4.17 million people since enrollment began for 2016 plans on Nov. 1. The federally run marketplace serves residents in 38 states.

Traffic on HealthCare.gov and Obamacare exchanges run by individual states has been very heavy this week, prompting Obamacare officials in most of the United States to give consumers more time to sign up for plans that take effect Jan. 1.
