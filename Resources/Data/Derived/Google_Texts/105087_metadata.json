Most states also limit the time a patient should wait for an appointment, ranging from 10 days in California and Pennsylvania to 60 days in Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nState leaders test their standards differently, and sometimes inadequately, which the audit cautioned could mean that they are \u201cunable to correct problems to improve care.\u201d\n\nMost states rely on information reported to them by insurance companies hired to oversee the care, which the audit said makes it harder to identify problems. Only eight states conducted outside assessments such as \u201csecret shopper\u201d phone calls to doctor\u2019s offices.\n\nThe Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS), which oversees the Medicaid programs, largely concurred with the recommendations and in some cases agreed to deepen its efforts.\n\nAn official from CMS said the agency is weighing options to better communicate the federal standards and plans to address this issue \u201cthrough the development of additional guidance to states.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Each state is largely free to set its own standards for care.", "description": "Each state is largely free to set its own standards for care.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Each state is largely free to set its own standards for care.", "title": "Audit: Medicaid quality of care varies by state", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/219201-audit-medicaid-quality-of-care-varies-by-state", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/219201-audit-medicaid-quality-of-care-varies-by-state", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-29T14:55-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Medicaid,,Health and Human Services Department", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-29T14:55:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/219201-audit-medicaid-quality-of-care-varies-by-state", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Each state is largely free to set its own standards for care.", "card": "summary", "title": "Audit: Medicaid quality of care varies by state"}, "dcterms.title": "Audit: Medicaid quality of care varies by state"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1fb1\"", "article_summary": "More than 50 million people receive healthcare through state-managed Medicaid programs, but the quality of that care varies widely and receives little federal scrutiny, a government audit has found.\nThe Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS), which oversees the Medicaid programs, largely concurred with the recommendations and in some cases agreed to deepen its efforts.\nAn official from CMS said the agency is weighing options to better communicate the federal standards and plans to address this issue \u201cthrough the development of additional guidance to states.\u201d\nEach state is largely free to set its own standards for care, including the distance a patient travels to see a doctor, the time a patient must wait for an appointment and the patient-to-doctor ratio within certain regions.\nMost states also limit the time a patient should wait for an appointment, ranging from 10 days in California and Pennsylvania to 60 days in Massachusetts."}
