Is there anything Will Barton can’t do?

The 25-year-old has just about done it all for the Nuggets. He scores inside and out, rebounds, passes, makes highlight-reel dunks and even throws shoes.

“That’s,” as NBA reporter Christopher Dempsey wrote in his column earlier this month, “Will Barton doing Will Barton things.”

On the season, the 6-foot-6 Barton is averaging career highs in points (15.7), rebounds (6.1), assists (2.3), steals (1.1) and blocks (0.4). But during the month of December, he’s stepped up game with averages of 19.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists — all of this coming off the bench.

“That’s my game — rebounding, scoring, getting some assists, getting out and running, steals, anything,” Barton said in a November interview with The Post. “My job is to go fill the stat sheet up.”

The Nuggets have never had an NBA sixth man of the year winner, but Barton is Denver’s best chance since J.R. Smith finished second in the 2009 vote.

So, who are Barton’s biggest challengers?

• Ryan Anderson, New Orleans: The Pelicans’ outside-shooting power forward is averaging 17.3 points and 6.4 rebounds off the bench. However, his biggest obstacle is the team’s dreadful 9-19 record.

• Alec Burks, Utah: The former Colorado Buffaloes star is putting up a career-best 14.4 points for the Jazz.

• Enes Kanter, Oklahoma City: Although the 23-year-old center has moved to the bench, he is still putting up solid numbers (11.3 points and 8.0 rebounds), providing a big spark for the 20-9 Thunder.

• Jeremy Lin, Charlotte: It’s not quite Linsanity, more like, um, re-Lin-able? Jeremypendable? Or maybe it’s just the hair. The 27-year-old point guard has found a niche as Charlotte’s backup point guard, averaging 11.7 points, 3.1 assists and — this is key — a career-low 2.5 turnovers per game (per 36 minutes).

• Victor Oladipo, Orlando: Losing his starting spot seemed to be a mixed blessing as Oladipo has put up better numbers coming in reserve. On the year, he’s averaging 12.8 points and 3.9 assists for the 17-12 Magic.

Barton should certainly get consideration for the NBA’s most improved player award, too. He averaged just 6.8 points and 2.8 rebounds last year splitting time between Portland and Denver.

“I’d be lying if I said I saw that (coming), to be very honest,” Malone told Post columnist Mark Kiszla Tuesday. “I knew he would be a spark off the bench, with his energy, his passion, his pace at which he plays. He has an attack mentality.”

If he wins the MIP award, he becomes the first Nuggets player since Chris Jackson (yup, pre-Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf days) was honored in 1993.

As this Denver squad continues to learn to play under coach Michael Malone, the team’s success is dependent on how well Barton plays. Where he goes, the Nuggets go.

CHEW ON THIS

• Barton scored 17 for the Nuggets Wednesday, but Randy Foye went off for 31 to lead Denver past the Suns.

• The Colorado Buffaloes’ 11-game winning streak ended Wednesday.

• Several Broncos players think the fine for Steelers’ Cody Wallace’s late hit on David Bruton wasn’t enough.

• Brock Osweiler and the Broncos offense must play consistently to clinch a postseason berth.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY

Comic book writer Mark Millar turns 46. You might not recognize his name, but you might recognize some of the movies in which his work has been adapted: “Wanted,” “Kick-Ass,” “Kingsman: The Secret Service” and the upcoming “Captain America: Civil War.” I’m still waiting for ” Old Man Logan,” the best post-apocalyptic wasteland version of Wolverine yet.
