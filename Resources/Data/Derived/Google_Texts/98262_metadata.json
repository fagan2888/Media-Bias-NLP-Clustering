But by June 30, the number was down by about 23,000, to just more than 943,000, according to the federal agency\u2019s June and September factsheets.\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, noted the decline. \u201cBig factor is 306k terminations due to immigration verification,\u201d he tweeted, referring to a statement deep in the latest federal factsheet:\n\n\u201cDuring the time period from April 1, 2015 to June 30, 2015, enrollment in coverage through the Federally-facilitated Marketplaces was terminated for about 306,000 consumers with citizenship or immigration status data matching issues who failed to produce sufficient documentation of their citizenship or immigration status,\u201d it read.\n\nCMS has not broken down the 306,000 figure by state.\n\nCharles Gaba, a Michigan website developer who keeps close tabs on Obamacare enrollment data, said in a post Tuesday he had been expecting, nationally, between 10.3 million and 10.4 million paying customers for private coverage made possible by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGaba said there had been \u201cmass cancellations\u201d because some enrollees couldn\u2019t provide proof of legal residence, with about 112,000 dropped in September 2014 and another 90,000 last February.\n\nIn Texas, some health care providers who watch the data more casually than does Gaba have told me they expected a slight increase in Texas enrollment over the spring and summer months.\n\nAs the federal agency said in a release last month, about 944,000 Americans picked plans through HealthCare.gov between Feb. 23 and June 30. They qualified for \u201cspecial enrollment periods\u201d because they had lost employment-related coverage, been denied Medicaid or CHIP coverage, faced a tax penalty for not having coverage or underwent a big life change such as marriage or childbirth.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wOS9kZW5pYWxzLWNhdXNlZC1ieS1pbW1pZ3JhdGlvbi1zdGF0dXMtaG9sZC1kb3duLW9iYW1hY2FyZS1lbnJvbGxtZW50Lmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert T.
