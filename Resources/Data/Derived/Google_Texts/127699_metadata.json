The talent appeared to be there \u2014 a major-league fastball and a killer curveball \u2014 but the results were not.\n\nTwo short stints with the Rockies over the past two years led to a 1-5 record, a 6.88 ERA and more questions than answers. Was he a starting pitcher? Was he a reliever? Did he truly have the stuff needed to win at the big-league level?\n\n\u201cYeah, I got down,\u201d he admitted. \u201cHonestly, I lost a lot of sleep over it.\u201d\n\nSomething drastic was needed. His career was slipping away, and he wasn\u2019t sure why.\n\n\u201cA broken man will listen to anyone,\u201d first-year pitching coach Steve Foster said. \u201cBrokenness brings out the question from an athlete: \u2018Can you help me?\u2019 \u201c\n\nAnd so, during spring training, the 26-year-old Bettis reached out, though he wasn\u2019t quite expecting what happened next. He was removed from the Cactus League rotation and disappeared into the bullpen to work with Foster and bullpen coach Darren Holmes.\n\nFor four consecutive throwing sessions, the right-hander threw fastball after fastball. No curves, no sliders, no messing around.\n\n\u201cFinally, at the end of the fourth \u2018pen, they let me throw a few changeups,\u201d Bettis said with a laugh. \u201cI threw 45 pitches, and maybe 10 changes.\u201d\n\nThe goal was to break Bettis down to the basics of pitching and fix a fastball that too often was hanging over the plate instead of tailing away from right-handed batters. Even if his fastball sometimes sizzled at 96 mph, big-league hitters were pummeling it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about being able to repeat a delivery and hit a spot,\u201d Foster said. \u201cChad wasn\u2019t doing that. And if you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re not going to be able to succeed at this elite level.\u201d\n\nBettis embraced the change, as well as the drudgery, and has evolved from a flamethrower without a clue into a starting pitcher with a plan. In five starts since getting called up from Triple-A Albuquerque, he is 2-0 with a 2.70 ERA, with 27 strikeouts and just nine walks. From not making the team out of spring training, he has been the Rockies\u2019 best starting pitcher since his call-up.\n\nMay 29 at Philadelphia, he flirted with baseball immortality, taking a perfect game into the seventh inning and a no-hitter into the eighth. He ended up allowing two hits over eight innings in a 4-1 victory.\n\nOver his past three starts, he has pitched 22 innings with a 1.21 ERA. He traces his improvement back to those fastballs he threw in Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\n\u201cThose sessions in spring training were game-changing,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cFor a while there, it was a little bit of a Rubik\u2019s Cube, because we loved Chad\u2019s makeup and we loved the arm, and we were just trying to get to the bottom of why he was struggling up here when he would dominate at the Triple-A level.\u201d\n\nBettis throws a fastball that averages 92 mph and a big curve that bends in at 73, 74. That can be a devastating one-two punch, but only if he pinpoints his pitches.\n\n\u201cI knew if I wasn\u2019t able to command the fastball, there was a good chance I would never be able to reach my full potential as a pitcher,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the big scheme of things, I knew I had to do it.\u201d\n\nWednesday night against Los Angeles Dodgers, Bettis wasn\u2019t nearly as sharp as he had been in his previous two starts, but he still allowed just two runs, one earned, through six innings. But he hung tough without having his best stuff, which was promising. So was the assortment of pitches he threw to finish off Dodgers hitters: an 86 mph slider, a 94 mph fastball, a 74 mph curve and an 83 mph changeup.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that I was always throwing fastballs in fastball counts,\u201d Bettis said. \u201cI\u2019m just not being so predictable anymore. It\u2019s about being able to throw any pitch in any count, keeping the hitter off balance. I am throwing each pitch with conviction, 100 percent of the time.\u201d\n\nFoster, however, cautions that Bettis is far from a finished product.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to have ups and downs,\u201d Foster said. \u201cHe\u2019s just not going to take off and run to the top of the mountain. He\u2019s not going to finish 20-0, and the chances are he\u2019s going to experience some failure.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that Darren and I have helped him build up enough calluses, stamina and belief to where he can withstand some setbacks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "How Chad Bettis refined the art of pitching for Rockies", "title": "How Chad Bettis refined the art of pitching for Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/06/how-chad-bettis-refined-the-art-of-pitching-for-rockies/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150524__chad-bettisp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150524__chad-bettisp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T20:56:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T03:03:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "For four consecutive throwing sessions, the right-hander threw fastball after fastball.\nBefore he started pitching like an ace in the past month, Chad Bettis was an enigma.\nSo was the assortment of pitches he threw to finish off Dodgers hitters: an 86 mph slider, a 94 mph fastball, a 74 mph curve and an 83 mph changeup.\nFrom not making the team out of spring training, he has been the Rockies\u2019 best starting pitcher since his call-up.\n\u201cIt used to be that I was always throwing fastballs in fastball counts,\u201d Bettis said."}
