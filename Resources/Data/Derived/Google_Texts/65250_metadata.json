He fervently favors a minor measure that would have mostly small, mostly injurious effects on a small number of people. Nevertheless, raising the minimum hourly wage for the 23rd time since 1938, from today\u2019s $7.25 to $10.10, is a nifty idea, if:\n\nIf government is good at setting prices. Government \u2014 subsidizer of Solyndra, operator of the ethanol program, creator of HealthCare.gov \u2014 uses minimum-wage laws to set the price for the labor of workers who are apt to add only small value to the economy.\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The Right\u2019s 25 most influential, from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site\u2019s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right, with a few names you may not know.

(It would be 10.9 percent if the workforce participation rate were as high as it was when Obama was first inaugurated; since then, millions of discouraged workers have stopped searching for jobs.) Because less than 3 percent of the workforce earns the minimum wage, increasing that wage will not greatly increase unemployment. Still, raising the price of low-productivity workers will somewhat reduce demand for them.\n\nIf you reject that last sentence. If you do, name other goods or services for which you think demand is inelastic when their prices increase.\n\nIf you think teenage (16-19) unemployment (20.8 percent), and especially African American teenage unemployment (35.8 percent), is too low. Approximately 24 percent of minimum-wage workers are teenagers.\n\nIf you think government policy should encourage automation of the ordering and preparation of food to replace workers in the restaurant industry, which employs 43.8 percent of minimum-wage workers.\n\nIf you think it is irrelevant that most minimum-wage earners are not poor. Most minimum-wage workers are not heads of households. More than half are students or other young people, usually part-time workers in families whose average income is $53,000 a year, which is $2,000 more than the average household income.\n\nIf you do not care that there are more poor people whose poverty derives from being unemployed than from low wages. True, some of the working poor earn so little they are eligible for welfare. But an increase in the minimum wage will cause some of these people to become unemployed and rely on welfare.\n\n1 of 20 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Top opinions stories of 2013 View Photos From Trayvon Martin to Obamacare: Take a look at a selection of the stories that caught readers\u2019 interests over the past year.

It would jeopardize marginal workers to benefit organized labor, which supports a higher minimum in the hope that this will raise the general wage floor, thereby strengthening unions\u2019 negotiating positions.\n\nIf you think it is irrelevant that nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage workers get a raise in their first year.\n\nIf you think a higher minimum wage, rather than a strengthened Earned Income Tax Credit, is the most efficient way to give money to the working poor.\n\nIf you think tweaking the minimum wage is a serious promotion of equality by an administration during which 95 percent of real income growth has accrued to the top 1 percent.\n\nIf you think forcing employers to spend X dollars more than necessary to employ labor for entry-level jobs will stimulate the economy. If you believe this, you must think the workers receiving the extra dollars will put the money to more stimulative uses than their employers would have. If so, why not a minimum wage of $50.50 rather than the $10.10? Because this might discourage hiring? What makes you sure you know the threshold where job destruction begins?\n\nIf you think the high school dropout rate is too low. In 1994, Congress decreed that by 2000 the graduation rate would be \u201cat least\u201d 90 percent. In 2010 it was 78.2 percent. Increasing the minimum wage would increase the incentive to leave school early. One scholarly study concluded that, in states where students may leave school before 18, increases in the minimum wage caused teenage school enrollment to decline.\n\nIf the milk of human kindness flows by the quart in your veins, so you should also want to raise the minimum street charity: Take moral grandstanding oblivious of consequences to a new level by requiring anyone who gives money to panhandlers to give a minimum of $10. Beggars may not benefit, but you will admire yourself.\n\nRead more from George F.
