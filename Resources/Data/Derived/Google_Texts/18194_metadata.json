Klein is conflating two different things here. First, there\u2019s the Halbig lawsuit, which hinges upon a strained, somewhat-exotic reading of the law to argue that the Affordable Care Act fails to create tax credits for people who buy their insurance through a federal exchange. The basis of this lawsuit is that the most explicit reference in the law mentions only state exchanges, and therefore courts ought to ignore all the other, less explicit parts of the law implying the opposite.\n\nThis is the case conservatives made for several years \u2014 Congress hastily failed to write a clear law, so conservative legal activists can take advantage of the screwup to interpret what (they argue, tendentiously but not insanely) is its literal reading. As the right-wing Investor\u2019s Business Daily, an early booster of this once-long-shot legal challenge, gleefully put it in 2011, \u201cOops! No Obamacare Tax Credit for You!\u201d I\u2019m sorry, the card says \u201cMoops.\u201d I find this argument highly, highly unpersuasive. It\u2019s been laughed out of court by Democratic-appointed judges, and rejected by at least one Republican judge. I will say this for it \u2014 it is at least tenuously connected to reality.\n\nBut now conservatives are making a different argument. They\u2019re no longer saying that the lawsuit is exploiting a drafting error. They\u2019re claiming it interprets the law correctly, and that the law actually (or possibly) intended to deny tax credits to people in federal exchanges. They have gone from smugly saying the card says \u201cMoops\u201d to insisting that the people who invaded Spain in the eighth century were actually called \u201cthe Moops.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, that is completely insane. There is a massive trove of evidence here regarding the intent of the law\u2019s drafters. Dylan Scott has the latest chunk today \u2014 a deep excavation of the role of the Congressional Budget Office, which was a kind of legislative super-body regarded as authoritative by Congress. The CBO, like everybody involved in the law\u2019s passage, believed the federal exchanges were designed to give health insurance to people in states that did not build their own. They were not designed as a deliberately unworkable punishment.\n\nYes, some smart people, speaking extemporaneously, were sometimes confused about just how the law worked. (Conservatives have made a great deal about off-the-cuff comments made by Jonathan Cohn before the law was actually finalized.) That doesn\u2019t change the fact that the federal exchanges were obviously designed to give people affordable insurance. It may be mean to point out that those who argue otherwise are completely, manifestly ahistorical, but that\u2019s just reality.
