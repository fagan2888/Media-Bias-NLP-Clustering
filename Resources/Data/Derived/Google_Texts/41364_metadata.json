I was praying. Jim lay, with a ventilator tube down his throat, recovering from open-heart surgery to replace a congenitally defective aortic valve.\n\nI was elated \u2014 for his survival, for Obama\u2019s victory. I looked forward to one of Obama\u2019s major campaign promises: to provide national healthcare reform so Americans with a pre-existing condition could get insurance Since his heart diagnosis in 2005, Jim, who probably couldn\u2019t have found a policy as an individual because of his condition, had been covered by small-business group insurance \u2014 because his self-storage business in Banning had one other employee. But his work, and his coverage, were always subject to change.\n\n\n\nI remained vulnerable as a freelance writer and part-time university professor who had to pay for her own health insurance. I also had had a few recent health hiccups, including a surgery to repair a herniated disk from spinal degeneration, and so I lived with the daily realization that one bit of bad health news could cause my policy to be canceled.\n\nAs it happened, the 2008 election was the first time Jim and I were bitterly divided on candidates. Jim foresaw healthcare reform as an addition to the federal deficit more worrisome than any health benefit. When I told my husband about Obama\u2019s victory in the hospital, he grumbled, \u201cI guess I can\u2019t blame Obama for breaking my heart.\u201d But, he worried that he would eventually be able to blame the president \u201cfor keeping me from getting better.\u201d\n\nThe transition to Obamacare \u2014 at least for a 59-year-old man and a 56-year-old woman in south Orange County \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be quite that bad. But it would be, in three big ways, far rougher and more frustrating than I\u2019d ever dreamed.\n\n1. Obamacare brought us new health insurance options \u2013 but cost us our more affordable plans.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance \u2014 this law will only make it more secure and more affordable,\u201d President Obama promised in 2012.\n\nThe fact that this wasn\u2019t true would be our biggest disappointment. In November 2013, Jim learned his small-business policy would be cancelled because it didn\u2019t comply with the new mandate to cover pediatric dentistry and maternity care. So Jim went to Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, to look for coverage for his employee and himself.\n\nHe found that the cost of his employee\u2019s individual \u201cbronze\u201d plan monthly premiums went up 13 percent , and that his own new individual \u201csilver\u201d plan was also more expensive. In 2014, Jim was individually paying $82 more a month in premiums. The deductible (the amount you have to pay before the insurance company starts footing the bill) did go down \u2014 from $5,000 to $2,000 for each individual insured. But if you added together 12 months of premiums, the deductible, and the new policies\u2019 out-of-pocket maximums, we were potentially on the hook for $13,260 \u2014 rather than the $11,024 from 2013 \u2014 if Jim got very sick. Around this time, Jim was diagnosed with prostate cancer, so the threat of high medical bills was real.\n\nThe individual plan I had with Blue Cross was cancelled, too. The bronze plan I got at Covered California raised my monthly premium payment from $301 to $422, with a $5,000 deductible. The maximum I might be responsible for if I got really sick went from $8,612 to $11,314.\n\n2. We learned patience, but we couldn\u2019t keep our doctors.\n\nThe only way to decrease the cost of our premiums was to get the subsidy offered by the federal government to lower- and middle-income people. And the only way to get the subsidy was by getting insurance through Covered California. But contacting Covered California, especially by phone, was maddening. The elevator music they played on hold became our winter soundtrack.\n\nWe had applied online and sent copies of our passports to California Covered for verification, but we received no bill, no confirmation of our coverage, no insurance cards. Jim spent an hour and a half on hold once before getting disconnected. He tried again the next day, waiting another two hours before getting disconnected.\n\nAfter a few more calls, Jim drove to a pop-up Covered California shop in the Laguna Hills Mall on Jan. 15, 2014, the deadline for adding coverage. He hoped to avoid website computer glitches and phone hang-ups. All we had were verbal assurances \u2014 not enough to see the cardiologist and a urologist at the insurance-negotiated rate. Receptionists at the doctors\u2019 offices said we could pay cash \u2014 $150 per visit for the urologist; $203 for the cardiologist, plus lab and treatment expenses.\n\nOn Jan. 22, we finally got our enrollment number and made our first payment to Blue Cross so we could start seeing doctors. Jim finally went to his cardiologist on Feb. 10, only to discover the doctor had left Blue Cross.\n\nThus began a session of musical chairs as we tried to match our insurance to the doctors we wanted to see before the music stopped. This was one time we had the advantage over an employer-sponsored health plan, which has only one open enrollment period in a year. Due to the start-up problems with state insurance exchanges, the deadline for Affordable Care Act insurance kept being pushed back, allowing us to change coverage twice.\n\nWe canceled Blue Cross and enrolled in Blue Shield so Jim could see his urologist. Then, when the urologist\u2019s office said they didn\u2019t accept Blue Shield patients enrolled through the state exchange, we canceled California Covered Blue Shield and bought directly from the insurance company, even though that meant foregoing the subsidies.\n\nBut the urologist wouldn\u2019t accept our new Blue Shield plan \u2014 even though the Blue Shield website said he did. Jim\u2019s regular dermatologist left Blue Shield, too.\n\nIn each case, the doctor\u2019s office said the reimbursements for the insurance we had were too low. In each case, the receptionists chirped, \u201cWe\u2019re happy to make you a cash patient.\u201d\n\nEventually, we requested records and sought new doctors. Although we read frequent reports of patients unable to find physicians willing to take new patients, in our case Jim found a new urologist he liked better than the old.\n\n3. The Affordable Care Act saved us money this year, but it didn\u2019t alleviate our concerns about obtaining affordable medical care.\n\nJim treated his prostate cancer with radiation, and received his recommended echocardiogram and MRI. So in 2014, we paid the maximum out-of-pocket expense and the insurance company covered the rest. Tallying his medical costs, Jim said, \u201cI take back what I said. Obamacare did help me get better.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m well below my annual deductible. I baby my back, neck, knees, and hip degeneration with regular walking, yoga, and acupuncture. I\u2019ve benefited from regular $28 acupuncture treatments, something that wasn\u2019t covered in my old plan. But my licensed acupuncturist hasn\u2019t received any reimbursement yet. It\u2019s also harder for her to make a living \u2014 the insurance company cut her pay by 25 percent.\n\nWhat Obamacare hasn\u2019t eliminated is worry: We\u2019re deeply concerned about our ability to get quality medical care from doctors we trust. The day may soon come when we can\u2019t afford the plans our doctors accept, or we\u2019ll have to wait hours to seen. Will the best doctors flock to a cash-only model? How long can a good doctor be satisfied with the $39.75 the insurance company paid her for my annual check up a few months ago?\n\nWe had thought that our work and businesses had paid us enough to live on in these older years \u2014 but we\u2019re discovering we didn\u2019t account for such dramatic increases in health care costs. Medical expenses already gobble up 20 percent of our income. In 2015, if we keep the same plans, our premiums will rise $95 a month. We have no choice to opt out of the required pediatric dentistry or maternity coverage we\u2019ll never use, so we\u2019ll eventually have to settle for less generous policies, with higher deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. My husband isn\u2019t required by law to insure his one employee, though he feels it\u2019s the right thing to do. As costs continue to rise, we may have direct him to buy his own health insurance at his own cost.\n\nWe\u2019ve already started the dance of enrollment all over again and are having a hard time finding partners. As I write this, the \u201cFind a Provider\u201d link on the Covered California website offers 2014 health providers, but not 2015, even though we\u2019re shopping for 2015 insurance policies. Ditto Blue Shield. Administrators at our medical group won\u2019t say yet if they\u2019ll remain with Blue Shield. At least this year we think we know the steps to the dance. Let the music begin.\n\nCatherine Keefe is an essayist, poet, editor, and writing instructor at Chapman University in Orange, California.
