On Saturday, the Spartanburg County Coroner's Office said one person was killed in a single-vehicle crash on Interstate 26.

The crash happened on the eastbound side near mile marker 35 just after 11:30 a.m, according to the South Carolina Highway Patrol.

Spartanburg County emergency dispatchers said multiple ejections were reported in the crash.

Dispatchers said both eastbound and westbound lanes were closed just after the wreck, which occurred in the median, as emergency crews worked to transport the victims and clear the wreckage.

Coroner's assistant chief investigator Ellen Holmes said five passengers were in the vehicle involved in the crash. One victim was pronounced dead at the scene after being ejected from the vehicle.

Four other occupants of the vehicle were transported to a local hospital.

Holmes identified the victim as 50-year-old Mary Jane Reeves of Tennessee.

The South Carolina Department of Transportation said all lanes on I-26 were reopened on Saturday night.

One person was killed and three people were injured in another crash on I-26 Friday night.
