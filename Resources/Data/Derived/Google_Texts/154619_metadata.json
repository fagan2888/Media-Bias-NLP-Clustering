This week, the Fox News host grew visibly angry after welcoming Bernard Whitman, a Democrat and political activist, onto her talk show, \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d Breitbart News reveals this Thursday, November 13, that Kelly was adamant in arguing that the purposes of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act have been misconstrued by the American public for months now.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nAre Obamacare \u201clies\u201d something the U.S. public should really worry about this 2014? Megyn Kelly of Fox News certainly thinks so. The TV host lost her cool on the air this week while having a heated debate with Democrat Whitman over Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber\u2019s recent comments. Gruber, a national economist, apparently stated that the only reason the healthcare law passed was due to the American people being utterly deceived at its original intent. Kelly says that Gruber in fact hinted President Obama\u2019s \u201ctakeover\u201d health care plan a long time ago.\n\n\u201cHe said in January that Obamacare was never meant to save money, don\u2019t worry about that. But before it was passed, he said it was a deficit reducer, it was a cost effective step towards healthcare problems\u2026.Now he comes out and says, all that stuff we said about taxes, that was B.S. And this other stuff, it\u2019s all B.S. We had to do it, because we had to get this law passed, and sorry.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Whitman says that although Gruber might deserve to be known as skillful when it comes to public policy, he remains \u201ca political idiot.\u201d The Democrat continued by saying that the Affordable Health Care Act \u2014 Whitman never used the unofficial term \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 has been successfully already, despite rumors of lies or scandal surrounding the bill.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, the Affordable Care Act has brought down the deficit by almost $100 billion largely due to Medicaid reductions,\u201d he said. The fact is, the cost of healthcare is going down. It went up 8% before this law, it\u2019s now going up 4% \u2026 The fact is, 18% of Americans did not have health insurance before the law passed, that\u2019s down to 13%. Over 15 million folks who didn\u2019t have health insurance before the ACA was signed into law in 2010 are now covered bringing the total uninsured adults in the US from 18% to 13.4%.\u201d\n\nWhile Megan Kelly lost it upon hearing Whitman\u2019s comments, Western Journalism News notes this evening that many from the U.S. public took issue with these statements as well. After all, says the report, the Senate Budget Committee revealed that the ACA will in fact be incurring an estimated $131 billion in federal deficits between 2015 and 2024, while a considerable number of American citizens are now experiencing higher deductibles that will ultimately lead to more expensive costs out-of-pocket.\n\nThe Fox News host denied Whitman\u2019s claim that \u201ceveryone knew what they were getting.\u201d She said Obamacare lies to the people, and that the healthcare law is in fact based on an untruth.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\" she said. \"Seriously? Seriously? Everyone knew what they were getting? Is that what you want the viewers to believe? \u2026 My head is about to explode.\u201d\n\nRegardless of which side U.S. citizens stand on, open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is on its way soon. Enrollment for healthcare insurance officially starts this November 15, and will close on February 2015. Do you agree with Democrat Whitman\u2019s support of Obamacare, or Kelly\u2019s argument that the bill was ultimately passed on nothing but a \u201clie?\u201d\n\nObamacare was first brought into the public limelight this week after the \u201carchitect\u201d of the controversial healthcare law stated that the \u201cstupidity\u201d of the American voters was the only reason the bill passed. Jonathan Gruber says that community ignorance of what President Obama\u2019s new plan actually entailed resulted in Obamacare ever making it through Congress.
