Since then, Obamacare has placed politics above patients and failed time and time again to protect the health and wellbeing of Americans. Here are six of Obamacare\u2019s most alarming failures:\n\nObamacare Illegally Diverted Billions to Reinsurance Slush Fund\n\nThe Obamacare reinsurance program was one of three programs (together with risk corridors and risk adjustment) created to hide the true costs of coverage on the exchange and prop up insurers by redistributing funds from different groups to Obamacare exchanges. In the case of reinsurance, this took the form of a $44 assessment on each individual with private health insurance.\n\nFor 2015 Obamacare reinsurance, the administration will pay out $6 billion raised from a fee on private health insurance and an additional $1.7 billion that under federal law belongs to the Treasury department. The decision by the Obama administration directly violates section 1341 of Obamacare which explicitly states, \u201c\u2026money shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury of the United States and may not be used for the [reinsurance] program established under this section.\u201d\n\nAs Doug Badger of the Galen Institute explains, Obamacare reinsurance for 2014 was supposed to raise $12 billion, but fell $2 billion short. To deal with this shortfall, the administration simply decided not to pay Treasury what it was owed.\n\nSky Rocketing Premium Increases Have Left the American People with Higher Healthcare Bill\n\nObamacare\u2019s individual mandate forces Americans to buy increasingly unaffordable health insurance or pay a tax. With insurance premiums (and also deductibles) increasing at such a rapid rate, many in the middle class are faced with higher and higher bills when visiting their doctor or a hospital.\n\nAt a high of nearly 50% rate increase, Minnesota\u2019s market premium tops the chart. Minnesota is followed by Alaska with a 39.6% increase- Oregon and Tennessee trail closely with 37.1% and 36.3%, respectively. Of the 50 states, enrollees in 34 states saw a top increase in premiums of 20% or more. The premium percentage increases from private insurance companies are broken down by state, proving that Obama\u2019s claim that \u201chealthcare inflation has slowed\u2026\u201d is clearly false.\n\nBillions Wasted on Failed State Exchanges\n\nTo date, recovery of the billions in wasted state exchange funds has been near non-existent, despite failed exchanges in Oregon, Hawaii, New Mexico, and Nevada costing taxpayers $733 million. In fact, according to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office, these four states have returned ZERO dollars to the federal government, and state exchanges collectively have so far returned just $1 million.\n\nOf all state exchange failures, the most alarming story is undoubtedly Cover Oregon. An uncovered email confirmed the accusations that the $305 million exchange was run by partisan political advisors focused solely on then-Governor John Kitzhaber\u2019s 2014 reelection.\n\nBut the waste doesn\u2019t end there, as \u201cworking\u201d state exchanges including Vermont, Minnesota, Maryland, and Massachusetts have each misused as much as hundreds of millions in taxpayer funds.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas), Obamacare chief Andy Slavitt said the federal government will \u201crecover its fair portion\u201d of funds in the event a failed Obamacare state exchange reaches a settlement with contractors.\n\nGiven that the federal government funded the overwhelming majority of state exchange projects with $5.5 billion in taxpayer funds, \u201cfair portion\u201d should be close to 100 percent.\n\nObamacare Exchanges Failed to Detect Counterfeit Documents\n\nObamacare exchanges are failing to verify key enrollment information, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). This report comes from a long line finding that controls on federal and state Obamacare exchanges are abysmal.\n\nAs part of its review, GAO tested application and enrollment controls on the federal exchange of two state exchanges (California and Kentucky). Ten fictitious applicants were created to test whether verification steps including validating an applicant\u2019s Social Security number, verifying citizenship, and verifying household income were completed properly.\n\nIn order to test these controls, GAO\u2019s test applications provided fraudulent documentation. As the report notes, all ten applications remained enrolled on Obamacare even though fraudulent or insufficient documentation was provided.\n\nAs a result, each applicant received the Obamacare premium tax credit and cost-sharing reduction subsidies, without being properly verified. The ten applicants received a total of $2,300 in tax credits per month.\n\nObamacare Website Launched Despite Security Official\u2019s Warnings\n\nThe federal Healthcare.gov Obamacare website launched in 2013 without authorization to operate and against the judgment of security agency officials. This left millions of Americans that enrolled on Heathcare.gov vulnerable to possible fraudulent activity \u2013 risks that continue to this day for the more than 6.5 million federal enrollees. Although the Obama administration knew about the security risks, the site was launched.\n\nIn the months following, the site\u2019s failures prompted the Obama Administration to contract various groups in an attempt to remedy the quality assurance issues of Healthcare.gov. Despite spending a further $2.14 billion in taxpayer dollars, they failed to fix some of the most serious security concerns.\n\nTwo years later, and after persistent and detailed warnings were directed to administration officials, Healthcare.gov was hacked by an outside source \u2013 proving the continued insecurity of the site.\n\nObamacare\u2019s Public Health Slush Fund Wasting Billions of Dollars\n\nCurrently, two billion dollars is given each year in perpetuity to an Obamacare slush fund known as the Prevention and Public Health fund. The Department of Health and Human Services is then free to spend these funds as they see fit, without any Congressional oversight.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this has led to the slush fund being used by the Administration as a tool to push blatantly partisan, politicized policies.\n\nMost alarmingly, a 2012 Inspector general alert raised concerns that these payments equated to taxpayer funded lobbying, while former Democrat Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) expressed concern that hundreds of millions sent to the fund have been diverted to encourage individuals to sign-up for Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "pocket-site-verification": "e8a03e904ad67c23ec990c1928577c", "og": {"site_name": "Americans for Tax Reforms", "description": "Six years ago, President Obama signed Obamacare into law.
