Now that dog, a nine-year-old boxer named Carmen, has a team of vets fighting around the clock to save her life.\n\nCarmen was injured last Thursday, February 5th when a fire broke out in the basement of the home where she lived with her owner, Ben Ledford, in Goshen Township, Ohio.\n\nFirst responders on the scene found Carmen on top of Ledford, trying to shelter his face from the heat, smoke and flame, according to CNN affiliate WCPO.\n\n33-year-old Ledford was taken to a hospital where he later died. Carmen ended up at Cincinnati\u2019s Care Center, a critical care veterinary hospital, where the vets there have placed her on a ventilator.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing okay. Considering what Carmen has been through, we think she\u2019s doing as well as can be expected,\u201d Dr. Daniel Carey, a vet at the hospital, told WCPO.\n\nCarey said Carmen is battling severe lung damage and is not strong enough to breathe on her own yet. The doctors had hoped to get her off the ventilator by now, but as of Sunday night, it just wasn\u2019t happening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unexpected that she\u2019s not ready to come off (the ventilator). It\u2019s just that in our best case scenario (we thought) maybe we could\u2019ve hoped to get her off (Sunday) afternoon,\u201d Carey told WCPO. \u201cWhenever they put a patient on a ventilator they\u2019re looking at a 50-50 chance of getting them off breathing on their own. The smoke ventilation cases are often the hardest to manage off the ventilator.\u201d\n\nDespite her breathing problems, Carmen has shown improvement in other areas. She is mentally alert and showing no signs of neurological problems, the vet said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s resting. She\u2019s very heavily sedated so that she won\u2019t fight \u2014 you know, that she\u2019s got a tube down her trachea or windpipe. She seems very comfortable,\u201d Carey said.\n\nLedford\u2019s family and friends, while mourning the loss of his life, are still doing what they can to help Carmen save hers. They\u2019ve turned to crowdsourcing website CrowdRise to raise funds to help pay Carmen\u2019s hospital bills. On the site, they thanked the doctors and expressed gratitude at the \u201cgenerosity being offered to help Carmen.\u201d\n\nThe hospital is also providing updates on Carmen through social media, using Facebook to post pictures of the dog resting on a pink blanket and keeping company with a pair of stuffed animals.\n\nDr. Marlo Anderson, another vet at the hospital who is caring for the dog, told WCPO she was not at all surprised that Carmen tried to save her owner.\n\n\u201cA lot of dogs instinctively know when there\u2019s a crisis going on and so a lot of them do go to try to protect their owners, so she very well may have been trying to protect him,\u201d she said.\n\nCLICK HERE for more on this story via WCPO.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "39.280682;-84.360846", "description": "(CNN) -- Deadly flames licked all around her, but a heroic dog in a suburban Cincinnati basement refused to leave her owner.
