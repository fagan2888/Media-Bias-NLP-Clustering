He is dean of the state Capitol correspondents, having covered government action in Madison for 36 years. Readers can contact Pommer at mpommer@sbcglobal.net. The content in this column does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Wisconsin Newspaper Association or its member newspapers.\n\nMore than 41,000 residents have lost their eligibility for federal food stamps, and another 12,000 people have found jobs under a training program.\n\nThat's good political news for Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who is still being mentioned as a possible vice presidential nominee.\n\nIt's bad news for the charities that run food pantries, soup kitchens and homeless shelters. Demand for their services has increased. There is increased hunger, their leaders note.\n\nThe food-stamp statistics were released one year after a new law took effect. Able-bodied adults up to age 49 who have no children at home must seek jobs or get training.\n\nWalker calls the program a success. Some people just went out and got a job, he told reporters. Businesses and industries are looking for \u201cqualified skilled workers,\u201d according to health officials.\n\nState officials have directed more than 107,000 people to participate in the program. Last year, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimated than 63,000 people would decline to participate and thereby lose their food stamp benefits.\n\nMore than 770,000 people have been eligible for food stamps in Wisconsin. That includes children and the poor elderly.\n\nYet there seems to be resentment at people getting the federally financed food stamp help. That disdain might be seen on the faces of other shoppers when food-stamp recipients move through grocery store checkout aisles.\n\nLegislators have flirted with new rules to limit what the food stamps will cover. There also was talk of requiring photo IDs to cash food stamps. The grocery industry opposed the idea.\n\nGetting the maximum number of federal dollars has not been a priority for the Walker administration. It rejected hundreds of millions of Obamacare dollars to expand Medicaid.\n\nThe governor said the federal government would be financially unable to continue such a Medicaid program. Critics have noted the additional money could have prevented or scaled back reductions in appropriations for the UW System.\n\nNext on the Walker administration's agenda is getting federal approval to drug test those seeking food stamps or aid from other programs.\n\nWisconsin is one of 11 states seeking that authority. The others are Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, South Carolina and Utah, according to The Associated Press.\n\nFederal approval may be difficult to obtain.\n\nIt may seem like good politics to go after drug users, but it also is controversial.\n\nWisconsin's religious leaders have opposed the approach.\n\n\u201cIn our religious traditions, poverty and joblessness are not indicators of bad character,\u201d the Interfaith Council told state officials when the idea was being developed.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe it is just to craft policies that punish those who face these trials while also suffering from the illness of addiction.\u201d\n\nThe religious leaders warned that drug addiction cannot be solved with one or two courses of treatment. Addiction is often linked to mental illness.\n\nBut there already is a shortage of such services, and a heroin epidemic has swirled through both rural and urban areas and affected a large number of young white people.\n\nThat makes it less an \u201cus versus them\u201d issue.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Next on the Walker administration's agenda is getting federal approval to drug test those seeking food stamps or aid from other programs.", "author": "Matt Pommer", "og": {"image": {"width": 900, "identifier": "http://www.gazettextra.com/assets/jpeg/JG8079106.JPG", "height": 470}, "type": "article", "description": "Next on the Walker administration's agenda is getting federal approval to drug test those seeking food stamps or aid from other programs.", "title": "Matt Pommer: Drug testing sends more to charities for help"}, "twitter": {"description": "Next on the Walker administration's agenda is getting federal approval to drug test those seeking food stamps or aid from other programs.", "title": "Matt Pommer: Drug testing sends more to charities for help", "url": "http://www.gazettextra.com/20160508/matt_pommer_drug_testing_sends_more_to_charities_for_help", "image": "http://www.gazettextra.com/assets/jpeg/JG8079106.JPG", "site": "@gazettextra", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 184800176}, "article": {"published_time": 20160508110000}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Matt Pommer: Drug testing sends more to charities for helpMatt Pommer writes this Wisconsin Newspaper Association weekly state government newsletter.\nMore than 41,000 residents have lost their eligibility for federal food stamps, and another 12,000 people have found jobs under a training program.\nLegislators have flirted with new rules to limit what the food stamps will cover.\nNext on the Walker administration's agenda is getting federal approval to drug test those seeking food stamps or aid from other programs.\nThere also was talk of requiring photo IDs to cash food stamps."}
