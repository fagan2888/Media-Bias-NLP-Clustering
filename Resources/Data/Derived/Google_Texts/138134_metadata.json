What those voters were saying was \u201cwe\u2019re disappointed, disheartened, disinterested\u201d. Instead the President seemed to hear something else: hey, we\u2019re behind you 100%, take our silence as full support!\n\nIt was no such thing.\n\nFor a very long time the President has been convinced that he knows more, and knows better, than anyone else. He\u2019s said it about his advisers, and now he\u2019s saying it about the voters.\n\nHe uses excuses, of course: my voters didn\u2019t show up, it was a map that favored Republicans, I\u2019m getting blamed for things I can\u2019t really control (Ebola, ISIS, etc.), these things happen in a two-termer\u2019s last election.\n\nBut none of those excuses are really relevant. There were issues of judgment, policy, and competence in this election.\n\nEvery Republican running for a Senate seat who won made Obamacare an issue, and the health care takeover took up one third of their political ads. Republicans ran against Obama. Democrats ran away. Big Blue states Illinois, Massachussets, and Maryland went Red.\n\nAt his news conference, on the same day ISIS was tweeting more massacres from the country formerly known as Iraq, the President was asked if we are winning against ISIS. He said something and took some time saying it, but the answer was not \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nEbola might have been on the minds of voters. New York City reported today that it is not monitoring 357 people for signs of the disease. That is up from the previous number by 300%. And the President promised that U.S. uniformed personnel in Africa would not be treating Ebola patients. Now it turns out that\u2019s not true.\n\nIn one sense, the President is entirely to blame. It\u2019s the Thin Blue Line that gives him the adoring support which buttresses his arrogance. He governs for them, not for that vast area between those blue dots and coastal stripes.\n\nIf the blue dots/stripes want to isolate themselves and their President in this remaining two years, well, OK, go ahead.\n\nThe resulting backlash will hit the next Democrat running for the White House in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"prism.channel": "fnc", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "FOX News Radio", "description": "by John Gibson\r\n\r\nFollow on twitter, Facebook and listen free and live on the FOX News Radio app.\r\n\r\nCourtesy rollcall.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map\u00a0from Congressional Quarterly\u00a0depicting races for the House of Representatives shows Democrat America according to Tuesday's voting: isolated Fort Apache encl", "title": "DEMOCRAT AMERICA: THE THIN BLUE LINE", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://radio.foxnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Map.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-06T21:24:58+00:00", "url": "http://radio.foxnews.com/2014/11/06/democrat-america-the-thin-blue-line/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://radio.foxnews.com/2014/11/06/democrat-america-the-thin-blue-line/", "image": "http://radio.foxnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Map.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "DEMOCRAT AMERICA: THE THIN BLUE LINE"}, "prism.section": "radio", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=601935043", "fb": {"app_id": 108927045863499}, "article": {"section": "John Gibson", "published_time": "2014-11-06T12:47:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-06T21:24:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "by John Gibson\r\n\r\nFollow on twitter, Facebook and listen free and live on the FOX News Radio app.\r\n\r\nCourtesy rollcall.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map\u00a0from Congressional Quarterly\u00a0depicting races for the House of Representatives shows Democrat America according to Tuesday's voting: isolated Fort Apache encl"}, "article_summary": "Courtesy rollcall.com Courtesy rollcall.comThe map from Congressional Quarterly depicting races for the House of Representatives shows Democrat America according to Tuesday\u2019s voting: isolated Fort Apache enclaves, and a Red America squeeze of the Blue into narrow coastal corridors.\nIf the blue dots/stripes want to isolate themselves and their President in this remaining two years, well, OK, go ahead.\nIt\u2019s the Thin Blue Line that gives him the adoring support which buttresses his arrogance.\nHe governs for them, not for that vast area between those blue dots and coastal stripes.\nThe resulting backlash will hit the next Democrat running for the White House in 2016."}
