You\u2019re probably also an early adopter of startup offerings, the first person to throw out a new company doing something uniquely interesting\u2013the latest on-demand app, that new marketplace platform, this thing that\u2019s going to be on Shark Tank next season.\n\nIf you have the passion, but struggle to find the breakthrough, just skip that step. Start with existing \u201cgreat ideas\u201d\u2013the products and services you love, use frequently and wouldn\u2019t want to be without. Focus especially on those which are technology-enabled and highly scalable, likely software and services. Where else could they go? I love the look on a friend\u2019s face when I share something I\u2019ve uncovered that he\u2019s never heard.\n\nIf there had been a referral program for ClassPass, for example, when I first signed up, I\u2019d have minted a lifetime of free membership. I loved the idea. Then I saw a Malaysian startup, KFit, took the ClassPass model to parts of Asia and Australia and raised millions from a top-tier U.S. venture firm. A proven concept, adapted for a new geography, becoming a huge success. Why didn\u2019t I think of that!\n\nIn the U.S., it\u2019s about coming up with the next \u201cUber for X.\u201d Elsewhere, it\u2019s about being the \u201cUber of X.\u201d Zafiti is the Zappos of Brazil. Aparat is the YouTube of Iran. Copying and dropping a successful business model elsewhere is a well-worn path. No idea list required.\n\nEven within the U.S., new models often start on the coasts and take some time to move inland. \u201cHealthy\u201d frozen yogurt, for example \u2013 I trekked to New York\u2019s Koreatown for my first taste of fresh fruit topped Pinkberry at least a year before I could find a similar tart offering when visiting my hometown, Cincinnati.\n\nConsidering what verified model you can replicate is a fantastic venture jump-start because:\n\nIt\u2019s proven, likely in a highly competitive marketplace, where it\u2019s been adjusted and tweaked. If ideation is your challenge, focus on execution, not reinvention. It attracts investors, \u201ccheck writers\u201d who are looking for untapped demand paired with proven solutions, rather than opportunities that just aim to steal market share. There are entire funds, and even angel investors, dedicated to the exported business model thesis. They\u2019ll be eager to hear your pitch.\n\nAnd it provides a head-start while the established incumbent is focused on refining in their home market, be it a city, region, or country. You can introduce a tailored offering well ahead of any possible expansion, honing for the needs of your chosen geography. You\u2019ve got the edge.\n\nChristina Bechhold is co-founder of Empire Angels, a member-led, New York-based angel group of young professionals investing in early stage technology ventures.
