Existing rooftop solar customers would be grandfathered under the agreements they originally signed.\u201d\n\nThe regulatory body, the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC), had suggested that the $21 per month fee was \u201can appropriate charge\u201d back in 2013, but initially set the charge at $5 per month. The new utility proposal asks the rate to be reset to $21.\n\nAPS had originally asked for a fixed charge between $60 and $100 per month \u2014 so $21 comes off as a sort of compromise.\n\nAccording to a release, \u201cFuture rooftop solar customers would have the option to choose a demand-based rate and avoid the grid access charge.\u201d\n\nIt has been the view of APS and the state\u2019s regulators that grid-tied solar customers use grid services that must be paid for. Otherwise, they contend, there is a cost shift from solar owners to non-solar owners. Studies can be cited which support this viewpoint, as can studies which suggest that grid-tied solar provides a benefit and should not be penalized with a monthly fee. The true value of PV solar is not really settled \u2014 and the battleground for determining this value is going to be in rate case negotiations across the U.S.\n\nThe APS proposal would not fully settle the cost shift issue and is intended as an interim solution until the problem is addressed in the next APS rate case, according to the utility.\n\n\u201cThe growth of rooftop solar doesn\u2019t lessen the need for the grid,\u201d said APS CEO Don Brand in a release. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s just the opposite. The continued growth of rooftop solar depends on a modern grid that supports the two-way flow of electricity, accommodates the highly variable nature of solar power while maintaining reliability and backs up solar power with fast-starting, flexible conventional power sources.\u201d\n\nFew would confuse APS for Vote Solar, a PV advocacy group \u2014 but despite APS\u2019 confrontational reaction to the rush of solar into its territory, APS Communications Manager Jim McDonald told GTM last night, \u201cThis is a process, and we want a serious policy-based dialogue,\u201d adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t want the rancor \u2014 we want serious-minded conversations that lead to positive solutions.\u201d\n\nVote Solar\u2019s Adam Browning notes, \u201cVote Solar looks forward to working with APS on a data-driven, policy-based solution. The fact is, distributed generation adds a lot of value to the grid \u2014 14 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to an APS sponsored study in 2009, and another study found that distributed solar under current rates provide over $34 million in net benefits to the grid annually, starting in 2015.\u201d\n\nMcDonald continued, \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking for is a way to modernize our pricing so we\u2019re more responsive to the needs of our customers who want solar \u2014 we want to make solar sustainable for the long-term.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is provide tools for our customers to manage their energy usage. The demand charge might not be a perfect rate for all customers but can still provide a measure of control,\u201d he said.\n\nMarc Romito, APS Manager for Renewable Energy, had this to say: \u201cIf you don\u2019t use the grid, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay for it, but if you do, you should pay your fair share.
