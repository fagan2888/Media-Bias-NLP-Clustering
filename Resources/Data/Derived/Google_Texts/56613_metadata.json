Don Young for Alaska\u2019s only U.S. House seat. Young is a 21-term incumbent who has literally been the 30-year-old\u2019s congressman his entire life.\n\nDunbar stopped by KTOO recently to talk about his campaign, policy and why he thinks he should replace Young.\n\nYou can listen to Casey Kelly and Jeremy Hsieh\u2018s full interview with Forrest Dunbar here. It was recorded Oct. 16. http://www.ktoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Forrest-Dunbar.mp3\n\nDunbar says there are a lot of nonpartisan, Alaska-specific issues he and Young agree on, like fighting the Interior Department to allow a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge for King Cove residents, trying to increase oil and gas development in Alaska, and working with the State Department to protect Southeast Alaska from upriver Canadian mines.\n\nThe big differences, Dunbar says, are on social issues and in their interpersonal styles.\n\nDunbar says he\u2019s prochoice, disagrees with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Hobby Lobby case that let some corporations deny its employees contraceptives through their health care plans, and is strongly on board with Democrats on LGBT rights.\n\n\u201cMy sister happens to be LGBT, and so that also sort of firmly aligned me with the Democrats, for the time being,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I know there are some younger Republicans that are sort of letting go of that as an issue, but I remember very distinctly in 2004 when I lived in D.C. that they were using it as an issue to try and drive people apart. And now that the tides have turned, there\u2019s a lot of people pretending like it never happened.\u201d\n\nDunbar says he plans to be collaborative and to work across the aisle, while he characterizes Young as aggressive, bombastic and counterproductive. Dunbar says he had met Young several times while he was in college and working in Washington D.C. and has seen those aspects of Young\u2019s personality intensify over time.\n\n\u201cHe was always perfectly nice to me, perfectly polite, had no personal animosity towards him when I started to run. But during the course of this campaign, I\u2019ve realized that, sort of the\u2013the legend is true!\u201d\n\nDunbar says in the last six years especially, Young has become stranger and a little bit angrier.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just very different than he was back then.\u201d\n\nThe Alaska Dispatch News has reported a number of recent instances of Young\u2019s behavior, including with Dunbar backstage before an Oct. 1 debate in Kodiak. Dunbar told the Dispatch that Young gave him a hard time about his roots. When Dunbar touched his arm, he told the Dispatch that Young said the last person to touch him \u201cended up on the ground dead.\u201d\n\nCampaign Finance\n\nDunbar says one of his priorities that gets less attention is campaign finance reform. He says the contrast in his finances to Young\u2019s illustrates why reforms are needed.\n\nIn recent filings, Dunbar says, \u201cWe had 306 individual Alaskan contributors, which is about, I think between 80 and 85 percent of our total campaign contributions. He had 33, right? Which is less than 20 percent of his total contributions. \u2026 It\u2019s been coming almost exclusively from individual, small contributions. \u2026 I haven\u2019t gotten the huge, sort of piles of corporate lobbyist cash that my opponent has.\u201d\n\nThat difference, Dunbar says, is representative of a concentration of power and lobbyists\u2019 influence.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t seem to stop that revolving door between the lobbying firms that provide campaign donations and the Hill. So my idea was to use term limits to sort of clog that door with a flood of bodies, lower the individual value of each of one of those people, and then, thus reduce the appeal of the lobbying profession.\u201d\n\nThis American Life has reported that members of Congress spend several hours a day cold calling potential donors. Dunbar says that\u2019s why it\u2019s so appealing to accept lobbyists\u2019 offers for fundraising relief. He says he won\u2019t self-impose term limits or fundraising prohibitions, though.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to play in the rules of the game as established. I want to change those rules, I want to change that structure,\u201d Dunbar says.\n\nDunbar says he\u2019s also in favor of legislation that would create a system where candidates for federal offices can opt out of traditional campaign finance in order to earn \u201cpatriot dollars\u201d \u2013 small, publicly financed vouchers that individuals control and can be spent only on campaigns.\n\nHealth Care\n\nDunbar readily acknowledges there are problems with the Affordable Care Act, which created a mandate that all Americans purchase health insurance.\n\nBut he says the heart of the act is requiring insurance companies accept customers with pre-existing conditions.\n\nDunbar said when he finished law school, he sought health insurance on the private market.\n\n\u201cTurns out, I have a pre-existing condition. I didn\u2019t realize it till I started to apply for quote-unquote private health insurance. This was before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. And I was rejected by everyone.\u201d\n\nHis pre-existing condition was sports-related, and it forced him into a high-risk insurance pool run by the state.\n\n\u201cIt was $250 a month with a $10,000 deductible. And no\u2013basically, catastrophic only, no preventative care. It was not good insurance and it was not sustainable. I basically, as I\u2019ve said before, I had to get hit by a bus in just the right way for it to be useful for me.\u201d\n\nHe was 27 at the time, and a nonsmoker.\n\n\u201cI can only imagine how hard it is for someone who\u2019s in their 50s or 60s, but not old enough to for Medicare who had cancer, for example. There\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to get private insurance if we (repeal the Affordable Care Act) that Don Young and Dan Sullivan support.\u201d\n\nNational Guard\n\nDunbar has been in the Alaska Army National Guard for about a year and serves as a judge advocate, which is a military lawyer. He says he\u2019s working some of the cases and may be involved in prosecutions for sexual misconduct in the guard, detailed in a federal investigation report released last month.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t talk specifics, \u201cBut in general, it does look like, and, um, it does look like there were some very serious issues in the Guard that went undealt with for a very long time.\u201d\n\nHe says Gov. Sean Parnell should have taken stronger action sooner.\n\nCasey Kelly contributed to this report.\n\nRelated articles\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"category": "Election Coverage,Featured News,Federal Government", "description": "Forrest Dunbar stopped by KTOO recently to talk about his campaign, policy and why he thinks he should replace Don Young.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Jeremy Hsieh", "og": {"site_name": "KTOO", "description": "Forrest Dunbar stopped by KTOO recently to talk about his campaign, policy and why he thinks he should replace Don Young.", "title": "Forrest Dunbar interview", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.ktoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dunbar-1.jpg", "height": 418}, "updated_time": "2014-11-01T09:50:34-08:00", "url": "http://www.ktoo.org/2014/11/01/forrest-dunbar-interview/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Forrest Dunbar stopped by KTOO recently to talk about his campaign, policy and why he thinks he should replace Don Young.", "creator": "@jmlhsieh", "image": "http://www.ktoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dunbar-1.jpg", "title": "Forrest Dunbar interview", "site": "@KTOOpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "nid": 100212, "fb": {"admins": "100000451568550,1057430445,64202921,5701326,100009904184202,100000548846198,100000571087086,100005265339889,657797481,698475886,100002322833863,529595225,1074192195", "app_id": 129011767246539}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.ktoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cropped-KTOO_favicon-270x270.png", "keywords": "2014 elections,2014 midterms,congress,Don Young,Forrest Dunbar,midterm elections,National Guard", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ktoopublicmedia", "published_time": "2014-11-01T10:45:56-08:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jeremy.hsieh.92", "section": "Election Coverage", "modified_time": "2014-11-01T09:50:34-08:00", "tag": "National Guard"}, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc876\"", "article_summary": "You can listen to Casey Kelly and Jeremy Hsieh\u2018s full interview with Forrest Dunbar here.\nDemocrat Forrest Dunbar is challenging Republican Rep.
