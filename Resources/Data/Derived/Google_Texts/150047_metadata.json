She won two Grammys in January for the song: Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance.\n\nThis was Bruce's first show in New Zealand since March 28, 2003 and only his second show ever there. It was three-hours with 30 songs including another full album performance of \"Born in the U.S.A.\" There was only one other tour premiere \"Loose Ends\" which was a sign request. He has now played 128 different songs in only 16 dates.\n\nThe show was at Mt Smart Stadium, an outdoor venue that holds about 40,000 for concerts\n\n\"There's a lot of energy here,\" Mitch, formerly of Manalapan, texted. \"There's a huge crowd on the floor and looks like every seat is filled. It was a good show despite a pretty standard set list.\"\n\nHere's video of the opener of \"Royals:\"\n\nAround the 3:00 mark, Bruce makes some noteworthy lyric changes from Lorde's version: \"Long ago I was the next big thing. Now I'm in love with being king.\" The original has \"We're bigger than we've every dreamed. And I'm in love with being queen.\"\n\nDuring the Australian leg of the tour, Springsteen and the E Street Band covered AC/DC's \"Highway To Hell,\" INXS's \"Don't Change,\" the Easybeats' \"Friday On My Mind\" and the Bee Gees' \"Stayin' Alive.\" In South Africa, three of the shows opened with the Special's \"Free Nelson Mandela.\"\n\nShow began at 8:12 p.m. local time (18 hours ahead of New Jersey so that was 2:12 a.m. our time)\n\nSet list\n\n\n\n1.
