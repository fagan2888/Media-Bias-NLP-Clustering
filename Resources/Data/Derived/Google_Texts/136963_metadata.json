A Radio Christmas Spectacular,\u201d being presented at the Tulsa PAC this weekend by Playhouse Tulsa.\n\nAs there were concerns that the show\u2019s opening performance might be cancelled because of the weather (which it was), I attended the Wednesday night dress rehearsal.\n\nThere were still a few things about the show that needed tightening Wednesday. Some of the lighting cues that are meant to direct attention to different areas of the stage weren\u2019t in sync, and the show\u2019s pacing was uneven, almost sluggish in much of the first act. (problems that I have been told were addressed and corrected by Friday\u2019s performance).\n\nThe script \u2013\u2013 an original by Cody Daigle, the company\u2019s writer in residence and author of the Shakespearean fantasia \u201cWilliam and Judith\u201d and the adaptation of \u201cLittle Women\u201d \u2013\u2013 is resolutely old-fashioned, and in a good way.\n\nIt evokes the atmosphere of the 1940s neatly, and it shows that it is indeed possible to craft a comedy without digging into the gutter for material.\n\nInstead, you have Kate, a starry-eyed intern (Grace Stump), who insists that the station can be saved with an over-the-top Christmas show, complete with a big-name guest star.\n\nHowever, Kate's idea of a big name is Edith Montclair (Rebecca Ungerman), known as \"Tulsa's Almost Famous Broadway Star\" \u2013\u2013 she's been cast in a lot of great shows, but never managed to make on to the stage.\n\nAnd it doesn't help that Edith has a not-too-pleasant history with Barbara Tate (Janet Rutland), KMOK's leading actress.\n\nThe show's writer George (Denny Meredith-Orr) is routinely late turning in his scripts, such as \"The Road to Okmulgee,\" a serial in which a family has taken more than two years to travel from Tulsa to the titular city.\n\nSo, when the day of the station-saving Christmas show arrives, nothing goes as it should.\n\nUngerman is excellent as the outsized persona of Edith Montclair, whether proclaiming the highlights of her alleged career or wallowing in the throes of stage fright. Ungerman also wrote the three songs in the show, the ballad \"God, Please,\" the tongue-in-cheek \"We're Not Friends\" and the jaunty \"When You Come Around Christmas Time.\"\n\nTony Schneider does a great job as Benny James, the over-worked actor at the station, who often find himself supplying the voices for an entire cast of characters. Samuel J. Hunt is appealingly geeky as the sound effects man Freddy, and Jennifer Lynn is may be a bit anachronistically sassy as the receptionist Carol, but she does it well.\n\nStump conveys Kate's wide-eyed optimism with enthusiasm and Rutland manages to maintain a knowing serenity, even when she has to give voice to some sort of sea monster.\n\nAmy Neerman as the house musician Louanne nicely mimics the music performed by Suzy Meredith-Orr, while Allie Ray Righthouse's exaggerated nasal voice as the sponsor Vanette WoodWood is more annoying than comic.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "Review of Playhouse Tulsa's original holiday comedy.", "title": "ARTS: REVIEW -- \"Tulsa!
