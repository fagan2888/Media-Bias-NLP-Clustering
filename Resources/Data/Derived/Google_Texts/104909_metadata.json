( Rachel Dornhelm/KQED )\n\nDiane Schoenfeld is a weekly visitor at the Chaparral House nursing home in Berkeley.\n\nShe comes every Friday to spend time with her aunt, Lillie Manger.\n\n\u201cHi Aunt Lill!\u201d she says, squatting down next to her aunt\u2019s wheelchair, meeting her at eye level.\n\nManger is 97. She has straight white hair pulled back in a neat bun today. It\u2019s tied with a green scarf, an homage to the dancer she used to be.\n\nThey go together to the dining room to look over family pictures. Manger needs to be reminded who is in them. Including one of herself.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me?\u201d asks Manger\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d her niece confirms.\n\n\u201cAm I supposed to remember?\u201d says Manger.\n\nSchoenfeld smiles at her encouragingly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re supposed to. It\u2019s OK either way.\u201d\n\nManger has dementia. Schoenfeld is her \u201csurrogate decision maker\u201d meaning that, legally, she is the person who makes decisions about Manger\u2019s health care. Schoenfeld has filled me in on her story. This is the second nursing home where Manger has lived. The first was 45 minutes away, and Schoenfeld wasn\u2019t able to visit as often.\n\nAt that first nursing home, staff had recommended antipsychotic sedatives for Manger\u2019s behaviors, like crying out and outbursts. Schoenfeld shared staff notes with me about the recommendations. She says she wasn\u2019t thrilled but agreed. She thought her aunt might get better care, \u201crather than (staff) being unhappy with her behavior.\u201d\n\nComing Out of a Fog\n\nTwo years later Schoenfeld had moved her aunt to Chaparral House, to have her closer. By this time, Manger appeared to be in a fog. Eventually, Schoenfeld broached the idea of weaning her aunt from the medication with Chaparral House. As soon as they did, she says things turned around.\n\n\u201cI could see her personality again, I was so happy,\u201d Schoenfeld said. \u201cMy sister came to visit and (Lillie) used my sister\u2019s name and clearly recognized her, which we had not seen in the years that she was on the medication. I only wish I had done that sooner.\u201d\n\nSchoenfeld says it just didn\u2019t feel right to have her aunt sedated.\n\n\u201cIf a baby is crying, I mean most people will go to a baby and comfort them. They won\u2019t try to ignore them and drug them,\u201d she says.\n\nKJ Page, administrator of Chaparral House, shares that philosophy. Page says in many cases dementia patients came to their facility with a prescription to be given antipsychotics half an hour before bathtime. Then, a number of years ago she read a book called Bathing Without a Battle about bathing dementia patients and why it can be such a challenge.\n\nShe asks people to imagine putting yourself in the place of the nursing home resident. \u201cA person they didn\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t recognize, comes to take off their clothes,\u201d she says. \u201cAh! No wonder they\u2019re screaming and fighting and kicking!\u201d\n\nPage says after that \u201cAha!\u201d moment, the staff came to a new agreement. The residents were not out running marathons, for instance, or other sweat-inducing activities, so regular showers weren\u2019t necessary. Instead, residents would have a regular caregiver do simple sponge baths.\n\nPage says the results inspired further changes.\n\n\u201cIt just rolled into what else are they fighting for, and why do we need to have a fight?\u201d Page says, \u201cWhat can we do to make it easier for people and the staff? And that\u2019s how we approached it from there on.\u201d\n\nIt worked. While Page says antipsychotics do have a place for some people, not one of Chaparral House\u2019s dementia patients is currently taking the medications.\n\nGrading Nursing Homes on Avoiding Antipsychotic Drugs\n\nFederal Changes Chaparral House\u2019s experience is unusual. In California nursing homes, just over 15 percent of dementia patients are on these drugs. That\u2019s far more than advocates say is necessary. But that number is actually down from almost 22 percent just three years ago. That\u2019s when the federal government began regulating their use for dementia in nursing homes. This came in response to several studies warning the medicines had serious risks including, strokes, falls and even death.\n\nThe new guidelines stipulate that nursing homes are graded on the percent of their dementia patients receiving antipsychotic medications. That figure becomes part of their rating on Nursing Home Compare, a tool from Medicare that helps consumers compare information about nursing homes.\n\nThe drugs are traditionally deployed to control what is seen as problem behaviors. Reducing the medication requires new approaches and retraining staff to deal with people with dementia.\n\nEnter Caroline Stephens, assistant professor at the UCSF school of nursing, who specializes in psychiatric care for the elderly and long term care policy.\n\nShe says that the new regulations have had a positive impact on staff. \u201cThey\u2019re now realizing we don\u2019t have to reach for the medication and they\u2019re getting to think creatively about what we can do for this resident.\u201d\n\nClinicians Become \u2018Good Detectives\u2019\n\nI meet Stephens at the Hayward Healthcare & Wellness Center nursing home, where she consults. She helps train nurses and staff on person-centered care, being attentive to the cues that people give and trying to understand what is bothering them, even if they can\u2019t communicate it directly.\n\nStephens tells me the new regulations have given more credence to this medical approach. She describes one of her success stories helping a dementia patient who was always fighting to leave the facility at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cThey felt they needed to catch the bus, they had to get home because they need to take care of their daughter,\u201d she says.\n\nInstead of physically restraining the person or prescribing medication, Stephens says they put a sign on the door that said, simply, \u201cIt\u2019s a holiday; buses aren\u2019t running today.\u201d The sign worked. The person stopped fighting to leave and there was no need for antipsychotic medication.\n\nAt another nursing home, Stephens consulted with staff about a resident who was disruptive and constantly wandered at night \u2014 including into other patients\u2019 rooms. He had been given an antipsychotic to control his behavior. But in a deeper look at his background, staff learned that he\u2019d worked as a night security guard for most of his adult life.\n\nThe staff came up with a new plan. They gave the resident a badge and clipboard and walked with him on an abbreviated set of \u201cevening rounds.\u201d Sure enough, after that he\u2019d willingly go to bed, and they were able to take him off medication.\n\nStephens says when the patients themselves can\u2019t communicate it\u2019s vital to talk to family, to find out what the person did for a living, what they enjoyed in life.\n\n\u201cIt is our job as clinicians to be good detectives,\u201d she explains.\n\nThis is especially important as nursing homes serve an increasingly diverse clientele. Stephens says the nursing home model was built around an older, white, female patient. Today, the demographics have changed.\n\nAt Hayward Healthcare and Wellness, she says, \u201cThere are probably 15 different racial groups and a minimum of five languages spoken.\u201d\n\nRisk of Cherry-Picking Patients\n\nOne of the big advocates for the federal regulations was Tony Chicotel, staff attorney with California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. He welcomes the guidelines, but says he has noticed a concerning unintended consequence.\n\nWhile across the state the overall rate has dropped, he says he has noticed that several hundred nursing homes have rates that have either stayed the same or increased, in some cases almost doubled.\n\nChicotel says that in an effort to decrease their patients on antipsychotics to get better ratings, some facilities may be cherry-picking patients, essentially warehousing the hardest to wean from anti-psychotics in the bleakest facilities.\n\nChicotel says for families and caregivers can look up a nursing home\u2019s antipsychotic drug use rates as well as other drug usage on websites including Nursing Home Compare.\n\nStill, these guidelines and ratings only cover nursing homes.\n\nChicotel says increasingly he is fielding calls from families worried about the use of antipsychotics in assisted living and home care settings, which don\u2019t fall under the regulations.\n\n\u201cWe need to be more proactive about trying to get data for assisted living facilities and reconfiguring our message so it\u2019s more applicable to assisted-living facilities,\u201d Chicotel says.\n\nIt seems likely, though that that is coming. Earlier this year, the GAO released a report urging HHS to expand their regulation of antipsychotics in dementia patients to settings other than just nursing homes.\n\nUCSF professor Stephens says this points to retraining ever more medical professionals in patient-centered care, eliminating the need for patients to be medicated as a form of restraint.\n\n\u201cIf we can train generalists I think we can make some headway,\u201d she says.\n\nRachel Dornhelm wrote this piece with support from the Journalists in Aging Fellows Program of the Gerontological Society of America and New America Media, sponsored by the AARP.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I could see her personality again, I was so happy,\" a niece says of her 97-year-old aunt.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Calming Dementia Patients -- Without Powerful Drugs\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/05\\/20\\/calming-dementia-patients-without-powerful-drugs\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-20 10:15:00\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-05-26 16:04:25\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":28597,\"author_id\":\"252\",\"author_name\":\"Rachel Dornhelm\",\"author_display_name\":\"Rachel Dornhelm\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/05\\/nose-e1432154886996.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "\"I could see her personality again, I was so happy,\" a niece says of her 97-year-old aunt.", "title": "Calming Dementia Patients \u2014 Without Powerful Drugs", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/05/20/calming-dementia-patients-without-powerful-drugs/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/05/nose-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0918\"", "article_summary": "In California nursing homes, just over 15 percent of dementia patients are on these drugs.\nThe new guidelines stipulate that nursing homes are graded on the percent of their dementia patients receiving antipsychotic medications.\nPage says in many cases dementia patients came to their facility with a prescription to be given antipsychotics half an hour before bathtime.\nEarlier this year, the GAO released a report urging HHS to expand their regulation of antipsychotics in dementia patients to settings other than just nursing homes.\nWhile Page says antipsychotics do have a place for some people, not one of Chaparral House\u2019s dementia patients is currently taking the medications."}
