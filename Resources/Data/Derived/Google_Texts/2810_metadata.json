Hanen ordered a halt to the program in February.\n\nHomeland Security officials managed to either recover or certify as destroyed almost all of the erroneous three-year permits and replace them with two-year permits.\n\nIn 22 cases, however, the illegal immigrants refused to comply. Homeland Security then revoked their extra benefits but said they would be allowed to remain in the U.S. because they didn\u2019t meet the department\u2019s standards for deportation.\n\n\u201cDHS has set enforcement priorities to make sure our resources are focused on apprehending and removing convicted criminals, gang members, recent border crossers, and the most significant threats to public safety and national security,\u201d department spokeswoman Marsha Catron said in a statement.\n\nIndeed, the administration said in court filings Tuesday evening that it was considering reapproving full amnesties for 10 of the 22 who have since come forward and returned their erroneous cards or asserted that the permits have been lost or destroyed.\n\n\u201cUSCIS will determine on a case-by-cases basis whether to restore deferred action and employment authorization for these individuals,\u201d agency director Leon Rodriguez said.\n\nThe amnesties were issued erroneously because of a confusing automated approval process and weren\u2019t intended to flout the court\u2019s order, the Homeland Security Department\u2019s inspector general concluded in a report this month.\n\nStill, investigators said the system is so messy that they cannot be certain how many incorrect amnesties may have been issued. Mr. Rodriguez, in his court filing Tuesday, said the department has taken extensive steps to track down any remaining illegal permits.\n\nThe permits are part of Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 amnesty for Dreamers, the young adult illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Under his policy, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Dreamers were granted tentative legal status and two-year work permits that allowed them to obtain driver\u2019s licenses, in-state tuition breaks for public schools in many states, and Social Security numbers.\n\nMr. Obama last year proposed expanding the amnesty to three years and broadening its reach to include 4 million illegal immigrant parents, but Judge Hanen halted those moves in February.\n\nThe administration had already begun processing three-year permits for more than 100,000 Dreamers who qualified under the 2012 policy, and those all remain in effect, though they are being challenged by the states that sued to halt the amnesty.\n\nBut more than 2,600 other three-year applications were approved and mailed after the February injunction, causing an immense legal headache that the administration is trying to explain to Judge Hanen.\n\nAfter Judge Hanen accused the administration of having a \u201ccavalier\u201d attitude, officials announced that they would revoke the permits for anyone who didn\u2019t return their cards. In the end, all but 22 complied, for a success rate of more than 99 percent.\n\nRosemary Jenks, government relations director for NumbersUSA, which calls for a crackdown on immigration, said the 22 have done enough to qualify for deportation.\n\n\u201cThese are not only illegal aliens; they\u2019re illegal aliens who have decided they have so little regard for the president\u2019s unconstitutional rules that they\u2019re not even willing to follow those,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is amazing to me that it\u2019s not like the government was saying you have to give up your DACA status. They were saying you have to give up your three-year status for two years [and] they\u2019re snubbing their nose at the government.\u201d\n\nThose granted deferred action were able to apply for Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s licenses \u2014 two key components to proving identity and getting hired.\n\nHomeland Security said its systems have been updated to catch anyone who isn\u2019t authorized to work.\n\nLikewise, any of the illegal immigrants who try to apply for driver\u2019s licenses or Social Security numbers now will be stopped because their information has been changed in the key federal computer systems, Ms. Catron said.\n\nShe said if any of the 22 were to try to use their revoked permits to get jobs, that would be considered fraud and could lead to deportation. The Social Security Administration said if any of the 22 tried to apply for a number now, they would be blocked.\n\nBut Ms. Jenks said any of them who obtained Social Security cards and driver\u2019s licenses in the months after they were granted amnesty could easily win jobs at businesses that rely on the paper I-9 forms for employment checks rather than using the voluntary E-Verify system.\n\nSocial Security said it does not revoke or cancel numbers once they are issued, so any cards the illegal immigrants have remain valid. But the agency said merely having a number doesn\u2019t entitle someone to work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The government has revoked the amnesties of 22 illegal immigrants who refuse to return their three-year work permits, but Homeland Security officials said they won't be deported because their offenses aren't serious enough to merit being kicked out.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The government has revoked the amnesties of 22 illegal immigrants who refuse to return their three-year work permits, but Homeland Security officials said they won\u2019t be deported because their offenses aren\u2019t serious enough to merit being kicked out.", "title": "Illegal immigrant Dreamers who refused to return 3-year amnesties won\u2019t be deported", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/18/illegal-immigrant-dreamers-who-refused-to-return-3/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/18/DACA2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/18/DACA2.jpg", "description": "The government has revoked the amnesties of 22 illegal immigrants who refuse to return their three-year work permits, but Homeland Security officials said they won't be deported because their offenses", "card": "summary", "title": "Illegal immigrant Dreamers who refused to return 3-year amnesties won&"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Andrew S Hanen, Marsha Catron, Leon Rodriguez"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Rodriguez, in his court filing Tuesday, said the department has taken extensive steps to track down any remaining illegal permits.\nSocial Security said it does not revoke or cancel numbers once they are issued, so any cards the illegal immigrants have remain valid.\nIn 22 cases, however, the illegal immigrants refused to comply.\nThe permits are part of Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 amnesty for Dreamers, the young adult illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.\nThe government has revoked the amnesties of 22 illegal immigrants who refuse to return their three-year work permits, but Homeland Security officials said they won\u2019t be deported because their offenses aren\u2019t serious enough to merit being kicked out."}
