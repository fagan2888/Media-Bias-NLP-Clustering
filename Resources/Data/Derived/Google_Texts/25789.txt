Lake County and LifeStream Behavioral Center officials will have a ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday for nearly three dozen affordable housing units in Leesburg that took almost $2 million to renovate.

The complex, called Hope Springs Villas, is located at 1171 Bentley Road, where the ceremony will be held at 11 a.m.

The complex consists of 35 affordable housing units which include a manager’s apartment, laundry room, 18 two-bedroom units and 16 one-bedroom units, Elisha Pappacoda, the county’s public information officer, said in a press release. The $1.9 million renovation took nearly six months to complete, but the property has undergone substantial improvements over the last four years.

The property was previously deteriorating, having been foreclosed upon and abandoned, Pappacoda said.

Hope Springs Villas was funded by a grant from the county’s Neighborhood Stabilization Program through a Housing and Urban Development grant. The recently completed improvements include the completely renovated apartments, repaving of the parking lot, landscaping and lighting upgrades, new appliances, new roofing, renovated property manager’s office, new laundry room and upgraded HVAC and electrical system, Pappacoda said.

The Neighborhood Stabilization Program was established for the purpose of stabilizing communities that have suffered from foreclosures and abandonment, authorized under the Housing & Economic Recovery Act (HERA) of 2008. The program’s major goal is to purchase and redevelop foreclosed and abandoned homes and residential properties, and also stabilize communities within strategic targeted areas, according to the press release.
