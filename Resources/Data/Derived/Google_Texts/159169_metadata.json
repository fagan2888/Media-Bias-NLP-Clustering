The ins and outs of the Federal Communications Commission vote to subject the Internet and its players to Title II regulation is abstract. It takes work to line up all of President Barack Obama\u2019s promises for the Affordable Care Act with its actual outcomes. But everyone understands Subway, Massage Envy, Papa Johns and Anytime Fitness.\n\nAttacking these mom-and-pop stores will not be popular. When Democrats on Capitol Hill wake up to what is being done in their name \u2013 and they will when the letters and phone calls start pouring in \u2013 they will have every reason to feel that the Obamacrats have once again left an unpleasant surprise on their doorstep.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: Franchises are business arrangements that allow local investors to obtain a license for the right to sell a national brand in a given area (whether McDonald\u2019s or Burger King, the UPS Store or Sylvan Learning). Franchisers offer an operating system and support, while insisting that certain standards be met. For their part, franchisees are given wide leeway to hire, fire and manage their stores.\n\n\n\nIllustration by Adriana Scott for USNWR, Photos by Mary Altaffer/AP Images, Brian Brainerd/Getty Images, Jason Merritt/Getty Images, Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP Photo\n\nSome franchises are better deals than others. Prospective investors certainly need to scrutinize the small print before getting into business with a national brand. But as a drive past any strip mall in America shows, investing in a franchise is one of the most common ways for people with limited savings and limitless drive to start a business and build personal wealth.\n\n[See: Editorial Cartoons on Barack Obama ]\n\nSuch scalable opportunity explains why there are now roughly 760,000 franchise small businesses in the United States employing millions of people. One out of five franchise owners is a member of a minority group. Franchising is an especially common route many women take to owning their own business. The franchise model has allowed many aspiring entrepreneurs to create a local success and, with other people\u2019s capital, rapidly expand it into a national network.\n\nAdriana Scott for USNWR\n\nGiven that small business is the principal driver of employment in this country, any other administration would celebrate the franchise business model as a driver of social success. But as with \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d the Obamacrats are ever ready to solve problems that don\u2019t exist by, well, creating bigger problems.\n\nThe NLRB appears to be preparing to move on a recommendation from its general counsel to declare franchisees and franchisers to be \u201cjoint employers,\u201d thus making the franchisers liable for virtually anything that happens in thousands of small businesses. Purveyors of social justice see this as a way to make national chains take responsibility for their workers with uniform policies and higher wages. Unions see it as a wedge to organize an untapped workforce. Franchisees see it as a way to go broke.\n\n\n\nAdriana Scott for USNWR\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nWith their money on the line, franchisees naturally want to set wages and manage working conditions in their own shop. If this system is unilaterally rewritten by unelected Obamacrats, the costs of buying a franchise license and franchise fees will soar. Liability concerns will discourage brands from accepting the very people with the most to gain \u2013 potential partners who are long on energy and drive but short on managerial track records.\n\nThe Obamacrats' franchise decision would be in line with other initiatives forced on America. In 2010, Obamacare was sold as a law that would lower premiums, protect vulnerable populations from being gouged for prescription drugs, while bringing more choice and competition. The result has been higher premiums for people who obtain health insurance outside of work, higher medication costs for people with pre-existing conditions and less choice and less competition in health care.\n\n\n\nAdriana Scott for USNWR\n\nThis year, the FCC enacted net neutrality to protect the consumer, only to ground it in a 1930s Ma Bell-era regulation of the Internet that now has leading advocates of net neutrality publicly voicing regret that they ever opened their mouths.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Obama NLRB Franchise Decision Would Be Blow to Small Business Success Story", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The NLRB is advancing a decision that could spell the end of one of the most successful business models of all time.", "title": "Obama\u2019s War on Franchises", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/mark-davis/2015/03/25/obama-nlrb-franchise-decision-would-be-blow-to-small-business-success-story", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/79/32/77d75c4348d8a6cf6ede240729ce/150122-mcdonalds-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The NLRB is advancing a decision that could spell the end of one of the most successful business models of all time.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama NLRB Franchise Decision Would Be Blow to Small Business Success Story"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "March 25, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Mark W.
