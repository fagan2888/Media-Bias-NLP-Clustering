Larry Keller is cancer free and practicing law again after a life-saving surgery, made possible by new insurance coverage. But a glut of new consumers now covered by Medicaid are waiting as much as four months before they can see a doctor for a routine visit. Welcome to the growing pains and gains ushered in by the unprecedented shift of people who now have health care coverage. A full year since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s most sweeping reforms were put to test, areas of the Tri-State boast a long hoped-for and fundamental outcome of the controversial law: Fewer uninsured Americans. In Southwest Ohio’s Butler, Clermont, Warren and Hamilton counties more than 80,300 residents have health benefits not open to them before. In Northern Kentucky’s Boone, Campbell and Kenton counties more than 30,000 now have new insurance. I don't care what your politics are - Richard Nixon could have passed this law.

- Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear “People are getting over their concerns about this being ‘Obamacare,’ and they’re signing up because the fear of not having coverage and being sick is just not a place you want to be,” said Judith Warren, CEO of Roselawn-based nonprofit Health Care Access Now. The coverage hasn’t come without challenges. Some worry that their new insurance means costly, out-of-pocket expense they won’t be able to cover if they get sick. Others complain the plans don’t cover the doctors they need or worse: They can’t see the doctors they have without lengthy waits. As the second wave of insurance signups wrap up this month, here’s a by-the-numbers look at the law’s impact. Kentucky boasts biggest gains Kentucky is a standout nationally when it comes to health insurance signups. The percentage of uninsured in the Bluegrass dropped by 8.9 percent in 2014, which was the second sharpest decline in the U.S. just behind Arkansas. A state long ranked among the worst in the country for diabetes, smoking rates and myriad of chronic diseases, Kentucky’s lead role in insurance sign-ups nationally is a welcome success for state policy makers. “I don’t care what your politics are – Richard Nixon could have passed this law. We needed something transformational to make a generational and historic change for the future of Kentuckians," said Gov. Steven Beshear Kentucky Gov. Steven Beshear talks about health care costs in Kentucky. State officials attribute the success to the ease of signing on to new insurance through Kentucky’s online marketplace – Kynect.ky.gov. The remaining states, including Ohio and Indiana, opted to let the federal government run their marketplaces hosted at Healthcare.gov. While the federal site faced massive coding errors and crashes during its debut in 2014, Kynect continues to be a national success story touted by President Barack Obama for its mostly glitch-free design. Now, other states are turning to Kentucky, and at least one state – Oregon - is scrapping its own state-based exchange to build one that models Kynect. Medicaid expansion fuels new coverage boom States like Kentucky and Ohio that expanded Medicaid coverage – a key option under health reform - have enrolled millions of low-income Americans into the joint state-federal health insurance program.

The rest with new coverage bought plans through the new federally-run and state-based marketplaces created to offer discounts to those buying health insurance on their own. The web-based marketplaces, also called exchanges, are considered critical for consumers who are self-employed or don’t get insurance through their employer. Across the Tri-State more than 29,000 plans were sold through the first wave of open enrollment, which ended in March 2014. Source: Department of Health & Human Services So far this year, sign-ups have been more robust compared to 2014 when Healthcare.gov was plagued by weeks of glitches and crashes. Officials expect Ohio to nearly double enrollment in marketplace plans from roughly 155,000 to nearly 300,000, says Trey Daly, Ohio director for Enroll America, a national nonprofit working to sign up uninsured. “We know a major barrier for people who did not enroll in the first round was the lack of information and awareness of the financial assistance available,” said Daly. Through early January, more than 196,000 Ohioans have enrolled, with 52 percent re-enrolling from last year, according to federal Department of Health and Human Services. In Kentucky, more than 100,000 have signed on with more than 90 percent re-enrolling. In Indiana, more than 175,000 have enrolled. The latest data available on enrollment doesn’t include county-level statistics. This year, open enrollment to buy a plan through the new marketplaces runs through February 15. But unlike the marketplace, enrollment in Medicaid is open throughout the year. 350,000 Hoosiers stuck in coverage gap The gains in the Bluegrass and Buckeye states are in sharp contrast to neighbors just miles away in Indiana. Indiana was one of 28 states that opted against expanding Medicaid coverage. And it saw its percentage of uninsured adults actually drop – moving from 15.3 percent in 2013 to 15 percent last year. Last month Indiana Gov. Mike Pence announced the state will pursue its own alternative plan to Medicaid expansion. The move would pave the way for coverage for an estimated 350,000 Hoosiers who currently remain uninsured and stuck in a coverage gap. They’re ineligible for Medicaid but don’t make enough to qualify for tax credits available through the marketplace that would offset their insurance costs. “The sad part is, these are people who are trying hard to earn a living, and they can’t get the same coverage as folks just a few miles away because they’re a Hoosier," said Roger Howard, CEO of Dearborn County Hospital The ACA is projected to cut the number of uninsured by 56 percent by 2016 when the health law is fully intact. But experts project millions of people in the U.S. still will remain uninsured for a variety of reasons. Immigrants in the country illegally, for example, don’t qualify for coverage. An analysis funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Urban Institute projects that as many as 27.1 million Americans will be uninsured in 2016. Among those: 37 percent would be eligible for coverage under Medicaid, but just aren’t aware.

22 percent are in states that didn't expand Medicaid

17 percent are higher-income people who aren't eligible for tax credits through the exchange, but choose not to buy insurance on their own. Back in Indiana, officials say the federal government’s recent approval for its Medicaid plan is welcome news after eight months of negotiating on finer points of the plan. “This has been a long process,’’ Pence said, “but real reform takes work.”

Marketplace insurance offerings vary on affordability Big up-front savings offset by other high costs and hurdles

Larry Keller doesn’t mince words when it comes to how he feels about the country’s health law. “A typical Cincinnati conservative would rather slit his wrists than consider a so-called Obamacare policy," Keller said. "But no exaggeration, I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the Healthcare.gov website.” The West Chester Township resident was among nearly 29,000 Tri-State residents to buy a health insurance plan last year sold through the new online marketplaces ushered in by health reform. While Keller credits the coverage for saving his life, putting the benefits to work came with big challenges and a hefty price tag: $676 a month to cover him and his teen son. A typical Cincinnati conservative would rather slit his wrists than consider a so-called Obamacare policy."

-Larry Keller Keller’s experiences – good and bad – are shared by millions of consumers who, in the last year, tapped into newly offered insurance benefits. For many, the new coverage has come with big monthly discounts, saving millions of families hundreds of dollars each month. Some still worry, because of other high out-of-pocket costs, that they won’t be able to afford the care they need if they get sick. Consumers like Keller were shocked to learn that the coverage they bought didn’t cover the doctors they wanted. Still others complain: "Going to my doctor was cheaper for me when I didn’t have health insurance," said Cindy Bastin of East Price Hill Going to my doctor was cheaper for me when I didn't have health insurance."

- Cindy Bastin, East Price Hill Under health reform, most Americans must buy insurance or face steep financial penalties come tax time. Those who aren’t insured this year face a penalty of $325 per adult or 2 percent of the household income -- whichever is higher, when they file 2015 taxes. In 2016, the penalty jumps to $695 per person, or 2.5 percent of a family’s income. For a family of four that’s uninsured, the minimum fine is about $1,000. “They’re looking at losing an entire tax return – or more - and so many are saying they just can’t afford not to have insurance,” said Angela Robinson, an outreach and enrollment specials with the Cincinnati Health Department. Can I afford this health insurance? Cathy Barney's family budget has a little more wiggle room. The Barney family of Milford, Ohio. Photo: Lisa Bernard-Kuhn | WCPO The Milford family of four is saving more than $500 a month on its health insurance plan thanks to tax credits offered through the new health insurance marketplace, Healthcare.gov. “Finally, after all of these years of buying health insurance on our own, there is some relief,” said Barney, who in the past paid nearly $1,000 a month. Nationally, 85 percent of Americans who bought a plan through marketplaces qualified for federal tax credits, saving them $264 a month on average. Average savings across Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana ranged from $250 to $336 a month. The web-based marketplaces, also called exchanges, are cornerstones of health reform and considered critical for consumers like the Barneys who are self-employed. Still up for debate is just how affordable the insurance plans really are – even after tax credits are applied. More than 80 percent of the plans sold through the marketplaces in 2014 had deductibles of $2,500 or higher, according to research from The Advisory Board. “There is concern that these higher deductible plans will cause consumers to forgo or delay care because of the cost," said Reem Aly, director of Healthcare Payment and Innovation Policy at the Health Policy Institute of Ohio For 57-year-old Cindy Bastin, that’s exactly the case. “We just don’t go to the doctor unless we’re really, really sick,” said Bastin. She is paying about $500 a month for health insurance that covers she and her husband. The couple’s deductible is $9,200, even after receiving a tax credit worth more than $430 a month. That leaves them paying out of pocket for costly prescriptions that add up to more than $300 a month. “There is concern that these higher deductible plans will cause consumers to forgo or delay care because of the cost.”

- Reem Aly “Thank God we own our home and cars, otherwise we’d have to make the choice between paying for those or our health insurance,” says Bastin. “It just worked out better for us when we didn’t have to have health insurance.” Advocates say more in-person help and education is needed as people shop and buy plans on the marketplace. The true cost of health coverage involves complicated calculations demanding an understanding of insurance lingo like deductible, in-network and out-of-pocket costs. “This can be an overwhelming experience for folks,” said Trey Daly, Ohio director of Enroll America, a national nonprofit working to sign up the uninsured. “For many, this is their first experience shopping for health insurance. It’s an issue that is very personal, very intimate and very complicated. That’s why assistance is so critical.” In spite of hurdles, coverage is worth it, he said. Among the most fundamental changes brought on by health reform last year is the banning insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Armed with that knowledge, West Chester’s Keller went insurance shopping on Healthcare.gov in late 2013, eager to buy coverage that would help battle colon cancer that had spread to his liver. It wasn't easy. “The various policies that are offered have names like they are in code or something,” he said. “It's hard to tell exactly what you are buying and if you are comparing apples to apples as far as price is concerned. It can be very difficult to see if a particular doctor or hospital is in a company's network.” Keller eventually chose a Humana Gold plan for he and his son. The plan saved him $200 a month over his previous policy. He made too much as a lawyer to qualify for a tax credit, he said. His plan covered more than his earlier catastrophic-coverage plan, which didn't cover preventive care and also required him to spends thousands for his medical care. But there was a catch: Keller’s surgical oncologist at University of Cincinnati's Barrett Cancer Center wasn’t an in-network provider. Like millions of who bought a plan through the marketplace, Keller’s policy was with a health maintenance organization (HMO). Such plans limit consumer choices for providers as a way to cut costs and offer lower rates. Just days before his scheduled surgery, Keller received notice from his insurer that the procedure was not covered because he chose an out-of-network provider. Larry Keller talks about his health care plan. Photo: Emily Maxwell | WCPO After spending hours on the phone battling with his insurer, the surgery was approved – with his insurer striking a deal that would allow the surgery to be done at an in-network price. A year later and cancer-free, Keller said he’s thankful for the coverage but thinks more can be done to help consumers understand what they’re buying. “It would be great if you could just type in the name of the doctor or hospital, and then the website gives you a list of which insurance policies include that provider in their networks,” he said. “Going through the provider page for each policy can be tedious and frustrating." Keller went shopping through the marketplace again this year – and he scheduled an appointment with a certified application counselor who helped him confirm his networks and costs. “It's all kind of intimidating,” said Keller. “But in the end, it's worth it."

The Medicaid conundrum: Hundreds of thousands enrolled, but for how long? Policy makers on watch as Indiana takes it's own path For much of his adult life, Raymond McElfers never went to the doctor. As a tree-trimmer, perks like health insurance just were never part of the job. So in April, when the 30-year-old Latonia resident’s new Medicaid coverage kicked in, he went for a routine physical. The father of four was told that a mass in his throat he had been ignoring was a cancerous tumor. By December, doctors had removed the original mass and another they later discovered. Raymond McElfers has his throat examined by his doctor. Photo: Emily Maxwell | WCPO “Without health insurance, I never would have been able to get surgery – let alone two surgeries,” said McElfers. “It’s been a life saver.” Under the Affordable Care Act, Ohio and Kentucky are among the 27 states to extend Medicaid benefits to people like McElfers. Indiana announced last month it will soon embark on an expansion effort. With So Many, Wait Times Grow In Southwest Ohio and Northern Kentucky, more than 85,600 residents have enrolled into the new benefits in the last year. The program’s expansion has been a boon for community health centers and safety net providers that for decades have offered deeply discounted care or forgone payments altogether from tens of thousands of people who couldn’t afford health insurance. “Every day we’re enrolling someone new,” said Judith Warren, CEO of Health Care Access Now in Roselawn. “It’s providing so many a chance to get care who otherwise would have delayed it, or not managed their chronic disease appropriately and just get sicker.” As the number of newly enrolled continue to swell, some say it can be difficult for some new Medicaid patients to connect with a doctor. Some providers complain Medicaid still pays doctors too little for the care they provide, keeping many from accepting new patients. Experts say it’s still too soon to know whether the new benefits are having any impact on local residents health. “Medicaid is just a means to accessing care, and you wouldn’t expect this policy change alone to be responsible for changing the ultimate health and well being for those covered,” said Amy Rohling McGee, president of the Columbus-based think tank Health Policy Institute of Ohio, “It’s necessary, but it’s among multiple changes needed.” There is a concern of how long you can ride this wave financially.

- Chris Goddard, CEO of HealthPoint Critics - argue that the move will prove too costly to taxpayers as millions of patients like McElfers begin to tap into their benefits. The federal government has promised to pick up 100 percent of costs for expanding benefits to those who are newly eligible through 2016. That contribution phases down to 90 percent by 2020. As the costs come in, even supporters have concerns that lawmakers may reconsider their support. “There is a concern of how long you can ride this wave financially,” said Chris Goddard, CEO of HealthPoint. The nonprofit saw a more than 15 percent jump in Medicaid patients across its six Northern Kentucky offices last year. “This is tremendous growth across the state,” he said. You just hate to think that once you ramp up services, add capacity and offer these benefits – a few years later it could be all withdrawn. - Chris Goddard, CEO - HealthPoint Expansion delivers boost, challenges for safety net providers In Cincinnati, the number of uninsured people turning to the city’s health department has more than doubled. About 50 percent of the department’s 35,000 patients seen across its seven health centers are now enrolled in Medicaid – a boost that’s brought in an estimated $2 million in revenue in 2014. Despite adding a new office to try and meet demand for an estimated 3,000 new primary care appointments, new patients looking to connect with the doctor are waiting for weeks. “We’ve had some capacity issues, and our biggest limitations have been finding providers,” said Dr. Lawrence Holditch, the department’s medical director. Across the region, there’s a shortage of primary care doctors and not all of them accept new Medicaid patients because reimbursements for care are paid out at about a third of commercial insurance. “It’s a real challenge to find doctors who will accept new patients,” said Warren, who runs a program aimed at helping high users of emergency room services. “When we try to refer someone to a primary care doctor, it can take up to three to four weeks, or longer, to get an appointment, which defeats the whole purpose of trying to keep them out the ED,” says Warren. Still, Holditch and Warren agree the current scenario is better than the alternative of having tens of thousands of patients with no way to pay for their care. Longer term, expanded coverage should “enhance our community’s health,” Holdicth said. Policymakers watching Indiana alternative Just miles away in Indiana, about 350,000 residents are expected to qualify for new coverage under the state’s own version of Medicaid expansion dubbed Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0. The state received approval two weeks ago from the federal government to move forward with the alternative program, after an eight-month wait. Indiana’s plan will extend Medicaid to those who make less than 138 percent of the federal poverty limit, or $16,104 a year. Previously, Medicaid excluded coverage for adults under 65 who did not have dependent children. Separating Indiana from other states, cost-sharing rules will require some of the newly enrolled to pay for a portion of their care. It also includes co-pays aimed at limited expensive emergency room visits ($8 for first visit, $25 for second.) The expansion is welcome news to residents like Tracy Huismann of Bright. Tracy Huismann reviews the latest rejection letter she received denying her from Medicaid coverage. Photo: Lisa Bernard-Kuhn | WCPO Huismann, who lost coverage early in 2015, suffers post traumatic stress disorder. The medicine she takes to manage it costs more than $200 a month. “If I could just get this under control, I could have a job again and get my life back,” said Huismann, who’s already filled out an application with the help of enrollment assistors at Dearborn County Hospital. Indiana’s move will be watched by lawmakers across the country who are calling for reforms to Medicaid that help curb the program’s cost. In Ohio and Kentucky, Medicaid is the second largest expense in each state’s budget, just behind education. It rings in at $5.9 billion in Ohio and $3.2 billion in Kentucky. Rohling-McGee said her think tank is “very interested in studying the relationship between employment and Medicaid, and how the coverage can help a person become or stay employed,” she said. “That can play a big role to some one moving on up the ladder and moving from Medicaid to private health insurance.” Pushback from critics has leaders in Ohio and Kentucky working to make the case to keep their programs in place. “The critics have shifted from ‘this is terrible’ to 'well, may be it’s OK, but are we going to be able to afford it?'” said Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear. “Honestly, that’s a legitimate question.” Beshear is awaiting the results of a consultant's report on the expansion’s impact on consumers, providers and the state’s budget. “We don’t have all the results back yet, but just a few things we do know are encouraging,” said Beshear. “Just in one year there has been about 5,300 new jobs in health care created already ... Our hospitals in this state, they’ve gotten an infusion in money that they’ve never seen before. That bodes well for our economy.” In Ohio, similar work has been under way in recent months as Gov. John Kasich works to get the legislature’s stamp of approval on his recent budget proposal. Kasich sidestepped his party’s line in 2013 when he agreed to accept billions of federal dollars to expand Medicaid. Now, he’s calling for cuts in other areas of Medicaid to curb the program’s cost. Among his proposals: Eliminating Medicaid coverage for some pregnant women and certain disabled adults whose incomes are higher than $15,500 a year. Currently, these Ohioans are eligible if they earn up to $23,400 (or 200 percent of the poverty limit.) Those currently covered wouldn’t lose coverage, but the change would prevent new enrollees starting 2016. The savings is estimated at more than $7 million in 2016 and more than $15 million in 2017.

Like Indiana’s plan, Kasich wants some low-income residents to pay for their coverage. Ohio is again petitioning the federal government to allow a $20 monthly premium to be assessed to those currently on Medicaid who earn more than $11,670 (or more 100 percent of the federal poverty level. If approved, the move would save Ohio more than $4 million over the next two years. All told, the changes could save Ohio taxpayers $47 million over the next two years, Kasich’s administration says. The proposals have some health care and low-income advocates concerned. “Those all create barriers with people who have no disposable income,” Cathy Levine, executive director of Columbus-based Universal Health Care Action Network. “I’m hoping that smart health policy prevails at the end of the day.”

Health care providers report varied impact as levels of uninsured drop Newly insured using benefits, but unpaid bills still a problem As hundreds of thousands of residents across the region put new health care benefits to the test, doctors and hospitals are reporting a mixed bag of gains and growing pains. Nationally, more than 10 million Americans are estimated to have signed up for insurance in the last year under the Affordable Care Act’s new online marketplaces and expansion of Medicaid in 27 states. Locally, health care providers report unprecedented shifts in the number of patients coming through who previously couldn’t pay their bills. Dr. Lawrence Holditch talks about the impact of the Affordable Care Act on health care providers in Ohio. At Mercy Health – Ohio’s largest health system operator – the number of uninsured patients dropped 60 percent in 2014 among those checking in for an inpatient stay. Among outpatients, those who were uninsured fell 35 percent, officials told WCPO. At UC Health, the percentage of uninsured was cut nearly in half, and now accounts for about 8.5 percent of all patients seeking care, down from 14 percent. “It’s a significant shift and it’s headed in the right direction,” said Tim Maloney, vice president of payor relations at UC Health. Cutting down on the number of patients who can’t pay their bills is considered critical to achieving a fundamental goal of the ACA: Stemming the country’s trend of skyrocketing health care costs. Other trends under way in health care could offset recent gains as some consumers find themselves shouldering more of their health costs. “If you’re a hospital, that means you now have to collect more of your revenue stream from a patient, rather than an insurer,” said Zac Stillerman, a general manager with the D.C.-based health care research and consulting firm The Advisory Board. “That’s a big change.” The toll of an unpaid doctor’s bill For decades, health care experts have blamed America’s escalating health care costs in large part on patients who show up in emergency rooms sick and unable to pay. Those unpaid bills, known as a hospital or doctor’s uncompensated care costs, are either written off as bad debts that can’t be collected or as charity care for those who can’t pay. In 2012, uncompensated care costs across the U.S. were estimated to be as high as $51 billion. To make up for the loss, doctors and health systems build those costs into their fees. And that gets passed on to those who do pay. "We're seeing more and more under-insured people who can't pay the high deductibles that come with the insurance they now have."

- Joe Kelley, health systems spokesman The ACA aims to tackle this cost conundrum by mandating that most Americans have health insurance coverage. The argument being that those who have health insurance visit their doctor more often. Doing that, keeps patients healthier and out of the emergency room where care is the costliest. In 2014, savings from those unpaid bills is estimated to be $5.7 billion. Still, health systems locally and nationally say the gains are muted by other market dynamics. Like its competitors, Avondale-based TriHealth has seen a drop in the uninsured since Ohio’s expansion of Medicaid last year. But reimbursement rates from Medicaid to the health system are “too low,” said Joe Kelley, a health system spokesman. "We're seeing more and more under-insured people who can't pay the high deductibles that come with the insurance they now have," Kelley said. As high-deductible plans increase, health systems on watch Nationally, more than 80 percent of consumers who bought a health insurance plan through the new marketplaces took on a deductible of $2,500 or more. Outside of the marketplaces, 25 percent of employer coverage has moved to plans with high deductibles. That number was 5 percent a decade ago. “That’s tough because now those consumers are on the hook for every one of those dollars before their coverage kicks in, and many don’t understand that it’s their obligation,” said the Advisory Board’s Stillerman. A recent analysis by the Advisory Board of high-deductible plans found that the higher the patient obligation, the less likely they were to pay their bills in full. It also noted that reimbursement rates to doctors from exchange plans are lower than commercial offerings. As the shift to higher deductible plans unfolds, health system executives say, it will take some time for consumers and providers to adjust. “For so long, the person receiving the health care was so disconnected from paying for it. Your employer was always paying most of the bill. Health reform, if anything, is trying to connect the dots by putting more purchasing power in the consumer's hands to make those buying decisions.” - Chris Bergman, CFO - The Christ Hospital The trends could force more health systems to take on even larger roles in engaging patients earlier about their financial obligations. “If we play this forward five years, I think most hospitals and health systems are going to get a lot more sophisticated about how to quote their prices,” said Stillerman. The trend could yield new innovations to help consumers shop for providers. “You can even imagine a scenario where there’s parallel technology to an Orbitz or Experian that would empower consumers to make decisions based on their coverage, the quality and the price,” said Stillerman.
