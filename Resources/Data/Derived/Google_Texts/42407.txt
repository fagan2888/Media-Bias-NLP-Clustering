On Monday, the search was on for a woman three small children who got lost in the Big Ditch just south of Wichita, when they went looking to help a friend who was stuck in the mud.

Thanks to a technology called "FLIR" (forward looking infrared), police found the family in just several hours.

The Wichita police helicopter communicated with police on the ground and led them to the SUV. The "FLIR" technology is the same type that helped Boston Police locate and apprehend the main suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing.

Authorities have this technology at its disposal for several years and it was instrumental in this week's successful search.

"FLIR" technology has become very popular with police departments across the country. In fact, "FLIR" hosts an awards ceremony every year, honoring the police departments with the best videos showcasing use of the technology.
