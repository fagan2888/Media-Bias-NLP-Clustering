Bill Cassidy, Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu\u2019s main Republican opponent:\n\nIt claims Cassidy once sponsored a bill to set up \u201cgovernment-run health care\u201d in the state. That\u2019s pure invention; Cassidy\u2019s bill did nothing of the sort.\n\nAnd it says he argued for \u201cautomatic Obamacare registration,\u201d when he didn\u2019t. Cassidy actually called for repealing the law \u2014 and enrolling the uninsured in a scaled-back GOP alternative.\n\nThe attack ad began airing June 7. It is sponsored by the Senate Majority PAC, a big-donor super PAC bent on keeping Democrats in control of the U.S. Senate. But from the way the ad slams Obamacare, a viewer might be forgiven for thinking it was the work of the Koch brothers or Karl Rove.\n\n\u2018Obamacare Lite\u2019?\n\nThe narrator says, \u201cCassidy wrote a plan for Louisiana that\u2019s been called \u2018Obamacare lite.\u2019 \u201d That\u2019s true as far as it goes. One opinion columnist for the Baton Rouge Advocate did call Cassidy\u2019s bill \u2014 not very accurately \u2014 \u201cObamacare lite.\u201d The columnist also predicted \u2014 more accurately \u2014 that Democrats would use the bill against Cassidy in this year\u2019s U.S. Senate race.\n\nBut there\u2019s simply no support for the ad\u2019s claim that \u201cCassidycare would have created government-run health care in our state, with government bureaucrats making medical decisions.\u201d There\u2019s simply nothing like that in the bill.\n\nThe ad refers to S.B. 307, a bill that Cassidy introduced in 2007 when he was a Louisiana state senator \u2014 long before \u201cObamacare\u201d was a word, and even before Obama had announced he would run for president. Cassidy\u2019s bill had one pale similarity to what eventually became the federal Affordable Care Act \u2014 it would have set up something called a \u201cLouisiana Health Insurance Exchange\u201d within the state Department of Insurance.\n\nNothing Like Obamacare\n\nBut Cassidy\u2019s state-run exchange would have been nothing like the ACA.\n\nCassidy\u2019s proposal didn\u2019t include subsidies for low-income people, wouldn\u2019t have required individuals to obtain coverage or have required employers to provide coverage, didn\u2019t set any requirements for what health insurance must cover, and didn\u2019t include any new taxes or fees. And it didn\u2019t include any new regulations on doctors, hospitals or patients, contrary to the ad\u2019s claim that it amounted to \u201cgovernment-run health care.\u201d The ACA, of course, isn\u2019t \u201cgovernment-run health care\u201d either, despite the many times Republicans have tried to brand it as such.\n\nInstead, Cassidy\u2019s proposed exchange would have been a \u201cclearinghouse\u201d for negotiations among parties in the insurance market. The actual language of the rather brief, 22-page bill described the \u201cprimary responsibility\u201d of the new exchange as being \u201cto promote and assist such an individual, person, business, state or local government, association and other juridical entity seeking health insurance coverage and any insurer to negotiate and transact a suitable contract or agreement between the parties to provide such coverage.\u201d\n\nIt is conceivable \u2014 barely \u2014 that Cassidy\u2019s bill could eventually have led to something in Louisiana resembling the Massachusetts health care law that then-Gov. Mitt Romney had signed into law the previous year, in 2006. The bill would have required state officials to come up with a set of \u201creform\u201d proposals to present to the Legislature in 2008, designed to \u201cprovide health insurance coverage to each citizen of this state.\u201d\n\nBut believing that Cassidy\u2019s bill could have led even to \u201cRomneycare lite\u201d in Louisiana requires a heavy dose of speculation. The bill didn\u2019t specify how the goal of universal coverage should be reached, and the possibility of a mandate for individuals to obtain coverage \u2014 the central element of both \u201cRomneycare\u201d and \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 wasn\u2019t even among the several ideas the bill would have required state officials to study and evaluate before coming up with their health care plan.\n\nCassidy\u2019s bill would have required state officials to \u201c[e]valuate demonstrated and verifiable successful reform experience of other states\u201d \u2014 presumably including Massachusetts \u2014 and it required officials to consider \u201cpossible waivers\u201d for Medicaid as one way of funding any proposed changes, as Romney did in Massachusetts. The bill also would have required state officials to \u201c[e]xplore the use of tax credits, vouchers and health insurance premium assistance.\u201d\n\nBut exploring, evaluating and studying possibilities is a far cry from proposing anything. And the ideas weren\u2019t limited to elements later adopted by the ACA. One of the means to be studied \u2014 the idea of \u201ctax credits\u201d \u2014 was soon being embraced by the GOP\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain, as a Republican alternative to the outright subsidies contained in the ACA. Does that make Cassidy\u2019s bill \u201cMcCain-care lite.\u201d Of course not.\n\nAs it happened, Cassidy\u2019s bill led to nothing. It died quietly in committee without receiving even so much as a public hearing.\n\nA Republican rival to Cassidy, Rob Maness, also pointed to a bill he co-sponsored with another senator in 2008 \u2014 S.B. 535 \u2014 which would have required group insurance policies for businesses with fewer than 50 employees to cover treatment for mental illness, alcoholism and drug abuse. But that\u2019s hardly comparable to the much broader coverage requirements of the ACA.\n\nFurthermore, Cassidy\u2019s 2008 bill called for a tax credit to offset the added premium costs to businesses (estimated to be between $67 million and $199 million by 2013), and it would not have become effective without such a credit. As it happened, his proposal was defeated on the Senate floor by a vote of 13 to 24.\n\nCassidy, when rival Republicans brought up the \u201cCassidycare\u201d allegation, issued a strong rebuttal:\n\nCassidy: The program I proposed is similar to other Republican programs. It was voluntary, market-based and meant to give people other options. President Obama\u2019s law, passed by Democrats on a party-line vote, is enforced by the IRS, dictates benefits and requires participation under penalty of law. By definition, it\u2019s not market based. To compare one to another is like comparing crony capitalism to capitalism. Anyone who thinks these bills are similar either does not understand their intent or hasn\u2019t read them.\n\nHaving read and studied these two bills, we agree that they\u2019re nothing like a \u201clite\u201d version of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u2018Automatic Obamacare Registration\u2019?\n\nThe Senate Majority PAC ad further claims that \u201cCassidy even said the government should automatically register us in Obamacare if we don\u2019t sign up.\u201d On screen appear the words \u201cautomatic Obamacare registration,\u201d as though Cassidy favored dragooning everybody into the exchanges. But that isn\u2019t true either.\n\nThe ad refers to remarks that Cassidy made March 20 to the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association. An audio recording of those remarks was obtained by the website Buzzfeed, which posted it March 26. In those remarks, Cassidy does indeed argue for automatically signing up uninsured people \u2014 for his own Republican alternative to the ACA.\n\nThe recording starts with Cassidy responding to a question, which he summarizes: \u201cIf you [Cassidy] don\u2019t like the president\u2019s law, what would you do differently?\u201d And, \u201cWhat would be my solution?\u201d He answers that by describing an alternative plan in which everyone below a certain income level would receive a health savings account, a policy to cover \u201ccatastrophic\u201d costs over a certain amount, and \u201ca pharmacy program.\u201d He adds, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have all these benefits that we have to pay so much for\u201d under the ACA.\n\nIn the recording, Cassidy then turns to \u201cother things I would do,\u201d and argues that the uninsured tend to be unable to grasp the complexities of choosing insurance coverage. Democrats have said this insults uninsured Louisianans, so we\u2019ll quote the relevant portion in full:\n\nCassidy, March 20: Insurance people they will tell you that they will go to a company and the employer will pay for everything, and there are some people who will not sign up. Turns out, those are my patients. They\u2019re illiterate. I\u2019m not saying that to be mean. I say that in compassion. They cannot read. The idea they\u2019re going to go on the Internet and work through a 16-page document to put in their data and sign up does not reflect an understanding of who is having the hardest time in our economy.\n\nAnd he concludes, \u201cInstead of saying, listen, you\u2019ve got to log-on, you just make it an opt-out. Everybody\u2019s in, unless you say you don\u2019t want to be.\u201d But \u201cin\u201d to what? Not the ACA, which he would repeal. He went on in the next breath to refer to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d coverage he had mentioned earlier as his alternative.\n\nCassidy\u2019s Obamacare Attack\n\nFinally, we note that the Democratic ad swipes video of Cassidy from one of his own ads.\n\nCassidy, who is a gastroenterologist and associate professor of medicine at Louisiana State University, appears in his ad kitted out with white coat and stethoscope. His ad is a standard GOP attack on the Affordable Care Act, expressing opinions and generalities and not much in the way of facts that can be verified or disputed.\n\nHe says he voted against the ACA in 2010 because, having read the bill, \u201cit was clear there would be canceled plans, expensive premiums, no guarantee that you could keep your doctor.\u201d He fails to mention that all those things were true before the ACA was passed.\n\nAnd he calls for replacing the ACA \u201cwith a plan that gives the power to you, not the politicians and bureaucrats,\u201d without getting into the fact that \u2014 as he noted in his remarks to the oil and gas group \u2014 his own plan \u201cwouldn\u2019t have all these benefits that we have to pay so much for\u201d under the ACA.\n\nDemocrats can ill afford to lose Landrieu\u2019s seat as they struggle to retain control of the Senate. Cassidy currently holds a slight lead over Landrieu in the polls, according to averages compiled by Real Clear Politics and the Huffington Post Pollster site. And the 538 Blog\u2019s Nate Silver lists Cassidy\u2019s odds of winning in November at 55 percent.\n\nBut being behind in the polls is no excuse for making false claims about an opponent\u2019s record. That\u2019s what voters should really find insulting.\n\n\u2014 Brooks Jackson, with Carolyn Fante\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a52\"", "article_summary": "But there\u2019s simply no support for the ad\u2019s claim that \u201cCassidycare would have created government-run health care in our state, with government bureaucrats making medical decisions.\u201d There\u2019s simply nothing like that in the bill.\nThat\u2019s pure invention; Cassidy\u2019s bill did nothing of the sort.\nAnd it didn\u2019t include any new regulations on doctors, hospitals or patients, contrary to the ad\u2019s claim that it amounted to \u201cgovernment-run health care.\u201d The ACA, of course, isn\u2019t \u201cgovernment-run health care\u201d either, despite the many times Republicans have tried to brand it as such.\nCassidy, when rival Republicans brought up the \u201cCassidycare\u201d allegation, issued a strong rebuttal:Cassidy: The program I proposed is similar to other Republican programs.\nDoes that make Cassidy\u2019s bill \u201cMcCain-care lite.\u201d Of course not."}
