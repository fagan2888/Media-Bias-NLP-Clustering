According to a new report, leaders of the ISIS terror attacks in Paris last month engaged in recruitment for their cause at a Hungarian refugee camp. From the Daily Mail:

A suspected ringleader of the deadly Paris attacks travelled to Hungary where he ‘recruited a team’ from unregistered migrants passing through the country, government officials say.



Salah Abdeslam, who remains on the run from European authorities, is believed to have visited Budapest’s Keleti station, then left the country with the team he pulled together.



The development comes as evidence grows that ISIS jihadis are passing through Greece and the Balkans hidden among refugees fleeing the Syrian conflict.

Fox News also reported on this development earlier today.

The Obama administration has made it clear they have no plans to reconsider policies allowing 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States over the next two years, despite FBI and Homeland Security officials saying the vetting process is incomplete. ISIS has publicly declared they will use the refugee crisis to smuggle fighters into western nations to carry out attacks.
