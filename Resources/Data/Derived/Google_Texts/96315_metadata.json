Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley has been a key supporter of the measure. \u201cThis is a bi-partisan plan, it\u2019s a New Hampshire plan \u2013 it\u2019s not Obamacare. It involves 48,000 of our friends and neighbors, many of whom do not qualify for the benefits of the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s helped make a more productive work force.\u201d\n\nRelated: HB1696 is broken down in our recent primer on Medicaid expansion.\n\nUntil the end of this year, the federal government has fully covered the costs of expansion. Under this proposal, state hospitals and insurance companies have agreed to make up for the eventual shrinking of federal funds. Medicaid expansion has the full support of Democrats, including Governor Hassan, but has divided Republicans who believe insurance premiums will rise.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "After clearing a key Senate committee Monday, sponsors of the bill to reauthorize Medicaid expansion are making sure they have the votes needed to pass the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://nhpr.org/post/backers-medicaid-expansion-nh-make-final-pitch-state-senate-vote", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/nhpr/files/styles/medium/public/201603/medicaid_presser.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After clearing a key Senate committee Monday, sponsors of the bill to reauthorize Medicaid expansion are making sure they have the votes needed to pass the", "title": "Backers of Medicaid Expansion in N.H.
