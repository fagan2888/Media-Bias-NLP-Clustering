Wallace says the wind can reconstitute ash clouds so large they're detected by satellite.\n\nThe observatory will install particulate measuring instruments at two locations to collect ash samples and assess how much is blown around.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Alaska Volcano Observatory is sending scientists to Kodiak Island to set up equipment that can monitor a century-old hazard: volcanic ash from the Novarupta-Katmai (noh-vah-RUP'-tah KAT'-meye) eruption in 1912.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/news/scitech/headlines/Scientists-to-measure-ash-stirred-from-1912-Alaska-eruption-324666911.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/489*315/alaska+volcano2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Alaska Volcano Observatory is sending scientists to Kodiak Island to set up equipment that can monitor a century-old hazard: volcanic ash from the Novarupta-Katmai (noh-vah-RUP'-tah KAT'-meye) eruption in 1912.", "title": "Scientists to measure ash stirred from 1912 Alaska eruption"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The Alaska Volcano Observatory is sending scientists to Kodiak Island to set up equipment that can monitor a century-old hazard: volcanic ash from the Novarupta-Katmai (noh-vah-RUP'-tah KAT'-meye) eruption in 1912.", "title": "Scientists to measure ash stirred from 1912 Alaska eruption", "url": "http://www.kake.com/news/scitech/headlines/Scientists-to-measure-ash-stirred-from-1912-Alaska-eruption-324666911.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/alaska+volcano2.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Scientists to measure ash stirred from 1912 Alaska eruption", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Scientists to measure ash stirred"}, "article_summary": "The Alaska Volcano Observatory is sending scientists to Kodiak Island to set up equipment that can monitor a century-old hazard: volcanic ash from the Novarupta-Katmai (noh-vah-RUP'-tah KAT'-meye) eruption in 1912.\nThe observatory will install particulate measuring instruments at two locations to collect ash samples and assess how much is blown around.\nThe eruption was the largest in the 20th Century and created the Valley of 10,000 Smokes in what is now Katmai National Park on the Alaska Peninsula.\nEach spring and fall, strong northwesterly winds blow ash around.\nWallace says the wind can reconstitute ash clouds so large they're detected by satellite."}
