The East African region has a combined population of 150 million\u2014and it\u2019s growing. When we pool our population we create a bigger market, which helps us sell our products but it also helps us negotiate with other markets, such as the European Union and the United States.\u201d\n\nAfrican nations\u2019 increased negotiating power was on display at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit hosted by President Barack Obama in Washington in August. During that event, a parade of American companies announced new or increased commitments to investing in Africa, while political leaders such as Secretary of State John Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden attempted to highlight the opportunities that U.S. businesses could seize as they helped African nations develop their economies.\n\nMr. Museveni, though, believes the most significant outcome of the summit was not the potential American investment in Africa. \u201cThe most important contribution to our development was President Obama\u2019s recommitting himself to AGOA [the African Growth and Opportunity Act],\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAfrica will be developed by us, not by anybody else. All we need is market access. That\u2019s what I said to President Obama. Opening your market to our products, that\u2019s the biggest service you could offer to Africa.\u201d\n\nEast Africa\u2019s economic development prospects have been boosted considerably recently by discoveries of substantial hydrocarbon resources. Giant gas fields have been found off the coasts of Mozambique and Tanzania and considerable quantities of oil have been found in countries including Uganda and Kenya.\n\nWhile the potential revenues from some of the new discoveries will swell the region\u2019s coffers, Mr. Museveni played down the significance of future oil revenues for Uganda. \u201cWe are going to develop Uganda without oil, but now that we have got oil, it is a good godsend that will quicken the process of development and transformation,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut it is nothing more than a tool.\u201d\n\nVideo: President Museveni discusses the importance of renewable resources.\n\nThe Ugandan president is focused more on renewable resources, including agriculture, and is actively working to encourage investment in agro-processing. Part of that effort includes revamping the country\u2019s program for assisting foreign investors.\n\nMr. Museveni admitted that the initial attempt to provide investors with a single point of contact to handle permits, tax issues and other key processes had been unsuccessful. \u201cWe created a one-stop center in the Ugandan investment authority. It was not well implemented [but] we are now going to make it mandatory that it will be respected,\u201d he promised.\n\nVideo: President Museveni explains the new one-stop-shop for investors.\n\nSome potential investors to East Africa have been deterred more by the regional security situation than the investment environment, though. Mr. Museveni acknowledged that unrest in the region, including in South Sudan, was causing economic damage. \u201cThere are definitely lost opportunities,\u201d he admitted. However, he said that he and his counterparts in neighboring countries had been discussing the civil war in South Sudan, while they were in New York for the UN meetings.\n\n\u201cI think we shall find a solution,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Dan Keeler at dan.keeler@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Africa's development will be led by Africans, says Uganda\u2019s President Museveni.", "title": "Ugandan President Museveni Sees Deeper Integration in East Africa", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/09/26/ugandan-president-museveni-sees-deeper-integration-in-east-africa/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ES966_museve_P_20140926162203.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Ugandan President Museveni Sees Deeper Integration in East Africa", "description": "Africa's development will be led by Africans, says Uganda\u2019s President Museveni.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Dan Keeler", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "Africa's development will be led by Africans, says Uganda\u2019s President Museveni.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-09-26T21:04:15-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/09/26/ugandan-president-museveni-sees-deeper-integration-in-east-africa/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-1205", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Africa's development will be led by Africans, says Uganda\u2019s President Museveni.", "title": "Ugandan President Museveni Sees Deeper Integration in East Africa", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/09/26/ugandan-president-museveni-sees-deeper-integration-in-east-africa/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ES966_museve_P_20140926162203.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-1205", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-01T12:57:01-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09f7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut it is nothing more than a tool.\u201dVideo: President Museveni discusses the importance of renewable resources.\nMr. Museveni, though, believes the most significant outcome of the summit was not the potential American investment in Africa.\nVideo: President Museveni explains the new one-stop-shop for investors.\nMr. Museveni admitted that the initial attempt to provide investors with a single point of contact to handle permits, tax issues and other key processes had been unsuccessful.\nMr. Museveni acknowledged that unrest in the region, including in South Sudan, was causing economic damage."}
