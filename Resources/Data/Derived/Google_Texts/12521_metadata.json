When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free.\u201d\n\nIn a statement,the National Jewish Democratic Council said that they \u201crejoice in this historic day, and reflect on the significant place human rights has in our Jewish values.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a vital, active imperative for the Jewish people to be on the front lines of issues protecting and promoting the rights of any group being treated unfairly. The fight for marriage equality is a symbolic manifestation of the Jewish value of seeking justice for the vulnerable,\u201d the NJDC said.\n\nThey also pointed to last year\u2019s poll by the Public Religion Research Institute, which found that 83% of American Jews \u2013 by far the highest of any religious group \u2013 supported marriage equality.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) called the historic ruling \u201cone of the most significant civil rights decisions in recent memory.\u201d\n\nThe Orthodox Union, on the other hand, criticized the decision, which may force religious institutions to lose their tax exemptions, stating the historical position of the Jewish faith, enunciated in the Bible, which condemns the institutionalization of such relationships as marriages. \u201cWe are grateful that we live in a democratic society, in which all religions are free to express their opinions about social issues and to advocate vigorously for those opinions. The reason we opt to express our viewpoint in a public forum is because we believe that our Divine system of law not only dictates our beliefs and behaviors, but also represents a system of universal morality, and therefore can stake a claim in the national discourse,\u201d the OU said in a lengthy statement. \u201cWe also recognize that no religion has the right to dictate its beliefs to the entire body politic and we do not expect that secular law will always align with our viewpoint. Ultimately, decisions on social policy remain with the democratic process, and today the process has spoken and we accord the process and its result the utmost respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill the laws implementing today\u2019s ruling and other expansions of civil rights for LGBT Americans contain appropriate accommodations and exemptions for institutions and individuals who abide by religious teachings that limit their ability to support same-[gender] relationships?\u201d the the leadership of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America said.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "American-Jewish groups were split in their reaction to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on marriage equality, now becoming law of the land.\nThe fight for marriage equality is a symbolic manifestation of the Jewish value of seeking justice for the vulnerable,\u201d the NJDC said.\nThey also pointed to last year\u2019s poll by the Public Religion Research Institute, which found that 83% of American Jews \u2013 by far the highest of any religious group \u2013 supported marriage equality.\nThe Supreme court ruled on Friday by a 5-4 majority that the Constitution\u2019s guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law mean that states cannot ban same-gender marriages.\n\u201cWe also recognize that no religion has the right to dictate its beliefs to the entire body politic and we do not expect that secular law will always align with our viewpoint."}
