Andrew Cuomo\u2019s administration edited and delayed a fracking study commissioned by the state, according to a review by Capital New York.\n\nThe New York news outlet reported Monday that the Cuomo administration had altered a report on the natural gas extraction technique commonly referred to as fracking. The report was commissioned in 2011 and was \u201cgoing to result in a number of politically inconvenient conclusions\u201d for the governor. A comparison of the original draft of the report, which was put together by the U.S. Geological Survey, and the final version, showed that some of the original descriptions and mentions of fracking-related health and environmental risks were \u201cplayed down or removed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe final version of the report also excised a reference to risks associated with gas pipelines and underground storage \u2014 a reference which could have complicated the Cuomo administration\u2019s potential support for a number of other controversial energy projects, including a proposed gas storage facility in the Finger Lakes region that local wine makers say could destroy their burgeoning industry,\u201d Capital New York reported.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t appear that any numerical findings of the report were altered between the first and final versions. The news outlet acquired redacted emails between members of the Cuomo administration and the federal researchers who were compiled the report through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\n\u201cIn the unredacted part of the emails, a D.E.C. official refers to \u2018alternate text\u2019 that he sent,\u201d Capital New York reported. \u201cAt various points, a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) spokeswoman thanks a state official for her edits, and reminds the study\u2019s author that they are employed by a \u2018science organization\u2019 which is not in the business of advocating particular positions. A later communication suggests delays from the administration side, when the USGS spokeswoman refers to a need to publish the report \u2018in a timely fashion.'\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Cuomo administration told Capital New York in a statement that the edits and correspondence related to the study were routine.\n\n\u201cWhile the report was drafted by USGS, it simply underwent a technical review by [New York State Energy Resource and Development Authority] staff and other experts, including experts from other state agencies like the Department of Environmental Conservation,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cEdits suggested through NYSERDA\u2019s technical review process were discussed with USGS, which is common and standard practice between parties with any scientific study. This study clearly underscores the State\u2019s resolve and commitment to having the most current and reliable scientific data to draw upon before decisions are made that may affect New Yorkers.\u201d\n\nChris Amato, staff attorney for Earthjustice, told the Village Voice that he\u2019s not surprised to hear the reports that Cuomo\u2019s administration may have had a say in the final report.\n\n\u201cThe Cuomo Administration has politicized the Department of Environmental Conservation and that\u2019s evident a number of pending issues that are before the department,\u201d Amato said. \u201cThe Cuomo Administration is deeply involved in the department\u2019s deliberations on these issues and is definitely controlling the game.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first instance of Cuomo administration officials communicating with the people in charge of conducting studies on fracking. In May, the Poughkeepsie Journal reported that two of Cuomo\u2019s advisers met in 2013 with New York Environmental Conservation Commissioner Joe Martens and then-Health Commissioner Nirav Shah, who were in charge of a fracking review. However, a Cuomo spokesperson told the news outlet that fracking wasn\u2019t the focus of either meeting.\n\nNew York state currently doesn\u2019t allow fracking, under a moratorium that\u2019s been in effect since 2008. New York cities and towns won a victory in June when the state\u2019s highest court ruled that they had the power to ban fracking, but a statewide decision on the practice has yet to be reached. Cuomo has said he won\u2019t consider lifting the ban until the state\u2019s review on the possible health impacts is completed \u2014 a study that Capital New York notes has an \u201cunspecified\u201d timeline for completion, and which Cuomo said in September would be ready \u201cwhen it\u2019s ready.\u201d The governor has faced criticism from both fracking proponents and critics for delaying his decision.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Capital New York acquired redacted emails between members of the Cuomo administration and the federal researchers who were compiling the report through a Freedom of Information Act request.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Capital New York acquired redacted emails between members of the Cuomo administration and the federal researchers who were compiling the report through a Freedom of Information Act request.", "title": "Report: New York Governor\u2019s Office Altered And Delayed Fracking Study", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/10/06/3576356/cuomo-fracking-report/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cuomo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Capital New York acquired redacted emails between members of the Cuomo administration and the federal researchers who were compiling the report through a Freedom of Information Act request.", "title": "Report: New York Governor\u2019s Office Altered And Delayed Fracking Study", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cuomo-320x213.jpg", "creator": "@KatieRValentine", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-climate", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cuomo.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cuomo.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-06T14:34:50+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/katiervalentine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddaa0\"", "article_summary": "Climate Report: New York Governor\u2019s Office Altered And Delayed Fracking Study CREDIT: AP Photo/John MinchilloNew York Gov.\nAndrew Cuomo\u2019s administration edited and delayed a fracking study commissioned by the state, according to a review by Capital New York.\nThe New York news outlet reported Monday that the Cuomo administration had altered a report on the natural gas extraction technique commonly referred to as fracking.\nNew York state currently doesn\u2019t allow fracking, under a moratorium that\u2019s been in effect since 2008.\n'\u201dA spokesperson for the Cuomo administration told Capital New York in a statement that the edits and correspondence related to the study were routine."}
