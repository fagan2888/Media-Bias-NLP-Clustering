The 6,615 number includes small businesses and individuals. Most of those applicants have still not completed the paperwork to buy insurance. The applicants represent less than 1 percent of Hawaii\u2019s 1.4 million residents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good outlook for us,\u201d said Sanjeev Bhagowalia, the state\u2019s IT director. \u201cThe business model will not survive.\u201d\n\nPat McManahan, the state\u2019s human services director, encouraged lawmakers to act quickly because federal money will run out by 2015.\n\n\u201cThe time is now to make the decision,\u201d said McManahan. \u201cThe longer it is postponed, the less opportunity.\u201d\n\nAn estimated $53 million was spent on HawaiiHealthConnector.com, which, Bhagowalia said, still has a number of glitches. Bhagowalia also worried the website is not secure enough to keep \u201cvery sophisticated foes\u201d from obtaining confidential information from the site.\n\n\u201cThis is a very serious area and we are not prepared,\u201d Bhagowalia said.\n\nRep. Bert Kobayashi said he was stunned to learn the connector has spent more than $10,000 per person registered on the site.\n\n\u201cThat does not sound like it is even possible,\u201d said Kobayashi, a Democrat who represents Kalaha and Kaimuki on Oahu.\n\nA Watchdog.org analysis shows the exchange has actually spent $292,825 on each person who successfully signed up for insurance.\n\nOther legislators were disappointed to hear state Insurance Commissioner Gordon Ito admit the exchange would not lower health-insurance rates in Hawaii. Rep. Justin Woodson, a Democrat from Maui, pressed Ito on the issue.\n\nIto said insurance plans obtained through the exchange would probably increase 8 percent to 10 percent per year, in part because of the fees assessed on insurance companies to fund the exchange.\n\nThe intent of Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act is to get uninsured people into the marketplace and to spread cost and risk, Ito said, noting Congress failed to address cost drivers with Obamacare.\n\nThe exchange is flooding the airwaves with ads on TV and radio encouraging people to sign up. So far, $1.2 million has been allocated for a public relations, media and public outreach contract.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The Hawaii health-insurance exchange created in response to Obamacare has spent $100 million it received from Washington to fund 6,615 applicants \u2013 some of whom are still not even insured yet.
