The surface of events is never what it appears, but instead hides deep, dark and destructive forces.\n\nWhat Hofstadter called \u201cmovements of suspicious discontent\u201d have targeted imaginary threats ranging from the Illuminati, Freemasons and Jesuits of long ago all the way to the Communist infiltration alleged by Joseph McCarthy and the John Birch Society in the mid-20th century. And since Hofstadter\u2019s seminal essay, the list of alleged evildoers has kept on growing, especially on the far right, where global elites are today seen as secretly laboring to build a totalitarian \u201cNew World Order.\u201d\n\nAlthough it is difficult to make valid historical comparisons, it is hard to avoid feeling that our country is drowning in an even larger ocean of conspiracy theories now than in decades or centuries past: President Obama is a Kenyan and a Marxist bent on seizing the weapons of all Americans; Common Core educational standards are part of a plot to impose communism on the U.S.; military exercises in Texas this summer are actually a first step toward martial law; and on and on and on.\n\nOne factor fertilizing such beliefs is the proliferation of alternative forms of media, from cable television and talk radio to social media and a seemingly endless number of websites. Almost any belief that a person has, no matter how far out or disconnected from the facts, has some kind of \u201cnews\u201d source to back it up.\n\nBut what may be even more important in the highly polarized political environment of the United States in recent years has been the willingness of large numbers of politicians \u2014 either because they really believe or because they are willing to pander shamelessly to the extremists in their bases \u2014 to legitimize the fairy tales. Whether or not Texas Gov. Greg Abbott truly believes that a military exercise this summer was a prelude to martial law, he acted as if he might.\n\nThese kinds of words have consequences. When Sarah Palin accused the president of organizing \u201cdeath panels\u201d as part of his health care plan, the debate veered from the serious to the ridiculous. When hundreds of thousands of Americans swallowed the claim that Mexican, U.S. and Canadian elites were secretly planning to merge the three countries, it helped to derail any hope for enacting comprehensive immigration reform. When politicians allege a global conspiracy behind a United Nations sustainability plan, preserving the planet becomes even harder.\n\nConspiracy theories, in other words, are destructive to democracy; they substitute ignorance and suspicion for knowledge and reason, and make it that much harder to deal with the many problems before us. As Francis Bacon suggested almost four centuries ago, conspiracy theories are a way for weak minds to deal with a complex world \u2014 and to wreck any chance for finding real solutions.\n\nWhat follows are 10 key conspiracy theories that have made their way from the margins of our society to often shocking levels of acceptance in the political mainstream. In addition to describing the theories, their origins and the reality of the situation, we take on some of the chief enablers of these destructive tall tales.\n\n1. Common Core \u2013 The Plot Against Our Children\n\nEver since the Supreme Court ruled in 1948 that outside groups like churches couldn\u2019t provide religious instruction in public schools \u2014 the first of a series of court decisions meant to ensure such schools would be genuinely secular \u2014 far-right forces in America have increasingly rejected the very notion of public education, attacking it as part of an anti-God, socialistic plot to poison our children\u2019s minds.\n\nThe latest and most virulent example of that is the rapidly spreading idea that the Common Core State Standards, an ambitious effort to lift student achievement across the country, is actually a dangerous conspiracy to indoctrinate young people into \u201cthe homosexual lifestyle,\u201d communism and globalist ideology, all the while collecting detailed and highly personal information about millions of citizens.\n\nIn actuality, the Common Core is a set of standards for math and language arts/literacy developed by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers and released in 2010. It does not mandate any particular curriculum or readings, although it does offer \u201cexemplar\u201d texts as examples of the books students should be able to understand at various grade levels. Although tests are not mandated by the Common Core, two federally funded consortia have been developing examinations that could ensure the standards have been met.\n\nAt their most benign, attacks on the Common Core have portrayed the standards as either a key step in a federal takeover of public education or yet another reform attempt that overemphasizes testing and standardization. But in the hands of radical groups like the John Birch Society and a whole array of far-right groups and politicians, the proposed program has morphed into what former Fox News host Glenn Beck characterized as \u201cCommunism. We are dealing with evil.\u201d\n\nForty-five states adopted the initially uncontroversial standards in a bid to improve the competitiveness of the American work force. But the brouhaha has had consequences: Indiana, Oklahoma and South Carolina have withdrawn from the standards, and at least a dozen other states have seen similar legislation introduced.\n\nVirtually all the radical claims about the standards are false. They do not mandate any particular texts \u2014 other than the Declaration of Independence, the Preamble to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and Lincoln\u2019s Second Inaugural Address. They do not promote homosexuality. They are not critical of Christianity, nor do they promote Islam. They do not require the collection of individual data that will then be sold to private interests. They don\u2019t push the idea of global warming or hector students about \u201csocial justice\u201d or being good \u201cglobal citizens.\u201d They are not part of a plot to impose a global government known as the \u201cNew World Order.\u201d\n\nAlthough more and more outlandish conspiracy theories are part of mainstream American political culture, wildly untrue claims about the Common Core have far more \u201cmainstream\u201d proponents than most. Politicians from around the country and all levels of government, pundits, a large number of Christian Right and anti-LGBT groups, and many others are part of the paranoid chorus.\n\nDavid Barton, a discredited Christian \u201chistorian,\u201d claimed the Common Core \u201cis not education, it\u2019s political indoctrination.\u201d Troy Towns, the minority outreach director for the Alabama Republican Party, said, \u201cWhen I heard the word \u2018common,\u2019 the first thing I thought of was communism.\u201d He described the standards as helping the government \u201ctak[e] over everything, contro[l] the way you think, what you do, education, health care.\u201d Phyllis Schlafly, founder of the right-wing Eagle Forum, decried the Common Core\u2019s \u201cactive promotion of gay marriage.\u201d Another Eagle Forum leader, Christina Michas of Palm Springs, Fla., linked it to Nazism and the \u201cultimate goal\u201d of setting up \u201cinternment or reeducation camps.\u201d\n\nA senior fellow at the American Principles Project, founded by Christian Right thinker and law professor Robert George, said that the standards are part of \u201cutopian, grandiose planning for a managed global economy\u201d sought by \u201csocialists.\u201d Jane Robbins added that they \u201cadvance the model of a command economy.\u201d\n\nRight-wing commentator Michelle Malkin denounced \u201ccollectivist agitators\u201d who have \u201cchipped away at academic excellence in the name of fairness, diversity and social justice\u201d and claimed that through Common Core, \u201cWashington meddlers\u201d are gathering data on children that the government will sell to \u201cthe highest bidders.\u201d Never one to mince words, Glenn Beck headlined one recent piece \u201cCommon Core: A Lesson Plan for Raising Up Compliant, Non-Thinking Citizens.\u201d\n\nAnd the politicians have chimed in, too. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) called the standards a \u201cdangerous new curriculum\u201d and joined with seven others to sponsor legislation banning any federal funding for them. U.S. Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.) said they are \u201cmuch like socialism.\u201d Wrapping it all up, Tea Party activist Terry Bratton last year told an Alabama Senate committee that the Common Core standards are simply \u201canti-Christian, anti-Catholic and anti-American.\u201d\n\n2. Military Exercises \u2013 Prelude To Martial Law\n\nWhen Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this summer ordered the Texas State Guard to \u201ccontinuously monitor\u201d the Jade Helm 15 U.S. military training exercise for possible violations of civil liberties or other rights, he was roundly criticized for legitimizing baseless fears that the exercise was really a first step in imposing martial law.\n\nAnd rightly so. As one Republican veteran of the Texas Legislature said, Abbott either \u201cactually believes this stuff\u201d or was willing to \u201cpander to idiots\u201d as a matter of political opportunism. \u201cIs there anybody who is going to stand up to this radical nonsense that is a cancer on our state and our party?\u201d Todd Smith asked.\n\nBut there is a real seed from which martial law conspiracy theories, common to both some segments of the far left and especially to the radical right, have grown. Martial law has been declared in the United States about a dozen times, the most recent after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. More to the point, frightening contingency plans for imposing martial law really have been drawn up.\n\nThe first public notice of these plans appeared in 1984 in, of all places, The Spotlight, a now defunct anti-Semitic tabloid, under the headline \u201cReagan Orders Concentration Camps.\u201d The story, which turned out to be substantially accurate, focused on another military drill, Readiness Exercise 1984, \u201cwhich postulated a scenario of massive civil unrest and the need to round up and detain large numbers of demonstrators and dissidents,\u201d according to Political Research Associates.\n\nIn 1987, a far more complete account of plans drawn up under the Reagan Administration appeared in The Miami Herald. The story reported that Lt. Col. Oliver North, then embroiled in the Iran-Contra scandal, had prepared a plan to suspend the Constitution in the event of crises including \u201cwidespread internal dissent or national opposition to a U.S. military invasion abroad.\u201d A collaborator, then-Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Louis Guiffrida, had years earlier discussed in a paper how, in the event of an uprising by black militants, martial law might be declared and some 21 million \u201cAmerican Negroes\u201d interned.\n\nSince then, fears of martial law have metastasized on the far right. In 1996, for example, Soldier of Fortune magazine ran a breathless story about the Army\u2019s Delta Force carrying out a nighttime exercise in Houston. By that time, the idea that the government intended to impose martial law at any moment had become a core theory of the antigovernment \u201cPatriot\u201d movement. And it still is today.\n\nBut the claims about Jade Helm are absurd.\n\nThe exercise was not part of a plot by the White House and the Pentagon to impose martial law. Closed Walmarts in the seven Southwestern states where it is occurred are not connected by secret tunnels and won\u2019t be used to intern dissidents. New dome-shaped facilities built by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as storm shelters are not \u201cDeath Domes\u201d where insurrectionists will be housed. Blue Bell Ice Cream trucks are not being converted to portable mortuaries.\n\nAlthough some criticism of the military and the militarization of police in the United States may well be legitimate, Jade Helm 15 is just what officials say it is: An exercise by about 1,200 Special Operations troops that ran between July 15 and Sept. 15, mostly on private land, to prepare for fighting overseas.\n\nThe idea that Jade Helm 15 is really a nefarious government plot apparently originated with Alex Jones, the hyperventilating conspiracy theorist who broadcasts from Austin, Texas, six days a week. In March, according to The Boston Globe, Jones told some 1 million listeners he had \u201chuge breaking news.\u201d He had obtained a map showing where the operation would take place \u2014 and showing that Texas and Utah were designated \u201chostile\u201d territories on that map. \u201cThis is going to be hellish,\u201d he said. \u201c[T]his is just a cover for deploying the military on the streets.\u201d\n\nFrom there, it raced across the radical right at something close to the speed of light. Militia members, other \u201cPatriots,\u201d and thousands of posts and comments on websites and forums echoed Jones\u2019 alarm, all the time adding new details.\n\nBut the surprise wasn\u2019t that so many Internet sleuths had conspiratorial ideas; it was that those ideas were more or less endorsed by many politicians. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, naturally, was the most notorious. But U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) chimed in, saying some were \u201cconcerned that the U.S. Army is preparing for modern-day martial law\u201d and adding that \u201cpatriotic Americans have reason to be concerned.\u201d U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said he would be asking tough questions of the military. And Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he would look into the matter.\n\n3. Agenda 21 \u2013 Conspiracy Of The Greens\n\nAgenda 21 is a nonbinding, essentially toothless United Nations natural resources sustainability plan for our increasingly crowded planet. It\u2019s a wish list, not a must-do-or-else list. The plan was signed in 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit by the leaders of 178 countries, including President George H.W. Bush, who is no sane person\u2019s idea of a wild-eyed, tree-hugging, anti-development environmentalist more concerned with woodpeckers than people.\n\nBut when it comes to Agenda 21, there are not enough tinfoil party hats to go around. Ever since the plan was announced 23 years ago, groups like the John Birch Society (JBS) have been doing their best to transform Agenda 21 in the American public mind into a secret plot to impose a totalitarian world government, a nefarious effort to crush freedom and American sovereignty in the name of environmentalism.\n\nIt\u2019s not just extremists singing this looney tune. In January 2012, the Republican National Committee bought into the propaganda, denouncing Agenda 21 in a resolution as a \u201cdestructive and insidious scheme\u201d that is meant to impose a \u201csocialist/communist redistribution of wealth.\u201d\n\nTo listen \u2014 if you can stand it \u2014 to the rants of the Birch Society and its many allies on the radical right, Agenda 21 will lead to a \u201cnew Dark Ages of pain and misery yet unknown to mankind.\u201d It is \u201ca comprehensive plan of utopian environmentalism, social engineering, and global political control,\u201d the \u201cmost dangerous threat to American sovereignty\u201d yet.\n\nAgenda 21, they say, will \u201cmake our nation a vassal\u201d of the UN, result in the \u201cdestruction of our lives,\u201d force rural areas\u2019 population to be \u201cdecimated,\u201d and lead to having \u201c90% of the population murdered.\u201d\n\nThe truth is Agenda 21 is not a treaty. It has no force of law, no enforcement mechanisms, no penalties, and no significant funding. Yet fear, lies and talk of flocks of black helicopters blocking out the sun and smashing freedom when they land are winning in too many places. Alabama, for instance, has passed a law meant to outlaw any effect of the plan. Earlier, in that state\u2019s Baldwin County, all nine members of the Planning and Zoning Commission quit in disgust after the County Commission killed their local development plan \u201con a pretext so devoid of relevance and merit as, in our opinion, to elicit only ridicule,\u201d they wrote in their resignation letter.\n\nAfter the County Commission acted, the audience cheered and sang \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d\n\nName a right-wing conspiracy theory of the last 60 years and chances are the John Birch Society was sitting near the front of the bandwagon.\n\nThe assault on Agenda 21 is no different. Although the Birch Society has been gunning for the UN since the early 1960s, it did not fully commit to the anti-Agenda 21 crusade until 2011, when it began devoting resources and foot soldiers to it. \u201cWe\u2019re in a fight to save our country,\u201d the group\u2019s CEO, Arthur R. Thompson, said of that battle in 2013. \u201cWe\u2019re in a fight to save the people who are unwilling to bend their knee to a totalitarian state.\u201d\n\nBefore JBS joined the fray, Tom DeWeese, founder of the American Policy Center, which focuses on \u201cenvironmental policy and its effect on private property,\u201d had been waging an almost one-man anti-Agenda 21 campaign. \u201cIt sounds so friendly. So meaningful. So urgent,\u201d DeWeese wrote in 2009. \u201cBut the devastation to our liberty and way of life is the same as if Lenin ordered it.\u201d\n\nDeWeese was soon joined by a number of far-right groups, including the Constitution Party, which was founded in 1992 and says its goal \u201cis to restore American jurisprudence to its Biblical foundations and to limit the federal government to its Constitutional boundaries.\u201d The party\u2019s Florida chairman, Bernie De Castro, put it like this: \u201cAgenda 21 is the most dangerous threat to America\u2019s sovereignty that is coming at us like a whirlwind and yet so few Americans are aware of this diabolical threat to them and their families.\u201d\n\nIn an alarming 2012 fundraising letter, three-time presidential candidate and former U.S. Foreign Service officer Alan Keyes, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of President Ronald Reagan, said: \u201cEnemies who hate America, despise liberty, and want the United States transformed \u2026 into \u2026 a global, socialist state \u2026 are relentlessly advancing a seditious new plan \u2014 Agenda 21 \u2014 to make our nation a vassal of the United Nations.\u201d\n\nProminent politicians like former House SpeakerNewt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and Sen.Ted Cruz (R-Texas) have also contributed to this agenda of fear and silliness as they denounce the plan that Cruz has claimed would \u201cabolish\u201d golf courses and paved roads.\n\n4. North American Union \u2013 U.S Sovereignty On The Bank\n\nOn March 23, 2005 \u2014 a date which will live in infamy, if you listen to the conspiracy conjurers of the American right \u2014 President George W. Bush, his Mexican counterpart, Vicente Fox, and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin met in Waco, Texas, and signed the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP).\n\nTo most observers, SPP was a benign, slow-moving attempt to coordinate technical trade and security policies among the three countries. But to right-wing conspiracy theorists, the agreement was the beginning of the end of American sovereignty, the first official steps down a dark road jammed with brown-skinned people and leading to the so-called North American Union, or NAU.\n\nThere is, of course, no such union or plan to merge the three nations into a borderless mass that uses a single currency, the \u201cAmero.\u201d American sovereignty is safe. Yet, that hasn\u2019t stopped the NAU bogeyman from becoming the dominant conspiracy theory animating the anti-immigration movement for the last 10 years. (A related theory, which emerged from the American Border Patrol hate group, says that Mexico has a secret \u201cPlan de Aztlan\u201d to reconquer the American Southwest.)\n\nIn 2007, The Boston Globe described the NAU as perhaps \u201cthe quintessential conspiracy theory for our time,\u201d one that \u201celegantly weaves old fears and new realities into one coherent and all-encompassing\u201d kooky package.\n\nIn a nutshell \u2014 emphasis on nut \u2014 the theorists say the NAU is a plot by elitists in the government and on college campuses that will result in Mexico sending millions more of its citizens to the United States, \u201cusing bilingualism to subvert America,\u201d as Daneen G. Peterson puts it. Peterson researches the perils of the \u201cOne World Order\u201d and runs stopthenorthamericanunion.com, a website devoted to unmasking the \u201cglobalists\u201d behind the NAU.\n\nOn her site, Peterson calls Bush, Fox and Martin \u201cThe Treasonous Triumvirate\u201d for signing SPP and clearing the way for the NAU with their \u201cmultiple acts of treason\u201d and \u201cdeceptive double-speak.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, Peterson claims, there is \u201ca government cabal bent on destroying our sovereignty,\u201d while the Mexican \u201cinvasion of America\u201d continues with \u201cHispanics who balkanize our cities and towns and arrogantly corrupt our unifying national language.\u201d\n\nThe seditious cabal is said to also include the Council on Foreign Relations and the alleged Dr. Frankenstein of the NAU, the late American University professor Robert Pastor.\n\nIn other words, as Peterson says on her website, \u201cTreason Abounds.\u201d\n\nLest you think the NAU conspiracy theory is only being pushed by one unwound webmistress, think again. The John Birch Society \u2014 whose founder once called President Dwight D. Eisenhower a communist agent \u2014 has been pushing NAU fears for years. And it also has made its way into the mainstream.\n\nIn 2006, four congressmen \u2014 U.S. Reps. Virgil Goode (R-Va.), Ron Paul (R-Texas), Walter Jones (R-N.C.) and Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) \u2014 sponsored a resolution opposing a \u201cNAFTA superhighway\u201d that conspiracy theorists believe is connected to the NAU. In 2007, Tancredo demanded an end to the SPP and insisted that belief in the NAU theory was not limited to \u201cright-wing kooks.\u201d\n\nA somewhat less mainstream group, the Coalition to Block the North American Union, was formed in 2006 by the late Howard Phillips, three-time presidential candidate for the theocratic Constitution Party and founder of The Conservative Caucus. Phillips\u2019 co-founders in the coalition were the Eagle Forum\u2019s Phyllis Schlafly and Jerome Corsi, author of the notorious \u201cSwift Boat\u201d book attacking and distorting 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry\u2019s Vietnam service. Corsi accused President Bush of having a \u201csecret agenda\u201d and warned that \u201can executive branch coup d\u2019etat may be under way.\u201d\n\nThe coalition had almost 70 members, many of them members of the Constitution Party. Others included Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center; Bay Buchanan of Team America; Tom DeWeese of the American Policy Center; Joan Hueter of the American Council for Immigration Reform; the Rev. William Owens of the Coalition of African American Pastors; Ronald D. Ray of the Coalition of American Veterans; Chris Simcox of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps; Elizabeth Ridenour of the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools; and several leaders of the American Independent Party.\n\n5. Shariah Law \u2013 Coming To A Courtroom Near You\n\nFor more than six years, much of the American right has been afflicted with a feverish brain disorder that writer Adam Serwer calls \u201csharia panic.\u201d\n\nThe fever shows no signs of breaking any time soon.\n\nThe disorder is a delusional and apparently highly contagious conspiracy theory that contends American Muslims are trying to undermine the U.S. Constitution and maybe even overthrow the government someday by implementing Shariah religious law in legal proceedings across the country.\n\nThe truth is that Shariah is essentially a code of ethics, or, as The New York Times put it, \u201cIslam\u2019s road map for living morally and achieving salvation.\u201d In some Islamic countries, it forms the basis of an often harsh legal code that governs crime, public morality and other matters. It is occasionally used in other countries in private civil contracts between individuals (such as agreements between spouses to abide by its precepts in any future divorce), just as Christians or Jews will sometimes draw up private contracts about similar matters based on their own religions.\n\nBut it cannot, under the Constitution, supersede American law.\n\nNevertheless, to a growing number of mostly Republican legislators from Vermont to Alabama, Shariah has become \u2014 particularly around election time \u2014 a blueprint for world domination. So to thwart the sneaky Muslims \u2014 and pick up a few more votes \u2014 politicians have introduced bills in almost three dozen states in recent years, seeking to ban Shariah law in U.S. courts. In the last five years, eight states have actually passed such needless measures.\n\n\u201cAll of this in spite of the fact that no instance of sharia law superseding U.S. Constitutional law exists,\u201d Todd Green, author of The Fear of Islam: An Introduction to Islamophobia in the West, wrote in the Huffington Post this spring. In any case, he added, \u201cat one percent of the population, Muslims are not in the position to impose any kind of law on any state.\u201d\n\nThe bills are essentially the same across the country. They are modeled after legislation written by a 59-year-old Hasidic Jew, David Yerushalmi, a lawyer who is widely considered to be the driving force behind the anti-Shariah movement. He is also, according to the Anti-Defamation League, a man \u201cwith a record of anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and anti-black bigotry.\u201d One of Yerushalmi\u2019s clients and close allies is Pamela Geller, perhaps the best-known and most unhinged anti-Muslim ideologue in the United States.\n\nYerushalmi began writing his model statute \u2014 \u201cAmerican Laws for American Courts\u201d \u2014 in 2009. The statute, according to the Times, \u201cwould prevent state judges from considering foreign laws or rulings that violate constitutional rights in the United States.\u201d Yerushalmi admitted later that his purpose was not so much to ban the imposition of Islamic religious law \u2014 already impossible under the Constitution \u2014 but \u201cto get people asking this question, \u2018What is Shariah?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 2010, backed by a $60,000 campaign funded by the Muslim-bashing group ACT! for America, the bill was passed in Oklahoma with 70% of the vote. But the Oklahoma law explicitly targeted Shariah and was later struck down by a federal court. After that, the anti-Shariah movement wised up and watered down its bigotry, shifting its focus and language onto banning all foreign laws.\n\nBut \u201cas these restrictions pile up,\u201d according to an article in 2014 on the website of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, \u201cthe bans come full circle and reveal their true purpose: to demonize the Islamic faith.\u201d\n\nWhile conceding that Shariah was \u201cnot an imminent threat in Oklahoma yet,\u201d Republican then-state Rep.Rex Duncan, a chief sponsor of that state\u2019s anti-Shariah bill, told ABC News in 2010 that \u201c[i]t\u2019s a storm on the horizon in other states,\u201d adding, \u201cThe only entities that could oppose this measure are those that admittedly support applying international law and sharia law in American courts.\u201d\n\nCathie Adams, the former chairwoman of the Texas Republican Party and current leader of the Texas chapter of Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagle Forum, has said that immigration reform is a \u201ctool of Satan that will lead to the enactment of Sharia law and usher in the End Times.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paranoia is in our bloodstream.
