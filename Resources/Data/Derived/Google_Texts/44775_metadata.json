Keep an eye on him.\n\nAs Martin O\u2019Malley dips his ankles into the deep end of national politics \u2013 most recently with his full-throated plea earlier this month against the deportation of immigrant children \u2014 I recalled the first time I saw him on a national stage.\n\nI had a pretty good view: I was standing right next to him.\n\nThe two of us were being paraded as rising stars by the Democratic Leadership Council at the 2000 Democratic National Convention -- and even featured together on the cover of The New Democrat magazine.\n\nAlas \u2026 may the DLC rest in peace. (So too with my own political career.) But give the late Third Way vanguard some crystal ball credit: O\u2019Malley could be the next President of the United States.\n\nIn his potential White House run, however, O\u2019Malley won\u2019t be pursuing the DLC\u2019s lurch-to-the-center path. Nor will he be following the liberal orthodoxy. Indeed, it\u2019s the Maryland Governor\u2019s uniquely post-Clinton, post-Obama positioning that makes him this handicapper\u2019s pick to emerge as the dark horse with the most potent stretch kick in the 2016 presidential derby.\n\nThe most compelling reason? As O\u2019Malley demonstrated in the immigration debate, he\u2019s the rare progressive to frame his strongly felt policy positions in the language of faith. It\u2019s the passionate application of universal moral values by this devout Catholic that has the potential to upend the usual partisan and ideological categories that are choking today\u2019s body politic.\n\nI sat down with O\u2019Malley on July 11, a few hours after he stole the platform at the National Governors\u2019 Association annual conference in Nashville and broke with the President by forcefully and emotionally calling for a more compassionate policy on the treatment of Central American children who\u2019ve recently come to the United States illegally: \u201cIt is contrary to everything we stand for to try to summarily send children back to death.\u201d\n\nWith the potential primary still flooded with fluid contingencies, O\u2019Malley demurs about the prospects of challenging Hillary Clinton. \"I haven't even decided if I'm running yet, so I'm not thinking about other potential candidates,\u201d he told me. \u201cI'm focused on governing Maryland, helping Democrats win in 2014, and preparing responsibly so that I can make a decision when the time is right.\"\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s record as governor of Maryland, and before that mayor of Baltimore, provides plenty of manna to nourish starving progressives. Long before his immigration comments, the Governor punched through a succession of liberal hot-buttons: Marriage equality? Check. Gun control? Check. Death penalty repeal? Check. Decriminalizing pot and legalizing medical marijuana? Check and check. Some might argue that he\u2019s even been too liberal for solid blue Maryland. In fact, some do, and vociferously: Discontented residents of four western counties have been pushing an initiative for months to secede from the rest of the state.\n\nO\u2019Malley has ticked off plenty of liberals as well. Inheriting a $1.7 billion structural deficit and then plunging into the headwinds of the Great Recession, the Governor pushed through more than $9.5 billion in budget cuts, requiring sizable state employee layoffs, and the downsizing of critical health and transportation programs. And the state\u2019s largest public employee unions expressed considerable displeasure with O\u2019Malley\u2019s signature pension reform efforts\n\nOverall, however, O\u2019Malley can point to a fiscal track record that most progressives would embrace: investing record sums in education to produce the nation\u2019s top ranked public schools five years in a row and lowest college tuition hikes since 2007; expanding the earned income tax credit and increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour; and recovering all of the jobs lost in the national recession.\n\nOf course, you can\u2019t win enough electoral votes in our purple nation by tacking completely left \u2014 especially in 2016, when Obama fatigue likely will be weighing on the nation.\n\nBut O\u2019Malley understands that the left/right/center paradigm isn\u2019t important to the Americans who actually determine our national elections in today\u2019s deeply polarized polity. Swing voters and independents aren\u2019t clamoring for moderation or centrism: They are looking for leaders who will put aside party and ideology on occasion and actually get stuff done.\n\nOver the past few years, the national bi-partisan grassroots organization No Labels (I\u2019m a co-founder) has been polling and focus-grouping these voters. Our surveys have consistently shown that a majority of Americans are looking not at party or ideology; but rather for problem-solving. And O\u2019Malley can make a plausible case that he\u2019s been a problem-solver above all.\n\nTime\u2019s best mayor of 2005 and Governing\u2019s public official of 2009 has defined his brand as a stickler for non-partisan, data-driven management and administrative competence. In his coming out speech in Iowa \u2013 keynoting this June\u2019s state Democratic convention \u2014 O\u2019Malley devoted several minutes to discussing the technocratic approach he used to fight crime: \u201cWhen I was elected mayor in 1999 \u2026 Baltimore had become the most violent, most addicted, most abandoned city in America \u2026 So we set out to make our city work again. We saw trash in our streets and alleys, so we picked it up every day. We saw open air drug markets, and we began to relentlessly close them down \u2026 Over the next 10 years, Baltimore went on to achieve the biggest reduction in part 1 crime of any major city in America.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Republicans have owned the faith space since the Reagan era. Presidential candidate Barack Obama tried valiantly to take it back in 2008, but after the embarrassment of Reverend Jeremiah Wright and the right wing\u2019s maniacal campaign to brand him a Muslim, Obama\u2019s rhetorical strategy was mostly abandoned.\n\nO\u2019Malley appears to be reaching to pick up the scepter. The regular weekday Mass attendee \u2014 who brings to mind the beer-drinking, Irish Catholic everyman rather than the pious moral scold \u2014 described his religious beliefs to me as the underpinning of his public vocation. He referred me to a speech he delivered to his high school alma mater way back in 2002 in which he connected his Catholic education with his passion for problem solving:\n\n\u201cI learned \u2026 to search for Christ in the faces of others including, and especially, the faces of the poor, the faces of the homeless men who lined up for a meal every morning alongside the foundations of this church \u2026 I learned \u2026 to recognize and confront the enemy within \u2013 the original sin of our own culture and environment that would have us think less of people who \u2013 because of race, or class, or place \u2013 are not like us \u2026 And I learned that it is not enough to have faith, you must also have the courage to risk action on that faith, to risk failure upon that faith: the faith that one person can make a difference and that each of us must try.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that he grounded his angry denunciation of Obama\u2019s immigration policy in the faith tradition: \u201cThrough all of the great world religions, we are told that hospitality to strangers is an essential human dignity. \u2026 It is a belief that unites all of us.\u201d\n\nNote that he didn\u2019t mention his Christianity, nor even the slightly more politically correct construct of \u201cJudeo-Christian values.\u201d Instead, he reached to a broader audience, with the understanding that all religious and spiritual traditions in world history share at their core the same universal moral values, of welcoming the stranger and loving one\u2019s neighbor \u2014 of compassion and community. This appeal to unity \u2014 to a common higher ground \u2014 can potentially disrupt the GOP\u2019s monopoly on faith, without frightening religious minorities, or even agnostics, from the Democratic fold.\n\nMost significantly, by embracing shared moral values, O\u2019Malley might even find the path to counter today\u2019s dominant politics of self-interest that underlies both Tea Party libertarianism and the more cynical, transactional-based politics that serves as Washington\u2019s greatest bi-partisan consensus.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s enough dreaming. Back here in the real world of politics, O\u2019Malley has quite an arduous journey ahead of him, especially if Clinton decides to run. He can expect bruising personal and professional scrutiny from a cruel and punishing new media, which may constrain his ability to define himself and articulate the vision. Most pertinently, recent critical focus on a Baltimore jail scandal and Obamacare\u2019s rocky roll out in Maryland could directly undermine both his problem-solver and moral paladin narratives.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Maryland,United States, u.s. poli, Democratic Party, martin o'malley, 2016", "publicationDate": 201408031030, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The Maryland governor is a problem-solver and a social-justice Catholic who can transcend the left-right divide.
