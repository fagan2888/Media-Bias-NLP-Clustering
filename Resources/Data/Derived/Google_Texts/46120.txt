Ronan Farrow, the estranged son of director Woody Allen and a future MSNBC host, has made no bones about his disdain for his father in the past, due in no small part to the unsavory allegations raised in a recent Vanity Fair piece dealing with Allen and Mia Farrow’s family life.

And after an honorary Golden Globe presentation to Allen — who, in absentia, was hailed by actress Diane Keaton specifically for his ability to work with actresses — Farrow made his disgust clear on Twitter.
