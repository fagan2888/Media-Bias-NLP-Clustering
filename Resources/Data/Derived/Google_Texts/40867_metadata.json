University of Utah researchers have claimed that drivers talking on cell phones are as impaired as drunk drivers with a blood alcohol level of 0.08%.Others argue that driving while using cell phones is not particularly dangerous . The University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center found that other distractions, such as events taking place outside the car, adjusting the CD player, and other people in the vehicle were all more likely to cause accidents than using a cell phone.Sources:\n\n\n\n\"Distracted Walking: Injuries Soar for Pedestrians on Phones,\" Ohio State University website, June 19, 2013\n\n\n\nJennifer Smola, \"Study: Cell Phone-Related Injuries Soar,\" usatoday.com, Sep. 17, 2013\n\n\n\nDavid L.
