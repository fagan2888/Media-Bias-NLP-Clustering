In a perfect world, she would pour all of her energy into her music \u2014 instead, she acts as a de facto copyright enforcer for her band.\n\nThough Nox Arcana\u2019s music has appeared in documentaries, television shows and even theme parks with the band\u2019s blessing, Christine also finds her music on hundreds of illegal sites, and spends an enormous amount of time issuing takedown notices. In fact, she has collected five gigabytes of screenshots and unanswered Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notices on websites where the band\u2019s music has been copied and distributed illegally, often supported with advertising by major brands.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChristine is one of thousands of independent creators across the country frustrated by the inefficiencies of the \u201cNotice and Takedown\u201d process created by the DMCA. In principle, the process was created to provide copyright owners, like Nox Arcana, an easy way to notify online service providers when they discover their work is being infringed. At the same time, search engines and others were supposed be shielded from liability if they remove the material expeditiously and abide by the law\u2019s requirements.\n\nBut in practice, the process is cumbersome and favors non-compliance. It\u2019s not working for Nox Arcana and other independent artists. Some liken it to playing \u201cwhack-a-mole;\u201d illegal websites get taken down only to pop up somewhere else.\n\nStopping IP theft should not be this difficult, or so costly, to the individual artist, who is ultimately the victim.\n\nIn the first six months of 2013, the largest search engine received more than 100 million DMCA takedown notices. The numbers are staggering, but don\u2019t reflect the reality that most indie and small creators struggle to keep up with issuing notices and have simply given up trying to prevent illegal profiting from their work. Independent artists cannot afford employing an entire legal department to monitor the unauthorized use of their content on a daily basis.\n\nAnd the profits are staggering \u2014 a recent study by the Digital Citizens Alliance estimates that the top 596 pirate sites raked in $227 million in advertising revenues last year. These sites had a profit margin of between 80 and 94 percent. Content thieves rely on stealing the rights-protected work of others and distributing on low-cost sites. It\u2019s a low-risk, high-reward business.\n\nThis week, the House Judiciary subcommittee on Intellectual Property will examine the \u201cNotice and Takedown\u201d process, and to us, it is clear that a very hard look is necessary.\n\nThe DMCA was passed in 1998 when the Internet was still very much in its infancy. It was supposed to make things easier for all stakeholders by creating an ecosystem that protects creative works and promotes their dissemination, while also providing safe harbors for the Internet companies that play by the rules. Instead, the ecosystem has become imbalanced, as search engines appear to be turning a blind eye to the infringement on their sites rather than coming to the table to find meaningful solutions.\n\nPermission-less innovation is not innovation at all. Artists should determine how and when their works are used. Yet, the current environment risks chilling artistic expression.\n\nThe American people deserve better. The Constitution directs us to promote the progress of art and science. To do so, we must ensure that laws like the DMCA allow for a more efficient compliance process that is practical and effective in a digital world.\n\nIt defies common sense that a search engine can receive notice after notice when the same work reappears and not have to do anything more than continue to respond to these notices. Doing the bare minimum is not how the law was intended to function. Search engines need to do more to implement reasonable repeat infringer policies, such as considering the number of notices and takedowns that a site has received when compiling the order of search results and stopping automatic reposting once a link has been disabled under a DMCA notice.\n\n\u201cTakedown\u201d should mean \u201cstay down.\u201d\n\nAs the Judiciary Committee looks at this issue and continues its review of copyright, we will work to ensure that the voices and views of all creators \u2014 including independents like Christine \u2014 are heard and respected.\n\nChu has represented California\u2019s 27th Congressional District since 2009.
