ROCKLAND, Maine â€” A 27-year-old Biddeford man has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting to dealing heroin and cocaine from a Thomaston home earlier this year.

Stafford A. Goodman, aka Smurf, was sentenced on Dec. 20 to 10 years in prison with all but five years suspended for trafficking in drugs.

Goodman had been released from jail in May after serving 27 months for a felony drug offense.

According to the affidavit filed in Rockland District Court by the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency, officers went to a Water Street residence in Thomaston in September as part of their investigation into three people allegedly dealing heroin and cocaine from the home.

The three were in the residence and officers interviewed each of them.

Goodman admitted being a heroin user and while in handcuffs, officers noticed he was reaching his hands down the front of his pants, according to the affidavit. The officers checked and found a bag containing heroin and cocaine.

He then admitted to officers that he had been in Thomaston for the past couple of weeks solely to deal heroin and cocaine, according to the affidavit.

Seized during the search were 21 grams of heroin and 26 grams of cocaine, as well as other items indicative of drug trafficking, according to the MDEA. The approximate street value of the seized drugs was $10,000.
