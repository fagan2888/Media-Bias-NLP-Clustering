But a private insurance agency is using the domain name \u201cwashingtonhealthplanfinder.org\u201d to sign people up for policies.\n\nConfused? State officials want to make certain consumers won\u2019t be.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of this site and \u2026 forwarded to our Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner for investigation,\u201d said exchange spokeswoman Bethany Frey.\n\nOfficials in many states have long been monitoring the Web for look-alike websites that can result in fraud \u2014 or simply consumer confusion.\n\nThe copycat website in Washington resembles a state exchange, offering plans for individuals and businesses and informing visitors that open enrollment starts Oct 1. But the site is actually owned by a Seattle-based insurance agency. In small print, at the bottom of the site\u2019s home page, it says that it \u201cis in no way associated with the official Washington Exchange web site.\u201d\n\nJeff Lindstrom, a partner with the Health Insurance Team insurance agency, said he he purchased the domain name last winter \u2014 around the same time the exchange chose Washington Healthplanfinder as its name. He said he told exchange officials last spring he would sell them the domain name but that they declined to negotiate. He refused to say whether his site would be confusing to people searching for the exchange.\n\nLindstrom said he has applied to become a licensed agency to sell insurance products available on the exchange but is uncertain whether he has that status. \u201cOur website is built with the intent to be where our consumers are,\u201d he said.\n\nOne clue that the site is not the real deal is its Medicare offerings. The Affordable Care Act exchanges don\u2019t offer policies for people on Medicare.\n\nThe real Washington exchange says if people are unsure they are on the right site, they should call Washington Healthplanfinder toll-free at 1-855-WAFINDER. If they suspect a site is fraudulent, they should contact the state insurance commissioner\u2019s office at 1-800-562-6900.\n\nExperts suggest that to avoid confusion, consumers should first head to the federal website healthcare.gov. On that site, they will be directed to the official marketplace for their state.\n\nThis story was originally published on Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "A deceivingly similar Web address to the Washington state Health Insurance Exchange is leading consumers to a private insurance website offering health-care policies of its own.", "pubDate": "2013-10-3", "og": {"image": "http://media2.govtech.com/images/Confused+Shutterstock.jpg", "title": "Lookalike Wash.
