Almost all 17 of the Republican candidates strongly opposed Obama\u2019s war on coal, the job-killing EPA, and global warming hysteria. But Trump has exhibited something else \u2014 unusually keen insight into and visceral dislike for green extremism, especially as inflicted upon us by the Obama administration.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOn global warming, Trump has repeatedly stated or tweeted as follows:\n\nGlobal warming is a \u201choax,\u201d echoing the words of leading Senate climate skeptic Sen. Jim Inhofe.\n\nTrump has mocked Obama for saying that climate change is the top global priority, especially as compared to Islamic terrorism and rogue nuclear states like Iran and North Korea.\n\nOther countries, especially China, push global warming hysteria to cripple the U.S. economy and gain competitive advantage.\n\nTrump has ridiculed Obama\u2019s climate \u201cdeal\u201d with China in which the U.S. cuts its CO2 emissions now while China gets away with a commitment to only possibly peak its emissions by 2030.\n\nWhen global temperatures failed to rise as predicted by climate models, \u201cglobal warming\u201d became \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\nGlobal warming hysteria is being pushed by \u201cJonathan Gruber-types,\u201d the infamous architect of Obamacare who called Americans \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nTrump has observed that the polar ice caps are not melting as predicted by global warming hysterics.\n\nThese are all key points made by climate skeptics. Trump has made them consistently without any waffling.\n\nTrump is also a long-time supporter of the U.S. coal industry:\n\n\u201cThe US is stupidly closing all of its coal fired plants. And then we wonder why our energy costs are going up.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s coal regulations will destroy the coal industry, put Americans out of work, raise electricity prices and lead to blackouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s war on coal is killing American jobs, making us more energy dependent on our enemies & creating a great business disadvantage.\u201d\n\nMost recently, Trumped jumped on Hillary Clinton\u2019s gaffe about putting coal miners and their industry out of business. \u201cI want clean coal. We\u2019ll have clean coal and plenty of it. The coal industry is being decimated and many great people are out of work and they can\u2019t get back into work. Hillary Clinton as you know, she says she wants to put the coal miners out of business never to work again. I don\u2019t know how she can go to West Virginia.\u201d\n\nTrump bears no love for wind and solar energy. He has personally battled wind turbines being built near one of his golf courses in Scotland as \u201cobsolete, ugly and expensive.\u201d Trump has railed against the corruption and inefficiency of solar power.\n\n\u201cThe $9 billion that \u202aBarack Obama spent in \u2018stimulus\u2019 for solar, wind projects created 910 total jobs, costing $9.8 million each.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama loves wasting our money. He just made another guarantee of $197 million to a solar company. Cronyism!\u201d\n\n\u201cShock \u0097 even more \u202aBarack Obama solar corruption. \u202aVice President Biden\u2018s chief of staff\u2019s firm got biggest Department of Energy loan.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter Solyndra, \u202aBarack Obama is still intent on wasting our tax dollars on unproven technologies and risky companies. He must be accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, green energy is way behind the times. You look at the windmills that are destroying shorelines all over the world. Economically, they\u2019re not good. It\u2019s a very, very poor form of energy. Solar, as you know, hasn\u2019t caught on because, I mean, a solar panel takes 32 years \u2014 it\u2019s a 32-year payback. Who wants a 32-year payback? The fact is the technology is not there yet. Wind farms are hurting the country.\u201d\n\nTrump is a long-time critic of the EPA, which he has called the \u201cEmployment Prevention Agency\u201d:\n\nWow, just in-John Beale, the top person in government on climate change (EPA), is a total fraud, and just admitted it! What can they say now ?\n\n\u201cNew business start-ups at the lowest level in 30 years and the EPA is now the Employment Prevention Agency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe EPA official who wants to crucify gas companies resigned. Good. But his attitude is endemic in the EPA.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarack Obama\u202a has increased the EPA budget by over 150%. The EPA is an impediment to both growth and jobs. It sends jobs overseas. \u201d\n\n\u201cWith gas prices rising and the economy failing, Barack Obama seeks to have his EPA raise energy prices by $109 billion.\u201d\n\nLest you doubt Trump\u2019s dislike of the EPA, Trump has several times commented that he would dismantle the EPA and send its functions back to the states. \u201cEnvironmental protection, we waste all of this money. We\u2019re going to bring that back to the states. We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget and we will be dynamic again.\u201d As EPA administrator Gina McCarthy has admitted that the vast majority of environmental protection is now done in the states, Trump\u2019s vow to cut EPA is well within the bounds of reality.\n\nI have worked on EPA, energy and environment issues for 25 years. No GOP presidential nominee has ever so consistently and vocally maintained such hard-core views against EPA and the green scam machine. Most impressively, Trump seems to have has figured out all this on his own as a detached observer. This underscores his sincerity.\n\nEPA, especially under Obama, and the rest of radical environmentalism have had devastating impacts on our economy and society. Hillary has promised more of the same. That must stop. A President Trump may be our last, best chance to do that.\n\nSteve Milloy publishes JunkScience.com and is a former coal industry executive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump-ing Hillary on EPA and Global Warming", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Trump-ing Hillary on EPA and Global Warming", "title": "Trump-ing Hillary on EPA and Global Warming - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/GettyImages-526116122.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/05/04/trump-ing-hillary-on-epa-and-global-warming/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump-ing Hillary on EPA and Global Warming", "title": "Trump-ing Hillary on EPA and Global Warming - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/GettyImages-526116122.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,EPA", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2016-05-04T08:17:53-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe269f\"", "article_summary": "When global temperatures failed to rise as predicted by climate models, \u201cglobal warming\u201d became \u201cclimate change.\u201dGlobal warming hysteria is being pushed by \u201cJonathan Gruber-types,\u201d the infamous architect of Obamacare who called Americans \u201cstupid.\u201dTrump has observed that the polar ice caps are not melting as predicted by global warming hysterics.\nAlmost all 17 of the Republican candidates strongly opposed Obama\u2019s war on coal, the job-killing EPA, and global warming hysteria.\nOther countries, especially China, push global warming hysteria to cripple the U.S. economy and gain competitive advantage.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn global warming, Trump has repeatedly stated or tweeted as follows:Global warming is a \u201choax,\u201d echoing the words of leading Senate climate skeptic Sen.
