Bobby Jindal apparently got tired of waiting for his big break and announced that he was dropping out of the campaign. Indeed, this time around, with Donald Trump in the race, the very top of the polls has so far been permanently occupied.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush \u2013 We Need U.S. Ground Troops to Fight ISIS\n\nOne of Jindal\u2019s partners in futility though, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, must see the current focus on the threat posed by the terrorist group ISIS as his last, best shot to break out of the basement in the opinion polls and make himself a factor in the race.\n\nGraham\u2019s signature issue in the campaign has been his determination to keep the country safe from terrorism in general and ISIS in particular. He is so focused on it, in fact, that he was mocked after the first debate for clumsily turning almost every opportunity he was given to speak \u2013 even on topics including the economy and abortion \u2013 into a discussion of ISIS.\n\nHe was ready to do \u201cwhatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Graham prefers to turn the discussion back to his hawkish defense stance, since the right-wing Republicans who are disproportionately represented among primary voters view him as a questionable candidate in other areas, including social policy and immigration reform.\n\nRelated: A Testy Obama Warns Republicans \u2013 Your Rhetoric Is Helping ISIS\n\nIn the wake of last week\u2019s terror attacks in Paris and the ongoing battles there between police and what appear to be terrorist cells, this would seem like Graham\u2019s moment to grab the attention of the voters. And the South Carolinian has been aggressively pushing his strategy for taking on ISIS in interviews and on social media.\n\nTo destroy ISIL, we must authorize force not limited by geography, time, or means. https://t.co/x9H6dK56X3 via @daveweigel #GrahamPlan \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) November 18, 2015\n\nOn Wednesday, Graham announced that he would introduce a proposed authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) to combat ISIS. (The Obama administration is currently attacking ISIS in Iraq and Syria under an old AUMF that was really meant to cover operations against al Qaeda.) The Graham AUMF places no geographical limits on the U.S. military and intelligence services in the fight against ISIS, not does it set limits on the amount of time the fight takes or what it costs.\n\nWhile Graham isn\u2019t the only one laying out plans to fight ISIS \u2013 Jeb Bush gave a major speech on defense policy Wednesday that called for more ground troops in the fight and Donald Trump released new radio ads promising to \u201cbomb the hell out of\u201d ISIS \u2013 he has the most riding on it.\n\nIf Graham can\u2019t get a bump in the polls when his signature issue is dominating the news cycle, it\u2019s virtually impossible to make a credible argument that he ought to remain in the race.\n\nRelated: Putin Doubles Down on Syria Bombing Campaign\n\nHis problem, though, according to Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center on Politics, is that in the past week, the other GOP candidates have begun sounding a lot like him.\n\n\u201cGraham\u2019s problem is actually, for him, a triumph: The other candidates are basically as hawkish as he is, which is what he wants (with the exception of the marginalized Rand Paul),\u201d said Kondik.\n\n\u201cHowever, because that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s hard for him to get traction, particularly because on other issues he\u2019s known to much of the party as a RINO-type figure.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Lindsey Graham has been sounded like a one-note presidential candidate at times, with his almost obsessive focus on ISIS.
