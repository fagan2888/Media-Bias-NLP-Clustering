Stephen Colbert interviewed incoming Daily Show host Trevor Noah on Thursday’s episode of The Late Show, and the two comics joked about taking over iconic talk shows from legendary broadcasters.

“Jon is like a Jewish Yoda,” Noah said, referring to erstwhile Daily Show host Jon Stewart. “I said, ‘What’s The Daily Show?’ He said, ‘The Daily Show is what The Daily Show should be for you to be the best show you can make.’ I don’t want to seem stupid, so I walked away.”

Noah starts as host of The Daily Show on Sept. 28, but the occasion of appearing on with Colbert gave the 31-year-old a chance to offer up some political commentary. When Colbert asked what Noah thought of the Republican debate on Wednesday night, Noah explained that no one on the debate stage said anything of substance for more than three hours.

“We’re all greats in this country. Greatness. And the taxes we need to … with Iran, if we look at what’s happening … Obamacare, no … we try to find a place where this is a great country … America. Unity. Justice. Together. Thank you very much,” Noah joked, mimicking a typical answer.
