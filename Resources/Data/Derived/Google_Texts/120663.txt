MENLO, Iowa â€” High speed and alcohol use likely were behind a single-vehicle rollover crash on Interstate 80 in Iowa on Friday night in which five Grand Island, Neb., men died, authorities said.

Alex J. Paz-Lobo, 29, was driving east on Interstate 80 south of Menlo in Adair County about 8:15 p.m. when the 2011 Chevrolet Camaro crossed the median and entered the westbound lanes, Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Bryan Michelsen said.

The car then rolled nearly a quarter of a mile into a field on the north side of the Interstate.

The passengers were Javier Martinez-Martin, 41; Denis Juvenal Sorto-Martinez, 25; Jose B. Martinez, 21; and Erick Rauda, 19.

All five were pronounced dead at the scene.

Martinez-Martin was the only one wearing a seat belt, but none of the men was ejected, Michelsen said.

The pavement was wet but not icy at the time of the accident. There is a curve in the Interstate at the site of the accident, and the car appears to have missed the curve, he said.

The Grand Island men were among 11 people who died in vehicle crashes and collisions on Iowa highways on Friday and Saturday. The Iowa State Patrol believes icy roads were a factor in most of the other accidents.
