Authorities have identified the two people killed when a car struck a tree in northeast Minneapolis early Saturday.

Shannasey M. O’Rourke, 26, of Minneapolis, a front-seat passenger, died at the scene.

The car’s driver, Paul S. Buchanan, 30, of Minneapolis, died at Hennepin County Medical Center about an hour after the 2:20 a.m. crash, the Hennepin County medical examiner’s office said.

Police said that the car hit a tree near the intersection of 37th and University Avenues NE. Three passengers in the back seat also were taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, but are expected to survive, police said Saturday. Their names have not been released.

The cause of the crash is under investigation.
