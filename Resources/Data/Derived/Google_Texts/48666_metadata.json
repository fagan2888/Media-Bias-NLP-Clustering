But let\u2019s imagine there was no Obamacare. Let\u2019s imagine that Obama had actually followed through on his occasional promises to focus on the economy and jobs first and foremost and didn\u2019t blunder into the huge wasteful distraction that is the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe lessons of the VA would still be a problem for Obama and for liberals generally.\n\nWhy? Because the Democratic party simply is the party of government. It is the party that insists on the nobility, efficacy and intellectual superiority of government. The VA is at the intersection of all the things liberals insist are wise and good and just about government. It is government-run healthcare. It is the tangible fulfillment of a sacred obligation the government has with those who\u2019ve sacrificed most for our nation. It is also the one institution and/or constituency that enjoys huge bipartisan support. The VA, rhetorically and politically, is more sacrosanct and less controversial than Medicare, Social Security, road building, the NIH, or public schools. We are constantly told that we could get so many wonderful, super-fantastic things done if only both sides would lay down their ideological blah blah blah blah and work together for yada yada yada. Well, welcome to the VA. How\u2019s that working out for you?\n\nThe White House keeps saying these horrible cases of deception and wrongdoing are \u201cisolated incidents\u201d and not \u201csystemic.\u201d As I asked last night on Special Report, how many isolated incidents do you need before they become systemic? Right now, allegations have surfaced in 19 states. That feels systemic to me. But what do I know?\n\nI do know that the VA has had problems of one sort or another for decades. The current allegations are particularly egregious, but the fact that the VA is plagued by bureaucracy and inefficiency is hardly a revelation. It\u2019s certainly not news to Obama, who acknowledged many of the problems as a candidate and was briefed on them after he was elected. Then senator Obama told the VFW in 2007, \u201dNo veteran should have to fill out a 23-page claim to get care, or wait months \u2014 even years \u2014 to get an appointment at the VA.\u201d He continued, \u201dWhen we fail to keep faith with our veterans, the bond between our nation and our nation\u2019s heroes becomes frayed. When a veteran is denied care, we are all dishonored.\u201d And given that in most of his State of the Union addresses Obama has gone on and on about improving government efficiency and cutting red tape generally, you\u2019d think the VA would be near the forefront of that effort.\n\nIt is absolutely true that the VA was plagued with problems before Obama came into office and Republicans who talk a lot about how much they love the military are open to criticism as a result. But Democrats talk about how much they love the government. And everything they need to make the VA work is available to them. And yet, it\u2019s a mess and has been a mess for decades. Why? Maybe it\u2019s a mess because such messes come with the territory when you put bureaucrats in charge. Criminality, as alleged, may not be inevitable (though I\u2019m not so sure). But rationing, incompetence, bloat, waste, rent-seeking, and a sort of legal corruption certainly are.\n\nYou would think that liberals, out of a desire to protect their brand, would worry more about making sure government handled what is already on its plate better before worrying about adding new responsibilities. This administration, and this president in particular, has insisted that they should be judged by their competence and intelligence. They\u2019ve laid down markers that they will prove that liberalism can go big because they\u2019re just so darn smart and good.\n\nThat creates a bind for this president. Was fixing the VA a priority or not? If it was a priority, how come after almost six years, it\u2019s such a godawful mess? Are you just not up to the job of managing it? And, if it wasn\u2019t a priority, why not? Were you just pandering to veterans?
