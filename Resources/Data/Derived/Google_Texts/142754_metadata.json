Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he welcomed the renewed sense of urgency to find a solution to the war in Syria after the Paris attacks, adding the world had a \"rare moment\" of diplomatic opportunity to end the violence.\n\nObama wants to coax other European and Middle Eastern countries into more tangible steps to show their military commitment and was due to hold a bilateral meeting with Saudi Arabia's King Salman. Last month, the two leaders affirmed the need to cooperate against Islamic State.\n\nObama said he also discussed in a meeting with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan coordinating efforts to fortify the border with Syria, which Islamic State has used to smuggle supplies and foreign fighters.\n\nMIGRATION CONCERNS\n\nThe coordinated attacks by gunmen and suicide bombers in Paris on Friday put Obama and other leaders of the world's major economies under increased pressure to find common cause.\n\nIt remains to be seen, however, whether Washington itself has an appetite for much deeper involvement after already stepping up air strikes and committing small numbers of special operations troops to northern Syria to advise opposition forces in the fight against Islamic State.\n\nThe Paris carnage, in which 129 people were killed in attacks on a concert hall, restaurants, bars and a sports stadium, also poses a major challenge for Europe, with populist leaders rushing to demand an end to an influx of refugees and migrants from the Middle East and Africa.\n\nIn a diplomatic coup for Europe and for Turkey, the G20 leaders will agree that migration is a global problem that must be addressed in a coordinated way, according to a draft communique seen by Reuters, although it has yet to be accepted by all and is due to be published on Monday.\n\nEurope and Turkey, the most-heavily hit by the crisis, had been pushing for the G20 to recognize the issue as a global problem and help to deal with it financially, despite opposition from China, India and Russia. A million migrants from the Middle East and Africa are expected to come to Europe this year alone.\n\nAccording to a separate statement due to be released later on Sunday, a draft of which was seen by Reuters, they also agreed to step up border controls and aviation security in the wake of the Paris attacks, which they condemned as \"heinous\".\n\n(Additional reporting by David Dolan, Lidia Kelly, Denis Dyomkin, Jan Strupczewski, Humeya Pamuk, Orhan Coskun, Asli Kandemir; Writing by Nick Tattersall; Editing by Keith Weir)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BELEK, Turkey (Reuters) - U.S.", "title": "Obama urges Russia to join renewed effort to eliminate Islamic State", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/15/Obama-urges-Russia-join-renewed-effort-eliminate-Islamic-State", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/g20-turkey_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/15/Obama-urges-Russia-join-renewed-effort-eliminate-Islamic-State", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/g20-turkey_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BELEK, Turkey (Reuters) - U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "U.S.-led efforts to combat Islamic State were complicated when Russia joined the conflict a month and a half ago, targeting what the West says are mainly areas where foreign-backed fighters are battling Assad, Moscow's ally, rather than Islamic State.\nWashington already expects France to retaliate by taking on a larger role in the U.S.-led coalition's bombing campaign against Islamic State (ISIL).\nRARE OPPORTUNITYThe Paris attacks again demonstrated how Islamic State poses a threat far beyond its strongholds in Syria and Iraq.\n\"Strategic objectives relating to the fight against the Islamic State are, in principle, very similar, but there are differences on the tactics side,\" he said.\nLast month, the two leaders affirmed the need to cooperate against Islamic State."}
