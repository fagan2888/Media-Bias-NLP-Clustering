The U.S. hemostasis testing is a well-established market, with nearly every hospital and reference lab having an analyzer, and most large hospitals having a backup unit in addition to their primary analyzer. The matured nature of the market and high installed base has led to relatively stable annual unit sales, with replacement of the older machines accounting for a majority of the total sales.\n\nRoutine high volume tests such as prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and D-dimer account for more than 65% of the total hemostasis tests. Tests for monitoring anticoagulant therapies are expected to decrease as new anticoagulant drugs that do not require monitoring are expected to enter the market.\n\nAging population and the inclusion of millions of people into the health insurance bracket due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will create increased demand for routine hemostasis tests. However, transitioning to outcome-based reimbursements model from fee-for-service model, due to the emergence of accountable care organizations (ACOs), will increase POC testing volumes, thus driving down the volumes and cost per test at both core lab sites and reference labs.\n\nThe competitive analysis outlines Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics as a leader in this market segment, but with Instrumentation Laboratory and other close behind.\n\nThis Report includes extensive detail on:\n\n- Hemostasis Analyzer Market\n\n- Hemostasis Reagent Market\n\nThis Report Also Includes:\n\n- In-depth, Professionally Researched Data That Has Been Formatted and Analyzed to Gain Actionable Insights as Quickly as Possible\n\n- Executive Summary\n\n- Trend Analysis by Segment\n\n- Market Value Forecasts until 2022 and History Back to 2012\n\n- Market Drivers and Limiters\n\n- Detailed Competitive Analysis for Each Market and Segment\n\nCompanies Mentioned\n\n- Bio/Data Corporation\n\n- Chrono-Log Corporation\n\n- Diagnostica Stago\n\n- Instrumentation Laboratory\n\n- Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics\n\n- Thermo Scientific\n\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/mtct3b/us_market_for\n\nAbout Research and Markets\n\nResearch and Markets is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.
