A 33-year-old Polk County man died Saturday night when he was struck by a car while walking alongside a road in Bartow.

About 9:32 p.m., Kassie Schaefer, 24, of Winter Haven, was northbound on Alturas Road just south of Citrus Avenue in her 2002 Dodge Neon, according to the Polk County Sheriff’s Office. Mark Piburn, of 2690 Alturas Road, was walking in the road at the same time.

Schaefer did not see Piburn until she hit him, the sheriff’s office said. Schaefer pulled over and called for emergency assistance. Emergency responders pronounced Piburn dead at the scene.

Piburn landed in the road, according to the sheriff’s office. There was damage to the roof, a window pillar and the windshield, which Piburn had broke through during the crash.

Schaefer was taken to Winter Haven Hospital where she was treated and released, the sheriff’s office said.
