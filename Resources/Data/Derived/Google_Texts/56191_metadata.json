Lawmakers in Brazil enjoy parliamentary immunity, which protects their speech, opinions and votes. However, the immunity would not apply to Bolsonaro because he made similar remarks later in an interview with a newsmagazine.\n\nThe statement did not provide any details about what charges Bolsonaro could face. But a report on G1, the Internet portal of Brazilian television network Globo, said they could include \"inciting discrimination or prejudice based on race, color, ethnicity, religion or national origin.\" It said those charges carry a maximum penalty of three years in prison as well as a fine.\n\nAtila Roque, who heads the Brazil branch of Amnesty International, said Bolsonaro \"crossed the line of what is acceptable.\"\n\n\"This particular congressman has been for a long time already a provocateur, particularly on the areas of sexual rights, of women, of the LGBT population, of people who stand for other values. He has consistently been prompting violence and misogyny and sexism,\" said Roque. \"It is time for the Congress to say 'enough': he has gone beyond the freedom of expression of anyone in this country.\"\n\nA March study by the government research agency estimated that some 527,000 people are raped per year in Brazil, though only around 10 percent of them report the attacks to the police.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/WORLD", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-06 03:04:36 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The Brazilian government's human rights watchdog said Friday it has asked the Attorney General's Office to file a criminal complaint against a lawmaker who said he wouldn't rape a female colleague only because she didn't deserve it.
