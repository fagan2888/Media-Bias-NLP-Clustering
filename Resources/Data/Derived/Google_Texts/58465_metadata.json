As a result, many plans enrolled a larger proportion of sicker people than they bargained for. But some of those losses were also a function of political wrangling after Republican lawmakers blocked payments that were supposed to help insurers get through the difficult first years.\n\nThe timing, though, is bad news for Democrats. Proposed rate hikes are just starting to dribble out, setting up a battle over health insurance costs in a tumultuous presidential election year that will decide the fate of Obamacare.\n\nAnd the headlines are likely to keep coming right up to Election Day since many consumers won\u2019t see actual rates until the insurance marketplaces open Nov. 1 \u2014 a week before they go to the polls.\n\n\u201cAny reports of premium increases will immediately become talking points on the campaign trail,\u201d said Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cWe\u2019re in an election where the very future of the law will be debated.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Republicans are already pouncing on UnitedHealth's decision as proof the law is unworkable. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the beginning of the so-called insurance death spiral,\" Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said last week.\n\nDemocrats say they will mount a vigorous defense of a law that has provided 20 million people with coverage \u2014 and point to Republicans' failure to propose any coherent alternative to Obamacare.\n\n\"The Republicans will try to make [Hillary] Clinton own the higher prices, but the problem is that Republicans have no alternative or answer,\" said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. \"They are in the position of taking away insurance if they repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nMore turbulence ahead\n\nThe consensus among insurance experts is that the Obamacare shakeout isn\u2019t fatal \u2014 that is, not unless political leaders decide to make it so. Many insurers \u2014 including Anthem, with Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, and Centene, the nation\u2019s largest Medicaid insurer \u2014 remain committed to the Obamacare marketplaces despite their dismal financial performance.\n\nAetna CEO Mark Bertolini, who has roughly 900,000 exchange customers, reiterated the company\u2019s commitment to the exchanges even as, during a call with shareholders, he called for changes to how the exchanges are organized.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to touch this product because of the politics,\u201d Bertolini said, noting that Congress routinely tweaks other health care programs. \u201cBut if we get to that point, we believe we are in a very good place to make this a sustainable program.\u201d\n\nBut no one denies there will be continued turbulence \u2014 or that that won\u2019t create consumer backlash that could be politically damaging.\n\nAverage rate hikes have been modest in the past despite apocalyptic predictions: Premiums increased by an average of 8 percent this year, according to an administration analysis. That report \"debunks the myth\" that Obamacare customers experienced double-digit rate hikes, said Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Ben Wakana.\n\nBut there are reasons to think the next round may be different.\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield plans, which dominate many state exchanges, saw profits plummet by 75 percent between 2013 and 2015, according to an analysis by A.M. Best Co. A chief reason for the financial woes: \u201cthe intensity of losses in the exchange segment.\u201d\n\nHealth Care Service Corp., which operates Blue plans in five states, dropped out of New Mexico\u2019s exchange for this year after regulators refused to approve rate hikes as big as the company sought. In Texas, Illinois and two other states where HCSC does business, medical costs for individual customers exceeded premiums by more than $1.3 billion last year.\n\nJust over half of the 23 nonprofit startups seeded with Obamacare loan dollars have collapsed after hemorrhaging red ink. The 11 surviving plans continue to struggle, with more than $400 million in combined losses last year.\n\n\u201cI have to raise prices because I have to assume the worst,\u201d said Martin Hickey, CEO of New Mexico Health Connections, one of the surviving co-ops, which expects to increase prices by roughly a third for 2017. \u201cWhether it stabilizes or not, we can\u2019t take the risk.\u201d\n\nEven New York-based Oscar, the much ballyhooed, tech-savvy startup bankrolled with billions in venture capital dollars, is sputtering. Medical costs for Oscar\u2019s individual customers in New York, where it has the most customers, outstripped premiums by nearly 50 percent last year, according to financial filings.\n\n\u201cIn some cases the hole is getting deeper rather than getting better,\u201d said Deloitte\u2019s Scott.\n\nOne big reason is lower-than-expected enrollment of younger, often healthier people who balance the costs of those who require more costly care. Roughly 12.7 million Americans signed up for Obamacare plans during the most recent open enrollment period. That\u2019s far below the 22 million projected by the Congressional Budget Office, and it\u2019s certain to decline as some drop out.\n\n\u201cThe pool is far less healthy than we forecast,\u201d said Brad Wilson, CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, which says it lost $400 million on its exchange business during the first two years and is weighing whether to compete for Obamacare customers in 2017. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue not just here in North Carolina, but all over. \u2026 We need more healthy people in the pool.\u201d\n\n'Not enough of a hammer'\n\nThere\u2019s a growing realization the financial penalty for failing to obtain coverage is an insufficient cudgel to persuade younger Americans to enroll. The fee for 2016 is $695 or 2.5 percent of income, whichever is higher. Just 28 percent of HealthCare.gov customers for 2016 were between the ages of 18 and 34, significantly below the 35 percent threshold typically considered necessary for a balanced marketplace.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough of a hammer,\u201d said Kevin Fitzgerald, an insurance lawyer with Foley & Lardner. \u201cYou need a lot of healthy people to sign up to make the numbers work. Obviously that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nInsurers have also been hurt by problems with programs designed to protect them if they drew a large share of sicker customers. Most notably, a pool designed to mitigate heavy losses delivered only 12.6 percent of anticipated payments after Republicans inserted a provision into a budget deal requiring that the program be budget neutral. That created a $2.5 billion blow to insurers. Many of the co-ops blamed their demise on the lack of that funding.\n\nHealth plans also complain that Obamacare\u2019s enrollment rules are too loose, allowing people to wait until they need medical care to sign up for coverage, and then to halt payments once they\u2019ve received treatment.\n\nThe Obama administration is addressing some of these concerns: It has eliminated some reasons Obamacare customers can use to sign up outside the standard enrollment season. And it plans to require proof from exchange customers that they\u2019re eligible to sign up outside the normal window because, say, they've moved or had a child, which are among the most common reasons.\n\nBut health plan officials say more needs to be done to stabilize the markets, for instance, by giving them greater flexibility to sell different kinds of policies.\n\n\u201cWe have real concerns about the next year or two based on the experience so far,\u201d said Ceci Connolly, CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, which represents 22 plans. \u201cEven for our members that are getting close to breaking even on this, they say that it\u2019s a really challenging and unpredictable environment.\u201d\n\nMost health plans remain optimistic the markets will eventually stabilize. Security Health Plan, which does business in 41 Wisconsin counties, attracted three times as many exchange customers as anticipated during its first year of Obamacare business.\n\n\u201cWas it a financial winner? No,\u201d said John Kelly, the health plan\u2019s chief marketing and operations officer. \u201cWe expected to take losses and we did.\u201d\n\nBut the losses weren\u2019t significant enough to pose a threat to the nonprofit plan\u2019s stability, and it expects to get better at assessing the costs of its Obamacare customers with each year.\n\n\u201cWe are not leaving our markets,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe are committed to these communities we serve.\u201d\n\nJennifer Haberkorn and Nancy Cook contributed to this report.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Many consumers will see large rate increases for the first time Nov. 1 \u2014 a week before they go to the polls.", "title": "Obamacare's November surprise", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/obamacare-rate-hikes-a-looming-political-headache-for-democrats-222663", "image": "http://static.politico.com/72/32/430574714fbb9fd7013daad5ce4b/160429-obamacare-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Many consumers will see large rate increases for the first time Nov. 1 \u2014 a week before they go to the polls.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Health plans also complain that Obamacare\u2019s enrollment rules are too loose, allowing people to wait until they need medical care to sign up for coverage, and then to halt payments once they\u2019ve received treatment.\nBut that looks increasingly likely as health plans socked by Obamacare losses look to regain their financial footing by raising rates.\nNo,\u201d said John Kelly, the health plan\u2019s chief marketing and operations officer.\nThe Obama administration is addressing some of these concerns: It has eliminated some reasons Obamacare customers can use to sign up outside the standard enrollment season.\nThat report \"debunks the myth\" that Obamacare customers experienced double-digit rate hikes, said Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Ben Wakana."}
