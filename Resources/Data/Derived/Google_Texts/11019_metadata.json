He also sits well to the right of the median Republican primary candidate, which helps explain his surge in the polls. Last week, National Review\u2019s Jonah Golberg wrote a column arguing that Carson is \u201ceven more authentically African American than Barack Obama, given that Obama\u2019s mother was white and he was raised in part by his white grandparents.\u201d\n\nGoldberg interprets the fact that a person of such authentic blackness is a popular, conservative member of the Republican Party as a matter of deep significance, when in fact it confirms that the right's commitment to racial justice has a deeply superficial quality. After a predictable backlash to the blackness scale he contrived, Goldberg revised and extended.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats, MSNBC, Salon, et al,\u201d he wrote, \u201care so invested in their narrative that the GOP is a racist cult that they have trouble dealing with the fact that Ben Carson\u2014a black guy\u2014is arguably the front-runner and certainly the most popular figure in the Republican field (and drawing most of his support from precisely the voters the MSNBC crowd is most convinced are the recrudescent racist heart of the conservative movement). Rather than celebrate this huge step forward in racial progress, or at least think about what it really means, they instead ignore it, dismiss it, or attack my 'racism' for pointing it out. Well, to Hell with that game.\u201d\n\nThis would fatally undermine the liberal critique of racial politics on the right, if liberals argued that Republicans belonged to a segregated party that espoused hatred for minorities no matter their politics. Instead, Goldberg is celebrating tokenism on the scale of a national, ideological movement.\n\nThat Carson is black and popular among Republican primary voters is incontrovertible. It\u2019s also largely beside the point. The question of why Carson is popular on the right is complicated, and surely in part related to his aforementioned conservative politics, his religious devotion, and his hypnotically avuncular demeanor. But it is just as surely related to the fact that Carson absolves conservatives of their coarse and patronizing view of black voters and political leaders. Carson attributes his unpopularity with liberals to the notion that he had the temerity to \u201ccome off the plantation.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, the fact that Republican voters like a guy who tells them that other black people\u2014the ones who support Democrats\u2014are like plantation slaves doesn\u2019t harm the liberal critique of conservative racial politics at all. Nor does it cancel out or refute the existence of racism.\n\nThe Kentucky poor are now in limbo, though their position is tellingly strengthened by the fact that Kentucky is whiter than the median state. Beneficiaries of the Medicaid expansion there are whiter and more geographically dispersed than in other states. The prologue to their story may come from Arkansas, which declined to rescind its version of the Medicaid expansion, even after voters there replaced a retiring Democratic governor with a Republican.\n\nSo there is hope. But there's also peril. What distinguishes Kentucky is that its Medicaid expansion was undertaken unilaterally by outgoing Governor Steve Beshear. Though he softened his position during the general election, Bevin could rescind it on his own, without going to the legislature.\n\nIf he declines to do so, conservatives will consider it a great setback in their ongoing campaign against the national wave of Medicaid expansion, a campaign that has done disproportionate harm to low-income black people all over the country. And that says far more about the racial politics of their movement than the fact that Kentucky\u2019s incoming lieutenant governor is black herself.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Look no further than the governor's race in Kentucky", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Look no further than the governor's race in Kentucky.", "title": "A Black Figurehead Does Not a Tolerant Political Party Make", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/b3017524383399a89cf73564570221deb26b53db.png?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/123350/superficiality-republican-commitment-racial-justice", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Look no further than the governor's race in Kentucky.", "title": "A Black Figurehead Does Not a Tolerant Political Party Make", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/b3017524383399a89cf73564570221deb26b53db.png?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/b3017524383399a89cf73564570221deb26b53db.png\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Superficiality of the Republican Commitment to Racial Justice\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/123350/superficiality-republican-commitment-racial-justice\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-04T17:33:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":123350,\"author\":\"Brian Beutler\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"Kentucky\",\"Mitch McConnell\",\"Matt Bevin\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Obamacare\",\"Medicaid Expansion\",\"Medicaid\",\"Jonah Goldberg\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-11-04"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe11cc\"", "article_summary": "Beneficiaries of the Medicaid expansion there are whiter and more geographically dispersed than in other states.\nAnd that says far more about the racial politics of their movement than the fact that Kentucky\u2019s incoming lieutenant governor is black herself.\nWhat distinguishes Kentucky is that its Medicaid expansion was undertaken unilaterally by outgoing Governor Steve Beshear.\nThat Carson is black and popular among Republican primary voters is incontrovertible.\nWell, to Hell with that game.\u201dThis would fatally undermine the liberal critique of racial politics on the right, if liberals argued that Republicans belonged to a segregated party that espoused hatred for minorities no matter their politics."}
