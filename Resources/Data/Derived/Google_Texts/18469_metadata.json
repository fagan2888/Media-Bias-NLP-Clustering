(Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe words \u201cwoman\u201d or \u201cwomen\u201d appear 11 times in the seven-paragraph biography on the campaign Web site of congressional hopeful Kathleen Matthews.\n\nWomen for Jamie, a group formed by state Sen. and fellow candidate Jamie Raskin, boasts more than 550 members, including Cecilia \u201cCissy\u201d Suyat, wife of the late Thurgood Marshall, and state Senate colleagues Susan C. Lee and Karen S. Montgomery.\n\nThe seven Democratic candidates for Maryland\u2019s 8th District seat know that women \u2014 especially those over 50 \u2014 are critical to their success in April\u2019s primary.\n\nMore than 80 percent of Democrats in the district live in Montgomery County, where women accounted for 60 percent of Democratic primary voters in each of the past two presidential election years. The county has 17,000 \u201cultra Dems\u201d \u2014 those who turned out for each of the past five Maryland primaries. Of them, 59 percent are women.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic candidates have a choice. They can connect with women in the 50s-to-70s age groups on issues they care about. Or they can lose,\u201d said Maryland Democratic consultant Adam Pagnucco.\n\nHe said the average age of women \u2014 and men \u2014 who voted in both the 2008 and 2012 Democratic primaries in the county was 63. Like women elsewhere in the state and across the county, they turn out at the polls in greater numbers than men. They also live longer, which extends their influence at the ballot box.\n\nMany of these reliable female voters are retired or are winding down careers in which they confronted glass ceilings and other workplace challenges. They care about pay equity, abortion rights and paid family leave. They worry about their children or grandchildren running up debt to pay for higher education.\n\n[Kathleen Matthews gets a spot on Emily\u2019s List]\n\nThat\u2019s why candidate Kumar Barve, a state delegate, mentions his work in the late 1980s as treasurer for the Maryland chapter of the abortion-rights group NARAL and his endorsement by Del. Anne R. Kaiser, a leader in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nAnd why former President Obama aide Will Jawando tells groups about his mother, who discovered after many years that she earned less than her male counterparts at a Silver Spring publishing company. In the White House, Jawando helped coordinate women\u2019s and civil rights groups to support passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which strengthens protections against workplace discrimination.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Matthews, Raskin, Barve, Jawando and the other Democratic 8th District contenders \u2014 Del. Ana Sol Gutierrez, David Anderson and Joel Rubin \u2014 will have a chance to make their case to women directly at a Bethesda forum sponsored by the Women\u2019s Democratic Club of Montgomery County.\n\n[Scrutiny over where money is coming from in Md. congressional race]\n\nBonnie Wicklund, 72, a retired librarian and ultra Dem from Chevy Chase, said she is undecided on the race and is likely to attend Tuesday\u2019s forum. She is looking for \u201csomeone who is moderate, not an ideologue; has legislative experience; and will protect women\u2019s health choices.\u201d She said she wants Congress to find a way to address gun violence, although she is not optimistic that will happen.\n\nAlthough Wicklund would like to see more women elected to national office, she said that won\u2019t drive her decision. \u201cIssues are more important to me than gender in this particular race,\u201d she said.\n\nOthers see increasing the number of women in elected office as more of an imperative. Jane de Winter, 56, executive director of Big Learning, a nonprofit Silver Spring education program, supported former Montgomery County Council member Valerie Ervin for the congressional seat before she dropped out of the race.\n\nDe Winter said she knows little about Matthews, who had raised more money as of Sept. 30 than any other candidate. \u201cBut I feel obligated to look at her because women are underrepresented in Congress,\u201d de Winter said.\n\n[Valerie Ervin, citing money problems, exits 8th District race]\n\nSome Montgomery political observers say that Matthews will benefit from the presence of two women at the top of the 2016 Democratic primary ballot: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Donna Edwards, who is running for the U.S. Senate nomination against Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the 8th District incumbent.\n\n\u201cHillary is going to get a lot of women out to vote in the primary, and that will accrue to Donna and Kathleen\u2019s benefit,\u201d said Montgomery\u2019s former county executive, Doug Duncan.\n\nBut that scenario depends in part on whether Clinton is in a heated race for the presidential nomination by the time the April 26 primary rolls around.\n\nThere are few substantive differences among the contenders on issues that resonate with older women. More important will be the candidates\u2019 ability to convince female voters that they can be the most effective advocates for their positions.\n\nMatthews, 62, a former Marriott executive and news anchor for WJLA (Channel 7), will use her robust campaign account to reach women and try to show them that her story \u2014 one of juggling career and kids \u2014 is their story.\n\nIn campaign ads, she calls Democrats the party that \u201cstands up for working women.\u201d She touts her support for requiring employers to pay for contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act, even if they have religious objections.\n\nRaskin, 52, mixes policy with personal stories of the women in his life, including his wife, Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin.\n\nAt the \u201cWomen for Jamie\u201d kickoff event in late September, he paid tribute to his late mother, the feminist writer Barbara Raskin, whose best-selling novel, \u201cHot Flashes,\u201d chronicled three middle-aged women taking stock of their lives after a friend\u2019s death.\n\nRaskin will position himself as a women\u2019s advocate with a legislative track record that includes major roles in the passage of marriage-equality legislation and the state\u2019s version of the Ledbetter Act.\n\nSol Gutierrez, 73, is the only Hispanic in the race and the only woman besides Matthews. She said she will frame her appeal around immigration, with a focus on the estimated 28,000 Latino residents in District 8, which stretches into parts of Frederick and Carroll counties to the Pennsylvania border.\n\n\u201cTrump has woken us up,\u201d she said.\n\nSol Gutierrez said she will also be trying to reach women at the senior end of the group, some of the most reliable voters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such a huge emphasis on youth and the millennials and the young culture,\u201d Sol Gutierrez said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to say this is our future, but it does not focus on what the needs of our seniors are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A consultant warns: \u201cThey can connect with women in the 50s-to-70s age groups. ...
