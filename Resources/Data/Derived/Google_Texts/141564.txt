She had her radio, hat, belt and badge. But all she really needed was a set of jump ropes and childhood nostalgia to do her job.

Metropolitan Police Department Officer Kandice Young decided to fling herself into the action by showing off her Double Dutch skills while visiting residents on Congress Street, Southeast.

The video was posted to the police department's Facebook page Friday.

She jumped into the double ropes, flipped around in the middle, and managed to keep up with the rope speed while wearing all her police gear.

She even tried the complex move of jumping while touching the sidewalk.

When Young was sworn in as a police officer in September 2013, she was a Physical Skills Award winner.
