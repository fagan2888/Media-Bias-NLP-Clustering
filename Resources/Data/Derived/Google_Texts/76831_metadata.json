The sign displays a number viewers can text to get more information.\n\nThe billboard comes on the heels of a tea party rally targeting Obamacare Tuesday afternoon that drew hundreds of protesters to the West Lawn of the Capitol.\n\nHeritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, who recently completed a two-week \u201cStop Obamacare\u201d tour in nine cities, said the billboard is intended to publicly emphasize the message that Americans oppose the law. \u201cPeople are losing their current coverage, they\u2019re losing access to treatments that have helped them, they\u2019re losing access to their long-time doctors, and their premiums are set to go through the roof,\u201d he said in a written statement.\n\n\u201cObamacare is becoming less popular \u2026 because it\u2019s beginning to bite,\u201d said Michael Gonzalez, vice president of communications at the Heritage, a conservative think tank.\n\n\u201cWe want the billboard to get people thinking, to raise awareness,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cWe expect the message to resonate with New Yorkers and visitors across the country. \u2026 Times Square is a mecca for people not just from the five boroughs, but from all 50 states.\u201d\n\nThe billboard, which is posted between 7th and 8th Avenues for the next month, was slated to go up Monday evening but encountered technical delays. Heritage declined to say what it paid for the space.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Brightly lit Times Square displays singing the praises of \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d find themselves with an unusual new companion this week, as the Heritage Foundation unveiled a billboard blasting Obamacare on 42nd Street.", "title": "Heritage Unveils Anti-Obamacare Billboard in Big Apple", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/09/11/heritage-unveils-anti-obamacare-billboard-in-big-apple/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YW361_0911bo_G_20130911134029.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Heritage Unveils Anti-Obamacare Billboard in Big Apple", "description": "Brightly lit Times Square displays singing the praises of \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d find themselves with an unusual new companion this week, as the Heritage Foundation unveiled a billboard blasting Obamacare on 42nd Street.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Rebecca Ballhaus", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Brightly lit Times Square displays singing the praises of \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d find themselves with an unusual new companion this week, as the Heritage Foundation unveiled a billboard blasting Obamacare on 42nd Street.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2013-09-11T18:15:14-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/09/11/heritage-unveils-anti-obamacare-billboard-in-big-apple/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-40308", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Brightly lit Times Square displays singing the praises of \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d find themselves with an unusual new companion this week, as the Heritage Foundation unveiled a billboard blasting Obamacare on 42nd Street.", "title": "Heritage Unveils Anti-Obamacare Billboard in Big Apple", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/09/11/heritage-unveils-anti-obamacare-billboard-in-big-apple/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YW361_0911bo_G_20130911134029.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-40308", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-11T19:25:21-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7f3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPeople are losing their current coverage, they\u2019re losing access to treatments that have helped them, they\u2019re losing access to their long-time doctors, and their premiums are set to go through the roof,\u201d he said in a written statement.\nAdrian Fussell for the Wall Street Journal A billboard paid for by The Heritage Foundation on 42nd Street in Manhattan attacking \u201cObamacare,\u201d pictured on September 11, 2013.\nBrightly lit Times Square displays singing the praises of \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d find themselves with an unusual new companion this week, as the Heritage Foundation unveiled a billboard blasting Obamacare on 42nd Street.\nThe 90-foot-high, 67-foot-long billboard reads, \u201cWARNING: Obamacare may be hazardous to your health,\u201d and encourages viewers to support defunding the health-care law.\nHeritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, who recently completed a two-week \u201cStop Obamacare\u201d tour in nine cities, said the billboard is intended to publicly emphasize the message that Americans oppose the law."}
