OK, OK, it’s kind of like comparing apples to oranges, but this graphic gave us pause.

In all fairness to the enrollment debacle plaguing the President’s healthcare program, the numbers here are a bit twisted. They compare two weeks of enrollment in Obamacare to 19 weeks of sign-up for the one-way trip to Mars. And, the data collected for Obamacare enrollment is significantly more detailed than what is asked by the Mars One people.

Additionally, Mars One is not promising to take care of everyone who wants to visit the red planet.” On the contrary, while Obamacare is hoping to cover almost every single person who wants medical insurance, Mars One is selecting only six teams of four people for training. So, we’re talking 24 people in the first group versus the estimated 25-30 million people currently not covered by health insurance in America.

The selection process for the first Mars mission in 2013 is closed. Teams will be notified soon and begin training. There will be annual open enrollments, selections, and training for future Mars missions leading up to the 2013 inaugural flight.

Obamacare’s open enrollment continues for another five months.
