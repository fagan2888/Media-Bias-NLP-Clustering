The spending \u2014 first reported by the Associated Press \u2014 is expected to continue through the first week of September. A smaller campaign is also airing in Pennsylvania, AP reported.\n\nFrom the AP story: \u201cFilled with children, workers and people of different ethnicities, the ads promote Republicans as interested in creating jobs, improving access to education and caring for the middle class. Many of the 30-second spots end with rays of sunlight peeking out from clouds as an upbeat female narrator says, \u201cThere are people who still believe opportunity lives in America, and we call ourselves Republicans.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the group\u2019s ads.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear who is paying for the TV campaign. The organization sponsoring the 30-second TV spots lists its editor as John Hart, a former operative for Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, a Republican. The FCC documents also list the Center for American Opportunity, a conservative group, as a sponsor. But Hart told the AP that his organization separated from the group in recent months.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Center for American Opportunity,Colorado,Opportunity News Media,Republicans,TV ads", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Opportunity News Media is airing a series of TV ads touting Republicans in Colorado, but it's still unclear who is paying for the GOP charm offensive.", "title": "Opportunity News Media airs GOP TV ads in Colorado", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/08/17/opportunity-news-media-republican-tv-ads-colorado-ohio/122612/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Opportunity News Media is airing a series of TV ads touting Republicans in Colorado, but it's still unclear who is paying for the GOP charm offensive.", "title": "Republican charm offensive appears on Colorado airwaves", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/08/17/opportunity-news-media-republican-tv-ads-colorado-ohio/122612/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@ByJohnFrank", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Opportunity News Media is airing a series of TV ads touting Republicans in Colorado, but it's still unclear who is paying for the GOP charm offensive."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd934e\"", "article_summary": "Opportunity News Media is the organization behind the $3 million TV campaign in Colorado and Ohio, according to FCC records.\nA series of TV ads touting Republicans are airing in Colorado but it\u2019s still unclear who is pushing the GOP charm offensive.\nIt\u2019s not clear who is paying for the TV campaign.\nThe organization sponsoring the 30-second TV spots lists its editor as John Hart, a former operative for Oklahoma Sen.
