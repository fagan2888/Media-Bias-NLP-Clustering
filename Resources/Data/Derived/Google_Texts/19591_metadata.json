(Photo: ~File photo)\n\nA 56-year-old man from the Skillman section of Montgomery has been indicted on federal wire fraud charges for allegedly soliciting $1.5 million from 16 investors based on fake financial records.\n\nU.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman said Rostyslaw Mykytyn was indicted on June 19 on five counts of wire fraud. He was scheduled to make his initial appearance Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge James B. Clark III here.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Mykytyn was the owner, president and chief executive officer of RGM Management Co., doing business as Campbell Co. Inc. in Washington State.\n\nThe company provided sales representative services to a company that manufactured and distributed power and cooling infrastructures for large computer spaces. Mykytyn allegedly solicited various investors for Campbell based upon false and fraudulent financial statements.\n\nHe allegedly created fake commission statements from a client that showed sales of more than $4 million, of which Campbell was due $472,720, to make the company's income appear greater than it was.\n\nMykytyn also allegedly falsely represented Campbell's assets to investors who, based on those representations, wire transferred $1.5 million into the company. Mykytyn allegedly would then divert a portion of the investment to himself to pay for his personal expenses, without disclosing the diversion to his investors.\n\nIf convicted, each count of wire fraud carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1Lstm3d", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A 56-year-old man from the Skillman section of Montgomery has been indicted on federal wire fraud charges for allegedly soliciting $1.5 million from 16 investors based on fake financial records.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "A 56-year-old man from the Skillman section of Montgomery has been indicted on federal wire fraud charges for allegedly soliciting $1.5 million from 16 investors based on fake financial records.", "title": "Somerset man accused of wire fraud", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/somerset-county/2015/06/23/somerset-man-accused-wire-fraud-charges/29183289/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 56-year-old man from the Skillman section of Montgomery has been indicted on federal wire fraud charges for allegedly soliciting $1.5 million from 16 investors based on fake financial records.", "title": "Somerset man accused of wire fraud", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b127ef6bdeca0a7997ada31f1919c35b81de662/c=354-0-1769-1415&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/23/Bridgewater/B9317837012Z.1_20150623175929_000_GGEB5N1IR.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Rostyslaw Mykytyn, Montgomery, wire fraud, investors, indictment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe023a\"", "article_summary": "If convicted, each count of wire fraud carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.\nU.S. Attorney Paul J.
