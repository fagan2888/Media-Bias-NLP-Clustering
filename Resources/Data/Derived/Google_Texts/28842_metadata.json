The law, which would exempt drinks including milk and 100 percent fruit juices, targets beverages with added sugar, marking the most significant federal response since the 2009 proposal to link a similar tax to the Affordable Care Act\n\n\u201cNAMA is strongly opposed to any excise taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, especially at the federal level,\u201d said Eric Dell, NAMA\u2019s Senior Vice President of Government Affairs. \u201cTaxes of any kind on sugar-sweetened beverages unfairly target industries that have worked to be part of the solution surrounding nutritional education and healthy choices. It will also create new liabilities for vending and food service companies, which could result in loss of critical jobs and taxable revenue, and will drive up food and beverage costs,\u201d Dell continued.\n\nNAMA also maintains that taxes on beverages are an ineffective way to encourage healthy lifestyles or combat obesity among consumers.\n\n\u201cIn fact, according to government data, sugar-sweetened beverages account for less than seven percent of calories in the average American diet. A federal tax of this nature is a classic example of the kind of government overreach that completely dismisses the role of consumer choice and responsibility,\u201d Dell said. \u201cFurthermore this tax increase will have a disproportionate impact on those who can least afford to pay the higher costs. Middle and lower income citizens who spend a higher percentage of their incomes on foods and beverages will be hardest hit.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, NAMA will continue its mission to educate consumers on healthy choices through its' nationally-recognized \u201cFit Pick\u201d program, and to support efforts including the American Beverage Association\u2019s \u201cCalories Count\u201d Beverage Vending Program.\n\nFounded in 1936, NAMA is the association representing the $42 billion U.S. vending and refreshment service industry. With more than 1800 member companies \u2013 including many of the world\u2019s most recognized brands \u2013 NAMA provides advocacy, education and research for its membership.
