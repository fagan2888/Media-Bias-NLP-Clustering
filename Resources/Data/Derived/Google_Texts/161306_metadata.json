In particular, that list includes Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and John Kasich, who has been quietly building up support in the state for months after having been the first candidate to begin running ads in the state. Despite coming in a statistical tie for last in Iowa among candidates who people still remember are running (sorry, Rick Santorum and Jim Gilmore), Kasich currently sits in third place in the Huffington Post\u2019s polling average for New Hampshire.\n\nKasich is perceived as being in a good position to do well in New Hampshire because he has placed himself squarely in the \u201cmoderate lane\u201d of the Republican race. New Hampshire Republicans are cool and dispassionate and swing-y, you see. They aren\u2019t like those hard-line Evangelicals and immigration hawks in Iowa; they want a candidate who is pragmatic and even-keeled and can Get Things Done\u2122 in the White House. Kasich\u2019s put all of his chips down on New Hampshire because he thinks he can make the case that that sounds like him.\n\nAfter all, don\u2019t you know that he expanded Medicaid under Obamacare? Because Jesus? Haven\u2019t you heard him say in the debates that we need to elect a uniter? Someone who can make sure that we all get along? Isn\u2019t that why the Boston Herald and the New York Times endorsed him?\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Aside from the Medicaid expansion and his folksy demeanor, there really isn\u2019t much separating John Kasich from the rest of the Republican field. Which is to say, setting aside one ideological heresy, John Kasich is no moderate. Having lived in Ohio while he was governor, I know him as a union-busting, voting rights-denying, reproductive rights-restricting fracking enthusiast. The suggestion that he\u2019s anything else is one of my biggest political pet peeves.\n\nSo.\n\nStarting today, running through the New Hampshire primary, AMERICAblog will be running a series of posts reviewing John Kasich\u2019s rhetoric and record. Taking one issue at a time, we\u2019re going to review what Ohio\u2019s governor has said and done, showing that, yes, he really does fit right in with the hardliners in today\u2019s Republican Party.\n\nIt\u2019s going to look a bit like this post James Neimeister wrote last year, but fleshed out.\n\nStay tuned.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "2016, Elections, john kasich", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "AMERICAblog News", "description": "Announcing our coverage of John Kasich's extremism in the run-up to New Hampshire.", "title": "John Kasich isn't a moderate - AMERICAblog News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/k3.jpg", "height": 700}, "updated_time": "2016-02-02T10:15:18-04:00", "url": "http://americablog.com/2016/02/john-kasich-isnt-a-moderate.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Announcing our coverage of John Kasich's extremism in the run-up to New Hampshire.", "creator": "@_Jon_Green", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/k3.jpg", "title": "John Kasich isn't a moderate - AMERICAblog News", "site": "@americablog", "card": "summary"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "6a65cadbb06b6a8cd2795a412c36d6b4"}, "fb": {"admins": 504024627}, "google-site-verification": "LrdwJVMR_suty6YsOZ4xc1Hv3-F8Ms0Wo-VhCAoXm_U", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AMERICAblog", "section": "Elections", "tag": "john kasich", "published_time": "2016-02-02T10:08:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T10:15:18-04:00"}}, "article_summary": "Which is to say, setting aside one ideological heresy, John Kasich is no moderate.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Aside from the Medicaid expansion and his folksy demeanor, there really isn\u2019t much separating John Kasich from the rest of the Republican field.\nIn particular, that list includes Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and John Kasich, who has been quietly building up support in the state for months after having been the first candidate to begin running ads in the state.\nStarting today, running through the New Hampshire primary, AMERICAblog will be running a series of posts reviewing John Kasich\u2019s rhetoric and record.\nKasich is perceived as being in a good position to do well in New Hampshire because he has placed himself squarely in the \u201cmoderate lane\u201d of the Republican race."}
