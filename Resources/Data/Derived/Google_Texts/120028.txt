Third-party administrator Broadspire Services Inc. is launching a suite of integrated disability and absence management services this fall for employers looking to outsource their leave management.

Integrated Disability and Absence Management Services, which includes short- and long-term disability and federal and state leave management, is expected to help employers lower costs and enhance employee productivity, the Atlanta-based Crawford & Co. unit said in a statement Monday.

An aging workforce that could mean more absences, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and complying with regulations are driving the demand for integrated programs such as Broadspire's, according to the statement.

The program can help employers looking to outsource processes as they deal with “ever-increasing regulatory and administrative burdens and costs,” said Broadspire CEO Danielle Lisenbey.

Broadspire will partner with firms — such as South Portland, Maine-based ClaimVantage, which provides automated claims processing to absence, disability and life markets — that can “complement and enhance its total absence offering,” according to the release. The new services will be in addition to Broadspire's existing medical and risk management, workers compensation and liability services.
