After 40 years, the priest is seeing a decrease in attendance in one of his churches, especially in the younger generation.\n\n\"The population of the Marion Church is decreasing as a whole. We only have perhaps maybe nine children, all very young, and so we don't worry about or think about religious education,\" Father Hal Barber said.\n\nReligious orders are leaving the Diocese of Sioux Falls to deal with declining numbers of vocations and increased retirements. This puts a strain on the priests currently leading worship.\n\n\"Some of our guys do travel a lot of miles between parishes. They're very willing and I think they're very giving of themselves in doing that by you can only ask the guys to do so much,\" Diocese of Sioux Falls Communication Director Jerry Klein said.\n\nThe diocese does have a plan in place to counteract the trend; some parishes will be merged, but none will close.\n\n\"It may remain so that funerals for example or marriages can continue to happen there, but they may not have a regular weekend liturgy,\" Klein said.\n\nWhile the numbers have decreased, Barber is confident the church will bounce back because of strong leadership at the top.\n\n\"Our universal leader, the Pope Francis, I think is a very good and wonderful leader and is giving us a good example, and the church needs that,\" Barber said.\n\nThe Diocese of Sioux Falls expects some of the plans to be in effect next July. They are trying to assure the health of their priests without affecting the integrity of rural churches.\n\nAccording to the Diocese of Sioux Falls, there's been more than 100 churches that have closed their doors in it's 125 year history.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "As populations in KELOLAND shift from rural areas to urban centers, the number of people attending rural churches are decreasing.
