The federal government projects that per capita spending on health care will rise 4.9 percent a year nationally through 2024.\n\nIn Massachusetts, the growth in costs had slowed over the past few years but recently has begun to accelerate. Last month, state regulators approved an average health premium increase of more than 6 percent next year for small business and individual policies, triple the increase of 2014.\n\nThe new state report shows that last year\u2019s spending increase was concentrated in the state\u2019s Medicaid program, known as MassHealth, where spending surged 19 percent after rising less than 5 percent in 2013. MassHealth, funded by taxpayers, provides insurance to 1.8 million low-income residents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act extended the program to cover a bigger share of the population, but MassHealth numbers also ballooned in 2014 when the state\u2019s online insurance exchange crashed. About 300,000 were placed in the program temporarily, regardless of their income, as state officials sorted out problems with the exchange, called the Health Connector, according to the state report.\n\nAlso, the state in 2014 stopped checking whether members of MassHealth were eligible for the program, a process known as redetermination.\n\n\u201cIt is tremendously concerning that we pay for so much health care for people who are turning out to not be eligible for the program,\u201d said Joshua Archambault, a senior fellow on health care policy at the Pioneer Institute, a Boston think tank.\n\nGovernor Charlie Baker\u2019s administration has resumed the redetermination process this year and so far has removed 205,000 people who were not eligible for MassHealth, saving about $250 million. The state budget limits MassHealth spending growth to 6 percent this year, said Billy Pitman, a Baker spokesman.\n\n\u201cGovernor Baker is addressing the inherited problems at the Health Connector and continues to implement the redetermination process, ensuring the long-term sustainability of MassHealth to provide care for the Commonwealth\u2019s most vulnerable,\u201d Pitman said.\n\nAnalysts said they don\u2019t know whether the spike in MassHealth spending was a blip or the beginning of a trend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to dig deeper,\u201d said Stuart Altman, chairman of the Health Policy Commission, the state agency that monitors costs.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the result of a temporary growth in enrollment, if it\u2019s the result of more structural issues \u2014 at this point, we just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nOverall health spending jumped to $54 billion statewide in 2014, from $51.3 billion a year earlier.\n\nFor Massachusetts residents on Medicare, the government health insurance program for seniors, spending rose 2 percent. For those in commercial health plans, which cover the majority of residents, spending grew 2.9 percent.\n\nBut beneath those modest increases is a concerning trend: Spending on drugs increased 13 percent.\n\n\u201cThere are preliminary indications that costs are growing,\u201d Altman said. \u201cThere are new drugs coming on the market that are very expensive, and new technologies. There are a number of factors that generate higher spending.\u201d\n\nThe report also found that more people are enrolling in high-deductible health plans, which have lower premiums but require members to pay as much as thousands more dollars out of pocketwhen they use medical services.\n\nNineteen percent of Massachusetts residents with commercial insurance were enrolled in high-deductible plans last year, compared with 14 percent in 2012. Such plans can put a greater burden of health care costs on consumers.\n\n\u201cThere is growing concern about the size of people\u2019s financial exposure with high-deductible plans,\u201d said John E. McDonough, a professor at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cClearly, it discourages people from getting unnecessary care. It also discourages people from getting necessary care.\u201d\n\nIn another shift, the report showed insurers continue to adopt alternative payment models, which are designed to give health care providers incentives to keep people healthy and out of hospitals \u2014 and ultimately contain costs.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.108041335", "eomportal-id": 499662, "description": "The soaring costs of insuring the state\u2019s poorest residents drove health care spending in Massachusetts up nearly 5 percent last year.", "eomportal-instanceid": 29, "og": {"site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "The soaring costs of insuring the state\u2019s poorest residents drove health care spending in Massachusetts up nearly 5 percent last year.", "title": "Mass. health spending, led by soaring Medicaid costs, jumps in 2014 - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/09/01/healthcosts/W470z61YbrKIhrS7xuDyVI/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/images/logo-bg-small-square.jpg", "longitude": "-71.38243740000001", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.4072107", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "health spending,health care,masshealth,medicaid,massachusetts,charlie baker,health insurance, Stuart Altman,Twitter", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 00:05:51 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "health spending,health care,masshealth,medicaid,massachusetts,charlie baker,health insurance, Stuart Altman,Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "1c044e60-5126-11e5-980e-ff155d7b9556"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a87\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt is terribly disappointing for all of us who have been working on health care cost control,\u201d said Brian Rosman, research director of Health Care For All, a consumer advocacy group.\nThe federal government projects that per capita spending on health care will rise 4.9 percent a year nationally through 2024.\nSuch plans can put a greater burden of health care costs on consumers.\nAnalysts said they don\u2019t know whether the spike in MassHealth spending was a blip or the beginning of a trend.\nThe state budget limits MassHealth spending growth to 6 percent this year, said Billy Pitman, a Baker spokesman."}
