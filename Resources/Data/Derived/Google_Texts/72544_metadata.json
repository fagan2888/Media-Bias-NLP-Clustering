She said the month without medication made it hard to get out of bed.\n\nPaying for drugs isn\u2019t a problem for Hill now: She has a more robust Covered California health plan, and she gets assistance from a drug company program.\n\nAnd as of the first of this year, she won\u2019t have to worry about sticker shock if she switches medications. All Covered California plans have a cap on how much patients pay for drugs: $250 a month in silver, gold and platinum plans, and $500 a month in bronze plans.\n\n\u201cI could try a better treatment,\u201d said Hill, a patient advocate, who says she is exploring that because her symptoms are becoming more severe. \u201cThe $250 is something I know that I can always fall back on.\u201d\n\nThe copay cap on drugs is just one way Covered California chose to shape the health insurance marketplace this year. Experts say the California exchange uses more of its powers as an \u201cactive purchaser\u201d than the vast majority of other states. That means it can decide which insurers can join the exchange, what plans and benefits are available and at what price.\n\nThe federal government \u2014 in pending proposed rules for 2017 \u2014 has signaled it too wants to have more of a hand in crafting plans. Though there are no plans to go as far as a monthly drug copay cap, healthcare.gov would be forging ahead on a path California already paved, swapping variety for simplicity in plan design.\n\n\u201cNot letting [health] plans define what\u2019s right for consumers, but defining it on behalf of consumers \u2026 is a better model for the market,\u201d said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure every consumer has good choice but not infinite choice,\u201d said Lee.\n\nMost other states, including those in the federal exchange, haven\u2019t subscribed to that idea so far. They have a clearinghouse model, in which all health insurers and plan designs are accepted as long they comply with the Affordable Care Act. That can mean the same insurer offers multiple plans with slightly different premiums, deductibles and copays. Even within one metal tier, say silver, the same insurer might offer half a dozen slightly different plans. (Obamacare plans come in four tiers, from bronze, with the most limited benefits, to platinum, with the most.)\n\nNow, the federal government proposes to create standard cost-sharing designs in various metal tiers and make them easily accessible on healthcare.gov. And it\u2019s considering how to improve \u201cvalue\u201d by being more selective about plans.\n\nA simplified marketplace, the feds say, will make it easier to choose high-quality health insurance.\n\n\u201cMany consumers \u2026 find the large variety of cost-sharing structures available on the Exchanges difficult to navigate,\u201d the proposed rules say. \u201cWe believe that standardized options will provide these consumers the opportunity to make simpler comparisons.\u201d\n\nThe proposal signals a big change.\n\n\u201cUp until now the federal marketplace has really taken a hands-off approach\u201d in shaping the marketplace, said Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\n\n\u201cThe new proposed rule says \u2018You know what? We actually are going to become more of an active purchaser.\u2019\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Approach\n\nCovered California holds insurers to a higher bar than what\u2019s required under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt negotiates premium prices down and requires quality goals to be met. Health plans must participate in health-disparity workgroups, collect information about enrollees\u2019 health status and monitor rates of preventive health services use. In the first two years, California\u2019s exchange rejected multiple health insurance carriers.\n\nCovered California says it\u2019s the only exchange in the country that requires all plans to be standardized (not just some, which the federal government is proposing). All gold tier plans, for instance, have the same costs for lab tests, doctors\u2019 visits and deductibles.\n\n\u201cThere was always a suspicion like \u2018Oh, is that plan $80 more a month because it covers more?\u2019\u201d said Anthony Wright, of the advocacy group, Health Access. \u201cAnd it was almost impossible to know. Whereas now people know \u2018Okay, these are basically the same plans.\u2019\u201d\n\nPrice negotiations with insurers have paid off, according to Covered California. During 2016 plan year negotiations, insurers reduced premiums by 1 percent to 9 percent, said Lee. The exchange says this will result in $200 million in savings for premium payers and taxpayers this year.\n\nCovered California average premium increases have been on par with the increases in other states, according to the private health care consulting firm, Avalere Health. It says this year\u2019s 4% overall average increase was particularly low in comparison.\n\nBut national researchers say the downward pressure on premiums may be more indicative of competition than the exchange\u2019s negotiating power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual to have four big insurers jockeying for market share like we have in many parts of California,\u201d said Larry Levitt, Senior Vice President at the Kaiser Family Foundation. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nAn Industry \u201cPartner\u201d?\n\nHealth insurers in California acknowledge there\u2019s more red tape if they sell in the subsidized marketplace there, but surprisingly, they don\u2019t complain.\n\nIn fact, a California insurance trade group says it sees the exchange as a \u201cpartner,\u201d and active purchasing as valuable for establishing ground rules.\n\n\u201cSo far in California, it has worked,\u201d said Charles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans.\n\nThe rules allowed new plans to get into the individual market, he says, and provided \u201cmore security in knowing what the playing field was.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Bacchi said, health plans don\u2019t always agree with the exchange\u2019s decisions.\n\n\u201cThere is give and take,\u201d he said.\n\nBlue Shield of California, which in 2015 had 25 percent of the exchange\u2019s enrollment, says it\u2019s very happy with its relationship with Covered California.\n\nApplying to sell through Covered California creates \u201cdifferent work\u201d than was required before, said Ken Wood, Senior Vice President of Consumer Markets at Blue Shield of California, adding that he applauds its approach. But the business is worth it, he said. Covered California gives insurers access to more than a million consumers, whose monthly premiums are largely subsidized by government.\n\nAnd \u201cthe standard benefits is an enormous simplification for consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nBut one of two health insurance regulators in California, the state Department of Insurance, said Covered California\u2019s strict guidelines may not benefit consumers.\n\nIt has created a situation in which the exchange \u201chas fewer carriers than would otherwise be the case,\u201d said Janice Rocco, deputy commissioner of the California Department of Insurance.\n\nMore insurers in the marketplace for the first two years would have had an impact on price in the long term, said Rocco.\n\nClosely Watching California\n\nFederal administrators may be trying to adopt active purchasing rules before the new presidential administration takes office, said Corlette, and California\u2019s example may make it more politically feasible.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the feds are closely watching the California experience,\u201d said Corlette, commenting on Covered California\u2019s ability to keep insurers in the marketplace and hold down premiums.\n\nThe federal rules also name other active purchasing exchanges as models however, including New York, Massachusetts and other state-based exchanges.\n\nHealth insurers on a national level are \u201cstrongly\u201d opposed to an active purchaser model for states served by healthcare.gov, including standardized benefits.\n\n\u201cIt could discourage many from enrolling if they can\u2019t find a policy that works best for them,\u201d said Clare Krusing from America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans.\n\n\u201cWhere there is competition and choice is where consumers benefit and where health plans benefit,\u201d said Krusing.\n\nResearchers raise other logistical and market concerns. Caroline Pearson, senior vice president of Avalere Health, said the risk of losing insurers under active purchasing is \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now the federal government needs to focus on increasing enrollment and maintaining plan participation,\u201d said Pearson.\n\nStreamlining benefits like medical service copays could get tricky when spanning across more than 30 states with different economies, said Corlette.\n\nWhat Consumers Say\n\nNot all of Covered California\u2019s actions have been met with applause. Consumer advocates say they\u2019re still concerned about the high deductible in Covered California\u2019s Bronze plans, an amount the exchange chose to raise for 2016 plans. But at the same time, advocates appreciate that policy decisions aren\u2019t being made in the \u201cback room of an insurance company.\u201d\n\n\u201cCovered California has put itself apart from other states in that it is willing to be aggressive and do what\u2019s right,\u201d said arthritis patient and advocate Charis Hill.\n\nShe said she\u2019s glad Covered California reminds insurance companies that they exist to serve patients: \u201cIf they\u2019re not doing their job, then somebody\u2019s going to step in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "When 28-year-old Charis Hill found out the medication to treat her degenerative arthritis condition would cost $2,000 a month, she chose to be in pain", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/will-healthcaregov-get-california-makeover", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201410/Healthcare.gov_2015_homepage.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "When 28-year-old Charis Hill found out the medication to treat her degenerative arthritis condition would cost $2,000 a month, she chose to be in pain", "title": "Will HealthCare.gov Get A California Makeover?"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Pauline Bartolone of Kaiser Health News", "wordCount": 1615, "dc": {"title": "Will HealthCare.gov Get A California Makeover?"}, "nid": 13571, "datePublished": "2016-02-09", "story_id": 466123491, "keywords": "HealthCare.gov", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSo far in California, it has worked,\u201d said Charles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans.\nBlue Shield of California, which in 2015 had 25 percent of the exchange\u2019s enrollment, says it\u2019s very happy with its relationship with Covered California.\nExperts say the California exchange uses more of its powers as an \u201cactive purchaser\u201d than the vast majority of other states.\nPaying for drugs isn\u2019t a problem for Hill now: She has a more robust Covered California health plan, and she gets assistance from a drug company program.\nHealth insurers on a national level are \u201cstrongly\u201d opposed to an active purchaser model for states served by healthcare.gov, including standardized benefits."}
