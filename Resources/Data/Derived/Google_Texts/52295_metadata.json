Trained in the enemy\u2019s language and endowed with a facility for words, she became a key contributor to a wartime project that remained classified for decades.\n\nBut by the time of her death on Nov. 12 at 92, Mrs. Batey was regarded in England as a national heroine. Working with Alfred Dillwyn \u201cDilly\u201d Knox and other celebrated code breakers, she learned to decipher what she called the \u201cutter gibberish\u201d of encrypted German communications.\n\nLike many of her colleagues, Mrs. Batey worked on a \u201cneed-to-know\u201d basis and did not understand at the time the significance of her efforts. In recent years, with the release of British wartime records, it was revealed that her code-breaking helped the Allies cripple the Italian navy in 1941 and assisted the 1944 Normandy invasion.\n\nWinston Churchill, Britain\u2019s wartime prime minister, was said to have called the Bletchley Park code breakers his \u201cgeese that laid the golden eggs but never cackled.\u201d Fueled by what Mrs. Batey described as \u201cersatz coffee,\u201d they toiled in secrecy to decipher the encoded messages spat out by the Axis powers\u2019 Enigma machines.\n\nMrs. Batey recalled reporting for duty at Bletchley Park, a Victorian estate about 50 miles north of London, and being \u201cthrown in at the deep end.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one knew how the blessed thing worked,\u201d she once told an interviewer, referring to the Enigma, a machine that resembled a typewriter and scrambled messages with confounding complexity.\n\nKnox, by her description, was an \u201ceccentric genius\u201d so consumed by his work that he on at least one occasion stuffed his pipe with bits of sandwich rather than smoking tobacco.\n\n\u201cHe would ask, \u2018Which way does the clock go round?\u2019 \u201d Mrs. Batey recalled in an interview with the Daily Telegraph. \u201cIf you were stupid enough to answer \u2018clockwise,\u2019 he would always answer, \u2018not if you\u2019re the clock!\u2019 That summed it up: You had to be prepared to think in a different way.\u201d\n\nMrs. Batey\u2019s first major contribution came in March 1941, when she helped decipher Italian naval communications revealing an impending attack on British ships ferrying supplies from Egypt to Greece. One message declared the arrival of \u201cday X minus 3.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy they had to say that I can\u2019t imagine,\u201d Mrs. Batey later said, according to the Telegraph. \u201cIt seems rather daft, but they did.\u201d\n\nShe was the cryptographer on duty to decode a subsequent message explaining in excruciating detail the Italian battle plans. The information was passed to Adm. Andrew Cunningham, the commander of Britain\u2019s Mediterranean fleet, who was then in Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nShortly before the attack, the admiral arranged to be spotted by a consul of the German-allied Japanese government. Cunningham, who knew that the consul enjoyed golf, showed up with his clubs and a valise, leaving the Japanese to believe that a weekend of leisure awaited him.\n\nInstead of golfing, Cunningham led the British in a preemptive attack on the Italian navy. That encounter, the Battle of Cape Matapan, was a decisive victory for the British and effectively devastated the Italian fleet for the rest of the war.\n\nThe code breakers, Mrs. Batey recalled, shared two bottles of wine in celebration.\n\nMrs. Batey also helped crack the even more complex Enigma codes employed by the Abwehr, the German military intelligence service. Some decoders were trained in mathematics and approached cryptography from a technical perspective. Mrs. Batey worked differently.\n\n\u201cI used the psychological approach,\u201d she told the Telegraph. \u201cTo test the day\u2019s settings, the Germans sometimes used their girlfriends\u2019 names and dirty words; it was a great shame when they were stopped, as we enjoyed the dirty words.\u201d\n\nBy penetrating Abwehr communications, Mrs. Batey and her colleagues helped confirm the success of the XX, or Double-Cross, an anti-espionage operation in which captured Nazi spies were used to transmit false information to the Axis.\n\nThe deceptive tactics were used throughout the war \u2014 most notably to fool Germans into believing that the D-Day invasion would take place not in Normandy, but at the Pas-de-Calais. Bletchley Park decoders confirmed that the ruse had worked, and that the Allies could count on the relative security of their plan.\n\nMrs. Batey steadfastly emphasized the heroism of others, including Polish code breakers who had made significant contributions, and the \u201cchaps\u201d who stormed the beaches of Normandy.\n\n\u201cWhen my local paper came to interview me,\u201d she once told the London Independent, she told the reporter: \u2018I don\u2019t want to see a headline saying \u2018Bognor Regis Woman Won the War.\u2019\u201d\n\nMavis Lilian Lever was born in Dulwich, in south London, on May 5, 1921. (She later lived in the community of Bognor Regis.) Her father was a postal worker, and her mother was a seamstress.\n\nDuring the war, she was studying at the University College London when she was approached for linguistic intelligence work.\n\n\u201cI think what clinched it for me,\u201d she later told the London Daily Mail, \u201cwas that during my assessment they told me they had been puzzling over what the letters STGOCH stood for. While they wondered if there might possibly be a saint called Goch, I had the idea that the answer might be Santiago, Chile, which it was.\u201d\n\nAmong her first assignments, according to the Telegraph, was poring over personal ads in the Times of London in search of secret German messages. On the basis of her performance, she was dispatched to Knox\u2019s team at Bletchley Park. Her exploits later helped inspire the 2001 film \u201cEnigma\u201d starring Kate Winslet.\n\nMrs. Batey died at her home in West Sussex, England, according to the Bletchley Park Trust. The cause was not immediately available.\n\nAfter the war, Mrs. Batey began a second career as a landscape preservationist. She was regarded as the doyenne of English garden historians and wrote books on horticulture.\n\nHer literary output was not limited to that subject, however, and included \u201cJane Austen and the English Landscape\u201d (1996), \u201cThe World of Alice,\u201d about Lewis Carroll\u2019s heroine (1998) and \u201cDilly: The Man Who Broke Enigmas\u201d (2009).\n\nAt Bletchley Park, Mavis Lever met a mathematician, Keith Batey, whom she married in 1942 and who died in 2010. They had two daughters and a son, Elizabeth, Deborah and Christopher, all of whom survive.\n\nThe children grew up knowing nothing of their parents\u2019 wartime employment, Mrs. Batey recalled, although \u201cthey were rather suspicious that we could always beat everybody at Scrabble.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mavis Batey was a British student of 19, midway through her university course in German Romanticism, when she was recruited for a top-secret assignment during World War II. \u201cThis is going to be an interesting job, Mata Hari, seducing Prussian officers,\u201d she years later recalled thinking. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "Mavis Batey was a British student of 19, midway through her university course in German Romanticism, when she was recruited for a top-secret assignment during World War II. \u201cThis is going to be an interesting job, Mata Hari, seducing Prussian officers,\u201d she years later recalled thinking. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think [...]", "title": "Mavis Batey, who helped crack Axis code in WWII, dies at 92", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2013/11/17/news/world-news/mavis-batey-who-helped-crack-axis-code-in-wwii-dies-at-92/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10025741_H11663881-600x972.jpg?strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mavis Batey was a British student of 19, midway through her university course in German Romanticism, when she was recruited for a top-secret assignment during World War II. \u201cThis is going to be an interesting job, Mata Hari, seducing Prussian officers,\u201d she years later recalled thinking. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think [...]", "title": "Mavis Batey, who helped crack Axis code in WWII, dies at 92", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2013/11/17/news/world-news/mavis-batey-who-helped-crack-axis-code-in-wwii-dies-at-92/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10025741_H11663881-250x250.jpg?strip=all", "site": "@bangordailynews", "card": "summary"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": 5809608, "app_id": 169032116512887}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1602683"}}, "keywords": "Maine, news, elections, election results, politics, sports, Bangor, Portland, Augusta, weather, obituaries, Waterville, Aroostook, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Hancock, Washington, bdn,news,world,regions,bangor daily news,mavis batey, who helped crack axis code in wwii, dies at 92,is_article,unbylined", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd8e2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe would ask, \u2018Which way does the clock go round?\u2019 \u201d Mrs. Batey recalled in an interview with the Daily Telegraph.\nMrs. Batey also helped crack the even more complex Enigma codes employed by the Abwehr, the German military intelligence service.\nBut by the time of her death on Nov. 12 at 92, Mrs. Batey was regarded in England as a national heroine.\nLike many of her colleagues, Mrs. Batey worked on a \u201cneed-to-know\u201d basis and did not understand at the time the significance of her efforts.\nThe children grew up knowing nothing of their parents\u2019 wartime employment, Mrs. Batey recalled, although \u201cthey were rather suspicious that we could always beat everybody at Scrabble.\u201d"}
