SURABAYA, Indonesia (AP) — More than a thousand worshippers attended somber Sunday services at an Indonesian church devastated by the crash of AirAsia Flight 8501, praying for relatives of lost loved ones — members of the congregation who made up a quarter of the 162 people aboard the plane.

“God, we pray that you will give the grieving families extraordinary strength and help ease their pain,” said the Rev. Johannes Sonny Susanto of Pentecostal Mawar Sharon Church. “Let them put their trust in you and know that you are a good God.”

Amen was echoed by those in the pews.

It is not clear what caused the Singapore-bound plane to plummet into the Java Sea 42 minutes after taking off from Surabaya, Indonesia’s second-largest city, last Sunday. Minutes before losing contact, the pilot told air traffic control he was approaching threatening clouds, but was denied permission to climb to a higher altitude because of heavy air traffic.

Despite a massive international search and recovery operation, so far only 31 bodies have been found, in large because of bad weather. But officials said after locating what appears to be a massive part of the fuselage, it is possible many remaining passengers and crew will be found inside the wreck.

Divers waited for breaks in weather Sunday to reach the site, but rolling seas stirred up silt and mud, leaving them with zero visibility, said Henry Bambang Soelistyo, chief of the National Search and Rescue Agency.

They had to turn back because conditions were so bad.

“At this moment, it’s impossible to send any divers,” he said. “We’ll wait until the weather gets better.”

Twenty planes and helicopters were being deployed Sunday together with 27 ships from Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, the United States searching for the all-important black boxes and pieces of wreckage.
