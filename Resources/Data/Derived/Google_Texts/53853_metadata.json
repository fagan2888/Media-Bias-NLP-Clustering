We\u2019ve had hard-charging zombies (28 Days Later), comic zombies (Shaun of the Dead), Nazi zombies (Dead Snow), love-bug zombies (Warm Bodies), even zombies as household help (Fido). What\u2019s left?\n\nFirst-time director Henry Hobson and first-time screenwriter John Scott 3 (the name he chooses to use) have come up with a risky new approach. They\u2019ve pared away the gut-munching and dialed down the horror thrills to present us instead with something like a TV-style disease-of-the-week story involving an affliction called \u201cnecroambulism.\u201d (As has become common in latter-day zombie films, the word \u201czombie\u201d is never uttered.) With knowing irony, the filmmakers have cast Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead role of a heartbroken farmer watching his infected daughter rot away before his eyes, en route to her flesh-rending doom. The thought of a parent witnessing the slow death of a child is inherently wrenching, and we\u2019re naturally moved. But over the course of 95 minutes of dim lights, dark clouds, and occasional tragic piano chords, the picture bogs down in its gloomy limitations.\n\nSchwarzenegger\u2019s farmer, Wade Vogel, is doing his best to get by in a dystopian world. The plague of necroambulism, for which no cure has been discovered, has turned the country\u2019s big cities into disease-ridden horror pits. Wade lives in relative safety in a rambling clapboard house out on the Midwestern plains with his teenage daughter Maggie (Abigail Breslin) and a woman named Caroline (Joely Richardson), who has two small children of her own and is trying to fill the vacant place of Maggie\u2019s deceased mother. Why Maggie might want to run off to a nearby city is unclear, but she does and she gets bitten by (let\u2019s just say it) a zombie. When Wade comes to retrieve her from a hospital, he\u2019s told by a doctor that he can only take her home for eight weeks, at which point she\u2019ll begin to \u201cturn.\u201d She will then have to be surrendered to authorities for quarantine (a horrific fate, we later learn), and she and her father will be compelled to \u201csay your goodbyes.\u201d\n\nSchwarzenegger, with his light, self-deprecating charm, has always been more than a simple action hero. Here, though, in a movie with virtually no action, and little to laugh about, he\u2019s forced to rely on basic acting ability\u2014not his strong suit. And the minimal way in which his character is written offers no help. As Maggie\u2019s disease progresses, and an ugly lesion on her arm spreads into spidery black veins on her face, Wade has little to do but wander about soul-stricken. We understand his misery, and we\u2019re touched, but we wait in vain for more emotional detail. Schwarzenegger\u2019s determination to try something new is laudable, but his performance is all in one key, and we keep hoping for modulations that never arrive. This leaves Breslin, an actor of more traditional skills, to keep the movie alive (so to speak) with affecting projections of fear and withering hope.\n\nMotivational clarity is also in short supply here. Wade is determined never to turn Maggie over for quarantine. But since her degeneration is irreversible, and she\u2019ll soon pose a lethal threat, we wonder what alternative plan he might have in mind. The script offers no suggestion. (Will he ultimately kill Maggie himself? That would raise other questions.)\n\nThe movie is enriched with a number of touching scenes: Maggie giving a farewell kiss to an infected boy (Bryce Romero) on whom she has had a crush; Wade\u2019s sudden encounter in a forest with a neighbor and his small daughter, both of them hideously turned. It\u2019s the kind of picture that makes you look forward to the novice filmmakers\u2019 future projects. This one is mainly a memorable calling card.\n\nThe D Train\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to discuss The D Train without revealing its central plot element: a sex scene, non-graphic but unflinching, that involves\u2026no, I can\u2019t. (Hang on till, oh, this afternoon, by which time it\u2019ll be common knowledge.) It\u2019s not a scene that\u2019s been rigged up for showy exploitation\u2014it triggers everything that follows, very little of which is what you might expect. The picture starts out as a sort of bro-com, but it soon creeps over to the dark side, where some fine performances and an array of implausibilities await.\n\nJack Black, wearing his portliness like a medal from a failed campaign, is Dan Landsman, a pompous bore who\u2019s been annoying people in his suburban hometown ever since high school. (He tosses around \u201990s wisecracks like dated grenades.) Now, 20 years after graduation, he\u2019s in charge of the class-reunion committee, in which capacity he\u2019s failing to ignite much alumni interest. One night, Dan sees a sunscreen commercial on TV that features Oliver Lawless (James Marsden), the coolest guy in Dan\u2019s old class. Unlike Dan, Oliver fled their dead-end town after graduation, and now, Dan assumes, he\u2019s become a big-time actor\u2014a star. Dan is certain that luring Oliver to the class reunion would guarantee its success, and maybe garner him some long-sought respect.\n\nIn order to finance a trip to Los Angeles to pursue this prospect, Dan concocts a shameless lie for his boss, Bill Shurmur (Jeffrey Tambor), the owner of the struggling consulting company at which Dan works. Dan tells Bill that he has engineered a lucrative business deal in L.A. and needs to fly out there to nail it down. Bill okays the trip, but then insists on coming along. Dan reluctantly agrees to this.\n\nAlready we have questions. Since Bill\u2019s presence in L.A. will guarantee disaster\u2014he\u2019ll immediately realize there\u2019s no big deal to consummate\u2014why does Dan insist on sticking to his plan after Bill deals himself in? Also, if Dan feels that face time with Oliver is so important, why doesn\u2019t he just spring for a plane ticket himself? The movie\u2019s writers and first-time directors, Andrew Mogel and Jarrad Paul, don\u2019t appear to care.\n\nIn any case, upon arrival, Dan tracks down Oliver\u2014who barely remembers him\u2014and ignores the fact that the onetime class cool guy hasn\u2019t really made much of himself as an actor. (Thus his presence in a tacky TV commercial.) There follows a night of gaudy debauchery\u2014pot-smoking, coke-snorting, booze-guzzling and chick-ogling\u2014that leaves Dan shaken and questioning his true desires. Back home again, the big reunion rolls around and everything that could possibly go wrong does so.\n\nJack Black, who established his non-comedy cred with the 2011 Bernie, is full of squirmy surprises here, playing a man who\u2019s off-putting on just about every level, but hard to look away from. And Marsden, such an underrated comic actor, captures Oliver\u2019s gone-to-seed hunkiness with irresistible precision. The rest of the cast provides strong support, especially Kathryn Hahn as Dan\u2019s uncomprehending wife; Tambor as a man too sweet to realize he\u2019s being conned; and Russell Posner as Dan\u2019s teenage son Zach (who gets some raw advice from Oliver on the intricacies of a sexual three-way).\n\nThe movie\u2019s not really a comedy in the usual sense\u2014it\u2019s sometimes boldly unpleasant. But it\u2019s not a film you\u2019re likely to forget a day after seeing it. Whether that\u2019s a good thing is another question.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Arnold Schwarzenegger in a sorrowful zombie film, Jack Black at comedy\u2019s far edge.", "title": "Movie Reviews: Maggie and The D Train Are Unexpected Oddities", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/05/08/movie-reviews-maggie-and-the-d-train-are", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14310311763487.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Arnold Schwarzenegger in a sorrowful zombie film, Jack Black at comedy\u2019s far edge.", "title": "Movie Reviews: <em>Maggie</em> and <em>The D Train</em> Are Unexpected Oddities", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14310311763487.jpg", "creator": "@kurt_loder", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-05-08T13:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/kurt-loder"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda9c8\"", "article_summary": "Unlike Dan, Oliver fled their dead-end town after graduation, and now, Dan assumes, he\u2019s become a big-time actor\u2014a star.\nIn the nearly 50 years since George Romero launched the modern zombie movie with Night of the Living Dead, there have been continual attempts to freshen the genre\u2014to keep it going.\nThe D TrainIt\u2019s difficult to discuss The D Train without revealing its central plot element: a sex scene, non-graphic but unflinching, that involves\u2026no, I can\u2019t.\nWe\u2019ve had hard-charging zombies (28 Days Later), comic zombies (Shaun of the Dead), Nazi zombies (Dead Snow), love-bug zombies (Warm Bodies), even zombies as household help (Fido).\nHere, though, in a movie with virtually no action, and little to laugh about, he\u2019s forced to rely on basic acting ability\u2014not his strong suit."}
