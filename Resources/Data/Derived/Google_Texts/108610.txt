A 10-year-old girl is one of three people who sustained nonlife-threatening injuries in a crash involving a Topeka Police Department patrol vehicle.

The Kansas Highway Patrol is investigating the incident, which was reported to the Shawnee County Emergency Communications Center at 6:32 p.m. Saturday.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports the highway patrol's crash log says 23-year-old Gary Atchison III of Burlingame was driving the police department SUV south with its emergency lights and sirens activated.

The vehicle and a 2004 Dodge Caravan collided in an intersection. The Dodge driver, 40-year-old Jesus Meza of Topeka, and a 10-year-old in the vehicle were taken to a local hospital.

Atchison and a passenger in the SUV, 22-year-old Caitlan Hornung, also were transported to the hospital.
