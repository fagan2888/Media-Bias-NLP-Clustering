That letter is going straight to the paper shredder.\"\"This will be the beginning of the end of the public school system as we know it,\" Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told Dallas-Fort Worth TV station NBC 5 Reaction was fierce in Indiana, as well.Dr. Zach Rozelle, superintendent of the Union County/College Corner Joint School District, did not mince words to CBS4 in Indianapolis.\"Another example of government \u2026 politicians using the public schools to promote their own political agenda -- little to no regard for the real impact on the right to privacy \u2026 security for all children,\" Rozelle said.The Obama directive added gasoline to a raging fire on the national debate on gendered bathrooms and who should be allowed to use them.\"All children should be free from discrimination and harassment. Except the at-minimum 99.7 percent of kids who aren't transgender. They just need to suck it up,\" wrote Federalist Managing Editor Joy Pullmann.
