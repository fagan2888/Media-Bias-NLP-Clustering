Interactive games and scenario stations helped staff members learn the following lessons:\n\nDon't break the chain: Know the chain of command for handling customer complaints, employee disputes or interdepartmental changes. Collect evidence: Recognize non-verbal cues from patients and families by observing and anticipating patient needs. Promote teamwork: Remember to use all available resources and interdepartmental collaborative programs, and communicate efficiently even in stressful situations. Communicate: Acknowledge the importance of frequent and appropriate communication with patients and family members, and consider patients' perception of the interactions. DNA (Don't Negative Answer): Realize the importance of phone etiquette, especially when directing people to and around the hospital.\n\nHospital leaders and department heads must encourage this kind of creativity on the part of nurses and staff, and recognize successful ventures like those seen at Grady Memorial with accolades and praise, according to the article.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSimulation lab, war room help prevent medical errors, improve doc-nurse communication\n\nHow to spark doc-nurse communication\n\nSuccessful nurse-led initiatives, HHS grants bolster calls for expanded nurse role\n\n5 ways to show appreciation during National Nurses Week", "article_metadata": {"description": "A nurse-driven, investigative approach to customer service helped nurses at Grady Memorial Hospital's emergency department boost patient satisfaction and improve interdepartmental communication,\u00a0according to\u00a0Advance Healthcare Network for Nurses", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A nurse-driven, investigative approach to customer service helped nurses at Grady Memorial Hospital's emergency department boost patient satisfaction and improve interdepartmental communication,\u00a0according to\u00a0Advance Healthcare Network for Nurses", "title": "5 customer service lessons to boost patient satisfaction", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/5-customer-service-lessons-boost-patient-satisfaction/2014-06-05", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,customer service,emergency department,Grady Memorial Hospital,HR & Workforce Management,interdepartmental communication,Nurses,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient satisfaction", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe429b\"", "article_summary": "A nurse-driven, investigative approach to customer service helped nurses at Grady Memorial Hospital's emergency department boost patient satisfaction and improve interdepartmental communication, according to Advance Healthcare Network for Nurses.\nThe activity created an interactive environment for staff members to share experiences, highlight challenges and share solutions or success approaches.\nInteractive games and scenario stations helped staff members learn the following lessons:Don't break the chain: Know the chain of command for handling customer complaints, employee disputes or interdepartmental changes.\nCommunicate: Acknowledge the importance of frequent and appropriate communication with patients and family members, and consider patients' perception of the interactions.\nCollect evidence: Recognize non-verbal cues from patients and families by observing and anticipating patient needs."}
