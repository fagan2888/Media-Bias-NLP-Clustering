The theater recently finished renovating part of its lobby, adding a bar and cafe.\n\nThe cafe serves hot items \u2014 chicken strips, fries, pizza and pretzel bites \u2014 a limited Starbucks menu and hand-dipped ice cream. You can also get milkshakes, which the theater says have been the most popular addition.\n\nOn the bar side, there\u2019s already a selection of beer and wine; some frozen and mixed wine-based drinks are coming. Although it is called a bar, it\u2019s not the long row of bar stools you might be thinking of.\n\nThe bar is just a separate register with a divider offsetting it from the cafe side. The renovation did add table and booth seating, though, which the theater officials say people have been taking advantage of.\n\nOf course just like the popcorn, anything you buy from the cafe and bar can also be brought into the movie. And when you combine the food and drink additions with the upgraded seating that was also installed, you\u2019re in for a great movie experience.\n\nThe theater at 910 W. Edison Road started the lobby renovation in January, right after it finished replacing all of its traditional seating with luxury recliners. There\u2019s no over hyping these seats; they are fantastic. There\u2019s no better way to watch a movie than in a comfy seat with lots of room and your feet propped up.\n\nThe armrest between some seats can even be pulled up if you want to cuddle with your date. For the sake of the rest of us, though, please keep that to a minimum.\n\nAlthough Movies 14 is the first in the area to upgrade to luxury seating, it\u2019s not the first to expand its food and drink offerings. Wonderland Cinema in Niles started serving beer and wine last summer, and it added food items like sandwiches, hot dogs and mozzarella sticks well before that.\n\nImproved seating and concession selections have been expanding nationally in recent years. Of the just under 6,000 movie theaters in the country, an estimated 600 sell alcohol, with many more planning it for the future, according to the National Association of Theater Owners.\n\nThere are also theaters taking amenities to the extreme, offering luxury seating with waiters bringing full menus of food and drinks right to your seat.\n\nWithout a doubt these changes are being made to improve the customer\u2019s experience and keep people coming in the door.\n\n\u201cOur feeling has always been to give customers as many options as possible,\u201d says Frank Gonzalez, a spokesman for Cinemark Theaters, the Plano, Texas-based owner of Movies 14.\n\nCinemark is the third largest movie theater owner in the U.S.\n\nImprovements and renovations are always part of the life cycle of theaters, Gonzalez says, but now the company is thinking beyond aesthetic changes and looking at how the customer experience can be improved.\n\nFor example, with the addition of the luxury recliners at Movies 14, you now buy a ticket for a specific seat. It\u2019s especially nice for the highly anticipated movies. You can buy your ticket and reserve your seat days in advance if you want. No more showing up an hour before the movie to get a good seat.\n\nEven though theater officials say the theater lost more than half of its total number of seats with the upgrade, ticket prices didn\u2019t increase.\n\nTheaters across the country have been making these improvements to get people back in the seats. Following the hard hit that ticket sales took in 2014, something needed to be done.\n\nTicket sales that year were the lowest since 1995, with box office sales dropping 5.2 percent to $10.3 billion. While movie offerings play a large part in attendance as well, creating a better experience goes a long way.\n\nWhatever the industry did, it worked. The box office saw a more than 7 percent increase in 2015, ending at $11.1 billion.\n\nAnd if the reaction from Market Basket readers on social media is any indication, the upgrades should be a big draw.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nice and genuinely makes me want to go to the movies more often,\u201d Kat Brown wrote on Facebook.\n\nSmart Streets celebration\n\nThe city of South Bend and downtown businesses will celebrate the launch of the Smart Streets conversion Monday, offering a range of specials.
