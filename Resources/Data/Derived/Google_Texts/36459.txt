CHICAGO — It’s no secret that Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried opened the eyes of those who got to see him up-close playing for Team USA last summer.

One of the coaches who has become a big Faried fan is Chicago’s Tom Thibodeau.

Thibodeau was asked about Faried before the Nuggets and Bulls met Thursday night at the United Center.

“He’s very talented and a great worker,” Thibodeau said. “He’s as good as it gets in terms of rebounding and his quick reaction to the ball.

“He sprints the floor offensively. He has great hands. He has really worked hard at his shooting and has improved in that area as well. His energy is a great talent. It’s really off the charts. He’s had some big games for them. You’re talking 25-point, 25-rebound games. Those are pretty special performances. This summer, he was terrific. He was a big multiple-effort guy who can cover a lot of ground defensively. His intensity is special.”

Familiar face. It was only a two-month stint, but point guard Aaron Brooks made a good impression with coach Brian Shaw after being dealt to the Nuggets last season at the NBA trade deadline.

Brooks left Denver during the summer, signing a one-year contract to play for the Bulls. He entered Thursday’s game averaging 10.8 points and 3.2 assists this season.

“He came in at the end of the season for us last year and helped out a great deal being able to hit shots and being able to run the team,” Shaw said. “It was a huge pickup for them, and I’m happy that he’s playing well.”

Footnotes. Darrell Arthur continues to occupy an “emergency only” space. His strained lower left leg hasn’t allowed him to return to full-time duty in the rotation. … Wilson Chandler returned to action after missing the second half of the Nuggets’ loss to the L.A. Lakers on Tuesday with a quad contusion.
