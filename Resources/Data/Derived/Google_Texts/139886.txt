Add New Jersey rocker Jon Bon Jovi to the long list of celebrities who have joined the Ice Bucket Challenge, raising awareness and money to fight ALS, or Lou Gehrig's Disease.

And he had some help — from none other than Gov. Chris Christie.

"@BonJovi, Happy to see you accept the #IceBucketChallenge, but even happier to help you complete it," the governor tweeted this evening.

Wearing a white T-shirt and dark shorts, Bon Jovi looks straight into the camera.

“On behalf of myself and my friends back here, I want you to know I wanted to be the first to rise to the occasion. I accept the challenge,” he says. Then he gives the signal: “Okay, guys.”

The video shows Bon Jovi laughing as Christie and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft pick up a receptacle full of water, lift it to shoulder height and pour it over him.

As is the custom, Bon Jovi then issued his own challenge — to fellow Bon Jovi bandmates David Bryan, Tico Torres, and Richie Sambora.

Christie himself was doused last week and then challenged U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who accepted.

The "Ice Bucket Challenge" is a public awareness and fundraising campaign that aims to fight the degenerative disease ALS. Videos of people who have accepted the challenge after being nominated by friends have been flooding Facebook since the campaign got underway in late July. The rules give those nominated 24 hours to get iced or donate $100 to a charity working on the incurable disease — or both.
