Lower labor costs are supposed to make the French manufacturing industry (and thus the French economy!) more competitive, and therefore help to curb unemployment and make everything better. But will the policy change anything for entrepreneurs? Can it encourage entrepreneurship and innovation?\n\nProbably not\u2026\n\nIt creates an environment that will ultimately discourage entrepreneurship (or make it a lot more difficult for some):\n\nWhat the French call \u201cSocial Security\u201d is a system that provides universal social insurance against ill health, unemployment and old age. Everyone in regular residence in the territory has a right to health care coverage, including the most disadvantaged (submitted to resources). The system is relatively cheap and the health care is (still) one of the best on the planet. It is funded through employees\u2019 and employers\u2019 contributions.\n\nCutting employers\u2019 contributions could have two effects: that of lowering the quality of care and the \u201crefunds\u201d the insurants get, and that of spurring them to subscribe to an additional private insurance, which by the way could ultimately make labor costs more expensive since it will become a necessity for employers to offer the best private coverage packages to lure in the talents they need! Ultimately this starve-the-beast policy aims at replacing the public system with a private one, likely to be significantly more expensive.\n\nThe French Social Security is an amazing cushion against risk. You can risk your job and create a business without losing your coverage or you can do it while unemployed because you receive unemployment benefits. No accident or disease can make you bankrupt if you\u2019re on your own. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act (dubbed \u201cObamacare\u201d) aims precisely at creating such an environment and spurring the economy by removing one of the obstacles to business creation and self-employment. In people\u2019s minds there\u2019s nothing more American than creating a business and yet, before Obamacare, health care was a gigantic obstacle to business creation, especially for the middle-aged or those unlucky to have a \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d like diabetes\u2014and they are numerous: one in three Americans will have diabetes by 2050 if the current trend continues.\n\nWhat if Facebook hadn\u2019t been started for want of health insurance? No one but President Obama said it better: \u201cThe commitments we make to each other through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, these things do not sap our initiative, they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers ; they free us to take the risks that make this country great\u201d.\n\nIt sounds a hell of a lot more inspiring than \u201clet\u2019s lower labor costs to become more competitive\u201d, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nFurthermore, lower labor costs just feed the rent-seekers and impede innovation\n\nThe very idea that lower labor costs can make an economy more competitive is a moot point. Price competitiveness depends as much on productivity (which is high in France), real estate prices and the cost of capital. But mostly competitiveness should be more about product quality, sales force, the lure of our brands and especially our ability to implement what Clayton Christensen calls empowering innovations, the only ones which create jobs.\n\nLower labor costs may be perceived as a short-term relief by French companies but they could impede innovation. They increase a company\u2019s efficiency, but as economist and venture capitalist William Janeway put it: \u201cefficiency is a dangerously overrated concept\u201d and \u201cthe enemy of innovation at the systemic level\u201d. It also \u201ccripples a government\u2019s effort to offset contraction in private sector\u201d.\n\nHigh labor costs encourage innovation. For long Germany was extremely competitive in spite of (because of?) its high labor costs. Low labor costs will obviously discourage investment. What\u2019s the point in acquiring sophisticated expensive labor-saving equipment if labor is cheap? What\u2019s the point in acquiring expensive 3D printers (they are getting cheaper, I\u2019ll grant you that)?\n\nJaneway believes both \u201cSchumpeterian waste\u201d (at the entrepreneur\u2019s level) and \u201cKeynesian waste\u201d (at the government\u2019s level) should be bolstered by the state. In addition to funding research, the state should serve as an early customer of innovative products not yet ready for commercial competition (much as the US Defense Department did in the early years of the digital revolution) or deploy open platforms on which entrepreneurs and investors can \u201cdance\u201d.\n\nOnce again, the government\u2019s short-sighted approach to helping the economy relies on an outdated vision of the economy where the \u201ceconomy\u201d equates with the \u201cmanufacturing industry\u201d and business with the rent-seeking corporations whose sole purpose is to squeeze their costs to be more efficient. Entrepreneurship and empowering innovation aren\u2019t part of that picture\u2026\n\nphoto via flickr", "article_metadata": {"description": "The bulk of President Hollande\u2019s economic policy, which was named the \u201cresponsibility pact\u201d, consists in helping to\u00a0lower French labor costs by cutting emp", "og": {"site_name": "Rude Baguette", "description": "The bulk of President Hollande\u2019s economic policy, which was named the \u201cresponsibility pact\u201d, consists in helping to\u00a0lower French labor costs by cutting emp", "title": "Does cheaper labor translate to a better startup ecosystem?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.rudebaguette.com/assets/5347882588_74db6d7393_z.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-05-20T14:35:11+00:00", "url": "http://www.rudebaguette.com/2014/05/20/entrepreneurs-interest-lower-labor-costs/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Rude Baguette", "description": "The bulk of President Hollande\u2019s economic policy, which was named the \u201cresponsibility pact\u201d, consists \u2026", "title": "Does cheaper labor translate to a better startup ecosystem?", "url": "http://www.rudebaguette.com/2014/05/20/entrepreneurs-interest-lower-labor-costs/", "image": {"src": "http://www.rudebaguette.com/assets/5347882588_74db6d7393_z.jpg", "identifier": "http://i2.wp.com/www.rudebaguette.com/assets/5347882588_74db6d7393_z.jpg?fit=640%2C484"}, "creator": "@RudeBaguette", "site": "@RudeBaguette", "card": "summary"}, "short_title": "Does cheaper labor translate to a better startup ecosystem?", "fb": {"admins": 3326514}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RudeBaguette", "section": "French-Startup", "published_time": "2014-05-20T14:34:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-20T14:35:11+00:00"}}, "article_summary": "Furthermore, lower labor costs just feed the rent-seekers and impede innovationThe very idea that lower labor costs can make an economy more competitive is a moot point.\nIt sounds a hell of a lot more inspiring than \u201clet\u2019s lower labor costs to become more competitive\u201d, doesn\u2019t it?\nLower labor costs are supposed to make the French manufacturing industry (and thus the French economy!)\nEveryone in regular residence in the territory has a right to health care coverage, including the most disadvantaged (submitted to resources).\nLower labor costs may be perceived as a short-term relief by French companies but they could impede innovation."}
