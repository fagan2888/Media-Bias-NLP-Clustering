Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly may think that Americans who vote for Democrats are “dumb,” but according to MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell, that word better describes Democratic candidates.

During MSNBC’s midterm election coverage Tuesday evening, Chris Matthews asked the panel why the rise of ISIS did not become a bigger issue than Ebola in these final weeks leading up to Election Day. Whether it was ISIS or Ebola, Mitchell said Republicans used issues like those as “scare tactics” and talked about in the “scariest, most non-factual ways to take at the eye off the real issues.”

“But the Democrats were dumb enough to not say, let’s talk about the economy,” Mitchell added.

Agreeing with Mitchell, Chuck Todd faulted Democrats for “engaging” in the conversation with Republicans. While the GOP succeeded in “nationalizing” the election, he said Democrats got caught up in more local issues that voters with which were not connecting.
