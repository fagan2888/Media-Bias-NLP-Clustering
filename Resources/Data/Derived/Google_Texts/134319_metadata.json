Burwell, a right-wing lawsuit that they believe would cripple or even destroy Obamacare. I argued recently it would do no such thing, one reason being that Republicans would pay a heavy political price for standing by and doing nothing as 11.5 million mostly middle-class Americans immediately lose their insurance.\n\nMy argument was based on assessing the political calculus from the outside. We now have a lot of information about what Republicans think from the inside. And the case looks even stronger than I initially suspected.\n\nIf it succeeds, which I would not bet on, the King v. Burwell lawsuit would eliminate tax credits for people buying insurance through federal exchanges. Yesterday, Ben Sasse, Republican senator and darling of the right, published a Wall Street Journal op-ed urging fellow Republicans to extend those tax credits for a year and a half. To make his message palatable to conservatives, Sasse decorates his argument with lots and lots of fiery denunciations of Obamacare\u2019s evil bureaucracy that does not and cannot work. (\u201cObamaCare\u2019s central planning is unworkable and unpopular,\u201d he writes, which makes one wonder how 11.5 million people are getting insurance from an unworkable market and why they would not object to its termination.) Sasse likewise insists this \u201ctemporary\u201d extension is merely step one of the plan, with step two being the Republicans finally unifying around their alternative health care plan. At this point, six years after the health care debate began, this should be regarded like Ike Turner\u2019s plan to become a loving and supportive spouse. It\u2019s rhetoric Republicans feel obligated to periodically use, and some feel obligated to believe, but which has no meaning.\n\nBut the core of Sasse\u2019s argument is that the onus of the meltdown King v. Burwell hopes to trigger would fall squarely on the GOP. Should the lawsuit succeed, Sasse argues, Republican states will face overwhelming demands to create their own exchanges (\u201cthe political pressure to adopt ObamaCare will be crippling.\u201d)\n\nToday, conservative reporter Byron York has much more detail. Private polling by a conservative group found that \u201chuge majorities\u201d would want Congress to restore subsidies for people who had lost them. \u201cWe're worried about ads saying cancer patients are being thrown out of treatment, and Obama will be saying all Congress has to do is fix a typo,\u201d one staffer confesses.\n\nMy column took for granted that Congress would do nothing and that states would create their own exchanges only over the course of years. Sasse\u2019s op-ed and York\u2019s reporting suggest I was far too pessimistic. Congress probably would be forced to act, and if it fails, many or most states would capitulate very quickly.
