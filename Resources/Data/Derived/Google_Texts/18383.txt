Valley Springs, SD

It's been months since the summer floods destroyed numerous homes in Valley Springs, but the road isn't getting easier.

"It's been a long ten weeks," Homeowner Mark Moore said.

It was a summer to forget for the Moore family. His home of 11 years, just outside of Valley Springs, was a victim of the rising waters, and more than two months later, the damage is clear. The water collapsed a wall, destroying everything in the basement. The family lost plenty of items, but the memories taken away will leave a hole in their hearts as big as the hole in their wall.

"Those pictures of the kids growing up. That was before computers and we never ever had them digitized or anything, so we lost all those," Mark Moore said.

In trying to start over, the Moore family has dealt with roadblocks from their insurance company. They say the belongings in the basement lost to the flood won't be replaced.

"Read the fine print on your insurance policy because everything in our basement wasn't covered except for the utility part," Moore said.

They estimate there's around $100,000 in damage to this home, but it is salvageable. So far they have only received $41,000. Mark Moore says that makes moving forward difficult.

"I took care of my part of the contract on paying my insurance premiums and now the insurance company is not taking their part of the contract," Moore said.

The Moore family bought this camper early in the summer to use for camping at the lake, but after the devastating flood rolled through, it became their home.

After this difficult summer, the future of the Moore's damaged home is still up in the air, but he knows where the location won't be.

"I'm moving to higher ground. If I move very close to water somebody better send me off to a psychiatrist," Moore said.

The biggest hurdle for the family currently is finding a contractor to lay the stone for their basement wall. Most contractors either do concrete pour, or are too busy during the fall.
