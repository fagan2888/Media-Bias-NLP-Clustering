Under the Affordable Care Act, the government in 2014 will provide tax credits to those with incomes between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level to help offset the expense of insurance premiums.\n\nBut for those who make even less than 100 percent poverty \u2014 $11,490 for an individual \u2014 the options are slim. They are unlikely to be able to afford the insurance and they are ineligible for tax credits.\n\nThirty-four percent of Louisiana\u2019s entire uninsured non-elderly population do not qualify for either due to their income, according to the Kaiser analysis. That\u2019s the third highest rate in the nation behind Mississippi (37 percent) and Alabama (36 percent).\n\n\u201cIt makes it more important to continue to fight to have Medicaid expansion in the state of Louisiana,\u201d said Jacqueline Jones, a lead organizer with Jeremiah Group, a coalition of area churches and faith organizations that have petitioned Gov. Bobby Jindal to change the state\u2019s stance. \u201cWe were clear from the very beginning that the exchange would not benefit thousands of people.\u201d\n\nLike governors in many Republican-led states, Jindal has opposed the expansion largely on grounds that it is too expensive. He says it will cost the state more than $1.7 billion over 10 years and would leave more people dependent on the government for care.\n\nIn a July opinion piece for NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune, Jindal put the total percentage of low-income Louisianians left without insurance at 6 percent. He also cited the state\u2019s system of charity hospital, arguing that Louisiana and other states should be left to create their own methods of caring for its people.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "bobby jindal,br-living,brhomepage,homepage,louisiana health care,louisiana medicaid", "title": "Lack of Medicaid expansion leaves 87% of state's poor adults without coverage, report says", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Lack of Medicaid expansion leaves 87% of state\\u0027s poor adults without coverage, report says\", \"link\": \"http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2013/10/lack_of_medicaid_expansion_lea.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/13589999-standard.jpeg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11441102\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-16T17:59:16Z\", \"author\": \"Rebecca Catalanello, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune\", \"tags\": [\"bobby jindal\",\"br-living\",\"brhomepage\",\"homepage\",\"louisiana health care\",\"louisiana medicaid\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nola.com/health_impact/photo/13589999-thumb_square_large.jpeg", "creator": "@RCatNola", "site": "@nolanews", "card": "summary", "description": "Eighty-seven percent of all non-elderly Louisiana adults living in poverty will not have access to government subsidized health insurance in 2014 despite a new national health-care law that was designed to extend coverage to more people.That&#8217;s according to Kaiser Family..."}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, October 16, 2013, 12:59 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nola.com/health_impact/photo/unisured-populationsjpeg-84cc5367fb0b8373.jpeg\", \"author_name\": \"rcatalanello\", \"author_nickname\": \"Rebecca Catalanello, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune\", \"author_id\": \"8224863\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Orleans Health and Health Care\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NOLA.com", "description": "Eighty-seven percent of all non-elderly Louisiana adults living in poverty will not have access to government subsidized health insurance in 2014 despite a new national health-care law that was designed to extend coverage to more people.That&#8217;s according to Kaiser Family...", "title": "Lack of Medicaid expansion leaves 87% of state's poor adults without coverage, report says", "url": "http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2013/10/lack_of_medicaid_expansion_lea.html", "image": "http://media.nola.com/design/alpha/img/logo_nola.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NOLA.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, October 16, 2013, 12:55 PM", "article_author": "Rebecca Catalanello, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune", "Description": "Eighty-seven percent of all non-elderly Louisiana adults living in poverty will not have access to government subsidized health insurance in 2014 despite a new national health-care law that was designed to extend coverage to more people.
