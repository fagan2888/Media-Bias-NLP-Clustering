According to The Huffington Post:\n\nThe report, titled \"Shortchanged: The Hidden Costs of Lockstep Teacher Pay,\u201d says the \u201clockstep pay\u201d system of most school districts gives all teachers the same pay increases, regardless of performance. The report contends effective teachers should be rewarded, especially in high-poverty districts that pose the greatest teaching challenges. It estimates that U.S. school districts spend at least $250 million a year on automatic pay raises for ineffective teachers. \u201cBeginning salaries have to be high, one because it's fair and new entrants are not going to consider a profession with low starting salaries,\u201d Tim Daly, TNTP president, said over the phone. \u201cThe second thing is we need to accelerate salary growth for early top performers. In other careers people often start at a moderate salary, but top performances accelerate quickly because they get promoted.\u201d\n\nThe study essentially finds that \"lockstep pay\"\u2014automatic yearly salary raises given to all teachers regardless of merit\u2014incentivizes bad teachers to stay in the field (since their raises are unconditional) and drives away good teachers (since their efforts go unrewarded).\n\nPaying teachers according to their degree attainment is also ineffective, the study finds:\n\nLast year alone, schools across the country spent an estimated $8.5 billion on raises for teachers due to master\u2019s degrees\u2014enough to cover the cost of all school nutrition programs for more than 15 million students. When teachers earn a master\u2019s degree or a PhD, they move into a new \u201clane\u201d on the salary scale, which translates into thousands of extra dollars in salary every year for the rest of their career. In fact, teachers who pay $25,000 for a master\u2019s degree today and remain in the profession for 20 years could expect to triple their investment. Not surprisingly, 56 percent of all teachers have master\u2019s degrees. However, there is mounting evidence that this massive investment in advanced degrees is wildly disproportionate to its actual impact on the quality of instruction in classrooms. Over the last several decades, studies have found that advanced degrees have little to no measurable effect on a teacher\u2019s ability to help students learn. In some cases, advanced degrees may even have a negative effect.\n\nTeachers union leaders will likely condemn the study\u2014they remain stubborn defenders of lockstep pay\u2014but perhaps it can provide ammunition for good teachers whose hard work deserves a logical pay system.\n\nFor more coverage of teacher pay, watch ReasonTV's \"The Two-Million-Dollar Teacher.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Paying teachers according to their degree attainment is also silly.", "title": "Paying Teachers According to Seniority is Nonsensical and Ineffective", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/07/15/report-paying-teachers-according-to-seni", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14054579303525.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "So argues a recently released study by The\nNew Teacher Project.
