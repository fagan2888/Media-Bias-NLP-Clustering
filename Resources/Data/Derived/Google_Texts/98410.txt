Osceola County authorities said Saturday they have arrested the second of two male Army recruiters accused of having sex with a 17-year-old girl they met while recruiting at her high school.

Osceola sheriff spokeswoman Twis Lizasuain said that authorities in Michigan arrested 33-year-old John Back on Friday night. He will be extradited to Osceola, though the timetable is not known.

Warrants were issued Tuesday in Osceola for Back and 30-year-old Christopher Doner. Doner was arrested on 10 counts of unlawful sex with a minor and booked into jail. Bail was set at $20,000.

Back faces two counts of unlawful sex with minors.

Authorities say the teenâ€™s mother contacted detectives after learning about the encounters.

Both men recruited at Kissimmee-area high schools, including Harmony High, where the teen went to school.
