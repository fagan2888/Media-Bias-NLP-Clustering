His mother Hillary Medlin gazes down on him as she gives him a bottle, and baby Xavier starts to scream.\n\n\u201cI know your tummy hurts,\u201d Medlin says to her baby. A trio of wires poke out from under his onesie and connect to a screen monitoring Xavier\u2019s heart rhythm and heartbeat. A cuff on his tiny foot measures Xavier\u2019s oxygen level.\n\nXavier\u2019s screams are heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cThis is new,\u201d Medlin says. \u201cThis is part of the withdrawal.\u201d\n\nMedlin, 25, was an opiate addict when she got pregnant. Withdrawal during pregnancy is dangerous, in part because the baby goes through withdrawal, and in part because detoxing mothers will sometimes turn to dangerous street drugs.\n\nSo her doctor prescribed oxycodone, and now mom and baby are detoxing together after birth.\n\n\u201cIt definitely sucks seeing them go through withdrawal because that\u2019s the first thing they go through when they\u2019re born,\u201d Medlin said. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Us when we go through withdrawal, we know why.\u201d\n\nMedlin\u2019s story isn\u2019t unique, in Florida or the nation. At Halifax Hospital in Volusia County, Xavier is one of six newborn babies detoxing on the same day. Things have gotten so bad, the hospital is expanding its neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.\n\nNationwide, the rate of babies born addicted to opiates has tripled in the last two decades. But in Florida, the state formerly known as the Oxy Express, the rate of addicted babies grew ten fold.\n\nAnd that has leaders trying to figure out what to do with pregnant addicts, even as county health departments get out of prenatal care statewide.\n\nHealth News Florida is highlighting details of its Pregnant and Poor investigation all week. See the series here.\n\nA complex problem\n\nMedlin wears a black T-shirt with the picture of a wolf emblazoned above word 'Survivors'. She has freckles, a wide smile and big brown eyes that can\u2019t hide her pain.\n\nHer road to addiction started with two slipped disks and two bulging disks. She has piriformis syndrome, a condition where the muscles around her sciatic nerve weaken, causing low back pain. She was on a legal prescription to control the pain, but then she lost her insurance.\n\n\u201cOnce my insurance got cut off, that\u2019s when I went to the street with my dependency,\u201d Medlin said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do and I just took everything I found to feel better.\u201d\n\nShe took any opiate she could get her hands on: morphine, oxycodone, roxycodone, loratab, percoset.\n\nMedlin takes a deep breath.\n\n\u201cI do feel guilty putting him through this,\u201d Medlin said. \u201cBut I feel if I wasn\u2019t on something we both probably wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s referring to last November when she had an overdose, right before she got pregnant.\n\n\u201cIt was whatever I could find in the cabinet,\u201d Medlin said.\n\nMedlin\u2019s problems are complex. She has a legitimate medical problem that causes her pain. But she\u2019s an addict as well.\n\nMedlin\u2019s doctor Pamela Carbiener said it\u2019s hard to sift through what is acute and chronic pain from withdrawal and dependency on opioids.\n\nCarbiener is one of the few doctors who will treat pregnant drug addicts in Volusia County, and she risks her own medical license by doing it.\n\nHer job has recently been complicated as the Volusia County Health Department stopped offering prenatal care. Statewide, more and more health departments are getting out of prenatal care.\n\nIf a doctor saw patients through the Volusia County Health Department, they couldn\u2019t be sued. But the health department stopped offering prenatal care in the last two years, leaving doctors wary of seeing pregnant addicts for fear of being sued.\n\nCarbiener told a panel working on solutions to the problem of pregnant addicts that doctors are overwhelmed, under-educated and don\u2019t want to deal with this population when they have no resources to help.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a bad outcome, (doctors) fear liability,\u201d Carbiener said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of their biggest fears because too often there will be a bad outcome. It\u2019s hard to get good outcomes in these circumstances.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nXavier doesn\u2019t know it yet, but he\u2019s got a big task in life: Saving his mother. Medlin calls Xavier her second chance.\n\n\u201cWith my first son, he got taken away because I was in another rough patch with the dependency,\u201d Medlin said. \u201cHis father found out. I would drink and drive with him. I would snort anything I could find while he was in the room. You know he could walk then. And I knew he knew something was going on if he had seen. \u2026 I finally went to detox.\u201d\n\nIn the intensive care unit hospital room, Medlin and her doctor start talking treatment. Medlin can\u2019t keep the prescription-strength ibuprofen down. She\u2019s getting a steroid pack to help with the pain.\n\nCarbiener promises to work with the pharmacist in the morning.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to do it today? Just asking, just asking,\u201d Medlin said.\n\nCarbiener asks if her mom is coming to pick her up. No, Medlin says, she has the car.\n\n\u201cIf I were to give you a script today, would you give it to your parents when you get home?\u201d her doctor asks.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Medlin says. \u201cI\u2019m going home after we\u2019re done here for a couple hours to chill out.\u201d\n\nCarbiener nods.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give your mom a call and make sure she knows you have a script that needs to be handed to her when you get home,\u201d Carbiener says.\n\nMedlin also received a steroid shot for her back pain. If those don\u2019t work, she may get the nerve endings in her back burned so she doesn\u2019t feel pain.\n\nOnce Hillary Medlin is weaned off opioids, she can go into a residential treatment program called WARM: Women Assisting Recovering Mothers.\n\nWARM was originally founded to help snow babies, babies born to mothers addicted to cocaine and crack. The program has evolved to treat women addicted to pills.\n\nParticipation in WARM ballooned alongside the state's prescription drug crisis. The program that started with 16 beds now has 80. Alicia Vincent is the program director for WARM. She says it\u2019s scary how many women are afraid to seek help.\n\n\u201cThe thought process is there if I or my baby test positive at birth the state is gonna step in and remove my baby,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cNot always the case, but still that fear factor is there, so a lot of women remain over in the shadow because they don\u2019t want to run that risk.\u201d\n\nRhonda Harvey and Alicia Vincent work with WARM. They flip through a box of photos of women who have been though the program. One photo stops them.\n\nSome come through the program successfully, Vincent said. And some don\u2019t make it.\n\n\u201cThis young lady here didn\u2019t make it, is not currently parenting that baby,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cYou can tell him where she is now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis current lady here, in heaven,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cShe died.\u201d\n\nHarvey tears up at the photo. Harvey said the staff at WARM finds strength in those tragedies. Every day, the goal is to not let it happen again.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harvey says, her voice wavering.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d Vincent says. \u201cThis, oh. We gotta put the box away.\u201d\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
