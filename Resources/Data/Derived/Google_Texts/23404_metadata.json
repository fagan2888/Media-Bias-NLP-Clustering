It allowed him to \u201cquickly and easily send encrypted photos of his three children across dodgy Eastern European network lines to the rest of his family.\u201d Now, the peer-to-peer file synchronization tool boasts two million users a month and is developing into BitTorrent's primary product. Wired shines some light on the motivation for the move around:\n\nA big part of the commercial opportunity for the tool, BitTorrent executives believe, lies in the reality that large corporations are aggressively reining in data following Snowden\u2019s revelations.\n\nLike Dropbox, BitTorrent Sync enables easy transfer of music, documents, and other files. But Sync's decentralized structure distinguishes it. Sync replaces data-storage centers, which the NSA can easily tap, with a peer-to-peer network. Like the BitTorrent protocol, users can share files directly, from one device to another. This leaves absolutely no opportunity for an agency like the NSA to harvest bulk data, because it cannot penetrate a central server. This method of file-sharing is somewhat less convenient because, Wired explains, \u201cin order to synchronize files across multiple systems, all must be online at the same time.\u201d But CEO Eric Klinker believes that the pros outweigh the cons for many consumers.\n\nSync has also been used as a platform for other exciting projects. Wired reports:\n\nTwo open source programmers, one in Texas and one in South Africa, have launched vole.cc, a distributed social network built on Sync. Last month, an engineer who works for Harvard University unveiled SyncNet, a parallel version of the world wide web that runs on Sync.\n\nDecentralized technologies are stirring a productive excitement. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency, similarly relies on a peer-to-peer protocol. Projects like BitCloud, which aims to \u201cdecentralize the internet,\u201d are popping up. The sharing economy is nurturing disruptive technologies that grant increased privacy, cheaper access, and a decentralized protocol. The \u201cDropbox killer\u201d is embedded in that trend.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "BitTorrent Inc. is shifting&nbsp;the emphasis of its business to&nbsp;BitTorrent Sync, a transformative file-sharing service that boasts NSA resistance.", "title": "BitTorrent Sync: The NSA-Resistant File Sharing Service You Might Have Missed", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/02/12/a-nsa-resistant-file-sharing-service-you", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_02/-sarang-wikimedia.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "BitTorrent Inc. is shifting&nbsp;the\nemphasis of its business to&nbsp;BitTorrent Sync,\na transformative file-sharing service that boasts NSA\nresistance.\nLast year, Belarussian Konstantin Lissounov threw together a\ncrude version of Sync at a BitTorrent hackathon.
