Obamacare is bad deal for the young: the whole purpose of the plan was to rope young and healthy people into paying for insurance they don’t use, freeing up money to pay for us older, and generally wealthier, folks.

The net result of two years experience with Obamacare is that enrollments are not keeping pace with targets, leading to rising insurance losses, as The Wall Street Journal notes:

Recruitment for 2015 is roughly 70% of the original projection, but ObamaCare will be running at less than half its goal in 2016. HHS believes some 19 million Americans earn too much for Medicaid but qualify for ObamaCare subsidies and haven’t signed up. Some 8.5 million of that 19 million purchase off-exchange private coverage with their own money, while the other 10.5 million are still uninsured. In other words, for every person who’s allowed to join and has, two people haven’t.

Among this population of the uninsured, HHS reports that half are between the ages of 18 and 34 and nearly two-thirds are in excellent or very good health. The exchanges won’t survive actuarially unless they attract this prime demographic.
