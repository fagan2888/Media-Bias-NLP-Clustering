Secret Service agents said nearly 800 victims lost more than $57 million after investing in Wilson's company, Atlantic Bullion and Coin.

Wilson was sentenced to 19 and a half years.

Wilson's wife, Cassie, and brother, Tim, were indicted along with him on a charge of conspiring to obstruct justice. Ronnie Wilson was also charged with lying to federal agents.

A Secret Service agent and an official in charge of receiving assets from Wilson that were to be used to reimburse victims discovered $400,000 in cash, gold and silver hidden in an ammunition canister, according to U.S. Attorney Bill Nettles.

Nettles said that Ronnie Wilson gave the cash and coins to his brother and wife after his arrest in an effort to hide it from investigators.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Watkins said, “When he indicated to agents that he turned over all the money and assets related to the Ponzi scheme, the government charges in the indictment that that was not a true statement.”

Wilson is now facing up to 15 more years in prison for the conspiracy charge and the charge of giving a false statement. If convicted, his wife and brother both face up to five years as well. While the receiver is still working to get victims back some of their money he says Wilson spent a lot of it and says it'll likely only be pennies on the dollar.
