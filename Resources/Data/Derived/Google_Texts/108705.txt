Friday on CNN, a cartoonist from Iran, who came to Paris to flee persecution, defended murdered Charlie Hebdo editor Stéphane Charbonnier (Charb), from one of the founding members of the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo, Henri Roussel’s criticisms that Charb “dragged the team into overdoing it,” as reported by The Telegraph.

Partial transcript as follows:

CNN REPORTER: He made a specific criticism of the editor, Charb, and said he pushed the message too far. After the fire bombing a few years ago, he kept publishing cartoons offensive to some. Speculation is it led to attacks that happened behind us.

CARTOONIST: I cannot believe that. I had the chance to know some of them. These cartoonists are so crazy and independent. No one can have drag them anywhere.

CNN REPORTER: Charb said a few years ago he would rather die than live like a rat. He was willing to be killed for these cartoons and this thought he wanted to express. Did the others — do the others who work in this magazine feel the same way?

CARTOONIST: I think yes. I think they knew what they were doing, and they know what they’re doing. They believe what they’re doing. I don’t think that they’re going to change or, for example, Charb, changed their mind in any way. I can’t believe that.
