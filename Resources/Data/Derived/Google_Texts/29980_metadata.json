What part of democracy are they afraid of?\u201d\u2014HRC \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 6, 2015\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s free-falling public image poll numbers have impelled the often rigid and robotic presumed Democratic nominee to adopt a more aggressive tack, according to The Washington Post The former secretary of state\u2019s new posture, according to the Post, has included \"almost daily attacks on the better-known contenders among the wide Republican field,\" the \"surprise release of her health and tax information late last month on the same day as a very public airing \u2014 in the home state of [former Florida Gov. Jeb] Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) \u2014 of her policy reversal on U.S. relations with Cuba,\" and \"a preemptive spin campaign\" ahead of the first GOP debate.Just before the \"happy hour\" debate kicked off at 5 p.m. Thursday, Clinton blasted a needling message on Twitter, one that embodied the tone of her new demeanor.Wrote Clinton in a Twitter message typical of her recent postings:The \"elbows-out approach\" by the \"no-false-moves\" candidate is designed to counter critics within her party that \"despite posturing as a fighter, she has rarely taken the gloves off,\" the Post reports.She\u2019s also been forced to take more risks as a result of the unforeseen popularity of progressive Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and rumblings that Vice President Joe Biden may get into the race.A recent NBC-Wall Street Journal poll found that Clinton\u2019s favorability rating dropped to 37 percent, from 44 percent, between June and July, according to the Post, while other surveys saw Clinton\u2019s lead over Sanders' diminishing.A June piece by the Post reported on the results of a Post-ABC poll that found Clinton\u2019s favorability ratings had fallen to their lowest since April 2008, when she first ran for president.The poll found that 52 percent of Americans said Clinton is not trustworthy, \"a 22-point swing in the past year,\" according to the Post, which noted that Clinton support from both independents and Democrats had diminished.In July, The Hill reported on a Quinnipiac University survey of voters in Colorado, Iowa and Virginia. The results were staggering.When tested against leading Republican contenders \u2014 Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2014 Clinton lost every state to every opponent.\"President [Barack] Obama won all three states in both of his presidential election victories, but they went for former President George W. Bush almost as uniformly in 2004 and 2000,\" according to The Hill.Clinton allies tell the Post that the \"new injection of energy is partly an effort to counter negative coverage of her email foibles and her falling poll numbers\" while her campaign maintains that a decline in polling numbers is expected as the race moves into full swing.The campaign insists its recent launch of a $2 million advertising campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 spots that cast Clinton as a \"champion for working people and families\" \u2014 had already been in the works and are in no way a reaction to the falling numbers.\"You\u2019re going to get nicked up a bit\" over a long campaign, chief strategist and pollster Joel Benenson said Wednesday. \"This is a marathon, not a sprint.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "hillary clinton, campaign, polls, popularity, attack", "pubdate": "2015-08-10T08:17:45", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Hillary Clinton's free-falling public image poll numbers have impelled the often rigid and robotic presumed Democratic nominee to adopt a more aggressive tack and \"elbows-out approach\" toward \"the better-known contenders\" in the Republican field, The Washington Post says.", "title": "Hillary's Poll Numbers Continue Slide", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/hillary-clinton-campaign-polls-popularity/2015/08/10/id/669305/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=5d16decd-b206-40ba-807a-cfa0e655da85&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/hillary-clinton-campaign-polls-popularity/2015/08/10/id/669305/", "title": "Hillary's Poll Numbers Continue Slide", "description": "Hillary Clinton's free-falling public image poll numbers have impelled the often rigid and robotic presumed Democratic nominee to adopt a more aggressive tack and \"elbows-out approach\" toward \"the better-known contenders\" in the Republican field, The Washington Post says.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1439194665, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "hillary clinton, campaign, polls, popularity, attack", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2015-08-10T08:17:45"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/hillary-clinton-campaign-polls-popularity/2015/08/10/id/669305/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Hillary Clinton's free-falling public image poll numbers have impelled the often rigid and robotic presumed Democratic nominee to adopt a more aggressive tack and  elbows-out approach  toward  the better-known contenders  in the Republican field, The Washington Post says."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0d3\"", "article_summary": "\"You\u2019re going to get nicked up a bit\" over a long campaign, chief strategist and pollster Joel Benenson said Wednesday.\nThe results were staggering.When tested against leading Republican contenders \u2014 Florida Sen.
