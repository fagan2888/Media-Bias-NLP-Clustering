It should also be an asset that you can generally understand or relate to. Otherwise, how do you know if it\u2019s performing as it should?\n\n\n\nGiven this, the one asset class that people may want to consider is real estate\u2013probably not residential real estate but more like real estate investment trusts (REITs) or possibly some commingled funds that invest in commercial real estate. This asset class is relatively easy to understand, tends to pay a high dividend and also can generate additional return through capital appreciation.\n\nThese types of investments might be especially appropriate for investors as they move to the near and in-retirement phases of their life.\n\nLarry D.
