Professor Shiller, who has taught at Yale since 1982, has signed up 67,582 students for his online lectures, which will be webcast starting in February.\n\nThat tally puts him behind other Coursera hits, which tend to rack up enrollment above 150,000. Thus far, the most popular courses at the site, which launched last year((2012)), are \u201cSocial Psychology,\u201d with almost 260,000 enrolled students; \u201cThink Again: How to Reason and Argue,\u201d with 226,000; and \u201cA Beginner\u2019s Guide to Irrational Behavior,\u201d at 203,000.\n\nThe third might be a good foundation for study with Mr. Shiller, a scholar of behavioral economics and author of \u201cIrrational Exuberance,\u201d a study of volatility in financial and housing markets. Mr. Shiller said his Coursera lectures will contain \u201csome behavioral finance.\u201d\n\nThe lectures aim \u201cto offer understanding of the theory of finance and its relation to the history, strengths and imperfections of such institutions as banking, insurance, securities, futures, and other derivatives markets, and the future of these institutions over the next century,\u201d according to the Coursera description. Participation is free; staying the course through the estimated 6-12 hour-a-week workload doesn\u2019t convey any credits\u2014but there also appear to be no exams or grades.\n\nMost teachers tape their lectures before the course launches and don\u2019t wing it before live cameras in the classroom, the Coursera representative said. Professor Shiller is no stranger to long-distance pedagogy. The lectures for his 2008 undergraduate \u201cFinancial Markets\u201d course were taped and offered online through the \u201cOpen Yale Courses.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Shiller and the University of Chicago\u2019s Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen, received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for their research on asset prices.\n\nIn an October telephone interview with the prize committee, shortly after learning their decision, Mr. Shiller said he gravitated to economics \u201cbecause it deals with really important problems\u2026Finance drew me in because it\u2019s so fundamental to human activity\u2026It follows precise mathematical relations but there\u2019s an element of imprecision that reflects human nature.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Nobel laureate Robert Shiller is getting a global classroom\u2014and signing up tens of thousands of students around the world for his \u201cFinancial Markets\u201d lectures on Coursera.", "title": "Rejected by Yale?
