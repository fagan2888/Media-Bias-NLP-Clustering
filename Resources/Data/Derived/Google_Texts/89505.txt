The group, A Better South Walton, Inc. (ABSW), is looking for residents to get involved.

The nonprofit organization was founded to seek more effective governance and local representation for South Walton. Along with exploring South Walton’s options, ABSW has created a survey to be distributed throughout the community to determine the issues most important to the citizens and what they value.

“Community input is critical to us as we move forward,” A Better South Walton Vice President Dave Rauschkolb, said.

The survey will provide citizens with the opportunity to weigh in on

infrastructure, governmental representation, natural resources, public services, the built environment and more.

In a press release, David Pleat, president of ABSW said, "After months of searching for experts to author the study and much careful consideration, ABSW has hired Bill Underwood, of Underwood Management Services Group, Inc. and Jon Moyle of the Moyle Law Firm to complete the study document. Underwood’s strong economic and fiscal analysis background was key to our decision, and Moyle’s deep North Florida roots combined with his extensive work throughout Florida’s communities made his firm a good choice. We are currently

finalizing an agreement with the John Scott Dailey Florida Institute of Government at the University of Central Florida to review the study when it is complete. We look forward to bringing a fully vetted and reliable feasibility study to the citizens of South Walton in the coming months."

The study will also be reviewed by the Florida League of Cities, a non-partisan organization that promotes success in local governance.
