From The Atlantic:\n\nAnd if Shakespeare (or Catullus or Vergil) makes students uncomfortable? That\u2019s a good thing, Teller said. Learning, like magic, should make people uncomfortable, because neither are passive acts. Elaborating on the analogy, he continued, \u201cMagic doesn\u2019t wash over you like a gentle, reassuring lullaby. In magic, what you see comes into conflict with what you know, and that discomfort creates a kind of energy and a spark that is extremely exciting. That level of participation that magic brings from you by making you uncomfortable is a very good thing.\u201d As we were on the subject of discomfort I asked Teller what he thinks of schools\u2019 efforts to protect students from discomfort as they learn through censoring teachers\u2019 content and requirements for trigger warnings. For the first time in our conversation, Teller illustrated the power of his trademark silence, and the line went quiet. Just as I\u2019d begun to think we\u2019d been disconnected, he replied, \u201cWhen I go outside at night and look up at the stars, the feeling that I get is not comfort. The feeling that I get is a kind of delicious discomfort at knowing that there is so much out there that I do not understand and the joy in recognizing that there is enormous mystery, which is not a comfortable thing. This, I think, is the principal gift of education.\u201d\n\nThe whole interview is worth reading. Teller is a fascinating person, and was no doubt a fascinating teacher. He told The Atlantic that on his first day as a teacher, he threw away the textbook and constructed his own curriculum. \u201cI taught [Latin] with a set of Latin readers I composed myself, complete with illustrations, called Lingua Latina Pictorius,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s deeply unfortunate that the public school system doesn\u2019t reward teachers like Teller who think outside the box. No, it does the opposite: creative, entrepreneurial teachers are thwarted at every turn until they give up. Thanks to numerous rules imposed on schools by politically powerful teachers unions, administrators are forced to reward seniority and credentials, rather than merit. It\u2019s endlessly frustrating for young, enterprising teachers to watch their older, less competent, less invested colleagues automatically collect more money than they do\u2014because they have been on staff longer, or hold advanced degrees. According to a report from the New Teacher Project, the system incentivizes bad teachers to keep teaching while driving better teachers out of the field.\n\nThe best way to fix the status quo is to disrupt it: empower students to choose innovative schools where teachers are rewarded for working hard to deliver an enchanting education. This week is National School Choice Week, which means it\u2019s a great time to celebrate all the reasons why giving families more of a say in their children\u2019s futures is smart policy: for kids, parents, and teachers (the good apples, at least).
