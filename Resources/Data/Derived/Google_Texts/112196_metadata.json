It already accounts for a small library\u2019s worth of excellent volumes, from coffee table books to natural histories probing its unique ecology. With The Reef: A Passionate History, however, Iain McCalman has produced something important and utterly new: a detailed and engaging account of human interactions with the largest coral reef on the planet.\n\nStretching 1,250 miles along the eastern coast of Australia, the Great Barrier Reef (actually a collection of more than 2,500 separate reefs) is home to thousands of species of corals, fish, whales, crustaceans, sea turtles, sponges, and countless smaller but ecologically vital creatures. In what could best be described as an unnatural history, McCalman, a research professor of history at the University of Sydney, chronicles the slow discovery and quick unraveling of this unique ecosystem by humans who have viewed the reef primarily through the distorting prisms of fear, greed, and ignorance for more than two centuries.\n\nThe 1770 expedition led by Lieutenant James Cook sets the tone for this epic tale. Sailing the HMS Endeavor into what he thought was open water (but was really a lagoon between the barrier reef and the Australian mainland), the British explorer soon ran the three-master aground. It was a near-disastrous first encounter.\n\n\u201cWe envisage the men,\u201d writes McCalman, \u201cwith horror frozen on every face and oaths stifled in their throats, staggering to retain balance as the ship tilts and beats against the rocks with a grating that can be felt through every plank\u2026.Stark disappointment greets the risen tide\u2019s failure to reach the ship\u2019s bottom, let alone float it free. There remains only the faint hope that the night tide will be fuller.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iain McCalman's new book, \"The Reef,\" offers a riveting account of the World Heritage Site's tragic demise", "author": "Osha Gray Davidson", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Iain McCalman's new book, \"The Reef,\" offers a riveting account of the World Heritage Site's tragic demise", "title": "\u201cLike seeing a house on fire in slow motion\u201d: The painful destruction of the Great Barrier reef", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/07/like_seeing_a_house_on_fire_in_slow_motion_the_painful_destruction_of_the_great_barrier_reef_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shutterstock_143133079.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iain McCalman's new book, \"The Reef,\" offers a riveting account of the World Heritage Site's tragic demise", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shutterstock_143133079.jpg", "title": "\u201cLike seeing a house on fire in slow motion\u201d: The painful destruction of the Great Barrier reef", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cLike seeing a house on fire in slow motion\u201d: The painful destruction of the Great Barrier reef", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Australia, Climate Change, crude oil, great barrier reef, OnEarth.org", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca9ac\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Australia, Climate Change, crude oil, great barrier reef, OnEarth.org, Sustainability NewsThis article originally appeared on OnEarth.org.\nDoes the world really need another book about the Great Barrier Reef?\nSailing the HMS Endeavor into what he thought was open water (but was really a lagoon between the barrier reef and the Australian mainland), the British explorer soon ran the three-master aground.\nStretching 1,250 miles along the eastern coast of Australia, the Great Barrier Reef (actually a collection of more than 2,500 separate reefs) is home to thousands of species of corals, fish, whales, crustaceans, sea turtles, sponges, and countless smaller but ecologically vital creatures.\nIt already accounts for a small library\u2019s worth of excellent volumes, from coffee table books to natural histories probing its unique ecology."}
