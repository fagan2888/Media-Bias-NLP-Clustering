Police say a 30-year-old man driving a Honda motorcycle and driving northbound crossed over into the southbound lane of traffic and began to lay down the motorcycle.\n\nA gray Ford Fusion traveling southbound hit the motorcycle, according to LMPD spokesman Dwight Mitchell. The driver of the Ford was not injured, but the motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene. He was wearing a helmet at the time of the collision.\n\nNo charges are expected in that collision.\n\nHalf a day later and about 20 miles away, another motorcyclist was pronounced dead near the intersection of Cane Run Road and Poplar View Drive.\n\nAround 2:15 p.m., a Chrysler 300 tried to turn left onto southbound Cane Run Road, but failed to notice a motorcycle traveling north on Cane Run, Mitchell said. The motorcycle struck the car.\n\nNo one besides the motorcyclist was injured in that second accident. Mitchell said he didn't believe alcohol was a factor in the collision. He said the LMPD traffic division is still investigating.\n\nTraffic on Cane Run Road is currently moving slowly as police work the scene. Mitchell said there are no detours at this point, though.\n\nReporter Allison Ross can be reached at (502) 582-4241.\n\nWeekend crime reports:\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1QF0d6u", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Two motorcyclists were killed Sunday in separate crashes only\u00a012 hours apart, according to reports from Louisville Metro Police.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Two motorcyclists were killed Sunday in separate crashes only\u00a012 hours apart, according to reports from Louisville Metro Police.", "title": "2 motorcyclists killed in separate crashes", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/traffic/2015/12/13/2-motorcyclists-killed-separate-crashes/77250650/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two motorcyclists were killed Sunday in separate crashes only\u00a012 hours apart, according to reports from Louisville Metro Police.", "title": "2 motorcyclists killed in separate crashes", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/22943d3706142b72b33ac5fafa6e3da288fbb29f/c=270-0-2070-1800&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Louisville Metro Police", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Louisville Metro Police", "title": "2 motorcyclists killed in separate crashes", "author": "Allison Ross", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/traffic", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67e08e819316be0b0613ee360f1f38dd4676dd97/c=912-0-2262-1800/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a516b6984b90fa2846d187e0f484deb793b19473/c=270-0-2070-1800/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fb7f606117e15dc4d8f066be7d1b86be505bcd02/c=0-21-2339-1780/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/86ab9c11f6ddcba05d30d8e702a47c636e657602/c=0-239-2339-1560&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-13T15:37:48.390000-05:00", "shorthed": "2 motorcyclists killed in separate crashes", "articleid": 77250650, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c233ae9fc8cc752c9313df8fb42bb057c8613e74/c=0-239-2339-1560/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/517d67d82a641bd3510fa80fd1ba159ebf38a4b7/c=1139-0-2147-1800/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "LMPD, fatal crash, motorcycle, Cane Run Road, Poplar View Road, accident, Allison Ross"}, "article_summary": "Illustration (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)Two motorcyclists were killed Sunday in separate crashes only 12 hours apart, according to reports from Louisville Metro Police.\nAround 2:15 p.m., a Chrysler 300 tried to turn left onto southbound Cane Run Road, but failed to notice a motorcycle traveling north on Cane Run, Mitchell said.\nTraffic on Cane Run Road is currently moving slowly as police work the scene.\nHalf a day later and about 20 miles away, another motorcyclist was pronounced dead near the intersection of Cane Run Road and Poplar View Drive.\nA gray Ford Fusion traveling southbound hit the motorcycle, according to LMPD spokesman Dwight Mitchell."}
