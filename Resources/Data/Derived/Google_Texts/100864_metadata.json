The country's current bailout programme expires at the end of February.\n\nTsipras struck a conciliatory tone saying he wanted a \"Win-Win situation\" for all parties. However, the new Greek government's confrontational style has alienated some politicians in Germany, the euro zone's paymaster.\n\nHans Michelbach, a senior conservative lawmaker, said the new government needed to prove that it \"was not just about sham-compliance\" and warned Greece's euro zone partners against granting Athens too many concessions.\n\n\"There are programmes which have been signed by Greece and to which the new government is tied. International agreements cannot be voted away,\" he was quoted as saying in the Handelsblatt newspaper on Saturday.
