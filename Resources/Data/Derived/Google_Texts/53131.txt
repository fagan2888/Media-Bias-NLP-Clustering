On Sunday, the metro area may see some sun and temperatures warmer than the 31 degrees that was Saturday’s high, according to the National Weather Service.

Denver’s sky will be overcast in the morning, but some of those clouds should clear away in the afternoon, said NWS meteorologist Scott Entrekin.

“We may see some sun this afternoon, there’s still some high clouds this morning, but some of that will be peeling away,” Entrekin said.

The temperature is expected to reach a high of 39 degrees.

Another storm system is expected to bring snow late Monday and Tuesday in the Denver area, with an estimated three inches of accumulation on each day.

Temperatures on the Plains will be similar, but it should be cloudy throughout the day on Sunday.

In the high country, temperatures will be in the 20s, and skies will be mostly cloudy.
