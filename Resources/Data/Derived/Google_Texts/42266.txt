Jean Yang, the executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, will step down Jan. 16.

Yang has overseen in the Health Connector, Massachusetts' health insurance marketplace, since January 2013. Before that, she was its chief financial officer. During her tenure, the Connector struggled through a troubled launch in 2013, when the website was a technological disaster and unable to enroll people in new insurance plans that conformed with the Affordable Care Act. She remained on the job through a far smoother launch in 2014.

After the difficulties in 2013, Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, brought in new leadership to oversee the fixes to the website. Sarah Iselin, who was later replaced by Maydad Cohen, was brought in as Patrick's special assistant to work with Yang, the leadership of MassHealth, a new technology vendor and others to oversee the project.

Cohen will take over for Yang as interim executive director of the Health Connector, while also continuing to serve as a special assistant to the governor.

Cohen has said he will remain on the job until this year's open enrollment period ends Feb. 15, in order to provide some continuity at the health insurance exchange.

Yang will leave days after Republican Charlie Baker is sworn in as governor. Baker has been critical of the state's handling of the Health Connector, so it is likely that he would have replaced Yang with his own appointee.

Health Connector board member Celia Wcislo said in a statement that as the pressure on the Health Connector grew, "Jean was a steady hand leading the organization forward."

"Despite the challenges Jean and her staff faced, she was able to keep the focus on the task at hand and keep her team motivated and engaged," Wcislo said.
