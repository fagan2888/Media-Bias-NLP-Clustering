Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), who is the co-chairman of communications for the group, said Wednesday the recruitment came about after the government shutdown last October.\n\n\u201cTheir deep commitment to fiscal responsibility and reaching across the aisle when crafting public policy is just the sort of leadership we need to solve the problems facing our country,\u201d Schrader said in a release.\n\nThe coalition, which at one point numbered 54 members, was cut down to 15 in 2013 after a string of retirements and failed reelections.\n\nAll of the new members \u2014 with the exception of Rahall who has served in the chamber since 1977 \u2014 are relatively new to the House. Both Bustos and Sinema are freshmen.\n\nBarber is serving his first full term in office after being sworn in mid-way through 2012 to replace former coalition member Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.).\n\nAll the new members won their last elections with less than 55 percent of the vote. The National Republican Congressional Committee has singled out both Barber and Rahall, who represent red-leaning districts that went to Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nDemocrats have also looked to protect the swing districts held by the new Blue Dog members. All but Rahall have been named to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s Frontline Program, which protects vulnerable incumbents.\n\nThe Blue Dog coalition has been bleeding members since after the 2008 elections, when their numbers peaked.\n\nRep. Pete Gallego (D-Texas) was the only freshman member to immediately join the group after last year\u2019s election. Barber and Sinema had joined another centrist Democratic group, the New Democrat Coalition, after the election. Gallego is a member as well.\n\nThe recruitment comes as a number of others members are leaving.\n\nBlue Dog Reps. Jim Matheson (D-Utah) and Mike McIntyre (D-N.C.), who won two of the closest elections in 2012, have already announced they will retire in 2014. Another coalition member, Rep. Mike Michaud (D-Maine) has announced a run for governor in the state.\n\n\u2014Updated at 4:35 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Reps. are Ron Barber, Kyrsten Sinema of Ariz., Cheri Bustos (Ill.) and Nick Rahall (W.Va.).", "description": "Reps. are Ron Barber, Kyrsten Sinema of Ariz., Cheri Bustos (Ill.) and Nick Rahall (W.Va.).", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Reps. are Ron Barber, Kyrsten Sinema of Ariz., Cheri Bustos (Ill.) and Nick Rahall (W.Va.).", "title": "Blue Dogs recruit four vulnerable Dems", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/briefing-room/news/195558-blue-dogs-recruit-four-vulnerable-members", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-15T21:34:24-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-01-15T21:34-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/briefing-room/news/195558-blue-dogs-recruit-four-vulnerable-members", "dcterms.date": "2014-01-15T15:02-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Blue Dog Coalition,Cheri Bustos, Ron Barber, Kyrsten Sinema, Nick Rahall,Blue Dog Coalition", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-15T15:02:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-15T21:34:24-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/briefing-room/news/195558-blue-dogs-recruit-four-vulnerable-members", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Reps. are Ron Barber, Kyrsten Sinema of Ariz., Cheri Bustos (Ill.) and Nick Rahall (W.Va.).", "card": "summary", "title": "Blue Dogs recruit four vulnerable Dems"}, "dcterms.title": "Blue Dogs recruit four vulnerable Dems"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde6a\"", "article_summary": "Another coalition member, Rep.
