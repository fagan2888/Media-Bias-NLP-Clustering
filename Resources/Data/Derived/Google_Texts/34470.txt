The Drake University Student Senate has refused to recognize a conservative group's chapter as a student organization.



The Senate voted 15-3 on April 21 to deny a request by Turning Point USA.



The organization says it was founded in 2012 to educate and organize students to promote the principles of fiscal responsibility, free markets, and limited government.

Amy Samuel has been helping organize the Des Moines campus chapter, and she told the Iowa City Press-Citizen that she and Turning Point's regional director will meet next week with university officials to learn why the application was rejected.

Associate Dean of Students Jerry Parker says the Turning Point USA members will need to go through the approval process again.
