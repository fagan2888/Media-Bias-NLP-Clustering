Huckabee launched his campaign earlier this month at a rally in Arkansas.\n\nNow, Huckabee has put forward a pro-life \u201cPledge to the People\u201d that he says is the only pledge he will sign as a candidate for president.\n\n\u201cI am hard at work on the campaign trail in Arizona this morning, but I wanted to send you a quick note to make sure you had seen my \u201cPledge to the People\u201d. It is the only pledge I am signing as a candidate for President. This campaign is about you and this pledge is about you,\u201d Huckabee said in an email to his supporters.\n\nThe pledge covers a host of political issues, including pro-life topics and opposing the pro-abortion Obamacare. Under the pledge, Huckabee promises:\n\n* I will stand for the sanctity of all human life from the moment of conception until the grave. Taking this unequivocal stand includes fighting to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n* I will now, and will for the duration of my presidency, promote and sign all measures leading to Obamacare\u2019s defunding, deauthorization, and repeal.\n\n\u201cLife begins at conception. This is not just a Biblical view \u2014 it is affirmed by modern science and every unique human DNA schedule, which is present at conception. Our value, and celebration, of every unique human life is the basic tenant of our freedom and should never be abandoned,\u201d Huckabee says.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\n\u201cAs Governor, I promoted and signed a fetal protection act. I imposed a ban on partial birth abortion, established waiting periods, created parental notification requirements, and passed a bill so mothers who brought a newborn to a hospital or fire station would not be prosecuted for child abandonment,\u201d he continued. \u201cAs President, I will always stand for the sanctity of all human life from the moment of conception until the grave.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs President I will fight to end abortion,\u201d he concludes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mike Huckabee Pledges to De-Fund the Planned Parenthood Abortion Business", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has signed a pledge to promote pro-life values as president and to de-fund the Planned Parenthood abortion busin", "title": "Mike Huckabee: As President I Will Fight to End Abortion, De-Fund Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/05/15/mike-huckabee-pledges-to-de-fund-the-planned-parenthood-abortion-business/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/mikehuckabee3.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "mike huckabee pledges to de-fund the planned parenthood abortion business", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has signed a pledge to promote pro-life values as president and to de-fund the Planned Parenthood abortion business.\n\u201cAs President, I will always stand for the sanctity of all human life from the moment of conception until the grave.\u201d\u201cAs President I will fight to end abortion,\u201d he concludes.\nNow, Huckabee has put forward a pro-life \u201cPledge to the People\u201d that he says is the only pledge he will sign as a candidate for president.\nUnder the pledge, Huckabee promises:* I will stand for the sanctity of all human life from the moment of conception until the grave.\nOur value, and celebration, of every unique human life is the basic tenant of our freedom and should never be abandoned,\u201d Huckabee says."}
