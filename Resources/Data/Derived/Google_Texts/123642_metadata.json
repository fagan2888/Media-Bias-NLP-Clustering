Everything that any analyst or consultant or professional would tell you not to do, Donald Trump is doing it, and he\u2019s leading the pack. This creates its own set of emotions and feelings and thoughts that run from person to person. Now, the political business, if you want to look at it that way, is like any other business. It has its people who are considered the elites in it \u2014 and like any business, they hate outsiders. They don\u2019t want outsiders just storming in trying to take over, and much less succeeding at it. Like any group of elites, they\u2019re exclusionary. They want to keep people out. They want to be in charge of who gets in the club. They want to be in charge of who\u2019s allowed to rise or climb the ladder in the club. Politics is no different, and all of those determinations are made by who gets money and who doesn\u2019t. But Trump is functioning totally outside this structure that has existed for decades. As such, the people who are only familiar with the structure and believe in it and cherish it and want to protect it, feel threatened in ways that you can\u2019t even comprehend.\n\nLimbaugh also described the cordial relationships he shares with Trump, moderator Megyn Kelly and Fox News head Roger Ailes. Limbaugh\u2019s fondness for Ailes and Kelly comes as no surprise \u2014 the three are natural allies as members of an influential and lucrative conservative media apparatus.\n\nBut Limbaugh\u2019s approval of Donald Trump as a candidate is not so easily explained.\n\nLimbaugh has made a career out of deriding centrist RINOs (Republicans in Name Only) for their willingness to negotiate with Democrats and in the process sacrifice key conservative values. (See his frequent mocking references to Lindsey \u201cGrahamnesty.\u201d) But in Trump, Limbaugh has offered consistently flattering coverage to a man who once supported abortion rights and the assault weapons ban, and told CNN in 2004, \u201cIn many cases, I probably identify more as Democrat.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Trump\u2019s conservative bona fides are far from rock solid, so why hasn\u2019t Limbaugh subjected Trump to the criticism one might expect he would aim at a former Hillary Clinton donor?\n\nOn one issue specifically, Trump has played right into Limbaugh\u2019s wheelhouse. The hard-line immigration rhetoric that fueled Trump\u2019s summer rise resulted in favorable Limbaugh coverage from the start of the campaign season. In July, Limbaugh praised Trump for having \u201cchanged the entire debate on immigration,\u201d calling it a \u201cblinding achievement\u201d and noting that he had \u201cbeen saying similar things.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh and Trump had been on friendly terms for some time before that. Limbaugh spoke of golfing with Trump back in 2011, and Trump has consistently praised the radio host for years on Twitter:\n\nCongratulations to my friend @limbaugh on being named to the \"Hall of Famous Missourians.\" Rush is a great guy & a great character. \u2014 Donald J.
