(Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\n4504393\n\nAn erstwhile Minnesota Obamacare customer told a state panel Tuesday that a flub with the state\u2019s exchange over his late wife\u2019s health insurance ultimately killed her.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Charlie Dunker told a state House committee, the Associated Press reports. \u201cShe\u2019d be here today if it wasn\u2019t for MNsure.\u201d\n\nDunker\u2019s wife, Gail Dunker, died of cancer earlier this year. The Dunkers canceled their private insurance plan after signing up at MNsure, the state-run Obamacare exchange, where they were told that they\u2019d pay nothing in monthly premiums after subsidies. After learning that Gail was ill, however, the Dunkers were told that they didn\u2019t have coverage after all.\n\n\u201cBecause Gail didn\u2019t fill out the form they wanted, they let her die,\u201d Dunker told the panel. \u201cPlain and simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cancer she had was treatable. They told us that at the Mayo [Clinic],\u201d Dunker said. \u201cThey said, \u2018If she had been here when this first came up\u2026this cancer is very treatable.'\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was in Mayo from November to Jan. 9, when she died,\u201d Dunker said. \u201cWhen MNsure was jerking our chain, that\u2019s what happened. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nDunker said the couple was uninsured for months after his wife\u2019s diagnosis, making it difficult to get appointments to treat her cancer, while they attempted to fix the problem with MNsure and regain coverage. However, judges ruled against Dunker in a hearing on the issue, deciding that the couple hadn\u2019t been able to prove their lack of insurance was MNsure\u2019s fault, according to the AP.\n\nDunker was one of several Minnesota residents that spoke at the hearing, but others had more positive experiences. Mary Einspahr, another MNsure customer, told the panel that the exchange \u201csaved my life\u201d after signing up for Medical Assistance through the website.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House Health and Human Services Finance Committee panel voted to abandon MNsure, the state-run exchange in favor of HealthCare.gov, only if the Supreme Court rules in June that the Obamacare subsidies \u2014 and therefore the employer mandate \u2014 applies only to state-run exchanges.\n\n\u201cAs we see today, it is harming people in Minnesota, said Republican state Rep. Matt Dean.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Mark Dayton has requested $500,000 from the state legislature for a task force on whether the state should attempt to keep fixing the exchange or instead join HealthCare.gov, as other states with technology problems \u2014 Oregon and Nevada \u2014 have done.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "'She'd be here today if it wasn't for MNsure'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "An erstwhile Minnesota Obamacare customer told a state panel Tuesday that a flub with the state's exchange over his late wife's health insurance ultimately killed her.    \"Absolutely,\" Charlie Dunker", "title": "Minnesota Man Tells State Obamacare Exchange Its Glitches Killed His Wife", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/03/17/minnesota-man-tells-state-obamacare-exchange-its-glitches-killed-his-wife/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/462802374-e1452570396873.jpg", "height": 516}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'She'd be here today if it wasn't for MNsure'", "title": "Minnesota Man Tells State Obamacare Exchange Its Glitches Killed His Wife Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/03/17/minnesota-man-tells-state-obamacare-exchange-its-glitches-killed-his-wife/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/462802374-e1452570396873.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-17 18:55:56", "sailthru.title": "Minnesota Man Tells State Obamacare Exchange Its Glitches Killed His Wife", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "mnsure,obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "mnsure,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "An erstwhile Minnesota Obamacare customer told a state panel Tuesday that a flub with the state's exchange over his late wife's health insurance ultimately killed her.    \"Absolutely,\" Charlie Dunker", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/462802374-e1452570396873.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc68b\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)4504393An erstwhile Minnesota Obamacare customer told a state panel Tuesday that a flub with the state\u2019s exchange over his late wife\u2019s health insurance ultimately killed her.\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Charlie Dunker told a state House committee, the Associated Press reports.\n\u201cBecause Gail didn\u2019t fill out the form they wanted, they let her die,\u201d Dunker told the panel.\nThe Dunkers canceled their private insurance plan after signing up at MNsure, the state-run Obamacare exchange, where they were told that they\u2019d pay nothing in monthly premiums after subsidies.\n\u201cShe\u2019d be here today if it wasn\u2019t for MNsure.\u201dDunker\u2019s wife, Gail Dunker, died of cancer earlier this year."}
