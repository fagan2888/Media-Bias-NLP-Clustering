A seasoned pro of the old school, she is as prepared for the presidency as one could be. But in today\u2019s political dynamic, her assets are also liabilities, and could lead to her downfall, much to the frustration of many voters hoping to see the first woman president.\n\nBernie Sanders keeps winning primaries and caucuses, besting Clinton in Michigan on Tuesday in perhaps his most shocking victory thus far. He is raising boatloads of money, and following Michigan likely a lot more, which will make things more difficult for Hillary. Maybe there is a path for Bernie to win the nomination, but in the end, given the role of the superdelegates, it is still a very steep climb for him to win. Assuming Sanders doesn\u2019t win, that raises a big question: How will Hillary grapple with Trump?\n\nMany Democrats have been rubbing their hands in glee over the prospect of a Hillary/Donald general election. Maybe in the end they will be right. But in the meantime, there are many factors challenging that assumption. When added up, they suggest that Hillary must change and become a candidate of aspiration, not of pragmatism, or she could be in trouble.\n\nTrump and Sanders Emotional Connection\n\nNever in our lifetime have we had two potentially electable presidential candidates who are connecting in deep emotional ways with voters, using ideas and tactics far outside of the conventional wisdom of what was thought to be acceptable in America. Presidential politics in the U.S. will never be the same, and it surely won\u2019t if Trump is elected.\n\nThe old-style Hillary can seem like a bad therapist. She will listen to what you have to say, maybe even utter some soothing words, like I know how you feel, and then try to talk you out of your feelings. She will suggest what you are thinking isn\u2019t good for you. This is Hillary trying to tell the world that Bernie is unrealistic, impractical, the banks are complicated, there are no easy solutions, etc. This is not the approach that will motivate voters and bring the necessary turnout in key states that she needs, nor will it motivate younger voters hungry for change. In contrast, Trump voters are very motivated.\n\nTrump is essentially telling voters, \u201cYou have every reason to feel like you do; I feel the same way.\u201d He tells people their feelings matter. He is saying, I get it. I know why you are angry about immigrants taking your jobs (and yes, some of them do,) scared of Muslims after 15 years of steady fear-mongering by Bush/Cheney, conservatives, the FBI, etc. He also says, You are sick and tried of big money, lobbyists, the super-wealthy controlling the system at every turn rendering you, the voter, less than nothing. I feel your pain. I hear you. I know you are desperate and I will change things. Together we will make America great again.\n\nOf course, there is also a lot of misogynist, fascist, bullying, contemptous crap thrown into the mix of messages Trump puts out. But that does not mean Trump isn\u2019t tapping into the aspirations of his supporters. More on that in a moment.\n\nMeanwhile, Bernie is also articulating the way a lot of people really feel and not just liberals and progressives, but working-class people as well. This is why hedoes better than Hillary against Trump in polls. He is generally saying, Our system sucks. It is screwing you. I know it, you know it, I don\u2019t accept it, and you shouldn\u2019t either. Together we can do something about it.\n\nThe reason his message resonates among younger voters\u2014where there arestriking differences between support for Bernie and for Hillary\u2014is young people are the most screwed, with limited jobs, huge loans and few prospects. Hillary often suggests, Yes, we can fiddle around the edges, cut back on some of the high interest rate on student loans, maybe make the banks change a little\u2026 but that does not seem like enough. She may need to make a dramatic split with her past to get the attention she will need.\n\nThe old-style politics: rational, policy oriented, pundit-influenced, has been swept away by Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Why haven\u2019t we had candidates like this in the past? The quick answer is the combination of reality TV, social media, online fundraising, Fox TV and the infantilizing of the voters with disinformation by Republicans and the conservative media for the last decade and longer. On top of this is the overlay of massive inequality which translates to an electorate that has been trampled upon and left behind. The top 15% of Americans who most think like Hillary and the punditry\u2014their peers\u2014are not going to decide this election. And for the first time in our lifetime, there are radical options.\n\nThe Bad News on the Electability Front\n\nThe two most significant question marks on the horizon are Clinton\u2019s electability and the unknown effect of Trump\u2019s authoritarian appeal outside of the Republican Party.\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that Bernie Sanders\u2019 extraordinary and surprising campaign has made mincemeat of the Hillary inevitability-electability argument. Not too long ago, the entire mainstream media saw Bernie as a minor gadfly candidate, treated him with contempt, or more often just ignored him. They still treat him with contempt and hostility, especially at the Washington Post. Despite this, Bernie has won eight primaries and caucuses, though most gave him little or no chance after New Hampshire.\n\nTrue, Hillary shellacked Bernie in states where there are high numbers of black voters, who remain very enthusiastic about Hillary. But that will not be enough in the general election, even as she\u2019s won in 13 states so far. (Trump has won 15, Sanders has won 9.)\n\nBut more important are the weaknesses in the Clinton candidacy that Bernie\u2019s campaign has exposed. Writing on Salon, P.J. Podesta makes this case rather convincingly. Bernie has a much higher favorability rating than Hillary. He is far ahead in terms of his appeal to independent voters, who make up the largest block of overall voters, and consistently does better against GOP opponents including Trump. Bernie\u2019s popularity among young voters creates an almost mindboggling gap with Hillary. It will not be easy to motivate this idealistic constituency for Hillary, when she is unpopular among the millennials. Furthermore, Bernie has made inroads among working-class white voters, presumably an area of intense competition assuming the opponent is Trump. Hillary\u2019s main source of strength is minority voters\u2014very important, but not enough to clinch a victory.\n\nOn the issues front, Les Leopold writing on AlterNet strongly argues that Hillary\u2019s positions on three key issues\u2014trade, war and Wall Street/big banks\u2014make her vulnerable against an authoritarian populist candidate, which is what Trump will present. (Bernie is stronger on each of these issues, which leads Leopold to argue he is the better candidate against Trump.) Trump is likely to confound people with his positions in a general race, where he tilts left and right simultaneously, picking up angry working-class voters victimized by rising inequality, while attracting conservatives with his bellicose views on immigration and Muslims.\n\nTrump\u2019s Authoritarianism\n\nThe appeal of Trump\u2019s authoritarianism beyond the GOP race is the other big wild card. Matthew C. MacWilliams, writing on AlterNet and using his own research, makes a strong correlation between Trump voters and authoritarian tendencies in the GOP primaries. To many observers this is no surprise. The big question is how much the authoritarian appeal spreads to independent voters, more angry white males, as it is clear that authoritarian impulses cross party and class lines.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s support is firmly rooted in an American version of authoritarianism that, once awakened and stoked, is a force to be reckoned with,\u201d MacWilliams writes. \u201cAnd until quite recently, the institutions and leaders tasked with guarding against what Madison called \u2018the infection of the violent passions\u2019 among the people have either been cowed by Trump\u2019s bluster or derelict in performing their civic duty.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that conservatives and fearful racists have aspirations too. The search for higher meaning is universal, not just the province of progressives. As psychologist Michael Bader wrote on AlterNet:\n\n\u201cThe psychic need for a higher sense of meaning and purpose is manifested in many different ways. It\u2019s a need for significance. It\u2019s a longing to be part of something bigger and better than our lonely and isolated selves. Spiritual traditions and practices express it most directly in our culture. It\u2019s also a wish to connect with and influence the future, to be part of the flow of history. Artists feel it; social activists trying to change the world feel it; parents who strive to provide their children with a better future tap into this need. People feel it in every walk of life. When communities turn out to help each other following a disaster, you can see it expressed. People get satisfaction from contributing to the whole, and from being part of a community of meaning seeking to influence history.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic frontrunner has her work cut out for her.
