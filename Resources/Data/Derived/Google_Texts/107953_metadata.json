That was the same opinion held by Nancy Pelosi initially \u2014 in exchange for the GOP agreeing to Obama\u2019s border funding request, the House could tweak the 2008 child-trafficking law to make it easier for the feds to send kids back to Central America expeditiously. Then the Congressional Hispanic Caucus declared that it opposed changing the trafficking law; suddenly Pelosi had an epiphany and decided that she opposed it too. And now, lo and behold, here\u2019s Hillary having the same epiphany. She too opposes changing the child-trafficking law, no doubt knowing that the alternative \u2014 releasing young illegals to family members in the U.S. while they wait for a deportation hearing \u2014 means countless numbers will escape the system. Greg Sargent\u2019s right: She\u2019s moving to Obama\u2019s left to start her pandering to Latino voters bright and early before 2016.\n\nThe comic charm of this video, though, is that she\u2019s trying to pull this move while chatting with Jorge Ramos, which means no matter how hard she strains to move left, she ends up awkwardly forced to defend herself to a guy who\u2019s even farther left than she is. No, she reassures Ramos, I don\u2019t support the child-trafficking law; no, I don\u2019t want kids who qualify as legit \u201crefugees\u201d to be sent home; yes, I do support Obama\u2019s (terrible) idea to begin processing refugee applications in Central America. She\u2019s pandering as hard as she can. The only line she draws is that kids who don\u2019t qualify for \u201crefugee\u201d status must be sent back in theory, since, as noted above, in practice, many won\u2019t be sent back anyway. But she\u2019s saying all of this to a guy who\u2019s on record as believing that America shouldn\u2019t deport children, period. What you\u2019re watching here, basically, is a debate between someone who\u2019s avowedly in favor of open borders versus someone who prefers open borders on the sly, so that she can pretend to independents next year that she\u2019s kinda sorta serious about border enforcement. In fact, I\u2019d go so far as to say this is near-definitive proof that she\u2019s running for president. If she wasn\u2019t worried about alienating centrists, she could join Ramos in the \u201clegalize \u2019em\u201d parade.\n\nBy the way, per the Washington Times, immigration activists will be picketing the White House today demanding that illegal immigrants be included in White House deliberations on this issue. We normally invite foreigners into the Oval Office for negotiations on domestic policy, don\u2019t we?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Priorities.", "title": "Hillary: On second thought, maybe some of these illegal immigrant children shouldn\u2019t be sent back", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/07/28/hillary-on-second-thought-maybe-some-of-these-illegal-immigrant-children-shouldnt-be-sent-back/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "border crisis, fusion, Hillary Clinton, Honduras, illegal, immigrant, jorge ramos, refugee,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-28T16:41:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-28T16:41:14+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e6e\"", "article_summary": "Greg Sargent\u2019s right: She\u2019s moving to Obama\u2019s left to start her pandering to Latino voters bright and early before 2016.\nBut she\u2019s saying all of this to a guy who\u2019s on record as believing that America shouldn\u2019t deport children, period.\nHillary: On second thought, maybe some of these illegal immigrant children shouldn\u2019t be sent backposted at 12:41 pm on July 28, 2014 by AllahpunditVia America Rising, a few weeks ago she told Christiane Amanpour that kids coming across the border would have to be sent back.\nThen the Congressional Hispanic Caucus declared that it opposed changing the trafficking law; suddenly Pelosi had an epiphany and decided that she opposed it too.\nThe only line she draws is that kids who don\u2019t qualify for \u201crefugee\u201d status must be sent back in theory, since, as noted above, in practice, many won\u2019t be sent back anyway."}
