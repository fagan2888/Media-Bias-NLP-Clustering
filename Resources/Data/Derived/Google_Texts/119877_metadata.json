He also suggested that the long wait times that veterans were forced to deal with when it came to setting up appointments to see a doctor represented the future under Obamacare. Basically, this is all a precursor to the \u2018death panels\u2019 that right-wing fear mongers have warned us about since the Affordable Care Act was first drafted. Below is an excerpt from the show\u2019s transcript, where Rush is speaking to a caller about the veterans waiting on appointments:\n\nRUSH: Now, is that just for an appointment or is that for the specific treatment that he needs? CALLER: That is for an appointment, sir. RUSH: I don\u2019t know where that happens. I don\u2019t know anybody who calls the doctor and is told three months. It may be, I just don\u2019t encounter it. CALLER: Well, luckily we have other insurance through my work and we have gone to another doctor. RUSH: Yeah, but correct me if I\u2019m wrong, wasn\u2019t the deal, didn\u2019t you all think that should something like this happen, the government\u2019s gonna take care of your husband? He\u2019s a soldier. CALLER: Absolutely. He put in a little over 20 years, and he is a retired veteran, and he is a disabled veteran as well. RUSH: Yeah. Well, look, look, and by the way, I know in every group of people you\u2019re gonna have some bad apples who try to exploit and take advantage of. But this is happening way too frequently. Forty people dying, a hundred people dying on a wait list designed to speed up their treatment. And I know some of you are saying, \u201cRush, Rush, don\u2019t downplay this death panel business.\u201d Hey, we all know it\u2019s out there. For the sake of this discussion we\u2019re gonna use the benefit of the doubt. I know the death panel is obviously a factor in certain cases, whether they want to admit it or not. But even if you take that out, this is just so much incompetence, it\u2019s impossible to calculate.\n\nGood for Rush to bring back the old \u2018death panel\u2019 talking point. It has been swept under the rug a bit, so bully for him. Always nice to be able to reach back and pull a classic out of mothballs.\n\nLater on in the show, Rush just had to use a tried and true favorite \u2014 comparing Obama to Hitler:\n\nRUSH: Reuters also has a story here: \u201cTop Aide Says Obama \u2018Madder Than Hell\u2019 About Veterans Allegations,\u201d and it\u2019s a story quoting what you just heard \u2014 the chief of staff, Denis McDonough \u2014 on Slay the Nation yesterday. (paraphrased) \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get to the bottom of this! We\u2019re gonna get to the bottom of this and we\u2019re gonna fix it, and we\u2019re gonna ensure that it doesn\u2019t happen again!\u201d Now, this is classic. This is exactly how stuff like this gets spun (\u201cspinned,\u201d for those of you in Rio Linda) in dictatorships and in totalitarian states since time immemorial. For example, \u201cGosh, if Lenin only knew all these people are dying in Ukraine! God, if Lenin only knew, he\u2019d be so mad that he wouldn\u2019t let this happen! If Stalin only knew!\u201d He was the genocidal dictator. \u201cIf Stalin only knew! If Hitler only knew what was being done on his watch? Oh, my! Oh, gee! What if he only knew? If Castro finds out, oh, no! Who\u2019s gonna have to tell Castro that this is not working? Oh, no!\u201d And then when the problem becomes too big to ignore, we hear, \u201cBoy, is Stalin mad now! Boy, is Castro really mad now!\u201d This is how it all works. These guys are in charge of everything!\n\nPretty sure that Rush can\u2019t go an hour without comparing President Obama to Hitler, or at least pointing out that he is a dictator. In this instance, he just reeled off a bunch of names and claimed that Obama was the same and that he\u2019s snowing the public when he\u2019s really a ruthless dictator set on making America a totalitarian state.\n\nThe situation with the VA hospital in Arizona is shameful. And we should continue to investigate it. It is likely that we\u2019ll see similar situations pop up in other VA hospitals around the nation. However, it seems Republicans just want to shine a spotlight on this particular incident because they are hoping to get a scandal out of it that will hurt the President. With the Benghazi investigation looking more and more like a bad joke for Republicans, conservatives are trying everything possible to find something that will finally stick to the President.\n\nThe fact is, there is a real scandal here. The scandal is that we sent over 2.6 million people to serve overseas in violent, dangerous wars. Out of those that came back, roughly half of them either came back injured, or developed serious mental and/or physical ailments in need of treatment. Despite the fact that we spent billions and trillions on these wars of choice, greatly expanding the VA hospital system and hiring thousands of more doctors and nurses to care for all of these new patients didn\u2019t seem like a huge priority. Especially when you have a certain sector of our legislature more concerned with austerity and budget cuts than anything else.\n\nSo, while people like Limbaugh, Hannity, or House Republicans crap all over the VA and try to blame Obama for this somehow, they need to look at themselves in the mirror and realize what they\u2019ve brought forth by cheerleading for two expensive wars halfway across the world that have killed thousands and injured over a million. They pushed for sequestration, and while the VA didn\u2019t see any cuts, many other government services that veterans and the VA rely on did see massive, across the board cuts. So please stop with the sanctimonious BS about how you care about the vets, when at the same time your words and actions have helped contribute to this current situation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "During his radio broadcast on Monday, conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh used the recent scandal surrounding a VA hospital in Arizona as a way to compare President Obama to Hitler.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Justin Baragona", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "During his radio broadcast on Monday, conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh used the recent scandal surrounding a VA hospital in Arizona as a way to compare President Obama to Hitler.", "title": "Rush Limbaugh Compares Obama To Hitler And Brings Up Death Panels While Talking About VA", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/05/19/rush-limbaugh-compares-obama-hitler-brings-death-panel-talking-va.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LimbaughRushAngry.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-20T11:18:37+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Media,Hitler,Rush,The Rush Limbaugh Show,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Media", "published_time": "2014-05-19T18:45:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-20T11:18:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Hitler, Rush, The Rush Limbaugh Show"}, "article_summary": "And I know some of you are saying, \u201cRush, Rush, don\u2019t downplay this death panel business.\u201d Hey, we all know it\u2019s out there.\nI don\u2019t know anybody who calls the doctor and is told three months.\nRUSH: I don\u2019t know where that happens.\nDuring his radio broadcast on Monday, conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh used the recent scandal surrounding a VA hospital in Arizona as a way to compare President Obama to Hitler.\nPretty sure that Rush can\u2019t go an hour without comparing President Obama to Hitler, or at least pointing out that he is a dictator."}
