That is, if you have moderate to severe depression and you\u2019ve had it for less than 2 years.\n\nSo says yet another study confirming what we\u2019ve now known for decades\u2026 The study, published in JAMA Psychiatry, found that you can expect full recovery from such a depressive episode when you employ the full double-barrel of depression treatment.\n\nYet most people don\u2019t \u2014 they opt for one or the other, but not both at the same time. In making this choice, most people are short-changing themselves\u2026 And their chances at recovery from depression in a shorter period of time.\n\nBack in the late 1990s, I wrote this article about whether you should choose psychotherapy, medications or both for depression (since updated). What I wrote nearly 20 years ago remains true today:\n\nCombined treatment of psychotherapy and medication is the usual and preferred treatment of choice for depression. [\u2026] Medication alone should be your last choice and only used as a last resort. Although you will likely gain some short-term relief of the most outward symptoms of your depression, the above-cited [scientific] meta-analyses and multiple studies have shown that medications don\u2019t work very well in the long-term.\n\nAnd yet psychotherapy utilization rates for depression treatment are at an all-time low. More people are simply turning to antidepressant medications \u2014 without even considering psychotherapy.\n\nBut now\u2019s the best time to try psychotherapy. In fact, it\u2019s never been a better time to give it a go.\n\nA federal law passed a few years ago guarantees your right to access all types of mental health treatments, including psychotherapy. And the Affordable Care Act has expanded that access, even to people who previously couldn\u2019t afford insurance.\n\nWhy should you bother with psychotherapy if you have depression? Well, the new study found that 4 out of 5 people suffering from moderate to severe depression (Hamilton rating scale score of 22 or higher) experienced full recovery when treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication. If you have mild depression, medication performed apparently just as well as the combined approach.\n\nAs a side note, look at how long it takes people to recover from a single episode of depression. We all too often imagine people with depression taking a pill and feeling better a few weeks later. Yet the data show that even after a year and a half (18 months), only 50 percent of people are approaching full recovery from depression. And even with the gold standard combined treatment approach, we\u2019re still at less than 80 percent of people recovering after 42 months (3 and a half years!).\n\nAre there challenges to getting good psychotherapy?\n\nAbsolutely. The first therapist you see may not be the best one for you or your needs. You may not know it\u2019s a good fit until 3 or 4 sessions into your therapy treatment. And telling your life story to more than one professional over the course of a few months can be daunting even under the best of circumstances.\n\nSeen in that light, critically and rationally searching for the right therapist fit while depressed can be downright overwhelming. I get it \u2014 it\u2019s not easy.\n\nBut few things worth doing in life are. If you\u2019re like most people, you didn\u2019t get a great relationship or a great job by just skating along, waiting for it to happen.\n\nYou also didn\u2019t ask for your depression to happen to you. But that\u2019s no reason to give up on yourself \u2014 or give up on getting the best treatment you deserve.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been spinning your wheels with depression, now\u2019s the time to get help. Reach out to someone today.\n\nReference\n\nSteven D. Hollon, PhD; Robert J. DeRubeis, PhD; Jan Fawcett, MD; Jay D. Amsterdam, MD; Richard C. Shelton, MD; John Zajecka, MD; Paula R.
