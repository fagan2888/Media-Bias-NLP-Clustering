It would increase the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour to $8.00 an hour beginning Jan. 1, 2015. The wage would then increase to $8.75 on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nThose speaking in favor of the bill said it would help 100,000 state residents. House Majority Whip Mike Caputo, D-Marion, said unfortunately more and more people are paid minimum wage.\n\n\u201cBack in my day the minimum wage was your summer job when you were in high school, when you were in college, to get you prepared for the workforce, that\u2019s not true anymore,\u201d Caputo said.\n\nDel. Stephen Skinner, D-Jefferson, said it is past time to help the lower paid considering what lawmakers have done in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve cut taxes in West Virginia by over 300 million dollars and we\u2019re waiting and we\u2019re waiting and we\u2019re waiting on the trickle down, well, it\u2019s time for people on the bottom to get a little trickle up,\u201d Skinner said.\n\nHis fellow Jefferson County delegate Tiffany Lawrence predicted a boost to the economy with the increase.\n\n\u201cConsensus tells us a raise in the minimum wage will provide an economic boom, let me say that again, an economic boom to this state,\u201d she said.\n\nDel. Jason Barrett, D-Berkeley, said the current minimum wage equates to $290 gross pay a week, which is $15,080 a year. The bill changes that to $350 a week, $18,200 a year.\n\n\u201cThat will allow a single parent with one child to be above the poverty line. I think that\u2019s the least we can do,\u201d Barrett said.\n\nThe bill now heads to the state Senate for consideration.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two increases would take wage to $8.75 an hour by Jan. 2016.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Two increases would take wage to $8.75 an hour by Jan. 2016.", "title": "Minimum wage bill passes House", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2014/02/12/minimum-wage-bill-passes-house/", "image": {"width": 1296, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Min-Wage-protest-2.jpg", "height": 968}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Min-Wage-protest-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-12T22:22:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-12T22:22:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdded6\"", "article_summary": "House Majority Whip Mike Caputo, D-Marion, said unfortunately more and more people are paid minimum wage.\nIt would increase the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour to $8.00 an hour beginning Jan. 1, 2015.\nBy Jeff Jenkins in News | February 12, 2014 at 5:22PMCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 The House of Delegates gave overwhelming approval Wednesday afternoon to a bill that would increase the minimum wage.\nJason Barrett, D-Berkeley, said the current minimum wage equates to $290 gross pay a week, which is $15,080 a year.\n\u201cConsensus tells us a raise in the minimum wage will provide an economic boom, let me say that again, an economic boom to this state,\u201d she said."}
