Alabama state troopers have a new tool to use while on patrol, body cameras. The Alabama law enforcement agency began distributing

Bodycams this week. The agency is hopeful the cameras will help protect police and the public.

"Every highway patrol person, every marine patrol individual will have a body cam and will be using that body cam on stops on citizen contacts," Alabama State Trooper Johnathan Appling explains. "With the way the world is now with law enforcement and things that have happened throughout the country it's a smart move, it's a smart move for everyone for the public and for the agency."

The agency plans to have all of its body cameras issued and active by July 1st.
