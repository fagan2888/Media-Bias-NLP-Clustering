Details surrounding the plan remain murky, but Dunkin\u2019 will most likely partner with Postmates, a delivery service app, that other restaurants are using.\n\nA partnership with Postmates allows the various fast-food chains to integrate the ordering process into the restaurants\u2019 own mobile application, control the transaction and track consumer response and interest.\n\nRelated: 3 New Food-Delivery Apps Make Ordering Even Simpler\n\nTech investments could be the punch Dunkin\u2019 needs to compete with coffee and bakery rival Starbucks, which is already experimenting with both concepts. The company\u2019s U.S. same-store sales grew only 1.6% for fiscal 2014, while Starbucks reported a 6% jump for its latest fiscal year.\n\nIn March, Starbucks partnered with Postmates, which had already been delivering orders without the company\u2019s involvement, to increase the productivity of deliveries. The deal allowed Seattle-based Starbucks to expand its mobile ordering across much of the Pacific Northwest and to begin testing delivery in Seattle and in New York City\u2019s Empire State building.\n\nStarbucks offers a flat delivery fee and plans to launch a new initiative, \u201cGreen Apron,\u201d that would have actual baristas delivering coffee in New York later this year.\n\nChipotle also partnered with Postmates in March and is currently delivering in 67 select cities. The company saw a 30% increase in online delivery orders in April from March. The fast-casual chain has a delivery fee capped at $7.99, and costs are usually between $4.99 and $7.99, based on the order.\n\nDuring Chipotle\u2019s investor call in April, the company revealed that about 6.6% of sales, including catering and Burritos by the Box, were through online orders. However, first-quarter revenue was recorded at $1.09 billion, short of the $1.11 billion Wall Street expected.\n\nRelated: The 25 Most Addictive Foods in the World\n\nMcDonald\u2019s McDelivery is in a pilot program with Postmates, but so far the service lacks a cap on delivery costs, which means fees can range from $5 to $20, depending on how far your Quarter Pounder has to travel.\n\nThe full McDonald\u2019s menu is available for delivery, except for ice cream cones, during the normal operating hours of participating restaurants. Some restaurants are offering delivery 24 hours a day.\n\nExecutives for Yum Brands, owner of Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken, say there is potential for delivery service in the future.\n\nBurger King was the first fast-food giant to offer delivery services, starting in 2012 in Washington, D.C. BK Delivery, as it\u2019s called, has since expanded to other U.S. cities, such as New York, and this year plans to broaden the service to select U.K. locations.\n\nConvenience or laziness, I\u2019ll take a medium French vanilla swirl with cream and sugar.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Dunkin\u2019 Donuts is the latest fast-food restaurant hopping on the bandwagon to cater to", "title": "Knock, Knock!
