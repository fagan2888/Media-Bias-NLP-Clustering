Patients want to talk real costs

"Medical costs were once a hidden algebra to the public, deciphered only by payers and health care administrators. But media focus in recent years on the lack of transparency in billing practices, as well as higher out-of-pocket costs for patients, has the public much more frustrated," the report claims. That makes it hard for physicians to give the best advice for care when cost is weighed so heavily by the patient.
