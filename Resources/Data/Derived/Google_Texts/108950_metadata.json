While the HHS\u2019 press release on the event doesn\u2019t specifically mention price fixing, it does mention \u201cstrategies\u201d for lowering prices and increasing access.\n\n\u201cDuring the forum, we will hear from a broad range of stakeholders on opportunities to improve patient access to affordable prescription drugs, develop innovative purchasing strategies and incorporate value-based and outcomes-based models into purchasing programs in both the public and private sectors,\u201d the HHS press release said. \u201cWe acknowledge this is a multi-faceted problem with no one solution, but there is a significant benefit \u2014 to all of us \u2014 of working together to find a solution.\u201d\n\nPointing out two \u201cbad actors\u201d regarding drug pricing \u2014 Turing Pharmaceuticals, which was blasted this fall for a 5,000 percent price hike on Daraprim, the only approved treatment for a life-threatening parasitic infection, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which came under fire for raising the prices for several of its drugs, including a more than 500 percent increase on a popular heart medication \u2014 Worthy said she is concerned the forum will focus only on prices and not look at the bigger picture of what\u2019s causing health insurance costs to rise steadily.\n\nCiting recent problems, the organization\u2019s report details how California\u2019s Blue Cross and Blue Shield lost any tax exempt status in the state for making $4 billion, much of which was put into reserves, while boosting pay for executives.\n\nThe report, citing Blue Cross in Tennessee and Aetna, both of which piled up massive profits while expressing the need for increased subsidies, said it\u2019s an industry-wide practice for the insurance market to hide profits in order to press for greater government assistance.\n\n\u201cPrice controls for the entire pharmaceutical industry would interfere with supply and demand and there would be less funding for research and development,\u201d Worthy said, adding that the price of drugs often reported in the news is incorrect because those prices are typically negotiated downward between the insurance and dug companies.\n\nAn insurance industry group, however, contends that drug makers are driving the insurance premiums upward through the high cost of medicines.\n\n\u201cDrug makers are desperately trying to shift the blame for soaring pharmaceutical costs,\u201d American Health Insurance Plans spokeswoman Clare Krusing said in a statement.\n\nKrusing said the drug industry wants to divert attention from its problems.\n\n\u201cOne way to do that is by talking about insurance coverage \u2014 a convenient way to hide behind unjustified, unchecked pricing power,\u201d she said. \u201cRather than owning the fact that their prices are pushing consumers\u2019 premiums higher and higher, drug companies respond by imposing price controls on health plans so they can charge whatever they want for their drugs \u2014 a move that will only lead to higher costs across the board.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Reflecting public concern about rising health insurance costs, the Obama administration is holding a forum on high prescription drug prices Friday, prompting fears of price fixing on medications.
