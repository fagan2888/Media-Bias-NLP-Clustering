In a vote of 8-5, the state House Committee on Municipal, Parochial and Cultural Affairs agreed to advance the proposal to the full House for debate.\n\nThe bill, HB 503, threatens to violate the separation of church and state by honoring a specific copy of the Bible \u2014 a nearly 500-year-old printing of the Christian religious text.\n\n\u201cThe official state book shall be the Holy Bible, published by Johannes Prevel, (Prevel, Jean, active 1510-1528, printer. & Petit, Jean, fl. 1492-1530.), which is the oldest edition of the Holy Bible in the Louisiana State Museum system,\u201d reads the original version of HB 503. \u201cThe use on official documents of the state and with the insignia of the state is hereby authorized.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe bill would also change the state motto to, \u201cA state, under God, united in purpose and ideals, confident that justice shall prevail for all of those abiding here.\u201d\n\nThose who oppose the bill argue that the endorsement of an article of faith for a specific belief violates the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition on the establishment of religion by the state. Elevating the Holy Bible to \u201cstate book,\u201d some argue, disenfranchises those that do not adhere to or accept the Bible, and it violates Thomas Jefferson\u2019s philosophy on church and state that the government should neither encourage nor deny religious identity.\n\n\u201cIf the purpose of this bill is to say that Louisiana is not a welcoming place for anybody who doesn\u2019t have these narrow religious views, then it would accomplish that goal,\u201d said Marjorie Esman, executive director of the Louisiana American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThere are probably books in the Louisiana State Museum that contain views that don\u2019t reflect our values \u2026 So that\u2019s pretext. This is a statement of religious discrimination.\u201d\n\nTechnically, the Holy Bible is not a book, but a collection of books, oral histories and correspondence that represents one of the oldest and most complete historical chronologies known to exist. Composed of parts of the Hebrew Torah, Nevi\u2019im and Ketuvim, and the Christian Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, Epistles and Book of Revelation, the Holy Bible is a written history of the region of the Middle East that now makes up Israel, the Occupied Territories, Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\nHowever, there is no such thing as \u201cthe Bible,\u201d as there are many Bibles \u2014 all based on different translations and views on what is canonical. As different denominations prefer different translations, there is no one commonly accepted Bible for the whole of the Christian faith.\n\nConcerns over identifying a specific version of the Bible for recognition led to language singling out the Louisiana State Museum Bible to be removed from the bill.\n\nThis bill reflects an emerging trend, according to a recent analysis by the Secular Coalition for America. Despite a plurality of Americans stating that they feel that politicians talk about religion too much and a majority of Americans arguing that churches should not be involved in political matters, Republicans overwhelmingly came up at the bottom of a scale that weighs Congress members\u2019 support for bills that support or endorse the notion of church and state separation. Of the Republican Congressional Caucus for the 113th Congress, only Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan and Rep. Vance McAllister of Louisiana did not receive a \u201cF;\u201d no Republican received a score higher than a \u201cD.\u201d\n\nReps. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., and Rush Holt, D-N.J., topped the scale with scores of 100.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to open ourselves up to a lawsuit. You can\u2019t adopt the Bible and not adopt Christianity,\u201d said Louisiana state Rep.
