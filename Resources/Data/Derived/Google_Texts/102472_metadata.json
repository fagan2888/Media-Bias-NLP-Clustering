Strangers donated thousands of dollars to online funds to help cover bombing victims\u2019 medical costs, and many insurance providers waived the fees for their emergency care.\n\nThe generous compensation has allowed many survivors to achieve financial stability, and even go on to meet financial goals like buying a home. But that\u2019s not true for all of them. As the Washington Post reports, some low-income survivors whose job prospects remain uncertain are wary to cash their checks because the additional income may actually undermine their ability to access health insurance.\n\nPaul and J.P. Norden, two brothers who lost legs when the second bomb went off, are both still struggling to recover. And they haven\u2019t cashed their $1.2 million checks from the One Fund charity \u2014 a fund set up specifically to aid bombing victims \u2014 because they\u2019re currently dependent on Massachusetts\u2019 public health insurance program for the poor. Although the charity donations are tax free, once they claim them, they may not qualify for that type of state assistance anymore.\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be an issue if they could access health care through an employer, or if the funds were enough to cover all of their expected medical costs. But the Norden brothers\u2019 recovery process has been slow, and they\u2019re not sure when they will be able to work again. They also worry that the high cost of prosthetics will quickly eat up the $1.2 million sum, leaving them with nothing.\n\n\u201cPeople will say stuff: \u2018Oh, you guys got $1.2 million,\u2019 \u201d J.P. Norden told the Washington Post from his hospital bed, recovering from his most recent surgery. \u201cDid we? Because I know I\u2019ve got to buy a leg for the rest of my life. I can\u2019t go out and buy a house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe amputees got a check they can\u2019t cash, if you think about it,\u201d another bombing survivor, who received a $735,000 check for bad burns that he sustained in the attacks, noted to the Washington Post. That\u2019s because the cost of treating amputations stretches out over a lifetime. It\u2019s not a one-time medical cost that can be paid for with a lump sum.\n\nProsthetics can cost up to $45,000 apiece for adults, and they need to be replaced every few years. In addition to the limbs themselves, ongoing rehabilitative treatment also racks up costs. Doctors and prosthetists told the Washington Post that the lifetime cost of a new limb could easily exceed the $1.2 million that the Norden brothers each received.\n\nAt the end of this year, the Nordens will need to leave their public health insurance plans and begin buying insurance on their own. They\u2019ll be able to purchase plans in Obamacare\u2019s new state-level marketplaces \u2014 but, just as their charity checks may disqualify them from accessing Medicaid, they\u2019ll also likely be barred from receiving federal subsidies to help make those plans cheaper.\n\nThe Nordens say they will deal with that when the time comes. For now, they\u2019re simply focused on rehabilitation. One of the brothers is meeting with financial advisers to decide how to invest his money, but says they\u2019re giving him conflicting advice. \u201cWho do you trust?\u2026 It\u2019s like we have money, but we don\u2019t have money,\u201d their mother, Liz Norden, explained.\n\nInsurance coverage for prosthetic costs currently varies widely. Fortunately for the Norden family, Massachusetts is one of the 20 states that have passed fair insurance laws for amputees. That means insurance providers are required to cover a certain level of care for amputees, and typically pay for up to 80 percent of prosthetic care.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Some amputee victims essentially \"got a check they can't cash\" because the large sum will force them off their public health insurance program -- without actually paying for the full cost of their recovery.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Some amputee victims essentially \"got a check they can't cash\" because the large sum will force them off their public health insurance program -- without actually paying for the full cost of their recovery.", "title": "Some Boston Bombing Victims Can\u2019t Cash Their Charity Checks Because They\u2019ll Lose Their Health Care", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/09/16/2625731/boston-bombing-victims-cash-checks/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/boston-marathon-first-responders-e1379349893330.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some amputee victims essentially \"got a check they can't cash\" because the large sum will force them off their public health insurance program -- without actually paying for the full cost of their recovery.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/boston-marathon-first-responders-e1379349893330-321x214.jpg", "title": "Some Boston Bombing Victims Can\u2019t Cash Their Charity Checks Because They\u2019ll Lose Their Health Care", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/boston-marathon-first-responders-e1379349893330.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/boston-marathon-first-responders-e1379349893330.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-16T12:08:43+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b12\"", "article_summary": "Health Some Boston Bombing Victims Can\u2019t Cash Their Charity Checks Because They\u2019ll Lose Their Health Care CREDIT: AP First responders on the scene at last spring's Boston Marathon bombingFirst responders on the scene at last spring\u2019s Boston Marathon bombing CREDIT: APAfter last spring\u2019s bombing at the Boston Marathon, the hundreds of victims injured in the attacks received an outpouring of public support.\nAt the end of this year, the Nordens will need to leave their public health insurance plans and begin buying insurance on their own.\nStrangers donated thousands of dollars to online funds to help cover bombing victims\u2019 medical costs, and many insurance providers waived the fees for their emergency care.\nAs the Washington Post reports, some low-income survivors whose job prospects remain uncertain are wary to cash their checks because the additional income may actually undermine their ability to access health insurance.\nAnd they haven\u2019t cashed their $1.2 million checks from the One Fund charity \u2014 a fund set up specifically to aid bombing victims \u2014 because they\u2019re currently dependent on Massachusetts\u2019 public health insurance program for the poor."}
