(Mark Gail/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe Democratic candidates for Maryland\u2019s 4th Congressional District race are almost indistinguishable in the policies they support and the issues they champion.\n\nExpanding the Affordable Care Act is crucial. Students need more career options beyond attending a four-year institution. Voters are tired of Washington gridlock. And struggling middle-class families need more help from their representatives on Capitol Hill.\n\nAt a candidate forum Tuesday night at Bowie State University, voters got a glimpse of how the field of seasoned veterans and political newcomers will try to differentiate themselves in the battle to succeed Rep. Donna F. Edwards (D), who is running for the U.S. Senate.\n\nFrom the unemployed statistician to Maryland\u2019s former lieutenant governor, each congressional hopeful sprinkled his or her platform with passionate personal narratives in an effort to draw in some of the approximately 75 attendees.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, I lost when I ran for governor,\u201d said former lieutenant governor and state delegate Anthony G. Brown (D), 54, who is billed as the primary front-runner in some candidate polls.\n\nDel. Joseline Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk (D), right, and former Maryland lieutenant governor Anthony Brown, center, talked with voters after the 4th Congressional District candidates forum held at Bowie State University on Tuesday night. (Mark Gail/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cPeople said, \u2018Why are you running for Congress?\u2019 And I thought about the lesson my father taught me. . . . Sometimes you\u2019re going to get knocked down, but if you believe in what you do, you pick yourself up, you dust yourself off, and you stay in it.\u201d\n\n[Congressional candidates split support among Pr. George\u2019s officials]\n\nBrown brought the polish of a practiced campaigner who spent more than a year at the head of a statewide campaign, responding to voter questions with crisp answers. If elected, he said, he would \u201cbuild on the achievements of President Obama,\u201d and he asserted that he is the candidate who is most qualified for the position. However, he did not go into great detail about his record.\n\nAlthough most of the candidates have been in the military, worked in the legislature, have had executive-branch experience in government or worked in the private sector, Brown said, \u201cI believe I am the only one who has done all four of those.\u201d\n\nGlenn F. Ivey (D) \u2014 the current fundraising leader \u2014 harked back to his time as state\u2019s attorney in Prince George\u2019s County, when he oversaw reductions in crime, championed reform measures that put cameras in police interrogation rooms and prosecuted officers accused of excessive force.\n\nHe, too, aligned his politics with those of Obama, who is wildly popular among the district\u2019s majority black voters, and he reminded the crowd of how congressional Republicans consistently sought to undermine the president\u2019s authority.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll fight against that,\u201d said Ivey, who turns 55 on Saturday.\n\nDemocrat Matthew Fogg, right, speaks at the 4th Congressional District candidates forum held at Bowie State University on Tuesday night. (Mark Gail/For The Washington Post)\n\n[Ivey finishes 2015 with strong fundraising lead in primary race]\n\nDel. Joseline A. Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk (D-Prince George\u2019s), 49, who is relatively unknown outside the portion of the congressional district that includes her state legislative district, said her experience as an immigrant who struggled through poverty uniquely qualifies her to advocate for working families.\n\n\u201cI bring a perspective that no one up here brings,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a woman. I am a mother. I am a wife, a sister, a daughter, an Afro-Latina that represents this community.\u201d\n\nDrawing parallels to Edwards, Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk said she is independent and unafraid to oppose party leaders. She was one of a handful of lawmakers in Annapolis who voted in 2012 against expanding gaming into Prince George\u2019s.\n\n\u201cYou want someone who is going to rock the boat but knows when not to flip it. That is me,\u201d Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk said. \u201cI don\u2019t compromise if it\u2019s going to harm you.\u201d\n\nMilitary veterans Warren Christopher, 48, and Terence Strait, 34, both Democrats, cast themselves as anti-establishment candidates who bring fresh vision in a field of career politicians.\n\nChristopher, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, touted his leadership abilities and military experience.\n\n\u201cThis is about making sure that we have a proven and tested leader,\u201d Christopher said, raising his voice. \u201cI have taken troops into combat more than seven different times, and under my leadership, I brought every troop home alive.\u201d\n\nIn some of the most pointed remarks of the night, Christopher asked the crowd whether life had improved as a result of the elected service of some of the current and former officials sitting alongside him: \u201cAre you better off? There are a lot of folks on this dais that have had opportunities to deliver. Look at the results.\u201d\n\nStrait, a statistician, said he has a vision, even if there is not much on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to offer voters. The youngest candidate of the group and a supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, he said he would fight for a $15 minimum wage, for a single-payer health-care system and for investments in infrastructure to stimulate job growth.\n\nDemocrat Matthew Fogg, 64, a latecomer to the primary race, is a retired U.S. marshal and community activist who ran for a state delegate seat in 2014 and, after losing, became a write-in candidate for state Senate.\n\nTwo Republican candidates, Robert Broadus, 43, and George McDermott, 70, also joined the forum. Broadus, a Navy veteran, urged black voters like him to vote for a party that fights \u201cagainst violations of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nMcDermott, a native Prince George\u2019s resident, bemoaned the change in society\u2019s values from those of his childhood and denounced voter apathy that led to the Democrats\u2019 state \u201cmonopoly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe monopoly will take advantage of you,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth parties will nominate candidates during the state\u2019s April 26 primary. In the heavily Democratic 4th District, the Democratic winner will be overwhelmingly favored to triumph in November\u2019s general election.\n\nThe next forum will be held at noon Saturday at Harmony Hall Regional Center in Fort Washington.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brown, Ivey and Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk touted experience; political newcomers pointed to failed leadership.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/arelis.r.hernandez", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Brown, Ivey and Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk touted experience; political newcomers pointed to failed leadership.", "title": "Candidates aim to distinguish themselves in Md.\u2019s 4th district", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/candidates-aim-to-distinguish-themselves-in-mds-4th-district/2016/02/24/b3e1bde4-d9b6-11e5-925f-1d10062cc82d_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/24/Local/Images/md4forum_321456294387.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@arelisrhdz"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "mdpolitics, 4th district congressional race, donna edwards, glenn ivey, anthony brown, jocelyn pena-melnyck, maryland 2016", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/arelis.r.hernandez"}, "eomportal-uuid": "b3e1bde4-d9b6-11e5-925f-1d10062cc82d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "mdpolitics, 4th district congressional race, donna edwards, glenn ivey, anthony brown, jocelyn pena-melnyck, maryland 2016"}, "article_summary": "Former state\u2019s attorney Glenn Ivey, center, speaking at the 4th Congressional District candidates forum at Bowie State University on Tuesday night.\nDemocrat Matthew Fogg, right, speaks at the 4th Congressional District candidates forum held at Bowie State University on Tuesday night.\n(Mark Gail/For The Washington Post)The Democratic candidates for Maryland\u2019s 4th Congressional District race are almost indistinguishable in the policies they support and the issues they champion.\nJoseline Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk (D), right, and former Maryland lieutenant governor Anthony Brown, center, talked with voters after the 4th Congressional District candidates forum held at Bowie State University on Tuesday night.\nIn the heavily Democratic 4th District, the Democratic winner will be overwhelmingly favored to triumph in November\u2019s general election."}
