State reps will be at the Queens Center mall to sign New Yorkers up for “Obamacare” health plans starting on Friday.

More than 50,000 Queens residents signed up from health plans last year out of 370,000 statewide, in addition to more than 100,000 who enrolled in expanded Medicaid and child health plans.

The state hopes to enroll 1.1 million New Yorkers by 2016.

“We enrolled quite a few people last year...We’re trying to reach those who have not come forward,” said Danielle Holahan, the deputy director of New York State of Health.

Queens was second to Brooklyn last year in the number of residents that enrolled in health care plans.

Friday (1 p.m. to 7 p.m.), Saturday (12 p.m. to 6 p.m.) and Sunday (11 a.m. to 5 p.m.) at the Queens Center.
