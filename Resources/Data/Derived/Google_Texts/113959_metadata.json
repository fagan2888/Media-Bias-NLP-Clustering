Taxpayers without health insurance will face larger penalties, and those insured by their employers will get a new tax form. There also have been adjustments for inflation, and Congress extended expiring tax breaks, some permanently.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that we finally have some certainty,\u201d said Kathy Pickering, executive director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block.\n\nThe arrival of the new year means it\u2019s time to start thinking about gathering the documents needed to file taxes. They include W-2 forms reporting wages or salaries, which employers will send out this month. You\u2019ll also need Form 1099 reporting interest and dividend income, Form 1098 showing interest paid on a home mortgage, and Form 1095-A if you bought coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\n\u2022 MORE TIME TO FILE\n\nTax season opened Jan. 19, when the Internal Revenue Service begins accepting returns.\n\nIf you like to procrastinate, you\u2019ll have four extra days \u2014 counting Feb. 29 because this is a leap year \u2014 to file without needing an extension. The deadline is April 18 because of the celebration of Emancipation Day in the District of Columbia. If you live in Massachusetts or Maine, Patriots Day means you\u2019ll have still another day to file.\n\nBut do take into account any changes in your personal life, he urged. Did you get married, have a child or begin caring for an elderly relative, for example?\n\n\u201cAs things change in your personal life, so do taxes change,\u201d he said.\n\nTax brackets, the value of each exemption and the standard deduction have been adjusted for inflation. So have the levels at which certain tax credits and deductions begin to phase out.\n\nFewer people are itemizing because the standard deduction continues to creep upward, said Barbara Weltman, a consultant and author of books on taxes, law and finance.\n\nFor 2015, the standard deduction is $6,300 for single filers, $12,600 for married couples filing jointly and $9,250 for heads of household. Each personal exemption is worth $4,000, up from $3,950 in 2014, according to the IRS.\n\n\u2022 FILING ELECTRONICALLY\n\nTaxpayers increasingly are choosing to file electronically.\n\nElectronic filing was up 2.4 percent in 2015 from 2014. Similarly, the use of direct deposit for refund checks also is gaining in popularity. Last year, more than 86 million tax refunds were paid through direct deposit, up 2.7 percent over 2014.\n\nOverall, the average refund in 2015 was $2,797, a slight increase over the previous year.\n\n\u201cChoosing e-file and direct deposit for refunds remains the fastest and safest way to file an accurate income tax return and receive a refund,\u201d the IRS said on its website.\n\nThe agency expects to pay more than 90 percent of refunds in less than 21 days.\n\n\u2022 IDENTITY THEFT\n\nIdentity theft continues to be a problem. Sometimes the first indication is a notice from the IRS that a tax return already has been filed with a taxpayer\u2019s Social Security number.\n\nTo combat the problem, the IRS launched a public awareness campaign in November and began issuing a series of tips on how to protect data online.\n\n\u201cThe IRS and the states have been working to get better at detecting these false returns, but as the criminals steal more and more personal data, they can do an even better job of making a tax return look legitimate,\u201d IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn short, the criminals are evolving, and so must we,\u201d he said.\n\nAt an IRS security summit, tax preparers, software companies and the agency came together \u201cto establish standards for authenticating tax filers online, and sharing information with the IRS and state departments of revenue on patterns of fraudulent behavior,\u201d Pickering said.\n\nTaxpayers filing electronically might see requests for stronger passwords, and security questions to help validate that they are who they say they are.\n\nThe extra security \u201cshouldn\u2019t be burdensome,\u201d Pickering said, and could help taxpayers feel \u201ca little more protected.\u201d\n\nStates also are taking steps, she said; more than a dozen now require employers to send copies of the W-2 directly to them by Jan. 31. The IRS also plans to require that in the future.\n\nTaxpayers should know that the IRS \u201cdoes not initiate contact by email to request personal or financial information,\u201d the agency emphasizes on its website. \u201cThis includes any type of electronic communication, such as text messages and social media channels.\u201d\n\n\u2022 HEALTH INSURANCE AND TAXES\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has now made health care a tax issue,\u201d Pickering said.\n\nIn a report to Congress earlier this month, National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson said the IRS faced \u201ca few unanticipated challenges\u201d last year regarding the tax-related provisions of the health care law. \u201cIn general,\u201d she said, \u201cthe IRS has sufficiently addressed the issues as they arise in order to avoid similar issues in future filing season.\u201d\n\nTaxpayers will see some new forms, 1095B and 1095C, if they have employer-provided health insurance or got it outside the marketplace. Lisa Greene-Lewis, CPA and editor of the TurboTax blog, called the forms a \u201cnon-issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe IRS computers are going to be able to verify your information that you and your dependents had the coverage,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2022 TAX BREAKS EXTENDED\n\nCongress acted in mid-December to extend about 50 expiring tax breaks for individuals and businesses. \u201cSome of the credits and deductions which are pretty popular with people have been extended permanently,\u201d Pickering said.\n\nThe American Opportunity Tax Credit, for example, provides eligible students with a maximum annual credit of $2,500 for the first four years of college. The congressional action making it permanent helps students or their parents plan four years out, she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "WASHINGTON -- What's new when you file your taxes this year?
