Staff File Photo\n\nCome Thursday, the nearly 17,000-seat Sports Arena will once again be transformed into a massive medical, dental and vision clinic, where hundreds of dentists, optometrists, nurses and other volunteers will offer free care for three days to those in need.\n\nBut the services offered will be different compared to six years ago, when a similar event was first held at the Los Angeles Forum. Back then, images of these megaclinics held nationwide and primarily in rural settings became symbolic of the fractured health care system before reform and the lengths many Americans would go to for much needed medical and dental care.\n\nNow, as the provisions under the Affordable Care Act take hold and more people are insured for primary care, some services at the upcoming large-scale clinic have changed while others have been expanded, said Don Manelli, the president and founder of Care Harbor, a nonprofit organization that produces the event.\n\nHe said while millions of Los Angeles residents now have some kind of medical coverage, dental care and vision services remain out of reach for many people. Medi-Cal doesn\u2019t cover the cost of a new glasses, for example, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat stayed the same is dental and vision,\u201d Manelli said. \u201cDental is about 60 percent of what we do, and vision is 40 percent. We\u2019ll see more dental patients this year than we have before and we\u2019re doing more. We\u2019re offering partial dentures. They\u2019re going to be made overnight.\u201d\n\nBut this year\u2019s event also will promote prevention, he said. Data collected from last year\u2019s event shows that of the 2,265 people who were seen for basic care, 68 percent had prehypertension, or stage 1 or stage 2 of the disease. Also, many didn\u2019t know they were qualified for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Even those who are undocumented are eligible for primary medical care in Los Angeles County through a program called My Health LA, he said.\n\n\u201cThe entire clinic is on an e-record system. It\u2019s kind of amazing,\u201d Manelli said. \u201cWe can track cases\u201d and refer them to clinics for regular care.\n\nWhat\u2019s also new this year is mental health services. Consultations will be offered and those who want can schedule appointments with nearby clinics for therapy, Manelli said. The clinic is also expanding vaccinations to include the shingles vaccine and offering more specialty care such as cardiology.\n\nLast year, the clinic served 3,111 people, up slightly from 2013. Last year, services rendered cost $2.3 million. Wristbands for those who are in need of services at the clinic have already been handed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManelli said he\u2019ll know when the health and dental system has improved and everyone has some kind of coverage when no one shows up for wristbands for the free care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be here until then,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Come Thursday, the nearly 17,000-seat Sports Arena will once again be transformed into a massive medical, dental and vision clinic, where hundreds of dentists, optometrists, nurses and other volunteers will offer free care for three days to those in n", "title": "Free medical, dental, vision clinic returns to LA with new services", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/health/20151013/free-medical-dental-vision-clinic-returns-to-la-with-new-services", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151013/NEWS/151019771/AR/0/AR-151019771.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "999px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Free medical, dental, vision clinic returns to LA with new services"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Come Thursday, the nearly 17,000-seat Sports Arena will once again be transformed into a massive medical, dental and vision clinic, where hundreds of dentists, optometrists, nurses and other volunteers will offer free care for three days to those in n", "title": "Free medical, dental, vision clinic returns to LA with new services", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/health/20151013/free-medical-dental-vision-clinic-returns-to-la-with-new-services", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151013/NEWS/151019771/AR/0/AR-151019771.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Obamacare,Sports Arena, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Obamacare,Sports Arena, Health"}, "article_summary": "He said while millions of Los Angeles residents now have some kind of medical coverage, dental care and vision services remain out of reach for many people.\nEven those who are undocumented are eligible for primary medical care in Los Angeles County through a program called My Health LA, he said.\n\u201cWhat stayed the same is dental and vision,\u201d Manelli said.\nBut the services offered will be different compared to six years ago, when a similar event was first held at the Los Angeles Forum.\nWhat\u2019s also new this year is mental health services."}
