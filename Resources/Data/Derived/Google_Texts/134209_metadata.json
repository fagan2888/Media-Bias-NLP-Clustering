The company\u2019s intention to use octocopter drones for small deliveries was announced by CEO Jeff Bezos at the end of 2013. Prime Air, as the project is called, will potentially travel 50 mph and carry five pounds of goods to people\u2019s doors.\n\nHowever, the tech giant\u2019s drone plan has run into an obstacle. Despite repeated petitions, Amazon has not been able to sway the FAA to alter the rules, and allow the company to test drones in Seattle, which is not one of the six FAA-approved drone testing sites in the nation.
