That is why many people to this very day believe that Ben Franklin invented daylight saving time.\n\nBen Franklin did not invent daylight saving time. Daylight saving time was invented by George Hudson, insect collector and stained glass window designer, which proves one of my pet theories, ergo: When you want something invented, why not go to an expert in the field?\n\nThe good news is that now we have correctly identified the person to hate when we get up twice a year at 2 a.m. on the first Sunday of November and another Sunday in March to set our clocks back and forward by an hour.\n\nIt is a well-proven fact (although I would have a difficult time supporting it with pesky things like actual facts), that most countries in the world are not using daylight saving time. Because we live in the greatest country in the world where we don\u2019t have to care what others think, we observe DST religiously \u2013 except in Hawaii and Arizona (minus the geographical inclusion there of the Navajo Indian Reservation) where they don\u2019t have to worship the sun as it spends more time in those states anyway.\n\nMy personal feeling is that we should practice daylight saving time year-round. I call this program \u201cSafe Time,\u201d and the advantages are almost innumerable. I will name just a few right here in this column.\n\nBy not setting our clocks back and forward every year we will greatly reduce the number of time-change related injuries. Who knows how many people get broken toes and bruised shins while trying to navigate through the living room, dining room, and kitchen furniture to find the clock on the microwave to change the time at 2 a.m.?\n\nNote the proceeding question was rhetorical; no need to make a comment at the end of this column.\n\nNot changing our clocks has another benefit: No one need ever show up at church an hour early or an hour late because they failed to set their clocks forward or back. Although, theoretically you can be two hours early or two hours late by setting your clock forward or back in the wrong direction \u2013 something I learned by personal experience.\n\nThe average head of household has to change the time on two car clocks, three appliance clocks, four home clocks, two alarm clocks, a wrist watch, and a host of other modern timekeeping devices.\n\nThis means that Mr. Average American spends an hour twice a year just setting clocks. Sure this only amounts to a fraction of the time we spend trying to log onto healthcare.gov, but it is still \u201cour\u201d time we are wasting.\n\nOur clocks, appliances, and other modern timekeeping appliances will last much longer if the time doesn\u2019t change twice a year. This is due to a well-proven law which states: Fiddle with something long enough and eventually it will break.\n\nThe biggest advantage of staying on daylight saving time year-round is that we will always have an extra hour of sunlight at the end of the day.\n\nTo those who may be thinking, \u201csure, we may have an extra hour of daylight at the end of the day, but in December it will still be dark until 9 a.m.\u201d I ask you: Is it better to have it be dark at work or dark on your way to go boating at Sand Hallow?\n\nOK, so maybe saying the advantages are almost innumerable is a bit of an exaggeration, but I learned my overstatement skills listening to the master, our very own president, as he sold us the goods on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf the powers that be are going to insist on having us change our clocks in the spring and fall then I have a suggestion that would make the time change much more palatable: Let\u2019s set our clocks forward and back on a daily basis. We could set the clocks forward right after lunch at work, and set them back as we go to bed.\n\nNote to reader: That is such a good idea that many will be calling upon me to run for office. Maybe I should start running right now!\n\nNew from STGnews.com\n\nJohn Carter is temporarily stepping in for his daughter, Elise Haynes, as she deals with the wonders and glories of moving an vacation.
