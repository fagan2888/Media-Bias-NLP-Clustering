Colonel Andr\u00e9 Dean (US Army, Retired)\n\nAge: 54\n\nFamily: Happily married to Dianne for 31 years. The Lord has blessed our marriage with 10 beautiful angels ages 10-28, all biologically ours.\n\nOccupation: Army Airborne-Ranger, 27-year Combat Veteran, Infantry Officer, private thru Lt. Colonel. Awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge, Bronze Star and Valorous Unit Award for my leadership under direct enemy fire.\n\nPosition Sought: U.S. House of Representatives (Congress), Washington D.C.\n\nReason for Running and what makes you the best choice: The 8th Congressional District needs new blood. Our 20-year congressman is now being rated by the venerated and most-trusted name in conservative thinking, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s \u201cAction,\u201d with a terrible lifetime voting score of 55/\u201cF\u201d.\n\nI am sick of being angry with \u201cRINO\u201d (Republican in Name Only) congressmen like Brady, Cantor and Speaker Boehner.\n\nI am a proven, distinguished 27-year military leader.\n\nI hold a bachelor\u2019s degree from Texas A&M (with honors) and a Masters in Public Policy/Affairs from The University of Texas in Austin; none of my fellow challengers holds a college degree.\n\nI am a Constitutional Conservative, and I am mad as Hell about our $19 trillion, irresponsible national debt. I demand a Balanced Budget Amendment and immediate fiscal restraint.\n\nI will impose Term Limits so no congressman, senator, federal or Supreme Court judge will ever be allowed to serve a lifetime in office again.\n\nI will make America safe again, by securing our Southern Border with Mexico and begin the 20-year deportation of all illegal aliens from America. I will freeze all Muslim immigration to the USA if our government cannot be 100% certain that the immigrant or refugee is not coming to America to kill us.\n\nI will expunge Obamacare and all VA hospitals and clinics (which is government-run, apathetic, substandard, horrific \u201ccare\u201d for our war heroes) and replace the VA with a Medical Card allowing Veterans to go to any doctor or hospital they choose for the best care to heal their war-wounds. I will do this at half the cost of the disgraceful, incompetent Veteran\u2019s Administration. The VA is Obamacare for our Veterans. We must kill it now.\n\nExperience & Community Service: I am profoundly Christian, a Husband, a Father, a Grandfather, a 27-year Army Combat Veteran/Infantry Officer-Leader, an Aggie, a Longhorn, a 5th generation Texan, a three-year public school teacher of student leadership and community service, and I am not a \u201cPolitician.\u201d\n\nWebsite: www.ColonelDeanToCongress.org", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "#elections2016,courier", "og": {"site_name": "www.yourconroenews.com", "description": "Name: Lt.
