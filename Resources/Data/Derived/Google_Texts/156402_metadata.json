The 20-year-old Brazilian model poured $40,000 into turning himself into Barbie\u2019s boyfriend, and now plans on opening up his own line of \u201cCelso\u201d dolls.\n\nSantebanes admits that he\u2019s addicted to looking at himself in the mirror. Throughout his childhood and adolescence, his family told him he resembled a Ken doll; at age 16, he won a modeling contest. Both of these events spurred him to begin using plastic surgery to enhance his features. He has had four operations on his jaw, nose, and chin, and also received silicone implants in his chest. \u201cI went to the city to become a model,\u201d he wrote on his Instagram. \u201cI never expected to have a toy myself. I dreamt of being a human puppet, but having one in my image was completely unexpected.\u201d\n\nSantebanes says he's addicted to looking at himself in the mirror; soon he'll be addicted to looking at mini-me versions of himself. Facebook\n\nA Brazilian model, Santebanes has been told in the past that he resembled a doll, which inspired him to enhance his physical appearance more. Facebook\n\nBut Santebanes isn\u2019t the most expensive \u201chuman dolls.\u201d Rodrigo Alves \u2014 who is also Brazilian \u2014 thus far has spent over $170,000 on plastic surgery, involving jaw liposuction, calf shaping, three nose jobs, and fillers in his arms. There\u2019s also Justin Jedlica, a 32-year-old New Yorker who has spent over $100,000 on 149 cosmetic surgeries since he was 18 years old. Jedlica\u2019s inspiration stemmed from anime characters, but admits that he resembles a Ken doll as well, which he believes is quite flattering. Santebanes, meanwhile, aims for more cosmetic procedures: \u201cI think I\u2019m 90 percent of what I want to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI intend to do more surgeries, but do not know what. For now my investment is being in the gym, for Ken is strong and I am skinny.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "human ken doll, celso santebanes, plastic surgery", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Celso Santebanes, 20, spends copious amounts of money on plastic surgery that will mold him into a human doll.", "title": "New Real-Life Ken Doll Spends $40K To Be Barbie\u2019s Boyfriend [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/newest-real-life-ken-doll-brazilian-model-celso-santebanes-spends-40k-be-barbies-boyfriend-296550", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/05/santebanes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Celso Santebanes, 20, spends copious amounts of money on plastic surgery that will mold him into a human doll.", "title": "New Real-Life Ken Doll Spends $40K To Be Barbie\u2019s Boyfriend [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/newest-real-life-ken-doll-brazilian-model-celso-santebanes-spends-40k-be-barbies-boyfriend-296550", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/05/santebanes.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/05/santebanes.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-05T12:49:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-05T12:49:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Celso Santebanes, 20, spends copious amounts of money on plastic surgery that will mold him into a human doll."}, "article_summary": "The 20-year-old Brazilian model poured $40,000 into turning himself into Barbie\u2019s boyfriend, and now plans on opening up his own line of \u201cCelso\u201d dolls.\nThroughout his childhood and adolescence, his family told him he resembled a Ken doll; at age 16, he won a modeling contest.\nCelso Santebanes isn\u2019t the first \u2014 and probably won\u2019t be the last \u2014 guy who spends obscene amounts of money on plastic surgery to look like a human Ken doll.\nFacebookA Brazilian model, Santebanes has been told in the past that he resembled a doll, which inspired him to enhance his physical appearance more.\nJedlica\u2019s inspiration stemmed from anime characters, but admits that he resembles a Ken doll as well, which he believes is quite flattering."}
