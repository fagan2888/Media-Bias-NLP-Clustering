And even if it were, there are other plaintiffs in King V. Burwell whose standing \u2014 the legal term for the right to bring a lawsuit \u2014 is not contested\n\n.\n\n\u201cWe examined this issue at the outset of the litigation,\u201d CEI general counsel San Kazman said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nNeither King nor Douglas Hurst, another co-plaintiff who also served in the military, was ever enrolled in a veterans health program, Kazman said. And Obamacare regulations specify that only individuals who actually enroll in a veterans health plan are treated as \u201celigible\u201d for them under the law, he said.\n\n\u201cTherefore, since neither Mr. King nor Mr. Hurst had even enrolled, neither was \u2018eligible\u2019 for veterans health care,\u201d Kazman said. \u201cFurther, there are also non-veteran plaintiffs in this case whose standing is uncontested by the Department of Justice, and so the veteran status of two plaintiffs is of no legal consequence in any event.\u201d\n\nKing filed an affidavit in the court proceedings in which he said that he was not eligible for any government health program or employer-sponsored health insurance.\n\nEarly on, the Justice Department challenged the standing of King and another plaintiff, Rose Luck, by saying that they were eligible for a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d health plan. But the department made no mention of veteran\u2019s coverage eligibility.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge James R. Spencer made no mention of standing problems in his ruling last February. The Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit did not stop the case on standing grounds, either.\n\nThe Supreme Court does examine such issues as it considers a case. Yet standing and ripeness \u2014 whether it is the right time to bring a particular challenge \u2014 are typically dealt with at lower court levels.\n\nWere the justices to decide that none of the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell has the right to bring the suit, they could toss the entire case on that legal point \u2014 an easy \u201cout\u201d for a highly controversial case.\n\nBut the challenge involves a total of four plaintiffs, and \u201conly one person needs standing for the case to proceed,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor.\n\nThe Supreme Court \u201ccan be a stickler for standing before it reaches the merits, and this would allow the Court to avoid resolving a very controversial issue,\u201d Tobias said on Saturday. However, he said, even if the justices ruled against King on this issue, another case opposing the Obamacare tax subsidies is already at the appellate level and could reach the court in the next term.\n\nThat case \u2014 Halbig v. Burwell \u2014 is one of three other lawsuits challenging the tax subsidy issue.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The lead plaintiff may not have a legal right to pursue his case.", "title": "King lawyers: Veterans coverage won't upend Obamacare lawsuit", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/david-king-obamacare-veterans-114989.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/16/150116_obamacare_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,david king,supreme court,Supreme Court", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The lead plaintiff may not have a legal right to pursue his case.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf722\"", "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro King lawyers: Veterans coverage won't upend Obamacare lawsuitThe attorneys challenging Obamacare\u2019s tax subsidies say that the lead plaintiff\u2019s potential eligibility for veterans health coverage won\u2019t derail their lawsuit in the Supreme Court.\nAnd Obamacare regulations specify that only individuals who actually enroll in a veterans health plan are treated as \u201celigible\u201d for them under the law, he said.\n\u201cTherefore, since neither Mr. King nor Mr. Hurst had even enrolled, neither was \u2018eligible\u2019 for veterans health care,\u201d Kazman said.\nNeither King nor Douglas Hurst, another co-plaintiff who also served in the military, was ever enrolled in a veterans health program, Kazman said.\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute, which is coordinating and funding the lawsuit, says that the veteran\u2019s status is a non-issue."}
