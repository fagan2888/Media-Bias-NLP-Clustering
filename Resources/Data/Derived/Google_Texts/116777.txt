Orlando-based HR software firm PlanSource, which now occupies almost the entire second floor of the downtown Exchange Building, is expanding again.

Having grown organically for the past several years, PlanSource announced that it bought software company ClearBenefits, a division of San Mateo, Calif.-based BENU Inc.

“We are in acquisition mode now. I think there will be a lot of opportunities for us to gobble up older platforms,” said CEO Dayne Williams.

About 25 employees with ClearBenefits will be joining PlanSource in California, Willams said. That boosts PlanSource’s total workforce to 282 now. Williams said he expects the company to employ 355 people by the end of 2015.

ClearBenefits designs a cloud-based benefits administration software platform.

“ClearBenefits has 300 clients that we are migrating onto our platform, mostly in California. It was a way for us to get a lot deeper in California,” Williams said in a brief interview. “They have a high-quality of staff, a good book of business, and we will be able to expand some of our services.”

PlanSource raised $12 million in venture capital for expansion in 2014. The company specializes in software platforms for health insurance administration.

In October, PlanSource launched a new online health insurance exchange for small or medium-sized California employers, called True Choice Private Marketplace.

The Sentinel has reported on a lot of acquisitions among Orlando tech companies this year including the largest, Pentaho selling to Hitachi for $500 million, and the sale of Code School to PluralSight for $36 million in stock and cash.
