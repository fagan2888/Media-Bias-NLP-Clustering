Anchor Health Logo There can be no doubt that Nurses, due to their education and professional experience, recognize the need for LTC protection more than any other large group.

The American Nurses Association (ANA), the nation’s only full-service professional organization representing the interests of the nation’s 3.1 million registered nurses, announced at their Executive Conference earlier in March, an agreement with Anchor Health Administrators to provide LTC Advocates for the ANA Members and their Families nationwide.

Anchor Health Administrators (Anchor) has over 18 years experience as specialists in Long-Term Care Insurance Planning for Medical Field Professionals, and has worked successfully with a number of the ANA constituent state nurses associations.

“There can be no doubt that Nurses, due to their education and professional experience, recognize the need for LTC protection more than any other large group,” stated Anchor Founder and President, Robert Wear. “With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the demands on the services of Nurses are going to continue to increase. Having LTC Protection means Nurses will not be as concerned about one important reality in life.”
