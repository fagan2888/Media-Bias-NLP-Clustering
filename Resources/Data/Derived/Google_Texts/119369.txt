OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - The annual air show at Offutt Air Force Base won’t be held this year because of planned construction.

The Omaha World-Herald reports (http://bit.ly/1ugWIFx ) that air show fans in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa will have to drive several hours to find one in 2015.

Maj. James Lee with the 55th Wing says the air show is being cancelled because Congress approved funding for a taxiway project at Offutt this year.

The Air Force plans to spend roughly $7 million to repave part of a taxiway that’s normally used for static displays and spectators at the air show. The Air Force Thunderbirds were expected to headline this year’s show.

Lee said he expects the air show to return in 2016.
