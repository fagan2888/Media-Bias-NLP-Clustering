Boehner later was re-elected to the House leadership post.\n\nThe letter explains to members of the U.S. House that two issues have \u201cprompted Americans to turn in droves to the Republican Party in November 2014 \u2013 Barack Obama\u2019s blatantly unconstitutional executive action to provide amnesty to millions of illegal aliens, and the deliberately deceptive restructuring of America\u2019s health-care system through Obamacare, which threatens to unravel the greatest health delivery system in the world.\u201d\n\nPointing out that Republicans before the election \u201csolemnly vowed to STOP this lame-duck president,\u201d the letter states: \u201cNow you have the power, right and duty to stop him.\n\n\u201cBut it won\u2019t happen with John Boehner leading you. You know this to be true. The trillion-dollar budget deal is just the latest proof that Boehner is not capable of leading the House to victory during this critical period.\u201d\n\nJoin the campaign now!\n\nThings were so bad in the south that Rep. Steve Pallazzo, R-Miss., felt compelled to send a mass email explaining how he met with Boehner \u201cone-on-one and man-to-man for more than an hour\u201d and \u201casked him directly whether he was going to be a conservative leader who will stand up to the liberal agenda of President Obama.\u201d\n\nTo which constituent Tracy Johnson Sr. wrote, \u201cMan to man really, so you looked a demon in the face asked him a question and think he did not lie to you? Are you stupid or what?\u201d\n\nAnswering his own question, Johnson added, \u201cI pretty much think you are a chicken crap politician who is no better than the liberals out there.\u201d\n\nJohn Stelmack asked, \u201cWhat kind of man would put his hand on the Bible, swear to uphold the Constitution, then turn around and vote for the man who demonstrated four years of blocking any defense against Obama?\u201d\n\nMoving from explaining to groveling, Palazzo says he \u201cconsidered\u201d opposing Boehner, but now he solemnly swears, \u201cIf Speaker Boehner refuses to put forward conservative solutions immediately to our nation\u2019s problems, I will vehemently oppose his every move.\u201d\n\nMike Longo summed up the sentiment of many Mississippians: \u201cYou\u2019re a fool if you think the people that are voting for you are falling for this and I\u2019m talking to you Steven Palazzo!\u201d\n\nLinda Louise Demaree got right to the point: \u201cYou lost my vote and a lot of other people\u2019s I know.\u201d\n\nRep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., found his eyebrows and other parts singed after voting for Boehner. He told outraged constituents: \u201cI declined to participate in a coup plot against Boehner that failed today by 11 votes. The plot was ill-conceived, ill-executed and designed to fail.\u201d\n\nTo which Heather Anne Searfoss responded: \u201cCoup? Plot? Are freaking serious here? Your Republican colleagues ARE the problem! A white knight? Stop talking to me like I\u2019m a child! I\u2019m disgusted.\u201d\n\nDon Peterson isn\u2019t buying it either: \u201cFor you to describe voting against an elected representative as a \u2018coup plot\u2019 is utterly repugnant. A coup is when a leader is removed from office by being rendered room temperature. What you should have done is to help remove a feckless, backstabbing, corrupt Boehner from the speakership via the constitutional process provided you. I will certainly remember this in two years.\u201d\n\nWhen DeSantis named Paul Ryan as a conservative he could support, Rodney Coffey replied incredulously, \u201cPaul Ryan a conservative?\u201d\n\nDeSantis tried to absolve himself by saying, \u201cfrom the CRomnibus to various bailouts and spending bills, I have consistently opposed Boehner\u2019s policies on the floor of the House.\u201d\n\nBut that didn\u2019t help. Josh Weitzell called DeSantis \u201ca spineless speedbump\u201d for complaining about Boehner then voting for him, while Greg Jahke compared his congressman to someone \u201cstanding by and watching another be brutally raped \u2013 we stood and did nothing because nobody else did.\u201d\n\nRep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, is another of many who caught heat. Enough heat that he told his constituents: \u201cI can\u2019t blame many of my supporters for being upset with my vote for Speaker Boehner. I ask, however, that they consider not just a single vote but my long record as a champion of conservative values who stands up to the establishment.\u201d\n\nJeff Alltus told Labrador: \u201cYou showed us you have a noodle for a backbone. I have given you money, had your signs on my properties. NO MORE!!!\u201d\n\nDeaunna Stafford was similarly unsparing in her critique: \u201cYou must be that GruberStupid to BELIEVE JohnFraudBoehner.\u201d\n\nDavid Heneise sounds like he fell out of love: \u201cI\u2019m not going to call you names because that doesn\u2019t do any good. I voted for you congressman precisely because you presented yourself as a conservative and you\u2019ve voted accordingly\u2026. in the past. However, \u2026what you did is the reason why people like myself are fed up with the typical Washington inside the beltway mentality.. say one thing and do another.\u201d\n\nRep. Doug Collins in Georgia found himself with a possible primary opponent \u2013 as well as a \u201cPrimary Doug Collins\u201d website and Facebook page \u2013 as a result of his vote.\n\nAl Gainey, a former county commissioner and conservative radio host is considering a run, telling the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \u201cI just cannot believe that we have had to put up with more of the same from everybody that goes to Washington from Georgia, from the senators in the past to the current congressmen.\u201d\n\nGainey would likely get Priscilla Barner Burnser\u2019s vote. She told Collins: \u201cI was truly disappointed with you for voting to re-elect Boehner. He is not a conservative. He is an Obama butt kisser. I cannot vote for you.\u201d\n\nAnd Debbie Jackson\u2019s vote, too: \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasted my vote on you. Your vote to keep Boehner as speaker was the final straw.\u201d\n\nRecruit your friends, neighbors, and fellow commuters to the \u201cDon\u2019t Be Yellow: Dump Boehner Now\u201d campaign with this exclusive bumper sticker.\n\nThe letter campaign to Congress already has generated more than 575,000 letters.\n\nJudson Phillips of Tea Party Nation explained why it\u2019s important.\n\nIn the Washington Times, he said: \u201cA month after its incredible victory, the GOP squandered its mandate, surrendering to the Democrats. The GOP-led House of Representatives did not proclaim its mandate and hold off on major decisions until the Republican majority in the Senate was sworn in. No, they went to the GOP position of preemptive surrender and gave President Obama and the Democrats almost everything they wanted.\n\n\u201cDespite the pleas and demands from the base, the GOP did nothing to stop Mr. Obama\u2019s executive amnesty. They even rewarded left-wing billionaires who had spent millions to keep the Democrats in power by extending so-called \u2018Green Energy\u2019 subsidies,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe architect of the Republican surrender was House Speaker John Boehner.\u201d\n\nMembers of Congress also have reported a flood of telephone calls from constituents critical of their vote to keep Boehner as speaker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The true measure of the impact of a \u201cDump Boehner Now\u201d letter campaign, which allows voters to urge every single Republican House member to find a replacement for the current House speaker, rests not with the two dozen who voted against him.
