Bobby Jindal said during a breakfast with the Story County GOP on Saturday.\n\nJindal has not announced his plans for 2016, but is considered likely to join the field of Republican presidential candidates.\n\nJindal started his talk by listing the \u201cworst\u201d things President Obama has done to the country, saying that even worse in his view than the growing national debt, Obamacare, Environmental Protection Agency regulations and foreign policy, is Obama\u2019s \u201cattempt to redefine the very idea of America and the idea of the American dream.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to about 50 people at Oakwood Road Church, in Ames, Jindal also said the \u201cthreat of radical Islamic terrorists\u201d is no longer theoretical, and is not a threat in other parts of the country, but a threat here in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a president who refuses to identify the threat we face,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he won\u2019t even call them the radical Islamic terrorists they are, how do we beat them?\u201d\n\nJindal said \u201cwe must insist that Muslim leaders, Muslim clerics, acknowledge that Islam has got a problem, and that problem is radicalism.\u201d\n\nPerhaps even more dangerous, Jindal said, is the \u201cinternal threat\u201d of an \u201cassault we see on religious liberty across our country.\u201d\n\nJindal said there is an \u201call-out assault\u201d from the left, and said he\u2019s tired of the party\u2019s hypocrisy.\n\n\u201cThey tell you that they\u2019re for tolerance and respect, and they are, unless you disagree with them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you see right now is they\u2019re trying to discriminate against Christian-owned businesses and other individuals who don\u2019t want to violate their conscience or beliefs, don\u2019t want to participate in weddings that offend their beliefs.\u201d\n\nAsked for a response, Iowa Democratic Party spokesman Sam Lau said \u201cwhat\u2019s hypocritical is for Bobby Jindal to refer to himself as an ideas guy when all of his ideas have failed the working people of Louisiana.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that his approval ratings in Louisiana are at an all-time low when his state ranks close to the bottom on education, health care and overall quality of life,\u201d Lau said. \u201cLike the rest of the Republican field, Bobby Jindal puts his own political ambition and the needs of the wealthy few over what is best for middle class families.\u201d\n\nTalking with reporters after the breakfast, Jindal said he believes Religious Freedom Restoration Acts such as the one in Indiana that drew controversy from people who believed it allowed businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians, gives people a shield to protect their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt simply allows you your day in court, it allows you to go to court and make your argument,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be okay for the state and it shouldn\u2019t be okay for folks to go in there and simply override their religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nJindal said while he believes the definition of marriage is between a man and a woman, \u201cyou can have religious liberty without discrimination.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, was also at the event, and said he wants to do as many events as he can with potential candidates as Iowa moves forward in the nomination selection process.\n\nKing said the Iowa Straw Poll, which will be held at the Central Iowa Expo in Boone in August, has \u201cnever been more important than it is now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had such a long and broad field of great candidates as we have now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe early selection process is going to help slowly winnow this field down so that the final decision made out of Iowa is made far more incrementally than we\u2019ve seen before.\u201d\n\nKing said we need a president who can inspire the country, listing Franklin Roosevelt during World War II and Ronald Reagan as examples.\n\n\u201cWe need a president who will restore the soul of America,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The two greatest threats facing the United States are the \u201cexternal\u201d threat of radical Islam and the \u201cinternal\u201d threat of an assault on religious liberties, Louisiana Gov.
