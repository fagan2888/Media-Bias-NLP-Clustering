I kept wondering, you know, am i going to get better? It was rough,\" Johnson described.\n\nSeveral doctors and hospitals later, Norm enrolled in a clinical trial at Cleveland Clinic for a new device called a leadless pacemaker, it doesn't have wires and doesn't require any incisions.\n\n\"It's a fully self-contained unit less than 10% of a traditional pacemaker. It gets around the long standing limitations of a traditional pacemaker,\" Cleveland Clinic Dr. Cantillion explained.\n\nA flexible tube, or catheter, is snaked through a vein in the leg up to the heart and the leadless pacemaker is placed inside one chamber.\n\nIt's anchored by a tiny cork-screw-like tip and controls the heart's rhythm.\n\nThe device is still experimental but new research published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows it's safe and effective, especially so for Norm.\n\n\"He could preserve the benefits of having a pacemaker while alleviating the problems that were created by the traditional pacemaker, you know it was an absolute home run,\" Dr. Cantillion pointed out.\n\nNorm feels like himself again. His heart doesn't miss a beat, and neither does he.\n\n\"I couldn't ask for a better life, you know. I'm back to doing what i like to do. So, life has gotten really good,\" said an enthusiastic Johnson,\n\nThe leadless pacemaker is not yet FDA approved.\n\nIt's currently designed for someone who only needs one chamber of the heart stimulated, and that's about 10-percent of people who need a pacemaker.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Pacemakers have been around for more than 50 years, but the technology that helps the heart beat properly isn't a perfect fit for everyone.", "language": "english", "og": {"description": "Pacemakers have been around for more than 50 years, but the technology that helps the heart beat properly isn't a perfect fit for everyone.", "title": "Wireless Pacemakers Changing Lives", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/news/newschannel7today/headlines/Wireless-Pacemakers-Changing-Lives-325311211.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/319/B2E/319B2E8BF4534D869258A10370190531", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/7EF/D1B/7EFD1BDE457C47F4A106436DC9C67BF3.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "Pacemakers have been around for more than 50 years, but the technology that helps the heart beat properly isn't a perfect fit for everyone.", "title": "Wireless Pacemakers Changing Lives", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/news/newschannel7today/headlines/Wireless-Pacemakers-Changing-Lives-325311211.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/pacemaker2.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Wireless Pacemakers Changing Lives", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It gets around the long standing limitations of a traditional pacemaker,\" Cleveland Clinic Dr. Cantillion explained.\nSo, life has gotten really good,\" said an enthusiastic Johnson,The leadless pacemaker is not yet FDA approved.\n\"It's a fully self-contained unit less than 10% of a traditional pacemaker.\nHis heart doesn't miss a beat, and neither does he.\nA flexible tube, or catheter, is snaked through a vein in the leg up to the heart and the leadless pacemaker is placed inside one chamber."}
