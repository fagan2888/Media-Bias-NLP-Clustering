WASHINGTON â€” Allies of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush launched an advertisement Tuesday contrasting his record with that of Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the two Republican presidential candidates he needs to beat in the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary.

Recent polls show Christie ahead of both Bush and Kasich. All three candidates are seeking the same pool of establishment Republican voters and donors, and a poor showing for any of them in the first-in-the-nation primary could doom their campaigns.

The ad came from Right to Rise, the pro-Bush super political action committee that raised $103 million through Sept. 30. It compares Bush, Christie and Kasich and says Bush was the only one of the three who receive plaudits for responding to nine hurricanes, was No. 1 in job creation, opposed the expansion of the Affordable Care Act to poorer residents, and offered a plan to destroy the Islamic State before the Paris attacks.

Both Christie and Kasich accepted federal funds to provide health care to their poorer residents under the Affordable Care Act, and Christie has touted his experience as a federal prosecutor after 9/11 as terrorism moved to the forefront of Republican voters' concerns after Paris.

Bush, who began the year as the GOP front-runner but has dropped in opinion polls, has used the Republican presidential debates to attack two candidates ahead of him, businessman Donald Trump and a fellow Floridian, Marco Rubio. Right to Rise has run ads critical of both of them.

Christie campaign spokeswoman Samantha Smith did not respond to a request for comment.
