Feminist icon -- and Hillary Clinton supporter -- Gloria Steinem says young women are supporting Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders because "the boys are with Bernie."

Steinem made the comment Friday night in response to a question from comedian and "Real Time" host Bill Maher when asked why the former secretary of state isn't doing better with young women.

Steinem said that young women will get more radical as they age, because women lose power as they get older.

"They're going to get more activist as they get older," Steinem said. "And when you're young, you're thinking, 'Where are the boys?' The boys are with Bernie."
