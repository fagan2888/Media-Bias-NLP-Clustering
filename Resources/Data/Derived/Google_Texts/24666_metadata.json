He married into an acclaimed Athabascan family. His own family, back in Cleveland, are six-figure donors to Republicans in high places. One of his biggest assets, though, is his resume.\n\nDownload Audio\n\nDegrees from Harvard and Georgetown. Positions in the White House and State Department. And, interspersed throughout, service as infantry officer in the Marines. Gov. Sarah Palin gushed about his \u201camazing credentials\u201d just before she appointed him Alaska Attorney General. Topping off his C.V.: three years as Alaska\u2019s Natural Resources Commissioner.\n\nHis resume is part of what impresses Irene Rowan, who has worked on Alaska Native issues since the 1960s and is close to Sullivan\u2019s wife.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll do very well for Alaska in Washington,\u201d she says. \u201cHe has the drive, he has knowledge of all the Alaska issues, and he knows how to move around in the system of Washington DC.\u201d\n\nSullivan deploys his resume to strategic advantage. He says he\u2019s the only candidate in the race who has a real record of fighting the policies of the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cFighting the federal government\u2019s over-reach, taking it to the Obama administration,\u201d he said on KOAN recently. \u201cA lot of candidates love to talk about that. I\u2019ve had the honor of being in the arena, battling these guys.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a candidate\u2019s job to sell his accomplishments. But political opponents say his resume has thin spots and complain he oversells himself. Sullivan, for instance, often says he was one of the lead AGs in the country to challenge the legality of \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn terms of credibility candidates, I\u2019m the one who sat down, the one who sued on this, the one who laid out a lot of the intellectual framework of why we thought (the Affordable Care Act) was unconstitutional,\u201d he said.\n\nSullivan\u2019s name is on a 2010 memo to Gov. Sean Parnell analyzing the legality of the Affordable Care Act. But Alaska didn\u2019t file its own challenge. It attached its name to a lawsuit out of Florida, after 20 states were on already board. It\u2019s much the same with the dragon all the Republican candidates pledge to slay \u2013 the EPA.\n\n\u201cWe won a case that I brought, originally brought, just three days ago,\u201d he said at a Republican debate in June. \u201cIn the U.S. Supreme Court! With the EPA! Putting them in their place.\u201d\n\nThe case was about the EPA\u2019s power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which, actually the Supreme Court left intact, at least for major smokestacks. Alaska tagged on to a case filed previously filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. These days Sullivan says he brought the case, but a press release from Sullivan\u2019s time as AG strikes a softer tone. It quotes Sullivan saying the state\u2019s involvement began in 2003 \u2013 years before Sullivan became attorney general.\n\nAs AG and later as DNR commissioner, Sullivan frequently cited his professional history during lobbying visits in Washington, says Russ Kelly. Kelly was an associate director of Gov. Parnell\u2019s Washington, D.C. office and was assigned on several occasions to shadow Sullivan as he made the rounds of congressional offices.\n\n\u201cI was disappointed,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the meetings went well. I didn\u2019t think they were productive.\u201d\n\nAfter one trip, Kelly wrote a long memo to top Parnell staffers critiquing Sullivan\u2019s work. It was recently emailed anonymously to APRN. Kelly, who had a bad break with the Parnell Administration, says he doesn\u2019t know who\u2019s distributing it. He says he wrote it because he felt a duty to report what he\u2019d seen of Sullivan\u2019s presentations on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI was concerned that when you go into these offices and you don\u2019t make the right impression and you don\u2019t have substance to share, then you\u2019re at risk of burning bridges and hurting relationships for the future,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the 2011 memo, Kelly says in most offices, Sullivan spent too much time reciting his resume and basic facts about Alaska, even when, in Kelly\u2019s opinion, the situation called for more complex answers.\n\nBut Kelly\u2019s memo says Sullivan made good use of his connections, particularly with Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, with whom he exchanged family news. Sullivan has connections across Washington, but his link to Sen. Portman is especially valuable. Portman\u2019s the chief fundraiser for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, an arm of the party. Over the years, Portman and his leadership fund have received tens of thousands of dollars from Sullivan relatives in Ohio and employees of RPM International. That\u2019s the paint company Sullivan\u2019s grandfather founded and his brother Frank now runs. The NRSC is supposed to remain neutral in a Republican primary, but Portman\u2019s presence at a Sullivan fundraiser on Capitol Hill last fall helped raise his profile among national donors.\n\nSo far, Sullivan has raised $3.8 million, nearly 90% of it from out of state. He\u2019s keeping pace with Sen. Mark Begich \u2013 quite a feat for a first-time candidate. Meanwhile, two Sullivan brothers and an ex-RPM board member have paid $125,000 to an independent campaign called Alaska\u2019s Energy/America\u2019s Values that\u2019s dedicated to promoting Sullivan.\n\nSullivan brushes off questions about how his family\u2019s political contacts may have helped him raise money from national groups.\n\n\u201cWe worked hard to get in front of those groups and make our case that we were the strongest candidate to win this primary, win this race,\u201d Sullivan says.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce has run a TV ad promoting Sullivan. Sullivan\u2019s brother Frank sits on the board of the U.S. Chamber. When pressed about any help his brother may have provided, Sullivan sticks to generalities.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of people who\u2019ve been helpful \u2026. A lot of people who have been helpful who care about America,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the gems of Sullivan\u2019s resume is his military service. Sullivan was a full-time Marine for four years. As a reservist, he spent all of 2005 as staff to the general in charge of the entire Middle East.\n\n\u201cIraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan \u2013 wherever he was \u2026. I was with him,\u201d he says.\n\nLast year, Sullivan was called up for six weeks to Afghanistan, where he says he focused on dismantling terrorist networks. As an infantry officer, Sullivan is trained to \u201ckick in doors and kill bad guys,\u201d as he put it to a conservative group in Wasilla, according the Anchorage Daily News. While rival Republican Joe Miller often calls himself a \u201ccombat vet,\u201d that\u2019s one thing Sullivan acknowledges is not on his resume.\n\n\u201cI do not consider myself combat in terms of kicking in doors, shooting, being shot at. I\u2019m an infantry officer. I was a recon officer. I\u2019ve spent years up here training hundreds of Alaskans to be recon officers,\u201d he says.\n\nLike Republican opponent Mead Treadwell, Sullivan has a history on the climate change question. These days, Sullivan sounds like a skeptic: \u201cThe consensus in the scientific community on what\u2019s going on with regard to man-made global climate change is still out.\u201d\n\nBut in 2007, as an assistant secretary of State, he flew to Germany to help sell the Bush climate initiative. At a press conference in Berlin, he insisted to a room of doubtful reporters that the administration was serious about helping meet UN targets for greenhouse gas reductions.\n\n\u201cOur goal, our stated goal, has been to slow, stop and reduce emissions,\u201d Sullivan told them, according to the State Department transcript.\n\nSullivan says he thinks the scientific consensus on climate change has weakened since then.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "As a candidate for U.S. Senate, Dan Sullivan has a bucket of advantages.
