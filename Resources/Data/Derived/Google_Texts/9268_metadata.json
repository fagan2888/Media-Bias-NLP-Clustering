REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\n4136501\n\nThe annual costs of Obamacare regulations come in at $6.8 billion a year so far \u2014 around 2.5 times the total benefits of its heavy-handed regulations, according to study released Monday.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s estimates of Obamacare\u2019s regulatory \u201cbenefits\u201d \u2014 what they project in increased efficiency or productivity due to streamlined processes and standards \u2014 clock in at just $2.6 billion annually, as opposed to the cost of complying with all those regulations, which is almost $7 billion.\n\nBy 2014, when all but those delayed parts of the Affordable Care Act have been implemented, regulations have imposed over $27.2 billion in costs upon the private sector and $8 billion in unfunded state burdens, the report by free-market think tank American Action Forum (AAF) found.\n\nA large portion of the costs come from the paperwork burden that Obamacare places upon states and private companies. Implementing the law takes 159 million paperwork hours a year for state governments and the private sector \u2014 an amount that would take close to 80,000 employees, working 50 weeks per year full-time. (That\u2019s 40 hours per week, not Obamacare\u2019s 30-hour work week threshold for full-time.)\n\n\u201cThese burdens obviously cost states and private entities time and money,\u201d writes AAF\u2019s Sam Batkins, the study\u2019s author, \u201cwhich could otherwise be devoted to productivity, not regulatory compliance.\u201d\n\nThe tallied costs of the Affordable Care Act don\u2019t include the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s prediction that the law will reduce employment by 2.5 million by 2024, for one, or inefficiencies in insurance policy cancellations and widespread problems with federal and state Obamacare exchanges.\n\nSome parts of the law aren\u2019t analyzed at all: federal regulations on the employer mandate \u2014 widely lambasted for placing undue burdens on companies large and small \u2014 simply don\u2019t include costs, benefits or paperwork requirements. Batkins concludes that when it comes to this cornerstone of Obamacare, \u201cthe public has little knowledge of the law\u2019s broader impact.\u201d\n\nObamacare authorizes at least 11 regulations that will have a significant economic impact on small businesses, including mandatory labeling for restaurant menus and vending machines and payment systems policies, among others. The total bill will be $1.9 billion for small companies, according to the federal government\u2019s public numbers.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
