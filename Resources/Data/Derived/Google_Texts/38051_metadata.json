The \u201cmommy issues,\u201d therefore, consisted of health care, the environment, welfare and other poverty programs, education, and Medicare and other programs for the elderly.\n\nThe Republican Party, by contrast, has been viewed as the \u201cdaddy party,\u201d emphasizing limited government as a force for order and restraint, a mechanism to ensure rights, not engage in social engineering. The \u201cdaddy issues,\u201d therefore, consisted of national security, illegal immigration, terrorism, law and order, and familial and societal breakdown.\n\nIf the \u201cdaddy party\u201d is the enforcer, making individuals live up to their responsibilities and face tough realities, the \u201cmommy party\u201d is the overbearing, suffocating and invasive busybody.\n\nIn other words, Hillary Clinton. But now she\u2019s not just a mother but a grandmother who freely admits to coloring her hair, presumably to cover the gray. Running to be \u201cAmerica\u2019s grandmother\u201d fits in nicely with the longstanding \u201cmaternal\u201d sensibility of her party.\n\nOr does it?\n\nThe problem for her now is that President Obama turned the maternal imagery on its head when he positioned himself as a coldly detached father, using the wooden spoon on the noggin of anyone who dared to disobey him.\n\nTo Mr. Obama, anyone voicing public disapproval of his plans needs to be removed or crushed. Campaigning as a unifying transcendent figure and governing as a radical redistributionist involved two different skill sets. Once he became president, the unifying, jovial guy disappeared and was replaced by Big Daddy.\n\nEvery president assumes a somewhat paternalistic role as he leads the nation, even if he comes from the \u201cmommy party.\u201d He\u2019s the guy in charge, shaping the country, leading us in war, making or keeping the peace, herding Congress and presiding over some 300 million citizens who look to him for protection, reassurance and guidance.\n\nMr. Obama, however, has taken the daddy role and supersized it. Let\u2019s face it. Mr. Obama is the worst national daddy ever.\n\nIn his 2009 inaugural address, he returned to a phrase that he had used before as he admonished us to \u201cput away childish things.\u201d In framing it that way, Mr. Obama subliminally put each American in the position of being a child. And of course, the nanny state he is building makes children out of all of us, as the government \u2014 with him sitting at the top \u2014 strips away your freedom and makes you a dependent.\n\nBy virtue of his super-paternalistic role, Mr. Obama elevated himself over Congress as well as the American people. Two days after he was sworn-in as president, Mr. Obama invited top congressional leaders to the White House to discuss plans for economic \u201cstimulus.\u201d When Republican Sen. John Kyl challenged him over the package\u2019s massive spending and tax \u201ccut\u201d to people who did not pay income taxes, Mr. Obama shot back: \u201cI won.\u201d\n\nTwo months later, the House Democratic Caucus met with Mr. Obama to discuss his budget proposal. When the president spotted Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio, who had voted against the \u201cstimulus,\u201d Mr. Obama leaned in to him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t think we\u2019re not keeping score, brother.\u201d\n\nThis was the presidency, done Sopranos-style. But it was also designed to remind Congress of who was boss. Big Daddy was now on the scene, and that co-equal branches of government thing? Forget it. In fact, Mr. Obama took to routinely lecturing Congress about this or that policy, repeatedly summoning congressional leaders to the White House on whims, convening numerous joint sessions to make them show up and applaud his latest radical proposal on health care or solar energy.\n\nDuring the 2011 debt debate, Mr. Obama even instructed members of Congress to \u201ceat their peas\u201d and get a deal in front of him. \u201cHey you kids! Stop fighting and play nice!\u201d He relished playing Big Daddy as he presided over a rapidly growing welfare state in which all of us are infantilized, and like dutiful children, silenced.\n\nThis is the new dynamic around which Mrs. Clinton must now maneuver. She is completely at home in the \u201cmommy party,\u201d and it\u2019s logical, given her sex, for her to run as Big Mommy. But Mr. Obama has cleverly reoriented the parental imagery, leaving her a bit confused as to her political gender role.\n\nShe is already trying to steer away from Mr. Obama\u2019s cold Big Daddy style, but her journey may be bumpy \u2014 especially if Mr. Obama has anything to say about it, as control-freak fathers often do.\n\n\u2022 Monica Crowley is online opinion editor at The Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For those trying to identify one accomplishment of Hillary Clinton's, here it is: She has put the \"Mommy party\" on pantsuited steroids.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "For those trying to identify one accomplishment of Hillary Clinton\u2019s, here it is: She has put the \u201cMommy party\u201d on pantsuited steroids.", "title": "MONICA CROWLEY: How Barack Obama screwed up Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u2018mommy party\u2019 strategy", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/17/monica-crowley-troubles-for-hillary-clintons-mommy/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/17/6_172015_b1-crowley28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/17/6_172015_b1-crowley28201.jpg", "description": "For those trying to identify one accomplishment of Hillary Clinton's, here it is: She has put the \"Mommy party\" on pantsuited steroids.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "MONICA CROWLEY: How Barack Obama screwed up Hillary Clinton\u2019s"}, "Author": "Monica Crowley", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Hillary Clinton, Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdacc8\"", "article_summary": "She is completely at home in the \u201cmommy party,\u201d and it\u2019s logical, given her sex, for her to run as Big Mommy.\nANALYSIS/OPINION:For those trying to identify one accomplishment of Hillary Clinton\u2018s, here it is: She has put the \u201cMommy party\u201d on pantsuited steroids.\nIf the \u201cdaddy party\u201d is the enforcer, making individuals live up to their responsibilities and face tough realities, the \u201cmommy party\u201d is the overbearing, suffocating and invasive busybody.\nFor decades, the Democratic Party has been considered the \u201cmommy party,\u201d stressing expansive government as a provider of safety and social welfare.\nBy virtue of his super-paternalistic role, Mr. Obama elevated himself over Congress as well as the American people."}
