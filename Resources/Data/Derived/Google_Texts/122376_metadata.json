LOUIS \u2014 Avalanche general manager Joe Sakic has cleared Mikko Rantanen to play for host Team Finland at the upcoming World Junior Championship in Helsinki. Rantanen, 19, is under contract with Avalanche but playing for its American Hockey League affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage.\n\nHe leads the Rampage in scoring with 21 points (eight goals) in just 17 games. Rantanen, who was selected 10th by the Avalanche in the 2015 NHL draft, played for Finland last year at the WJC in Montreal and Toronto, leading the Finns in scoring with four points \u2014 all goals \u2014 in five games.\n\nMost WJC players are amateurs and get clearance from their NCAA or junior teams. The Avalanche has no draftees on the United States\u2019 or Canada\u2019s preliminary rosters.\n\nThe WJC begins Dec. 26, and the gold-medal game is Jan. 5.\n\nLocal ties. Defenseman Brandon Carlo of Colorado Springs and forward Scott Eansor of Englewood are on the preliminary U.S. WJC roster. Carlo, who plays for major-junior\u2019s Tri-City Americans and is a 2015 second-round draftee of the Boston Bruins, is among seven returnees from the 2015 team that was upset in the quarterfinals by Russia.\n\nFootnotes. Avalanche captain Gabe Landeskog returned to the lineup after missing two games with back spasms. The left winger rejoined the Nathan MacKinnon-centered line, and Mikhail Grigorenko was moved to the fourth line. \u2026 Defenseman Zach Redmond and center Chris Wagner were Colorado\u2019s healthy scratches. Wagner had played in the previous 13 games since being claimed on waivers from Anaheim. \u2026 Colorado entered the game leading the NHL in blocked shots (511). The Avs are one of the few teams that mandate all players to wear protective plastic skate fenders.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche GM Joe Sakic has cleared Mikko Rantanen to play for Team Finland", "title": "Avalanche GM Joe Sakic has cleared Mikko Rantanen to play for Team Finland", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/13/avalanche-gm-joe-sakic-has-cleared-mikko-rantanen-to-play-for-team-finland/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151213__Mikko-Rantanenp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151213__Mikko-Rantanenp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-13T20:26:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T21:41:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "ST.
