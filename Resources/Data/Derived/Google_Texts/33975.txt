North Carolina's insurance commission says the federal health care law is causing havoc in the insurance market in the state.

The News & Observer of Raleigh reported that commissioner Wayne Goodwin says the Affordable Care Act might prompt some insurance companies to leave North Carolina.

Goodwin wrote to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvian Burwell this week.

Goodwin is a Democrat who met with Obama administration officials in November, telling them the law is increasing insurance costs, reducing consumer choices and creating unsustainable financial losses for insurance companies.

Supporters of the law say Goodwin is overstating the problems. They say the law has reduced the number of uninsured people in North Carolina.

Goodwin wrote he's worried insurance companies will pull out of the North Carolina individual insurance market.
