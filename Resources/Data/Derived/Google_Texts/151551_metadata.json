So I was struck by his observation about Donald Trump during the course of an interview with New York magazine\u2019s Gabriel Sherman: \u201cFor Donald Trump to win, everything we know about politics has to be wrong.\u201d\n\nThis strikes me as exactly true. In order for Trump\u2014or Ben Carson or Carly Fiorina\u2014to win the GOP nomination, everything we know about American politics would have to be wrong. Think about it: In order for the same electorate which nominated Mitt Romney four years ago to switch to Donald Trump, the voters would have to undergo some sort of paradigm shift in preferences.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, our parties hardly ever nominate non-professional politicians. There\u2019s an American tradition of having generals in the White House\u2014which stretches back to Washington\u2014but the last general to be nominated by a party was Eisenhower in 1952. Since then, only one general has run (Wesley Clark in 2004).\n\nNon-military, non-political professionals first started running regularly in the early twentieth century, and they\u2019ve had a dismal record. Only one captured a party\u2019s nomination. (That was Wendell Willkie in 1940, as the Republican nominee. And Willkie was as hip-deep into politics as you can be while still retaining civilian status.) Every other outsider: Channing Phillips, Ellen McCormack, Jesse Jackson, Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan, Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, Al Sharpton, Alan Keyes, Herman Cain\u2014no dice.\n\nSo if Trump, Fiorina, or Carson win the nomination it will mean that something fundamental about the political order has changed. It would mean that this time it\u2019s different.\n\nIn general, \u201cthis time it\u2019s different\u201d is one of the most dangerous phrases in the English language. But what if this time really is different? There\u2019s certainly an argument to be made that it might be.\n\nBarack Obama has become the transformational president he aspired to be. Among the things he has transformed is the nature of the political compact between the rulers and the ruled in our republic.\n\nBefore Obama, citizens hoped that their elected leaders would be wise, independent, and disinterested leaders\u2014but they never really counted on utopian vision. What they banked on was that the people they elected would, at the very least, be self-interested vote-seekers\u2014so that if voters started punishing politicians for a specific course of action, the politicians would abandon it.\n\nThe passage of Obamacare broke this arrangement. And the impending passage of the Iran nuclear deal, in the face of voter discontent will cement this new relationship as the norm. In both cases, Democratic law makers went along in processes that were highly irregular (the nuclear option for passage of Obamacare; no treaty ratification with Iran); with initiatives they largely disliked on the merits; that voters demonstrably disliked in polling; and that had (or are likely to have) negative outcomes not just in the real world, but in the political world, too. This sort of power dynamic is new in American politics.\n\nOther things are new, too. Such as having the understanding of marriage dating back thousands of years redefined by a single unelected justice. Or having the rule of law downgraded to the level of executive discretion (on Obamacare, on marijuana, on immigration, etc). Or having an economic recovery that, seven years in, still feels like a recession. Or having a stretch of four presidential terms in which you could plausibly argue that at the end of the term the country has been in worse condition than it was at the beginning.\n\nSo maybe this time is different and maybe everything we know about politics is, if not wrong, exactly, then is changing.\n\nBut maybe not. As altered as the political order looks today from what it had been, there are two other recent moments at which the world changed in fundamental ways, too. In 1989, with the end of the Cold War, and in 2001, with 9/11 and the war against Islamic terrorism. If \u201ceverything we knew about politics\u201d was ever going to be wrong, it should have been in the 1992 or 2004 elections.\n\nBut in the end, both of those races turned out to be reasonably conventional.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "2016 Elections,Ben Carson,Carly Fiorina,Donald Trump,Establishment,Jeb Bush,Jonathan V.
