Fox Newsian (Shep Smith) breaks rank, says something sensible. Rush Limbaugh promptly mocks him for it.\n\nThere was a strange outbreak of sanity this week on Fox News. Well, not an outbreak. One case. Shep Smith made an impassioned statement about how Ebola hysteria is counterproductive, and Americans should not be swept up in it. \u201cDo not listen to the hysterical voices on the radio and the television or read the fear-provoking words online,\u201d he urged his viewers. \u201cThe people who say and write hysterical things are being very irresponsible.\u201d\n\nWhoa, Shep. What are you saying? Sowing fear and panic is your network\u2019s bread and butter. This is heresy.\n\nOne day we may really have something to panic about, Smith continued. And we\u2019re not going to ready for it. We\u2019ll have spent all our panic chips. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna panic when we\u2019re supposed to and we\u2019re certainly not gonna panic now,\u201d Smith pleaded. \u201cWe have to stop it.\u201d\n\nFortunately, this outbreak of somewhat inarticulate reasonableness was contained. The rest of the Fox News team donned their Hazmat suits and ratcheted up the crazy, irresponsible fearmongering and Obama-blaming. Good ol\u2019 Rush Limbaugh sagely did the manly thing and mocked Shep Smith, calling him a sissy. \u201cShep Smith was crying so much during his reporting from New Orleans in Hurricane Katrina his mascara was running,\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cBut we need to dial it all back here.\u201d\n\nAll is right once again in the right-wing conservoverse, where sanity proved to be an isolated case.\n\n2. Dr. Keith Ablow: Obama has it in for us; that\u2019s why he\u2019s trying to give us Ebola.\n\nReality seldom impinges on the world that Dr. Keith Ablow, a member of Fox\u2019s \u201cmedical A-team,\u201d is creating in his own head. In this world, President Obama hates America and that\u2019s why he isn\u2019t protecting Americans from the Ebola virus by closing the border.\n\nAblow explained all this on Fox radio this week, that Obama thinks of himself as a \u201ccitizen and a leader of the world\u201d who has no affinity for any particular country \u201cperhaps least of all this country because he has it in for us as disappointing people. People who\u2019ve been a scourge on the face of the Earth.\u201d Ouch.\n\nAblow said that \u201cas a psychiatrist,\u201d this is his professional and considered opinion. He cannot even believe the suggestion that his views on Obama being un-American and loving people in Africa more than Americans could possibly be construed as racist. He is shocked, shocked I tell you. \u201cI would say the same thing if he was from Luxembourg,\u201d he said.\n\nWell, that ought to settle it.\n\nIn fact, Ablow is so unracist that he graciously offered to treat the president, whom he called, \u201cOur patient in chief.\u201d Ablow would love the opportunity to sit Obama down and explain to him why he hates America so much, and why this is a problem. \u201cIt\u2019s psychologically difficult to defend and protect a country that you have it in for,\u201d he said.\n\nClearly a doctor with deep compassion.\n\n3. Donald Trump: The president is a \u2018psycho.\u2019\n\nBlowhard businessman Donald Trump has not been able to get any of his blatantly racist birther theories or other accusations to stick against the black man who has taken over the White House by being elected, twice. But Trump, who counts excessive germophobia among his charming traits, is particularly worked up about this Ebola thing. Ever the nice guy, he opposed allowing Ebola-infected American doctor Kent Brantly back into the country for treatment in Georgia a while ago, because maybe Trump would catch it in New York. And of course, Trump favors the travel ban from West Africa that conservatives are calling for. Because, of course he does.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One Fox News expert actually thinks Obama is using the disease as a biological weapon against America", "title": "6 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 Ebola idiocy abounds", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "One Fox News expert actually thinks Obama is using the disease as a biological weapon against America", "title": "6 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 Ebola idiocy abounds", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/20/6_worst_right_wing_moments_of_the_week_ebola_idiocy_abounds_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/laura_ingraham3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One Fox News expert actually thinks Obama is using the disease as a biological weapon against America", "title": "6 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 Ebola idiocy abounds", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/laura_ingraham3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Janet Allon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Africa, AlterNet, Donald Trump, ebola, Laura Ingraham, Rush Limbaugh, Shep Smith", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Africa, AlterNet, Donald Trump, ebola, Laura Ingraham, Rush Limbaugh, Shep Smith, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNet1.\nShep Smith made an impassioned statement about how Ebola hysteria is counterproductive, and Americans should not be swept up in it.\nDr. Keith Ablow: Obama has it in for us; that\u2019s why he\u2019s trying to give us Ebola.\n\u201cShep Smith was crying so much during his reporting from New Orleans in Hurricane Katrina his mascara was running,\u201d Limbaugh said.\nGood ol\u2019 Rush Limbaugh sagely did the manly thing and mocked Shep Smith, calling him a sissy."}
