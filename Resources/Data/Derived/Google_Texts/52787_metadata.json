We still need to make sure that paid family leave is not the exception around the country, but is the rule,\" Obama said. \"So that women, especially low-income women, don't lose their jobs for minor things like giving birth. We have to end violence against women. We have to end practices like child marriage. We've got to make sure that girls around the world have the same opportunities as boys to go to school.\"\n\nObama also spoke on the topic of online harassment, particularly against women who play video games and on social media. He remarked that on Twitter, female journalists receive three times the abuse when compared to male colleagues.\n\nThe president said that although progress has been made, much more needs to be done -- including in efforts to remove the \"glass ceiling\" that prevents women from reaching deserved opportunities.\n\n\"That is why we celebrate Women's History Month -- not to get complacent, but to take a moment each year and celebrate the achievements that women have fought so hard to achieve, and to rededicate ourselves to tackling the challenges that remain,\" Obama said.\n\nThe president's speech can be found below, beginning at the 43:25 time mark, after he was introduced by Marvel's Director of Content and Character Development Sana Amanat, who began speaking at the 40:00 time mark:", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama celebrated Women's History Month during an address at the White House, where he urged for global gender equality.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "President Barack Obama celebrated Women's History Month during an address at the White House, where he urged for global gender equality.", "title": "Obama praises progress, urges more at Women's History Month reception", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/03/17/Obama-praises-progress-urges-more-at-Womens-History-Month-reception/2641458213092/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/2641458213092/2016/6/a31bc8befcabbfa70532f4a91fb75419/v2.1/Obama-praises-progress-urges-more-at-Womens-History-Month-reception.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama celebrated Women's History Month during an address at the White House, where he urged for global gender equality.", "creator": "@AVPLive9", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2641458213092/2016/upi/d276500239f0a9b60b2fb695539665d9/v2.1/Obama-praises-progress-urges-more-at-Womens-History-Month-reception.jpg?lg=4", "title": "Obama praises progress, urges more at Women's History Month reception", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., Barack Obama", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "\"We still need to fight for economic equality, for equal opportunities for entrepreneurs, for equal pay for equal work.\nWASHINGTON, March 17 (UPI) -- President Barack Obama celebrated Women's History Month during an address at the White House, where he urged for global gender equality.\nObama also spoke on the topic of online harassment, particularly against women who play video games and on social media.\nWe still need to make sure that paid family leave is not the exception around the country, but is the rule,\" Obama said.\nWe've got to make sure that girls around the world have the same opportunities as boys to go to school.\""}
