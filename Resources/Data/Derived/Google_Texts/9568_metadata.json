From the transcript:\n\n\u201cI think we do a better job than most. You look at the racial composition of our police department \u2013 it looks like the communities that we serve.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the movement toward cameras and videos \u2013 we were already discussing that before before the Ferguson judgment. And I think because of the history of the city of Atlanta, candidly, we work harder at issues of race than other communities do. It\u2019s part of the DNA of our city being the home of Dr. Martin Luther King.\n\n\u201cBut what I made clear is that Ferguson can happen anywhere. Because it\u2019s about the judgment of an individual officer. What we have to do is\u2026to make sure that we don\u2019t take a broad brush and paint police officers as bad people, because they do a tough job. But when we see wrong, we need to act decisively.\n\n\u201cAnd in order to make there be real value from the losses we\u2019ve seen, we have to move forward on training, caring about equity in terms of racial composition of the police force. And the conversation about video cameras is over. We\u2019re going to move there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/12/07/in-wake-of-brown-garner-decisions-kasim-reed-says-atl-will-move-quickly-to-cop-cameras/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/120214-holder-bg3.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed was part of a panel on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press\u201d this morning that discussed the grand jury decisions in...", "title": "In wake of Brown, Garner decisions, Kasim Reed says ATL will move quickly to cop cameras | Political Insider blog"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "AJC blog about Atlanta politics, Georgia politics, Georgia and metro Atlanta election campaigns.
