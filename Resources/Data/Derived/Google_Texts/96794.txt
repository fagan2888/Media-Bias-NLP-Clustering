Medical-device giant Medtronic Inc. /quotes/zigman/233680/delayed /quotes/nls/mdt MDT announced on Monday that it implanted the world’s smallest pacemaker without surgery into a patient in Austria.

The device, called a Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, was inserted through the femoral vein via a catheter. It was attached to the heart wall and can be repositioned if needed, Minneapolis-based Medtronic said.

And it marks the start of a competition for what could be a huge market for such devices. In October, Medtronic’s crosstown rival, St. Paul, Minn.-based St. Jude Medical Inc. /quotes/zigman/242119/delayed /quotes/nls/stj STJ , purchased Nanostim Inc., a private manufacturer of a similar device that is also implanted through the femoral vein.

But it may be a while before we see either of these devices in the U.S. Nanostim’s device is being readied for European markets but has yet to win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA, however, has given conditional approval for an exemption granted to what are known as “investigational” devices.

Meanwhile, Medtronic’s pacemaker, which it says is comparable in size to a large vitamin, has been granted investigational status worldwide.
