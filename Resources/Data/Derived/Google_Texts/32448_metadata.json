US. V. Citgo Petroleum Corporation, et al., case number No. 14-40128, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas). Looking toward the Eighth and Ninth Circuits that a \u201ctaking\u201d is limited to deliberate acts done directly and intentionally to migratory birds, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the MTBA convictions for the death of migratory birds that landed in uncovered tanks must be reversed. Referring to the common law definition of take, the Court concludes, \u201cone does not reduce an animal to human control accidentally or by omission; he does so affirmatively.\u201d The opinion emphasizes the fact that the MTBA definition of \u201ctake\u201d does not include qualifying terms like \u201charm\u201d or \u201charass\u201d which would had signaled Congress\u2019 intent of expanding the term to include negligence or unintentional acts. The Fifth Circuit decision rejects the MTBA decisions rendered by the Second and Tenth Circuits. The Court distinguishes its opinion from those decisions by emphasizing a review of the definition of \u201ctake.\u201d The reasoning is that to be convicted of a criminal act, there must be an affirmative action not an unknowing or involuntary act.\n\nFinally, to refine its analysis the Court offers the following, \u201cIf the MTBA prohibits all acts or omissions that \u201cdirectly\u201d kill birds, where bird deaths are \u201cforseeable,\u201d then all owners of big windows, communication towers, wind turbines, solar energy farms, cars, cats, and even church steeples may be found guilty of violating the MTBA\u2026.The absurd results that the government\u2019s interpretation would cause further bolters our confidence that Congress intended to incorporate the common-law definition of \u2018take\u2019 in the MBTA.\u201d\n\nThis decision raises question about the USFWS proposed permitting program of earlier this year in which it issued a Notice of Intent to develop a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to evaluate the potential impacts of a proposal to authorize incidental take of migratory birds. 80 Fed. Reg. 30032 (May 26, 2015). If there is no such thing as an unintentional take, then the purpose of a permit is questionable. The USFWS has a couple of options to include continuing with the development of its permitting program and await D.C. Circuit litigation. At issue also is whether the Service will continue its enforcement efforts under MTBA in those jurisdictions that do not agree with this decisions, those in the Second (Connecticut, New York, and Vermont) and Tenth Circuits (Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah).", "article_metadata": {"description": "On September 4, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Migratory Bird Treaty Act) only criminalizes acts related to hunting or poaching, not omissions that unintentionally kill birds.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "On September 4, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (&amp;ldquo;MBTA&amp;rdquo;) only criminalizes acts related to hunting or poaching, not omissions", "title": "Migratory Bird Treaty Act Enforcement Questioned", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/migratory-bird-treaty-act-enforcement-questioned", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1123/bird%2C%20flowers.jpg?itok=pOWeJFdj", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Fifth Circuit, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, MBTA, hunting, poaching, criminalizes, omissions, unintentional kill", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "legal, business, environment, litigation, Fifth Circuit, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, MBTA, hunting, poaching, criminalizes, omissions, unintentional kill"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb8e\"", "article_summary": "Saturday, September 19, 2015On September 4, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (\u201cMBTA\u201d) only criminalizes acts related to hunting or poaching, not omissions that unintentionally kill birds.\n14-40128, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas).\nThe Fifth Circuit decision rejects the MTBA decisions rendered by the Second and Tenth Circuits.\nLooking toward the Eighth and Ninth Circuits that a \u201ctaking\u201d is limited to deliberate acts done directly and intentionally to migratory birds, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the MTBA convictions for the death of migratory birds that landed in uncovered tanks must be reversed.\nThe USFWS has a couple of options to include continuing with the development of its permitting program and await D.C."}
