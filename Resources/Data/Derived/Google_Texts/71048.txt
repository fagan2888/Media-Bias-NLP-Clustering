Saturday morning, at the Gulf Coast Children's Advocacy Center, hundreds of members of the community came out to participate in the Lauren Books 1,500 mile walk across Florida to raise awareness about child sexual abuse.

Advocates wore shirts to promote walking with a cause, and teal tutu's for Tallahassee, where the walk will end April 23rd.

Lauren Book is the author of 'Walk in my Shoes' and says that one in three girls and one in five boys are sexually abused before age 18; and 95 percent of that abuse is preventable.

Book is a former educator who travels across the state and empowers others about her own personal experience and how to prevent it from happening in the community.

The walk will continue Sunday at 10:30 a.m. at the Gulf Coast Children's Advocacy Center.
