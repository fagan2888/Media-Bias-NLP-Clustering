And then Obama didn\u2019t invite Prime Minister Netanyahu, and the guy came anyways,\u201d Leno opened the evening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to cherish my friendship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Bibi is a man of his word,\u201d Leno continued. \u201cnless of course that word is spoke the day before an election,\u201d a joke Bibi did no like, according to Ha\u2019aretz.\n\nHe also took some jabs at U.S. President Barack Obama, \u201cDon\u2019t confuse Obamacare with his Israel policy, which is called Obama-Don\u2019t-Care,\u201d he said. \u201cI actually had more facetime with Netanyahu than Obama has,\u201d he further quipped.\n\nNetanyahu was a little more serious in his speech, before presenting the award to the U.S. actor.\n\n\u201cIf I have to summarize in one word what it is that we\u2019re trying to foster, that word is \u2018pride\u2019. Pride in the Jewish people, pride in the Jewish state. There\u2019s much to be proud of, because the Jewish people is remarkable in so many ways,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cThe one thing that is unique about the Jewish people, is having been dispersed, they refused to disappear. They kept saying year after, for two millennia, \u2018We\u2019ll be back!\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAs prime minister of Israel, I\u2019m committed to strengthen the unity of the Jewish people and I will continue to reject any attempt to delegitimize any Jewish community. Everyone is welcome. Reform, Conservative, Orthodox alike \u2013 everyone!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels good to be at home again. I am proud to be a Jew,\u201d Douglas proclaimed as he received the Genesis Prize.\n\nThe award, which doubled to $2 million thanks to a donation from billionaire philanthropist Roman Abramovich, was given to Douglas for his professional accomplishments and his commitment to the Jewish legacy and to Israel. The award will be dedicated to promoting awareness on the importance of openness and diversity in the Jewish world.\n\nDouglas, the son of Jewish Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas, mentioned his Jewish background, despite being born to a non-Jewish mom. \u201cInclusiveness and tolerance are Jewish values, too. I strongly believe that Judaism should reflect the spirit of welcome and tradition that existed in Abraham\u2019s tent,\u201d he said. \u201cI will continue to live by the values given to me by my father and handed up to me by my son.\u201d\n\nKirk Douglas, born as Issur Danielovitch, was raised as an Orthodox Jew, but rediscovered his faith after barely surviving a plane crash in 1991 and a stroke in 1996. In recent years, the younger Douglas has identified as a Reform Jew, and his son Dylan celebrated a bar mitzvah in Jerusalem last year.\n\nEarlier this week, Douglas expressed concern about the growing danger of nuclear weapons and the threat of boycotts targeting Israel during an address to hundreds of young Jewish leaders at the Peres Center for Peace in Tel Aviv. \u201cI am a U.N. ambassador for peace and I would like to say that from my experience the biggest problem in the world are nuclear weapons,\u201d Douglas said.\n\nJNS, Israel Hayom and Jpost contributed to this report", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Actor, producer, and humanitarian activist Michael Douglas received the Genesis Prize from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a ceremony held at the Jerusalem Theater on Thursday night.\nI am proud to be a Jew,\u201d Douglas proclaimed as he received the Genesis Prize.\nThere\u2019s much to be proud of, because the Jewish people is remarkable in so many ways,\u201d the prime minister said.\nAnd then Obama didn\u2019t invite Prime Minister Netanyahu, and the guy came anyways,\u201d Leno opened the evening.\nDouglas, the son of Jewish Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas, mentioned his Jewish background, despite being born to a non-Jewish mom."}
