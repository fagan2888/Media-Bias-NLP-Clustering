Here are some of the things we're thankful for in 2015:\n\n***\n\nHere we are at another Thanksgiving and I am overwhelmed with gratitude for all of my blessings: good health, a loving family, supportive and loyal friends who feel like family, my dog, a warm home, incredible life experiences, fulfilling employment with a great boss, important life experiences, the United States of America and so much more.\n\nI\u2019m especially grateful to my friend Donal Blaney, who graciously hosted me in London this year for the first time. During my trip, I was able to see first hand the important work the Margaret Thatcher Centre is doing to preserve the legacy of the Iron Lady.\n\nAs you sit down with your families today, please remember the men and women serving in our armed forces and intelligence communities who won't be at home with theirs, I am certainly grateful for their sacrifice and dedication to keeping us safe. Happy Thanksgiving everybody.\n\n-Katie Pavlich, Editor\n\n***\n\nI am, as ever, deeply thankful for my loving family, my amazing friends, my good health, my fulfilling career, and my wonderful colleagues at both Townhall and Fox News. This year has been an eventful one. I'm grateful for the support and kindness afforded to me by so many in May -- and for those who helped make our fun exhausting book tour over the summer a success. I feel particularly blessed to know my friend Mary Katharine Ham, and her two beautiful children.\n\nAnd this list would not be complete without a shout-out to the 9-2 Northwestern Wildcats. Happy Thanksgiving!\n\n-Guy Benson, Political Editor\n\n***\n\nWhen I first sat down to write what I was thankful for this year, without even realizing it I wrote the exact same first sentence as last year. Not because nothing has changed in my life but because throughout that change I have God alone to thank. Today, and each and every day, I am grateful to Him for everything I\u2019ve gained and lost. As you gather with friends and family today and reflect on what you\u2019re thankful for, don\u2019t forget God\u2019s role in all of it and give thanks to Him. Happy Thanksgiving!\n\n-Leah Barkoukis, Online Features Editor\n\n***\n\nI\u2019m thankful to God for blessing me with a loving, encouraging (and growing) family, lasting friendships and fun colleagues who make it so easy to come to work everyday.\n\nI\u2019m thankful for our men and women in uniform. Veterans Day is but a glimpse into how we should be treating our courageous soldiers. Free pancakes and discounted meals are great, but once a year perks are hardly enough to thank them. We should try to remind our vets everyday that their service is both admired and appreciated.\n\nI\u2019m thankful for an election season that never bores. I can\u2019t help but be grateful to anybody willing to dedicate months of their life on a bus touring the country, meeting with Americans and giving an ear to their needs. Leading the United States is no small task. Thank you, candidates, for applying for the job.\n\nI\u2019m thankful for the memories Paris gave me in 2011 while studying abroad in Europe. One of the most unforgettable moments of my semaine \u00e0 Paris was watching the Eiffel Tower sparkle in the twilight. The romantic beauty of Paris can never be extinguished by terrorist thugs (to quote BBC).\n\nCher France, nous sommes avec vous.\n\nFinally, I\u2019m thankful to our readers for choosing Townhall as their news source. Thank you for not just reading the site, but engaging us with entertaining and often insightful comments, and for catching our silly errors \u2013 a seldom occurrence, of course.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving, everyone!\n\n-Cortney O\u2019Brien, Deputy News Editor\n\n***\n\nThis year was a doozy at times, and I'm thankful to have gotten through it in one piece. I'm forever grateful to a loving God for being there for everything and guiding me towards a positive path.\n\nI\u2019m thankful for my friends, both those who live near me and for those who live far away, and for the miracle that is the internet for keeping the world ever so small. I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had over the past year to travel around the country to visit new places to see old friends. I'm thankful to have been able to see Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S. earlier this year, and to have been able to witness the joy His Holiness brought to Washington.\n\nAnd, of course, I couldn't end this list without saying how I'm thankful for the Providence College Men\u2019s Ice Hockey team, who gave me one of the happiest nights of my life this past April with their insane, come-from-behind victory to win their first NCAA National Championship. What a blessing it was to have been able to witness that.\n\nI hope you all have a very happy Thanksgiving!\n\n-Christine Rousselle, Managing Web Editor\n\n***\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to be thankful for this year. Of course, I\u2019m always thankful to have a supportive and loving family who took me in at four months from South Korea. I\u2019m thankful for our troops who are keeping us safe, our Bill of Rights, especially the Second Amendment, and for all the freedoms we have in this country (and the ones we at times take for granted). I\u2019m especially thankful to be working with a great editorial team who keep me going every day while writing for Townhall. Besides family, one couldn\u2019t ask for a better source of support. Lastly, I\u2019m grateful for the newest edition to the Vespa clan, little Graeme, who arrived in September.\n\nI hope you all have a Happy Thanksgiving.\n\n-Matt Vespa, Associate Editor\n\n***\n\nI am thankful to be an American. I live in the greatest country known to man. I am thankful for my family and proud to be a leader and mentor for my two younger brothers, John Foster and Samuel Thomas. I am thankful for having a mother and father who have taught me hard work and how to be a gentleman. I am thankful for all those who have been a part of my life. I am thankful for my founding fathers, who risked their lives and fortunes on a cause that has granted me a wonderful life. I am thankful to all those who have died fighting for my way of life. One young man does not deserve all the blessings that I have received and it is my duty to make the most of them every single day. Happy Thanksgiving.\n\n-Justin Holcomb, Web Editor\n\n***\n\nI\u2019m thankful for God, Country, Family and Corps, in that order. God blessed me with my Country, my family and my brothers and sisters serving along side of me, and for that I am thankful. My Country blessed me with the opportunity to serve, and for that I am Thankful. My family blessed me with unwavering support throughout my life, and for that I am thankful. The Corps blessed me with the perspective to count my blessings and the will to protect them, and for that I am thankful.\n\n-Leigh Wolf, Video Production Manager\n\n***\n\nThis year, I'm surprisingly thankful for change -- not the kind promised by a politician or the kind you find in the street (although, that's always a welcomed surprise), but the kind of change that makes life a little crazy, but exciting, before turning a fresh page.\n\n2015, for me, has been marked by planned and unplanned change in both my professional and personal life, which in retrospect, has given me more joy than I could have anticipated. The Townhall Media team is enjoying new space and some new faces, and I'm enjoying learning the power of several layers of socks here in the North East.\n\nDespite this year's non-stop movement, I'm grateful to still be part of an amazing team led by a great boss with colleagues I cherish and respect. Of course, none of that would be possible without the love and support from my family and close friends - who, on top of everything else in their lives, are helping me plan a wedding! And I just have to give a special shout out to my momma and sisters, who from thousands of miles away, never let me forget their love.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving, everyone. Thank you for your continued support throughout the years, and we look forward to sharing an exciting 2016 with you.\n\n-Amanda Munoz, External Relations Director, Townhall Media\n\n***\n\n2015 has been an amazing year and there\u2019s plenty to be thankful for. Most of all I\u2019m thankful for my amazingly supportive family (especially my Mom) and friends. I\u2019m also very thankful to be a part of the amazing Townhall team; coming in to work with them everyday is awesome. I\u2019d be lost without my technology and social media, so I\u2019m obviously very thankful for those. Finally, we should be thankful all the time that we have the freedoms we do, and remember the men and women who have given so much to protect America. This Thanksgiving take the time to give back to a Vet in need, it can really go a long way. Happy Thanksgiving to all!\n\n-Storm Paglia, Staff Assistant\n\n***\n\nThis year, I am thankful to have the opportunity to begin work as an intern at Townhall. Working alongside these incredibly talented and welcoming people has been a true blessing in my life.\n\nThis Thanksgiving, I count myself lucky to be an American, and to have a loving family to return home to. I am thankful for my friends and my education. I applaud the police officers, who risk their safety every day to protect our communities. Oh, and I'm thankful for coffee. (It's finals season.)
