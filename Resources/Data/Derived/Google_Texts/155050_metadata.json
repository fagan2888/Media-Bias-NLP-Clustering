A local boy is led an effort to help them stay warm.\n\n7-year-old Max Freeman passed out 165 blankets to homeless men and women on Sunday after seeing them standing out in the cold.\n\n\"It started I'd say about in December,\" said Freeman.\n\nHe brought the idea to his mother who then asked Faith Christian Church to help make it possible. The congregation organized a blanket drive.\n\n\"It was a little bit hard because we had to buy that much blankets, but we got it,\" said Freeman.\n\n\"God used this little boy and we listened to him,\" said Faith Christian Church pastor Greg Hamlin.\n\nHamlin says Freeman's effort took off far past Wichita. A church in Indianapolis heard about his wish and donated hundreds of dollars.\n\n\"It grew and grew and grew to what it is today and we didn't imagine it would be this big,\" said Hamlin.\n\nAltogether, Freeman's idea raised $550 dollars, allowing the church to make a trip to the store to buy a truckload of blankets. For those on the receiving end, the gift comes with gratitude.\n\n\"It make a whole lot of difference,\" said Lasonya Harris. \"Thank you so much, and without you it wouldn't be none of it.\"\n\nFor those passing them out, that appreciation makes the hard work worth it.\n\n\"It means that i'm giving thanks to other people,\" said Freeman.\n\n\"When you actually hand it to somebody and you see their face it changes you, forever,\" added Hamlin.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Even on the coldest winter nights, hundreds of people in Wichita must brave the elements outside.
