Other careers, such as nursing, Long noted, are offering jobs to people still in school.\n\nMost companies, Long said, have a core making up about 60 percent of their workforce, and struggle to keep the remaining 40 percent filled. Beckwith agreed that model describes his business as well.\n\nThe strong work ethic in the area continues to justify why employers stay located here. Beckwith said he is sending 200 truckloads of product to a construction project in New York City.\n\n\"The work ethic here offsets the freight costs,\" he said.\n\nLong agreed, recounting how he toured the offices of Expedia.com at the Springfield airport, which occupy one of the terminal buildings. The company originally planned to run a six-month operation in Springfield after buying Travel.com, then move the employees. However, Expedia found people worked harder in southwest Missouri than in any other city, leading them to expand their entire local operation rather than close it. Nationwide calls to Hotels.com are now being answered by Expedia staff in Springfield. Executives from Expedia flew to Springfield from company headquarters in Seattle to meet Long, which he found flattering, since he did not consider himself to rank so highly among the influential members of Congress.\n\nPrine reported ASI has customers nationwide. One job requires shipment of more than 90,000 industrial parts in 52 trucks to Chicago.\n\nA Long staff spokesman said the one-day manufacturing tour provides opportunities to meet with many producers in small towns, where he said a surprising amount of manufacturing takes place.\n\nOn the tour, Long also visited Digital Monitoring Production in Springfield, Holden Industries in Southwest City and Precision Products in Webb City.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Monett Times", "description": "Seventh District Congressman Billy Long heard about manufacturing processes and labor needs during his stop at Architectural Systems Inc. in Monett this week, part of Long's annual manufacturing tour.
