Kennedy told historian Arthur Schlesinger he \u201cfelt that it would be a good idea to admit frankly that he had been wrong in not taking a more forthright position\u201d on the Communist witch hunting by Senator Joe McCarthy. Schlesinger told him he was \u201cpaying the price of having written a book called Profiles in Courage.\u201d Kennedy replied, \u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t have any chapter in it about myself.\u201d\n\nHow might Kennedy respond to the courage\u2014or lack of it\u2014of these Nevada politicians?\n\nSenator Dean Heller. In one day, Heller had a doubleheader. First, the National Journal reported \u201cGOP Is Relying on Obama to Veto Reconciliation Bill.\u201d The bill would repeal the president\u2019s Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act but allow time for transition. The Journal noted, \u201cSeveral GOP senators represent states that have opted to expand Medicaid under the ACA, and stripping their constituents of health-care coverage could be dangerous politically\u2014but the president\u2019s veto threat assures that won\u2019t happen. \u2018Well, it\u2019s going to be vetoed,\u2019 said Senator Dean Heller, a Nevada Republican, when asked about the Medicaid provision. Nevada has expanded Medicaid.\u201d\n\nLater that day, 24 hours or so after the massacre in San Bernardino, the Senate voted anew on the Manchin-Toomey bill, defeated in 2013, that would have expanded background checks. The vote was 50-48 against, with three Republicans joining Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, to back the measure: Arizona\u2019s John McCain, Maine\u2019s Susan Collins and Mark Kirk of Illinois. Heller, that noted champion of bipartisanship, voted against the bill.\n\nIt takes real courage to vote against something that you know will be vetoed anyway, and then to keep a system that still allows domestic terrorists with criminal histories\u2014i.e., Robert L. Dear of Colorado Springs\u2014easy access to weaponry.\n\nJohn Oceguera. The former Assembly speaker ran for the House in 2012 and lost to Joe Heck, who doesn\u2019t want you to know he\u2019s still in Congress as he seeks Harry Reid\u2019s Senate seat. After working as a lobbyist, Oceguera is in a crowded Democratic primary with declared candidates Lucy Flores, Ruben Kihuen and Susie Lee in the race for House District 4, which consists of several rural counties and most of Clark County north of Las Vegas.\n\nResponding to, as he put it, \u201cmore than 350 mass shootings just this year,\u201d Oceguera wrote a letter resigning his membership in the National Rifle Association. \u201cI am [a] law-abiding gun owner, and have been a life member,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up in a family of hunters.\u201d [But] I cannot continue to be a member while the NRA refuses to back closing these loopholes. Therefore, I resign my membership in the NRA effective immediately. Please remove my name from your membership list.\u201d\n\nOn the one hand, Oceguera has extensive ties to rural Nevada\u2014he grew up in Fallon, where Democrats are exceedingly rare\u2014and it would be reasonable to calculate that his best chance is with more conservative white male Democrats. This actually could hurt him politically.\n\nOn the other hand, what took him so long? The NRA hasn\u2019t exactly been shy, and San Bernardino wasn\u2019t a first, second or even 22nd mass shooting. And the overwhelming majority of Democrats\u2014and the majority of Americans\u2014have had it with the NRA.\n\nAdam Paul Laxalt. The attorney general announced he had ended an inquiry into Planned Parenthood\u2019s Nevada chapter. His office had been trying to find out whether the offices sold body parts. Attorneys for Planned Parenthood reported that the Nevada branches don\u2019t participate in donation programs for body tissue.\n\nThis may have been an act of political courage. Republicans have shown no signs of believing the facts about Planned Parenthood. Imagine future campaigns in which opponents will attack him for that. If he gets to Congress, they may never put him on a Benghazi panel. Kennedy said something else: \u201cWe enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Vegas Seven", "description": "How might John F.
