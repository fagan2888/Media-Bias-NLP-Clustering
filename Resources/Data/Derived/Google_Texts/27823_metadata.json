ObamaCare requires that companies with 50 or more employees provide health insurance benefits to every full-time worker, considered to be anyone who logs an average of 30 or more hours a week.\n\nEmployers will be hit with a penalty for each full-time employee who isn\u2019t covered and instead purchases insurance through a federally subsidized exchange.\n\nAlthough the administration delayed implementing the rule until 2015, the penalties for that year will be based on staffing levels recorded in the second half of 2014 at the latest.\n\nAs a result, several large companies and a long list of smaller businesses have changed their policies to cap weekly hours at 29.\n\nAccording to an April survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management, 41% of 603 small business owners said they have delayed hiring because of the federal healthcare law. One in five already cut hours, while 20% have reduced payroll.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMercer, a human resources consulting company, said its own survey found that 12% of all U.S. employers reported plans to reduce workers\u2019 hours as a direct result of the Affordable Care Act. The impact was more pronounced in the retail and hospitality industries, with 20% of employers saying they will cut part-time hours.\n\nMost recently, theme-park operator SeaWorld Entertainment (SEAS) revealed that it reduced its cap on weekly hours for part-timers to 28 from 32. The company does plan to add full-time hourly positions next year across its 11 parks, it said in a statement. Those full-time jobs will include healthcare benefits.\n\n\u201cThe move is intended to bring consistency to the part-time designation across the SeaWorld Parks system,\u201d SeaWorld said.\n\nA company spokesperson didn\u2019t comment beyond the statement when asked if the move was also intended to prevent part-time or seasonal employees from being classified as full-time under ObamaCare.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Huffington Post website reported that Trader Joe\u2019s, which currently providers healthcare benefits for its part-time workers, sent out a memo to staff detailing the company\u2019s plans to roll back the policy for employees who work less than 30 hours a week.\n\nThe California-based grocery chain determined that providing coverage for part-timers who log 18 hours or more will not be worth the cost under ObamaCare, since low-wage workers will be eligible for tax subsidies to buy insurance next year.\n\nAlso according to the memo, Trader Joe\u2019s will cut a check for $500 in January to help cover the cost of insurance purchased on the subsidized exchanges.\n\nA spokesperson for Trader Joe\u2019s didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nWal-Mart Stores (WMT) made headlines early in the summer when a Reuters survey revealed the world\u2019s largest retailer was only hiring temporary employees in many of its stores, something it would normally do just during the holiday season.\n\nWalmart said less than 10% of its workforce is temporary, compared to between 1% and 2% before this year. Chief Executive Bill Simon told a group of reporters in June that workers\u2019 hours \u201cflex by the needs of the business from time to time.\u201d\n\nBattling ObamaCare\n\nOther companies have been more forthcoming, whether in public comments or internal directives, when it comes to ObamaCare\u2019s influence in the decision to reduce hours.\n\nApparel maker Lands\u2019 End has also turned to cutting hours to no more than 29 a week. WKOW in Madison, Wis., reported on a staff memo that notified employees of the change.\n\nIn the memo, Lands\u2019 End told its workers, \u201cFor some of you, working less hours may be what you wanted. For others, these new governmental guidelines may be very difficult. These guidelines applies (sic) to all companies in the US (unless they have less than 50 employees or are non-profit).\u201d\n\nLands\u2019 End spokeswoman Michele Casper told FOX Business the company doesn\u2019t comment on internal employee practices.\n\n\u201cWe plan to continue to employ part-time employees to best match our workforce to our workload,\u201d Casper added.\n\nRegal Entertainment (RGC) sent out a similar internal memo, according to a report from FOX News. The nation\u2019s largest movie theater chain, which operates more than 500 theaters in 38 states, blamed ObamaCare requirements for capping hours below the 30-hour threshold.\n\n\u201cTo comply with the Affordable Care Act, Regal had to increase our health care budget to cover those newly deemed eligible based on the law's definition of a full-time employee,\u201d the company said in its memo. \u201cTo manage this budget, all other employees will be scheduled in accord with business needs and in a manner that will not negatively impact our health care budget.\u201d\n\nRegal Entertainment didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment from FOX Business.\n\nNew England Motor Freight, a New Jersey-based trucking company, implemented in June an hourly cap for about 400 part-time employees, saying the company can\u2019t afford to offer them health insurance benefits.\n\nRipple Effect?\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, has been one of Washington\u2019s sharpest critics of the Affordable Care Act. He recently remarked that the string of companies cutting hours is evidence of ObamaCare\u2019s negative impact on workers.\n\nHe also highlighted congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who told lawmakers that employers are hiring part-time workers to avoid the employer mandate.\n\n\u201cThis is one instance in which Bernanke is right,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nMike Montgomery, a senior economist at IHS Global Insight, said data has yet to show that the average workweek is getting shorter because the incentive structure works in both directions. Fewer hours for part-time workers can be compensated by an increase in hours for employees considered full-time under the law, he explained.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying that no one is reducing workweeks, but that some may be raising the average but with fewer workers,\u201d Montgomery added.\n\nThere is so far \u201cabsolutely no evidence that this is happening,\u201d he said, referring to changes in the average workweek nationwide. But any shortening in the workweek now or in the future may be \u201cinvisible in the data since the data only exists to one decimal place and bounces around.\u201d\n\nThe private sector isn\u2019t alone in cutting hours for part-time employees, with more than 200 public-sector employers reducing hours to avoid ObamaCare penalties, according to a list compiled by Investor\u2019s Business Daily.\n\nIn fact, the effect of ObamaCare thus far appears to be more pronounced in the public sector. Many U.S. towns and counties have joined in and cut part-time hours, and the business newspaper tallied 34 universities and colleges, including college systems, that are doing the same for part-time or adjunct faculty.\n\nThere have also been signals that the law\u2019s impact stretches beyond headcount. At a Heritage Foundation seminar in March, Five Guys Burgers and Fries franchisee Mike Ruffer, a former Marriott International (MAR) executive who owns eight of the restaurants in North Carolina, warned that consumers will pay a higher price in the long run.\n\n\u201cAny added costs are going to have to be passed on,\u201d Ruffer said.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX
