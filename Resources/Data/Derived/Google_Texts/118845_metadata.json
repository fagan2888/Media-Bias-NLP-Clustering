That was a hope more than a firm commitment, and Hogan said as much to voters. His first priority then and now: getting Maryland\u2019s financial house in order.\n\nHow bad is it?\n\nSpending is running roughly $400 million ahead of revenues this fiscal year \u2013 and the same gap is projected for next year and the following 12 months.\n\nMaryland\u2019s estimated structural deficit during that time is nearly $1.2 billion.\n\nOver the next six years, the total structural deficit is projected at close to $4.3 billion.\n\nNo wonder Hogan announced that fiscal whiz Bobby Neall would be plotting a budget triage plan by year\u2019s end. It will be a Herculean task.\n\nNeall has the credentials.\n\nHe sensibly downsized Anne Arundel County government as county executive. He was a strong advocate of cautious, common sense spending as a leader of the House and Senate budget committees. He\u2019s been a voice in the wilderness on the Spending Affordability Committee crying out for far-reaching fiscal reforms \u2013 usually rejected by legislative liberals and the \u201cprogressive\u201d O\u2019Malley-Brown administration.\n\nNeall correctly pointed out last week that one of the main trouble spots is the soaring cost of debt payments. Too many state bonds were issued in recent years. The proverbial chickens are coming home to roost.\n\nRising payments on state bond debt; spending growth hard to cut\n\nUnless something is changed, debt service will triple from two years ago -- to $268 million. By 2019-2020, debt service will hit $559 million.\n\nEven worse, there\u2019s only one realistic way to curb that rising expense -- a step Hogan definitely won\u2019t take: Raise the state property tax rate.\n\nOther big spending-growth areas also will be difficult, if not impossible, to cut.\n\nEducation aid to the counties is set to rise by $304 million next year, higher education by $225 million and public safety by $175 million. Most of this is due to mandated increases.\n\nUnexpected expenses related to the expansion of Medical Assistance under Obamacare adds a whopping $410 million next year as well.\n\nThe overall problem is easy to identify.\n\nToo much spending\n\nToo much spending by liberal Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley; a weakened state economy that isn\u2019t recovering as expected.\n\nNot enough coming in; too much going out.\n\nWelcome to the New Normal.\n\nO\u2019Malley and other liberals always assumed that Maryland would rebound strongly from the Great Recession. It never happened.\n\nJob creation has remained uneven. It\u2019s been flat for the past six months. Republicans in Washington have stalled growth in the federal bureaucracy that employs so many Maryland residents. Contractors in Maryland who are dependent on the federal government are seeing a definite slowdown that will continue with the GOP taking full control of Congress.\n\nAdapting to a smaller federal government could be painful for Maryland. Yet that is part of today\u2019s reality.\n\nState government and state aid will have to shrink\n\nThe New Normal means Maryland government will have to shrink, too. It means less money flowing back to local governments as well.\n\nCapital spending will be affected. In the past, a small state real estate tax was sufficient to pay debt service on general obligation bonds. But property values took a sharp plunge in 2008 and have yet to recover fully. That trend may persist for the rest of the decade.\n\nThis year, O\u2019Malley for the first time dipped into the state\u2019s general funds to pay for debt service. With housing prices stalled, Hogan is facing far larger debt service payments coming from the general fund starting next year.\n\nThe situation was made worse by O\u2019Malley\u2019s decision to pay some on-going budget expenses with proceeds from state bonds. This diversion has taken nearly $2.5 billion out of the state\u2019s construction program and has increased debt service markedly.\n\nIt\u2019s an ugly aspect of the New Normal.\n\nCuts not as easy as supposed\n\nOn the campaign trail, Hogan made cutting state spending sound easy. It\u2019s not.\n\nFor starters, 58% of the growth in Maryland\u2019s budget next year is required by law or by legislative mandates enacted in 2014. This is untouchable without assent from the liberal General Assembly.\n\nLocal aid will be hard to cut, too. Eight-six percent of that money goes to schools. Touching this ever-growing pot could be next to impossible given the popularity of education among voters.\n\nWhy not slash the bureaucracy? Amazingly, the size of the state\u2019s work force is virtually the same as it was in 2002. There might not be as much \u201cfat\u201d on the bone as Hogan indicated during the campaign.\n\nSettling for small adjustments\n\nHogan may have to settle for incremental reductions throughout government. He may have to take some distasteful steps, too, perhaps nudging up the state property tax slightly. He\u2019ll almost surely have to lower aid to the counties \u2013 another unpleasant task that won\u2019t win him friends in counties that supported him.\n\nHe won\u2019t win fans by shrinking the school construction program, either. But it has to be done to restore a sense of fiscal equilibrium.\n\nWhat a mess O\u2019Malley is leaving behind. He let spending spin out of control. He ignored clear signs that growth in state revenue was slowing and that federal hiring and contracting were shrinking. These are long-term trends.\n\nBudget issues will dominate Hogan\u2019s first four months in the State House. He will need cooperation from Democratic legislators to get Maryland out of this fiscal bind.\n\nGridlock is not an option.\n\nBarry Rascovar\u2019s blog is www.politicalmaryland.com.
