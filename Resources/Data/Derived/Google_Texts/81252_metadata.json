Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), a libertarian-minded lawmaker who co-wrote the new amendment, said in a statement after the vote. \u201cThis amendment is a much needed next step as Congress continues to rein in the surveillance state and reassert the Fourth Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe measure, which was attached to the fiscal 2016 defense appropriations bill, tackles two separate \u201cbackdoors\u201d into people\u2019s communications about which lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised alarms.\n\nOne provision of the amendment would ban the government from forcing tech companies to build weaknesses into their security systems so that police and federal agents can access people\u2019s data. While the FBI has asserted that it needs that power to go after terrorists and criminals, critics say it would weaken digital security for everybody.\n\nThe second part of the amendment would ban the NSA and FBI from accessing Americans\u2019 data without a warrant through a \u201cloophole\u201d in federal law, known as Section 702 of a 2008 update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n\nThat law has authorized the NSA\u2019s PRISM and Upstream programs, and gives the government license to pick up foreigners\u2019 emails, chats and other online communications. Americans\u2019 data can be caught up in that net so long as it is \u201cincidental.\u201d\n\nBoth areas have been a prime focus for privacy-minded lawmakers, who have hoped that the momentum behind surveillance reform would propel additional reforms.\n\n\u201cThis amendment is the most meaningful step Congress can take to end warrantless bulk collection of U.S. persons' communications and data,\u201d Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), the other lawmaker behind the amendment, said in a statement.\n\nA similar amendment sailed through the House\u2019s version of last year's defense appropriations bill, though it never made it to the legislation that reached the president\u2019s desk.\n\nThursday\u2019s vote \u201cshows once again that the House is committed to upholding the Constitution and protecting Americans from warrantless invasions of their privacy,\u201d Lofgren added.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Lawmakers aren\u2019t done reforming the nation's spying laws.", "description": "Lawmakers aren\u2019t done reforming the nation's spying laws.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Lawmakers aren\u2019t done reforming the nation's spying laws.", "title": "House votes to further rein in NSA, in sign of continued momentum", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/244719-house-votes-to-further-rein-in-nsa-in-sign-of-continued-momentum", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/massiethomas_010315getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-11T15:57:01-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-06-11T15:57-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/244719-house-votes-to-further-rein-in-nsa-in-sign-of-continued-momentum", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-11T15:14-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "National Security Agency, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,Zoe Lofgren, Thomas Massie,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-11T15:14:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-11T15:57:01-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/244719-house-votes-to-further-rein-in-nsa-in-sign-of-continued-momentum", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Lawmakers aren\u2019t done reforming the nation's spying laws.", "card": "summary", "title": "House votes to further rein in NSA, in sign of continued momentum"}, "dcterms.title": "House votes to further rein in NSA, in sign of continued momentum"}, "article_summary": "House lawmakers voted to further rein in the nation\u2019s spies on Thursday, in a signal that legislators aren\u2019t yet done reforming surveillance law.\nThursday\u2019s vote \u201cshows once again that the House is committed to upholding the Constitution and protecting Americans from warrantless invasions of their privacy,\u201d Lofgren added.\nAmericans\u2019 data can be caught up in that net so long as it is \u201cincidental.\u201dBoth areas have been a prime focus for privacy-minded lawmakers, who have hoped that the momentum behind surveillance reform would propel additional reforms.\nThat law has authorized the NSA\u2019s PRISM and Upstream programs, and gives the government license to pick up foreigners\u2019 emails, chats and other online communications.\nA bipartisan amendment to add new limits to the National Security Agency (NSA) passed 255-174, slightly more than a week after President Obama signed legislation ending the agency\u2019s bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records."}
