CCTV video footage showed prison officials watching impassively as Guzman ducked behind a shower wall in his cell and out of sight as he escaped through a hole in the floor.\n\nEn route, Guzman disposed of a bracelet that only he and a few other high-risk inmates had to wear, and smashed bulbs lighting up the tunnel as he fled.\n\nIn 2001, Guzman bribed guards to help him escape from a prison near the city of Guadalajara after a previous arrest in 1993. He was recaptured in northwestern Mexico in February 2014.\n\n\"They are very secure centers. The failures only come via corrupting the personnel,\" said Jose Alfonso Carreon, who was the deputy director of the high-security jail in Tepic in western Mexico, similar to the one which Guzman escaped from, between 2000 and 2012.\n\nPresident Enrique Pena Nieto's government says it plans to extradite Guzman to the United States, where he is wanted on an array of charges including drug trafficking, but officials have cautioned the process could take anything from 1-5 years.\n\n(Editing by Simon Gardner and Sandra Maler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Deeply concerned that the world's most notorious drug kingpin,", "title": "Fearing third escape, prison guards watch Mexico drug boss Chapo 24/7", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/12/Fearing-third-escape-prison-guards-watch-Mexico-drug-boss-Chapo-247", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mexico-guzman_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/12/Fearing-third-escape-prison-guards-watch-Mexico-drug-boss-Chapo-247", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mexico-guzman_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Deeply concerned that the world's most notorious drug kingpin,", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Mexico's government detained around two dozen people in connection with his escape, including the former director of the prison.\nOn Sunday, various senior officials, including National Security Commissioner Renato Sales and Federal Police Chief Enrique Galindo, inspected the improved security measures.\nIn 2001, Guzman bribed guards to help him escape from a prison near the city of Guadalajara after a previous arrest in 1993.\n\"He is in a different, very cold zone (of the prison) and in complete isolation,\" Badillo told Reuters on Tuesday outside the Altiplano prison where Guzman is being held.\nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Deeply concerned that the world's most notorious drug kingpin, Joaquin \"Chapo\" Guzman, could escape for a third time, Mexico has beefed up security at his prison, reinforcing the floor of his cell and placing a guard on his door 24/7."}
