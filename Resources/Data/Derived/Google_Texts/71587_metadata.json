An angry parent teamed up with the group which has threatened to sue the school and the principal if they do not agree to do away with the prayer for their next graduation ceremony.\n\nThe AHA is also alleging that a sign with \u201cJesus\u201d written on it is on school grounds and must be taken down, or else they\u2019ll likely sue.\n\nMonica Miller, a lawyer for the AHA\u2019s legal branch, told The Daily Caller News Foundation that it would be \u201cshocking\u201d if the school doesn\u2019t back down because they have clearly violated the Establishment clause.\n\n\u201cOne can only infer that the school district or the school board is saying \u2018we support Christianity\u2019 when they see that sign there,\u201d Miller told TheDCNF. \u201cI assume the case would involve suing the principal and other officials involved in their personal capacity as well as their professional capacity.\u201d\n\nA parent of a second-grader at Rabun County Elementary School attended a graduation ceremony May 19, during which the parent says the principal gave a lengthy prayer that ended with \u201cIn Jesus\u2019 name we pray.\u201d\n\nThe parent attended the Kindergarten graduation ceremony a little over a week later, and the same principal gave a similar prayer ending with \u201cin Jesus\u2019 name we pray.\u201d\n\nThe angry parent complained to the school and then reached out to AHA. The group sent a letter to the school demanding the sign be taken down and the praying stop.\n\n\u201cFederal circuit courts have been nearly unanimous in concluding that prayers delivered at primary and secondary public school graduations violate the Establishment Clause, even when they are student-initiated and student-led,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nThe school\u2019s principal and superintendent did not return requests for comment in time for publication.\n\nFollow Casey on Twitter and like him on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Georgia principal who gave Christian prayers at two graduation ceremonies could face fines now that an atheist group is targeting the school.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "A Georgia principal who gave Christian prayers at two graduation ceremonies could face fines now that an atheist group is targeting the school.", "title": "Atheist Group Threatens To Sue Principal For Praying To Jesus During Graduation", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/jesus_facepalm.jpg", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/atheist-group-threatens-to-sue-principal-for-praying-to-jesus-during-graduation/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/jesus_facepalm.jpg", "description": "A Georgia principal who gave Christian prayers at two graduation ceremonies could face fines now that an atheist group is targeting the school.", "site": "@thelibrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Atheist Group Threatens To Sue Principal For Praying To Jesus During Graduation"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "section": "Faith & Freedom", "published_time": "2015-09-09T15:48:22+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ProducerPetersen"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A Georgia principal who gave Christian prayers at two graduation ceremonies could face fines now that an atheist group is targeting the school.\nThe American Humanist Association says Primary School Principal Lisa Patterson gave two prayers which ended with \u201cIn Jesus\u2019 name we pray\u201d at graduation ceremonies at the end of the last school year.\nThe group sent a letter to the school demanding the sign be taken down and the praying stop.\nAn angry parent teamed up with the group which has threatened to sue the school and the principal if they do not agree to do away with the prayer for their next graduation ceremony.\nThe AHA is also alleging that a sign with \u201cJesus\u201d written on it is on school grounds and must be taken down, or else they\u2019ll likely sue."}
