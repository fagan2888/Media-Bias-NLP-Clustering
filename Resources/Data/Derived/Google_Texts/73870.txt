In the midst of plans for a controversial mega-merger with one of its chief competitors, Anthem Inc. is doing even better than expected. The health insurance giant reported a 4 percent profit increase in the third quarter, exceeding what industry analysts anticipated.

The Associated Press reports that the company attributes the profit increase to a spike in enrollment, particularly in its government-funded health plans. The company attracted 174,000 new enrollees overall, for a current total of 38.7 million customers.
