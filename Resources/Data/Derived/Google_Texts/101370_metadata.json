All of the riders are under 18.\n\nThe Hopkinses\u2019 son Levi is the world\u2019s largest bull contractor \u2014 with 75 bulls \u2014 and he\u2019s only 17.\n\nThe kids showcased their riding skills as part of a special program during the third annual Team Colorado Rodeo, which includes contestants from major rodeos throughout the state.\n\nTeam Colorado Rodeo \u201cgives us at the National Western a chance to talk about these other rodeos that happen throughout the year,\u201d said Susan Kanode, rodeo media coordinator. \u201cColorado has some really good rodeos and some very important ones within the industry.\u201d\n\nAll of the headliner competitions during National Western\u2019s two-week schedule are considered the new year\u2019s set-up contests for these professional riders.\n\nWith large prize purses and the stock show kicking off the year\u2019s competition circuit for many, National Western\u2019s rodeos can help catapult riders into a good position for the year.\n\n\u201cIt can give them confidence and set them up as they travel to other rodeos,\u201d Kanode said. \u201cEvery National Western champion last year, except the bull rider \u2014 because he got injured \u2014 qualified for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, which is like our Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nAs for the miniature bull riders, Jordan made the whole ride and scored a solid 85.\n\n\u201cWe drove 14 hours to make an eight-second ride,\u201d said Brian Kane, his father. \u201cSo you have got to be proud.\u201d\n\nKristen Leigh Painter: 303-954-1638, kpainter@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kristenpainter", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Miniature bull riding debuts at stock show", "title": "Miniature bull riding debuts at stock show", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/11/miniature-bull-riding-debuts-at-stock-show/", "image": {"width": 590, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140111__BN20140112_B4_BNCD12STOCKSHOWp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140111__BN20140112_B4_BNCD12STOCKSHOWp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-11T19:06:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T03:49:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02c8\"", "article_summary": "Miniature bull riding is exactly what its name implies: bull riding on a smaller scale, both in terms of beast and man.\nJordan is a member of the Tuff-N-Nuff Miniature Rodeo Association, a group making history by bringing miniature bull riding to the National Western Stock Show for the first time in the event\u2019s 108-year stretch.\nThe 5-year-old from Iowa strutted around the rodeo staging area of the Denver Coliseum at the National Western Stock Show on opening day, sporting a bubble-gum-pink shirt, pink-fringed chaps and his initials \u201cJLK\u201d emblazoned in the same color down his leg.\n\u201cEvery National Western champion last year, except the bull rider \u2014 because he got injured \u2014 qualified for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, which is like our Super Bowl.\u201dAs for the miniature bull riders, Jordan made the whole ride and scored a solid 85.\nTeam Colorado Rodeo \u201cgives us at the National Western a chance to talk about these other rodeos that happen throughout the year,\u201d said Susan Kanode, rodeo media coordinator."}
