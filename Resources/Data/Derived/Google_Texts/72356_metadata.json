No one said no,\u201d Frank Aiello said. \u201cThere isn't anybody in the community that would say no to this program. And what a wonderful program it is. Out of sight, out of mind? Not anymore. Not in our community.\u201d\n\nFamilies received miniature replica banners during the Armed Forces Day ceremony and will be given the full-size 47-by-22-inch banners when they're taken down in November, Frank Aiello said.\n\nWhen pitching the idea of hanging the banners, the Aiellos first contacted the parents of Lt. Col. Christopher \u201cOtis\u201d Raible, who died leading a counterattack against enemy forces on Sept. 14, 2012, at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.\n\nRaible's photo was used on the banner prototype displayed on promotional flyers distributed throughout the community and to area businesses, and his banner was one of the first hung for display.\n\n\u201cI think it's a wonderful program, and I actually wish other communities would all start adopting it,\u201d said Raible's mother, Kim, of North Huntingdon. \u201cWhen he died, I thought, \u2018Does anybody appreciate what these people give up, what the military gives up? Do they realize?' I found out that they do.\u201d\n\nArmy Capt. Jaycee Archinal of North Huntingdon was one of a handful of active-duty members of the military able to be present for the ceremony. Her son, Army Rangers Spc. Lee Archinal, also has a banner hung in his honor.\n\n\u201cIt's an honor for me to serve, and to have the support from the community is just awesome. I can't say enough about it,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople forget because it's gone on for so long. I just want them to still be honored and their families still to be honored.\u201d\n\nTo date, 34 banners have been mounted, and Frank Aiello said eight more will be ready to go up soon. A total of 65 sites are being eyed for the banners, Aiello said.\n\n\u201cThis is like icing on top of the cake,\u201d said Marlyn Shipley of North Huntingdon, who fought for years to have her son, Marine Corps Cpl. Michael Don Shipley, listed as being killed in action after he died aboard a chartered airplane that exploded on Dec. 12, 1985, over Gander, Newfoundland. \u201cIt's like coming out of the hat, like a magical day. I'd dreamt of this all this time.\n\n\u201cI'm glad their doing it because it shows they do care,\u201d she added. \u201cThey should recognize all these young men and women. They're giving their lives to keep us alive. Give them credit, and for them to do this is just miraculous. I can't even put into words how much it means. My heart is thumping so hard, you can't imagine.\n\n\u201cIt means so much to me just to see these men and women honored.\u201d\n\nGreg Reinbold is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Greg Reinbold", "description": "On Main Street in Irwin and along Norwin Avenue in North Huntingdon, banners honoring local active-duty military personnel and those killed in action have flown ...", "pubdate": "2014-05-17 21:00:18", "author": "Greg Reinbold", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "On Main Street in Irwin and along Norwin Avenue in North Huntingdon, banners honoring local active-duty military personnel and those killed in action have flown ...", "title": "Banners honor service members in Irwin, North Huntingdon", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=bO_KD0cwnRlEtcGYVrcMOs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtmXzXDNXVuET8YfNzv9$jZWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "updated_time": "2015-11-02 23:18:57.521", "url": "http://triblive.com/news/westmoreland/6049121-74/banners-huntingdon-military", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Main Street in Irwin and along Norwin Avenue in North Huntingdon, banners honoring local active-duty military personnel and those killed in action have flown ...", "creator": "@triblive", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "title": "Banners honor service members in Irwin, North Huntingdon", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=bO_KD0cwnRlEtcGYVrcMOs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtmXzXDNXVuET8YfNzv9$jZWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-05-17 21:00:18", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.title": "Banners honor service members in Irwin, North Huntingdon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/news/westmoreland/6049121-74/banners-huntingdon-military", "keywords": "banners, huntingdon, military, north, program", "headline": "Banners honor service members in Irwin, North Huntingdon", "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, News, Westmoreland", "article": {"category": "News", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2014-05-17 21:00:18", "subcategory": "Westmoreland", "mainsection": "News", "section": "News", "publishedtoweb": "2014-05-17 21:00:18", "modified_time": "2015-11-02 23:18:57.521", "tag": "banners, huntingdon, military, north, program", "subsection": "Westmoreland", "title": "Banners honor service members in Irwin, North Huntingdon", "author": "Greg Reinbold"}, "docauthor": "Greg Reinbold", "sailthru.description": "On Main Street in Irwin and along Norwin Avenue in North Huntingdon, banners honoring local active-duty military personnel and those killed in action have flown ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd85eb\"", "article_summary": "On Main Street in Irwin and along Norwin Avenue in North Huntingdon, banners honoring local active-duty military personnel and those killed in action have flown since mid-April.\nApplications can be sent to norwinrotarybanners@aol.com or The Rotary Club of Norwin, Attn: Military Banner Program, 750 Adele Drive, North Huntingdon, PA 15642.\nBanners honor service members in Irwin, North HuntingdonApplications being accepted Military Banner Program applications will be accepted on an ongoing basis and must include an official military photo of the honoree, verification of military status and proof of residency.\nJaycee Archinal of North Huntingdon was one of a handful of active-duty members of the military able to be present for the ceremony.\n\u201cThis is like icing on top of the cake,\u201d said Marlyn Shipley of North Huntingdon, who fought for years to have her son, Marine Corps Cpl."}
