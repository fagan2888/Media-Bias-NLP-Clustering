Robert Redford doesn't shy away from talking politics.

And when it comes to the just-ended government shutdown, the progressive-minded actor shares his idea about what drove conservative Republicans to try to nullify President Barack Obama's legislative agenda, including Obamacare: racism.

In an interview with CNN on Tuesday to promote his critically acclaimed new movie, All Is Lost, the 77-year-old Redford attributed the current gridlock in Washington to fear by the right of a black president and the change he represents.

"There is a body of congressional people that wants to paralyze the system. I think what sits underneath it, unfortunately, is there's probably some racism involved, which is really awful," the Oscar winner told the cable network.
