The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) insurance program Open Enrollment period is from Nov. 10 through Dec. 8, 2014. The enrollment becomes effective Jan. 1, 2015. The CSKT pays 72 percent of the FEHB insurance premium and its employees pick up the remaining 28 percent. In other words, for every $28 an employee expends for the FEHB coverage the CSKT expends $72. The employee premium share is deducted from their salary. Open Enrollment is a time to: enroll in FEHB if not already enrolled; cancel FEHB enrollment; change type of enrollment (self only vs. self and family that includes children up 25 years old); or, change from one plan or option to another. The annual Open Enrollment period is an opportune time for CSKT employees that have previously elected coverage under the FEHB insurance program to change scope of coverage or to cancel the coverage. You do not have to re-enroll if there are no changes in coverage. It is also an opportune time for CSKT employees that have opted out of the FEHB insurance program to enroll for various levels of individual or family insurance coverage. Employees that opted out of enrollment in the CSKT\u2019s health insurance options are not eligible for insurance through the Affordable Care Act Health Insurance Marketplace. Many of those who opted out of the CSKT FEHB insurance program coverage did so because of the belief that Indian Health Service would be enough to cover their health care needs. However CSKT employees eligible for IHS coverage should be cognizant that the IHS has historically had severe budget limitations and will continue to have the monetary limitations well into the future. \u201cWe know for certainty that the Indian Health Service is constrained by reduced funding that doesn\u2019t keep up with the constantly rising costs of health care,\u201d said CSKT Tribal Health Director Kevin Howlett. \u201cThe health care procedures IHS pays for will in all likelihood remain at the \u2018life or limb\u2019 level. Those who depend on Indian Health Service to pay for their care run the risk of the monetary resources not being there.\u201d That monetary limitation is a fact, regardless of whether a person thinks that health care is a treaty-obligated privelige and/or right. There are Real Politick limitations: the IHS is funded by the U.S. Congress appropriation process that is muddled by politics and available monetary resources. Consequently there is a need for alternative health care insurance coverage. For CSKT employees eligible for IHS the FEHB insurance program is the cure for what could potentially ail the pocketbook when it comes to paying for medical procedures not covered by IHS. Indian Health Service has only been authorizing \u201clife or limb\u201d procedures. As a result those who have opted out and have chosen IHS as their provider are responsible for health care bills they incur for procedures not covered by IHS outside of IHS facilities or Tribal Health clinics because the monetary resources are not there. Once again it is not the IHS or Tribal Health that is responsible for incurred health care bills, it is the individuals responsibility. Dependent upon a person\u2019s wage they could be eligible for financial relief when it comes to co-pays and deductions for services. The only other time a CSKT employee may change their FEHB insurance program coverage is related to \u201cQualifying Life Event.\u201d The Qualifying Life Event includes: change of family status; change in enrollment status; and, you or a family member lose FEHB or other health insurance coverage.
