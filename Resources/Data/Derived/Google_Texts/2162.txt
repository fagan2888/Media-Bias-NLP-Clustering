Bloomberg News/Landov Central Bank of Russia Chairwoman Elvira Nabiullina’s decision to raise interest rates didn’t stop the dollar from strengthening further against the ruble.

NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — The dollar extended its gains against the ruble, Norwegian krone and Canadian dollar Thursday as crude oil prices fell below $60 a barrel, a sign that the contagion that has afflicted the ruble for the past two weeks has spread to the currencies of other major oil exporters.

The dollar hit an 11-year high against the krone and a five-and-a-half year high against the Canadian dollar Thursday afternoon as crude oil prices settled below $60 a barrel. Meanwhile, the dollar traded at 56.40 rubles, an all-time high.

The buck traded at USDNOK, -0.0375% 7.32 krone, and USDCAD, +0.1387% 1.155 Canadian dollars, its highest level since July 2009, compared with 7.13 krone and 1.140 Canadian dollars Wednesday afternoon.

Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset management, said the intensity of the decline in oil prices is beginning to take its toll on the economies of major oil producers other than Russia as investors adjust their positions to reflect the possibility that the price of oil will remain lower for longer.

“The fact that we couldn’t even hold the $60 a barrel level suggests that the oil market is just going to free fall right now,” Schlossberg said. “If we’re in a $60 to $70 market for the next year, that’s when you’ll see the severe negative impact for those economies.”

The Norges Bank’s surprise decision to lower its benchmark interest rate to 1.25% from 1.5% also weighed on the krone. The Norwegian central bank cut its rate in an effort to protect the economy from falling oil prices, according to Jameel Ahmad, chief market analyst at ForexTime.

Earlier Thursday, the Russian Central Bank raised its benchmark rate from 9.5% to 10.5% in an effort to prevent the ruble from weakening further.

Strong November retail sales figures pushed the dollar higher against its G-4 rivals, helping it snap a three-day losing streak. The euro EURUSD, -0.0357% traded slightly below $1.24, compared with $1.245 Wednesday.

The buck traded at 118.90 yen USDJPY, +0.09% compared with ¥117.57 Wednesday. It traded flat against the pound GBPUSD, -0.0136% at $1.57.

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.06% a trade-weighted measure of the dollar’s strength against a basket of six rival currencies, rose 0.38% to 88.60.
