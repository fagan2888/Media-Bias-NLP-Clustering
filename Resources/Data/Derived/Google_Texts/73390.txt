PHOENIX - A Senate committee has passed bills blocking the enforcement of executive orders and the Affordable Care Act.

House Bill 2368 by Republican Rep. Bob Thorpe of Flagstaff blocks state funding for executive orders and policy directives from the U.S. Department of Justice.

House Bill 2643 by Republican Rep. Justin Olson of Mesa stops state and local governments from using financial resources to enforce the Affordable Care Act.

Thorpe and Olson say they are using voter-approved Proposition 122 allowing the state to opt out of federal laws.

Opponents say the measures are unconstitutional and prevent the state from accepting federal funding.

The Senate federalism committee passed House Bill 2368 and House Bill 2643 on a 4-0 vote Tuesday. The bills are set to move to the flood pending a standard review.
