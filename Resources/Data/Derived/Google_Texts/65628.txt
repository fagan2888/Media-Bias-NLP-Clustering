Bob the possum must have been very beloved creature in the town of Gulfport, Ms. – so much so that the town threw him a proper funeral over the weekend to celebrate his life.

According to WLOX-TV, a good Samaritan recently donated the funds to the Wild at Heart Rescue Center to pay for the adored rodent, who took part in nearly 300 education programs at the wildlife center in 2013 alone. Bob sadly passed away from a neurological injury a few months ago.

Locals who attended the funeral at A Pet’s Memory Funeral Home and Crematory in Gulfport reminisced over memories of feeding the marsupial bananas or petting him during their visits to the rescue center. Well-wishers could also leave their thoughts of the late rodent on the funeral home’s Facebook page.

“For the most part our aftercare program services that we provide are for dogs, kitties, some birds, rabbits. I have to say Bob the opossum is our first experience performing aftercare cremation on a opossum. Bob is very well loved throughout the coast,” Linda Sumrall, the owner of A Pet’s Memory, told the station.

Bob spent the last two years of his life at the rescue center after being found with a spinal injury in nearby Ocean Springs. Because of the injury, he couldn’t be released back into the wild.
