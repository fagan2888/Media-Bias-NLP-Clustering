In particular, the investigators searched for particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, in addition to nitrogen dioxide.\n\nIn the study group, birth weights dropped by 48 grams for every 10 microgram per cubic meter increase in the particulate matter women breathed during their pregnancies. For each 10 parts per billion increase in nitrogen dioxide, birth weight fell by 18 grams. For comparison, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets a national standard of 15 micrograms of those smaller particulates over the course of the year, in addition to a limit of 53 parts per billion of nitrogen dioxide.\n\nWith regard to the drop in birth weights in New York City, Savitz called for policy change. \"While these are not important for any individual, on a population level, if a large number of births are shifted by that amount, there would be a real public health concern,\" he said. \"The message really concerns policy, raising awareness that even though we have reduced air pollution levels substantially, there is still reason to believe that further reductions would be beneficial and quite possibly, have a small beneficial effect on the health of newborns.\u201d\n\nA similar study this year encompassing a dozen European countries likewise found lower birth weights. \u201cExposure to ambient air pollutants and traffic during pregnancy is associated with restricted fetal growth,\u201d the European investigators wrote in The Lancet. \u201cA substantial proportion of cases of low birthweight at term could be prevented in Europe if urban air pollution was reduced.\u201d\n\nSource: Savitz DA, Bobb JF, Carr JL et al.
