A redevelopment plan may be in the works for the decaying facility. (The Oakland Press-Vaughn Gurganian)\n\nThe college football match between Michigan State University and Alabama in the Goodyear Cotton Bowl New Year\u2019s Eve at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, caps a year that was dominated by sports and, in many ways, the MSU Spartans.\n\nThe winner of the New Year\u2019s Eve game advances to the college football championship game in January against the winner of the Clemson vs Oklahoma semifinal.\n\nThe 12-1 Spartans pulled off a couple of stunners to make it to the semifinals.\n\nIn October, they shocked Michigan with a 27-23 win on the final play of the game. In November, the Spartans rallied to a 17-14 win over Ohio State on a field goal as time expired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut 2015 wasn\u2019t all about MSU football. In April, Tom Izzo coached the Spartan basketball team to the Final Four, where they fell to Duke, 81-61.\n\nMSU accomplishments overshadowed the appointment early in the year of Jim Harbaugh, Michigan\u2019s former college quarterback and NFL coach, as the Wolverines\u2019 new head football coach.\n\nHarbaugh wasn\u2019t the only personnel shuffle of the year:\n\n\u2022 The Detroit Lions fired team President Tom Lewand and General Manager Martin Mayhew in early November after a 1-7 start to the National Football League schedule.\n\n\u2022 In baseball, the Detroit Tigers cut ties with General Manager Dave Dombrowski.\n\n\u2022 In hockey, the Detroit Red Wings in June named Jeff Blashill as the replacement for Coach Mike Babcock after Babcock and the Wings were unable to agree to terms of a contract extension.\n\n\u2022 More locally, 19-year-old Dylan Larkin, from Waterford Township, also joined the Red Wings roster in October.\n\nCrime\n\nThe year saw its share of tragedy.\n\nIn August, Michigan State Police Trooper Chad Wolf, 38, a motorcycle trooper, was killed when he was struck and dragged for miles by a Waterford Township driver on Dixie Highway near I-75 in Springfield Township.\n\nIn January, 76-year-old Clifford Van Haywald was killed in Waterford after a 38-year-old Walled Lake woman allegedly stole his truck and then ran over him when he tried to chase after her.\n\nIn July, Jeffrey Maurer, 53, from Rochester Hills, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the beating deaths of his elderly parents.\n\nIn September, the Michigan Court of Appeals overturned a Wayne County court ruling that would have resentenced former Oakland County resident Richard (White Boy Rick) Wershe to time served in prison. Wershe, a former teen drug dealer and federal informant, has been in prison for 28 years following his arrest for cocaine possession when he was 17.\n\nOther News\n\nSigns of an improving economy were visible throughout the year.\n\nA look at mass layoff filings with the state in March showed the number of filings had dropped as the economy improved. And in October, median real estate prices across southeast Michigan hit a 10-year high. The downside of the improving economy, however, was that higher property values, and costs, were driving up rental rates.\n\nSome other notable stories in 2015:\n\n\u2022 In March, Waterford Township trustees voted to retire police Chief Dan McCaw.\n\n\u2022Last May, voters in Oakland County and across the state rejected tax increases to fix the state\u2019s crumbling roads. Undeterred, state lawmakers passed a road funding package this fall, although road agencies say it could be a couple years before the money trickles down to local roads.\n\n\u2022 In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Michigan\u2019s ban of same-sex marriage, but there was no immediate rush to the courthouse by same-sex couples seeking to tie the knot.\n\n\u2022 Also in June, the nation\u2019s highest court ruled that tax subsidies to help people pay for health insurance are allowed under Obamacare, more formally known as the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u2022 In October, plans were announced to demolish the Silverdome in Pontiac, the former home of the Detroit Lions, and redevelop the site with a variety of uses.\n\n\u2022 In October and November, two major county road projects were completed. In Southfield, Evergreen Road was reopened after a $12 million overhaul. In Auburn Hills, motorists now have its first diamond interchange at I-75 and University Drive.\n\n\u2022 In November, Gov. Rick Snyder took some heat when he said Syrian refugees weren\u2019t welcome in Michigan. But agencies who help with relocation said it was business as usual for them.\n\n\u2022 Also in November, Keego Harbor voters approved a ballot proposal decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana. Local law enforcement stressed that marijuana remains illegal under state and federal law.\n\n\u2022 Earlier this month, three groups announced they plan to take over Doctors Hospital in Pontiac as it goes through bankruptcy proceedings.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "DataWorks, DataWorks", "title": "2015 Year In Review: Sports, crime and news", "og": {"url": "http://www.theoaklandpress.com/article/OP/20151224/NEWS/151229796", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.theoaklandpress.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/OP/20151224/NEWS/151229796/AR/0/AR-151229796.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1118px"}, "type": "article", "title": "2015 Year In Review: Sports, crime and news"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theoaklandpress.com", "description": "The college football match between  Michigan State University and Alabama in the Goodyear Cotton Bowl New Year\u2019s Eve at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, caps a year that was dominated b", "title": "2015 Year In Review: Sports, crime and news", "url": "http://www.theoaklandpress.com/article/OP/20151224/NEWS/151229796", "image": {"src": "http://www.theoaklandpress.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/OP/20151224/NEWS/151229796/AR/0/AR-151229796.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@TheOaklandPress", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551761416", "iphone": "id520210301", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.oaklandpress"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "DataWorks, DataWorks", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The college football match between  Michigan State University and Alabama in the Goodyear Cotton Bowl New Year\u2019s Eve at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, caps a year that was dominated b"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2f2d\"", "article_summary": "Some other notable stories in 2015:\u2022 In March, Waterford Township trustees voted to retire police Chief Dan McCaw.\nIn September, the Michigan Court of Appeals overturned a Wayne County court ruling that would have resentenced former Oakland County resident Richard (White Boy Rick) Wershe to time served in prison.\n\u2022 In October and November, two major county road projects were completed.\n\u2022 More locally, 19-year-old Dylan Larkin, from Waterford Township, also joined the Red Wings roster in October.\nIn November, the Spartans rallied to a 17-14 win over Ohio State on a field goal as time expired."}
