Paul Raver absent, to offer retirees $5,000 to switch plans or accept a monthly stipend or cash buyout.\n\nHemet continues to struggle with its finances, dipping into its reserves to balance the budget for the seventh consecutive year.\n\nThe city is budgeted to spend $4.2 million on retiree healthcare in this fiscal year, Hurst said. That number could grow to more than $9 million in 2020 under the current plans, which will be subject to a 40 percent excise tax under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe city will spend around $3 million on healthcare costs for its almost 300 current employees, the majority of whom are not eligible for lifetime healthcare at retirement.\n\nHurst estimates the incentives would cost $325,000 if all retirees switch plans, but that will be more than offset by the savings of $700,000 to $1.2 million in the first year alone.\n\nIn lieu of the incentive to switch out of the Aenta plans by Sept. 30, retirees may opt for up to $1,028 per month or a lump-sum cash payment to seek their own health insurance as the city will discontinue offering the Aetna plan in one year.\n\n\u201cIt makes the program more sustainable,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cWe need the city to be fiscally healthy.\u201d\n\nContact the writer: 951-368-9086 or cshultz@pe.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "sailthru.author": "CRAIG SHULTZ", "content_author": "CRAIG SHULTZ", "ICBM": "33.948100, -117.396100", "sailthru.tags": "news, city, retirees, hurst, plans, million, healthcare, switch, costs, hemet, year", "content_section": "news", "content_title": "HEMET: Retirees offered cash to switch health plans", "geo.position": "33.948100;-117.396100", "author": "CRAIG SHULTZ", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-09 16:30:33", "sailthru.title": "HEMET: Retirees offered cash to switch health plans", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nufo27-b88508765z.120150909163033000gnubtuek.10.jpg", "geo.placename": "Riverside", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nufo27-b88508765z.120150909163033000gnubtuek.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "publication_date": "2015-09-09", "Description": "News: HEMET: Retirees offered cash to switch health plans | city, retirees, hurst, plans, million, healthcare, switch, costs, hemet, year", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "News: HEMET: Retirees offered cash to switch health plans | city, retirees, hurst, plans, million, healthcare, switch, costs, hemet, year", "title": "HEMET: Retirees offered cash to switch health plans", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/nufo27-b88508765z.120150909163033000gnubtuek.10.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/city-779730-retirees-hurst.html", "type": "article"}, "Keywords": "city, retirees, hurst, plans, million, healthcare, switch, costs, hemet, year", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nufo27-b88508765z.120150909163033000gnubtuek.10.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda02f\"", "article_summary": "The council voted 4-0, with K.
