Such is the case for the infamous Obamacare. United Healthcare is pulling out of Arizona leaving the rural areas with little if any Obamacare alternative companies. Blue Cross Blue Shield is the only one left standing and it\u2019s complaining about losing its shirt, $185 million.\n\nPresident Obama sold his law as a means to spare people from \u201cdouble-digit premium increases year after year.\u201d Instead, his \u201cinartfully\u201d named and drafted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has made the situation worse, with insurers asking for the double-digit premium increases the president promised to do away with.- according to Forbes Magazine.\n\nOpponents remember all too well how Obamacare was pushed through Congress by Nancy Pelosi instructing members to pass the bill and read what was in it afterwards late Christmas Eve of 2009. This is what set people off, this is why the approval rating of Congress is the lowest in history because they passed the 2,000 page monstrosity with over 20,000 pages of regulations against the will of the people. It was nearly seven years ago that the people ranted against Obamacare by a two to one margin or more.\n\nSo why is everybody losing money with Obamacare? Most people don\u2019t realize it was written by Obama administration officials, lobbyists and \u201cTort\u201d attorneys -the frivolous litigation which is the cause of higher insurance so there\u2019s no tort reform in those thousands of pages. The ones that took all that money are in Washington on \u201cK\u201d street.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As a taxpayer when you hear the term subsidize you think of all the taxes you have to pay to support the cause.
