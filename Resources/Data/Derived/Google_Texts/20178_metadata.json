The majority live in low- to middle-income nations, though this issue permeates in developed countries like the United States. These hidden patients often have limited access to the medical personnel and supplies that could screen for the disease.\n\nAnd being unaware of their status leaves them open to unknowingly spreading the virus and impedes efforts to control the disease.\n\nThe holy grail for AIDS health workers would be a handheld HIV detector that they could carry from the streets of Nairobi to the alleys of Chicago. Similar to Star Trek\u2019s tricoder, the gadget could assess a patients disease status in the blink of an eye.\n\nScientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have taken a major step toward achieving this goal by developing a microchip that can diagnosis the virus with the same efficiency and accuracy as sophisticated hospital equipment.\n\nAkin to the fingerstick test that diabetics use to measure glucose, the gadget can take a single drop of blood from a patient and judge whether they are carrying HIV. It works by channeling the blood cells through a microscopic network of passages shaped like a snake.\n\nAt the end of this serpentine maze, a pulse of electricity is passed through the cells, which measures their dimensions.\n\nCD4 T-cells, which are the part of the human immune system destroyed by the HIV virus, have a prescribed size that is recognized and counted by the microchip.\n\nIt also counts CD8 T-cells, which would be important for diagnosing HIV in infants. CD8 T-cells are elevated in babies infected with HIV, while the loss of CD4 T-cells may be less apparent. The ability to measure CD4 and CD8 levels in seconds is a versatile feature of this device that surpasses previous attempts to create an HIV lab on a chip.\n\nThe new microchip doesn\u2019t use complex lasers or fancy optics, so it could be easily adapted into a portable, battery-powered HIV detector, according to the report published today in Science Translational Medicine. \u201cA good analogy is our device is like a mp3 player vs. current technology is like a portable CD player, which has optics to read the disc,\u201d said Dr. Nicholas Watkins, a nanotech engineer who developed the biochip while earning his PhD at the University of Illinois.\n\n\"So far, there are very few \"point-of-care\" automated CD4+ T cell counters, and they require optics (lasers, diodes, charge-coupled devices, lenses, mirrors, etc.), which generally makes them more fragile, more expensive, and more bulky,\" continued Watkins.\n\nWatkins estimates that it will take a couple of years to design a handheld unit to go with the chip and run it through clinical trials.\n\nSuch a device could \u201celiminate the barriers that currently prevent access to 69% of HIV-infected people in resource-limited settings like Sub-Saharan Africa\u201d, write the authors who were led by Dr. Rashid Bashir, a professor of bioengineering and of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois.\n\n\u201cThis approach has the potential to be realized as a handheld, battery-powered instrument that would deliver simple HIV diagnostics to patients anywhere in the world, regardless of geography or socioeconomic status,\u201d the authors conclude.\n\nSource: Watkins NN, Hassan U, Damhorst G, Ni H, Vaid A, Rodriguez W, Bashir R.
