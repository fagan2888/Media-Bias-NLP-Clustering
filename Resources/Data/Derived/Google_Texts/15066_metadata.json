Mostly, it was the team and how it approached the day at Sonny Lubick Field at Hughes Stadium that pleased Bobo the most on his 42nd birthday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about the mind-set of how I want to practice,\u201d Bobo said after the team ran 115 plays. \u201cBeing physical, competing, having fun, energy. We had a chance to come to the stadium and play football and treat it like a game, and today, I thought they did and they competed.\u201d\n\nThe Rams will hit the field in 2016 with more experience on the offensive side of the ball, but it was the defense that controlled most of the day in Bobo\u2019s pretape review eyes. With no returning starters on the defensive line and three-fourths of the secondary graduated, it wasn\u2019t a development to be overlooked.\n\nIn the first half of the day, the top defensive unit stuffed the run of the first offense and performed well in pass coverage.\n\n\u201cIt is encouraging. I would much rather any scrimmage start where the defense dominates,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cThey really dominated early in the scrimmage. Really, the \u2018twos\u2019 offensively got the energy going on the offensive side. The one defense got the upper hand, and that\u2019s encouraging.\u201d\n\nAs expected, linebacker Kevin Davis \u2014 the team\u2019s leading tackler last season \u2014 was lauded for his play, but so was Josh Watson, a player Bobo pointed out last week as someone who had to start showing more consistency in his play.\n\nThe same was said for wideout Xavier Williams, and he also earned kudos for his coach. The knock on the junior last year was not making plays in the air, but Saturday, Williams was winning the majority of those battles.\n\n\u201cIt was a really good day for him,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cHe had one in the red zone he could have made; he didn\u2019t go through the route. But other than that, he made plays in one-on-one situations. X had a lot of one-on-one situations last year where the ball was in the air and he didn\u2019t come down with it.\u201d\n\nAs for the quarterbacks, Bobo said the main three \u2014 returning starter Nick Stevens, senior transfer Faton Bauta and true freshman Collin Hill \u2014 all played pretty well. Hill\u2019s performance stood out to the coach as Hill had struggled as of late with all of the offensive installation.\n\nTight ends Danny Nwosu and Nolan Peralta were singled out for their strong play, as were running backs Bryce Peters and Dalyn Dawkins, who hit a couple of big runs against the defense in the second half.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado State football\u2019s starting defense earns early praise in spring scrimmage", "title": "Colorado State football\u2019s starting defense earns early praise in spring scrimmage", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/09/colorado-state-footballs-starting-defense-earns-early-praise-in-spring-scrimmage/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-09T20:32:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-09T20:32:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Coach Mike Bobo wasn\u2019t giving out statistics from Saturday, but he did dish out a few compliments from Colorado State\u2019s first scrimmage of the spring.\nI would much rather any scrimmage start where the defense dominates,\u201d Bobo said.\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about the mind-set of how I want to practice,\u201d Bobo said after the team ran 115 plays.\nHill\u2019s performance stood out to the coach as Hill had struggled as of late with all of the offensive installation.\nSome players earned praise, and so did the starting defense."}
