Ted Cruz says many things that need to be said and says them well. Moreover, some of these things are what many, if not most, Americans believe wholeheartedly. Yet we need to remember that the same was true of another freshman Senator, just a relatively few years ago, who parlayed his ability to say things that resonated with the voters into two terms in the White House. Who would disagree that if you want your doctor, you should be able to keep your doctor? Who would disagree with the idea of a more transparent administration in Washington, or a President of the United States being a uniter instead of a divider?\n\nThere are many things like this that freshman Sen. Barack Obama said that the overwhelming majority of Americans \u2014 whether liberal or conservative \u2014 would agree with. The only problem is that what he has actually done as President has repeatedly turned out to be the direct opposite of what he said as a candidate.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz has not yet reached the point where he can make policy, rather than just make political trouble. But there are already disquieting signs that he is looking out for Ted Cruz \u2014 even if that sets back the causes he claims to be serving.\n\nThose causes are not being served when Senator Cruz undermines the election chances of the only political party that has any chance of undoing the disasters that Barack Obama has already inflicted on the nation \u2014 and forestalling new disasters that are visible on the horizon.\n\nObamaCare is not just an issue about money or even an issue about something as important as medical care. ObamaCare represents a quantum leap in the power of the federal government over the private lives of individual Americans.\n\nChief Justice Roberts\u2019 decision declaring ObamaCare constitutional essentially repeals the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, which declares that powers not given to the federal government belong to the states \u201cor to the people.\u201d\n\nThat central support of personal freedom has now been removed. The rest of the structure may not last very long, now that the Obama administration is busy quietly dismantling other bulwarks against the unbridled power of the government in general, and the unbridled power of the presidency in particular.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission, for example, is already floating the idea of placing observers in newspaper editorial offices to \u201cstudy\u201d how decisions are made there. Nothing in the Constitution grants the FCC this dangerous power, nor is there any legislation authorizing any such activity.\n\nBut what the federal government can do is not dependent on what the Constitution authorizes it to do or what Congressional legislation gives them the power to do.\n\nThe basic, brutal reality is that the federal government can do whatever it wants to do, if nobody stops them. The Supreme Court\u2019s ObamaCare decision shows that we cannot depend on them to protect our freedom. Nor will Congress, as long as the Democrats control the Senate.\n\nThe most charitable interpretation of Ted Cruz and his supporters is that they are willing to see the Republican Party weakened in the short run, in hopes that they will be able to take it over in the long run, and set it on a different path as a more purified conservative party.\n\nLike many political ideas, this one is not new. It represents a political strategy that was tried long ago \u2014 and failed long ago.\n\nIn the German elections of 1932, the Nazi party received 37 percent of the vote. They became part of a democratically elected coalition government, in which Hitler became chancellor. Only step by step did the Nazis dismantle democratic freedoms and turn the country into a complete dictatorship.\n\nThe political majority could have united to stop Hitler from becoming a dictator. But they did not unite. They fought each other over their differences. Some figured that they would take over after the Nazis were discredited and defeated.\n\nMany who plotted this clever strategy died in Nazi concentration camps. Unfortunately, so did millions of others.\n\nWhat such clever strategies overlook is that there can be a point of no return. We may be close to that point of no return, not only with ObamaCare, but also with the larger erosion of personal freedom, of which ObamaCare is just the most visible part.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Freshman Sen.
