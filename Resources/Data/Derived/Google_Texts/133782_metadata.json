By approving the drug, also known as the morning-after pill, to be sold freely to women over 15, it eliminated the need for a doctor\u2019s prescription and made access to the drug much easier in emergency situations. Now, generic brands can sell their versions of the pill over the counter too, but one company may be taking that liberty a bit too far.\n\nSyzygy, a health care company launched last year, is the maker of AfterPill, which brands itself as \u201caffordable contraception for women who want to be prepared.\u201d It sounds honest enough; after all, the morning-after pill (active ingredient levonorgestrel) should be taken within five days of unprotected sex to avoid a pregnancy, and within 72 hours of sex for maximum effectiveness. The company is selling the pills at one for $20 and three for $60. It\u2019s a bargain, with pharmacy prices of Plan B One-Step going as high as $55. It also makes access to the drug that much easier to, say, teenage girls who can\u2019t always afford it, especially when they find themselves in a bind.\n\n\u201cWe know that there\u2019s a large number of women who take the risk of becoming pregnant after having unprotected sex instead of purchasing emergency contraceptives because the price is high,\u201d said Jamie Barickman, managing director at Syzygy, according to Jezebel.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt the drug would really help these women. But how prepared should they actually be? In 2013, 34 percent of high school students reported having sex within the past three months, 41 percent of whom said they didn\u2019t use a condom. By selling the drug in packs of three and at a lower price, it makes getting the drug easier than ever and could encourage teens to have even more unprotected sex \u2014 because hey, if the pill is so much easier to use, then why not use it instead of condoms, birth control pills, or other contraceptives.\n\nUsing the morning-after pill repeatedly won\u2019t make it less effective and it won\u2019t stop it from working. But health care professionals recommend women not to use it as a regular form of birth control because it\u2019s not as effective at preventing pregnancy as intrauterine devices and other forms of birth control \u2014 it\u2019s up to 89 percent effective within 72 hours of sex, but its effectiveness wanes as time passes.\n\nBy improving access to the morning-after pill, Syzygy is helping thousands, if not millions, of women obtain cheap and effective emergency contraception. But that\u2019s exactly what it should be used for, and emphasizing that point and using it responsibly is paramount.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "discounted, morning, after, pills, are, being, sold, online, while, its, good, overall, women", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A website selling the morning-after pill at half its retail price is making access much easier, but women need to know how to take the drug responsibly.", "title": "You Can Now Buy Cheaper Morning-After Pills Online, But Do So With Caution", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/discounted-morning-after-pills-are-being-sold-online-while-its-good-overall-women-should-307013", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/14/morning-after-pill.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A website selling the morning-after pill at half its retail price is making access much easier, but women need to know how to take the drug responsibly.", "title": "You Can Now Buy Cheaper Morning-After Pills Online, But Do So With Caution", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/discounted-morning-after-pills-are-being-sold-online-while-its-good-overall-women-should-307013", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/14/morning-after-pill.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/14/morning-after-pill.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-10-14T16:36:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-14T16:36:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A website selling the morning-after pill at half its retail price is making access much easier, but women need to know how to take the drug responsibly."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd250\"", "article_summary": "By improving access to the morning-after pill, Syzygy is helping thousands, if not millions, of women obtain cheap and effective emergency contraception.\nUsing the morning-after pill repeatedly won\u2019t make it less effective and it won\u2019t stop it from working.\nA website selling the morning-after pill at half its retail price is making access much easier, but women need to know how to take the drug responsibly.\nBy approving the drug, also known as the morning-after pill, to be sold freely to women over 15, it eliminated the need for a doctor\u2019s prescription and made access to the drug much easier in emergency situations.\nBut that\u2019s exactly what it should be used for, and emphasizing that point and using it responsibly is paramount."}
