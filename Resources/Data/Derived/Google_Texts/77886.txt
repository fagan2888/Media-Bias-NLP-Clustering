Pro-life supporters took to Twitter on Wednesday to reveal their personal stories regarding adoption, pregnancy and choosing life.

Playing off of the name “Planned Parenthood,” the social media hashtag #UnplannedParenthood is filled with many people sharing their stories of deciding against abortion, even in the midst of difficult times, and celebrating that decision years later.
