The hand held 3D printing pen, which to those who have no artistic ability, may be viewed more as a glorified hot glue gun, happens to be an awesome artistic tool, for those who learn how to use it. Last week we did a story on the man who used his 3Doodler to print out an actual remote control airplane. It was incredibly well done, and almost unbelieveable.\n\nHere we are only a week later, and one man may have already \u20183Doodled\u2019 an even more impressive piece. A Somerville, Massachusetts man named Justin Mattarocchia, has 3D printed an entire plastic man with his hand held 3Doodler. Mattarocchia has named the piece, \u2018Voight\u2019 and it is the world\u2019s first life-sized, hand 3D printed, humanoid skeleton ever created.\n\nThe project took Mattarocchia several months to complete, and he has learned a great deal about the hand held device along the way. To achieve a state where the plastic man was at least close to being anatomically correct, he used Google Images to search for different skeletal parts. He also drew out parts, such as the jaw bone, and traced those drawings with the 3D printing pen.\n\n\u201cI love the freedom the 3Doodler offers me in creative design,\u201d Mattarocchia told 3Doodler. \u201cIt\u2019s an excellent tool, and when used in conjunction with other media, and even electronics, you can make your work really come to life.\u201d\n\nFor the spine of the man, Mattarocchia used a cardboard tube as a structural base. He then was able to print onto that cardboard with the ABS plastic from the 3Doodler. Once the plastic dried, he could slide the tube out, leaving a pretty accurate model of an actual spine behind. For the face, he wanted to take a more free hand approach, as he explained to 3Doodler:\n\n\u201cI started by drawing out on some foam core project board a rough face shape, laying out where the eyes, nose, and mouth would be. Then I traced over it with the 3Doodler and built off of that original outline. Getting curved features can be tricky mid air, especially if you don\u2019t have a form to work on, so I decided to think in polygons. I would form triangular shapes off the initial trace, and continued to build off them until a face feature was formed. Once the initial polygonal structure was in place, I could then either build off that, or fill it in, by running back and forth between the lines of the polygon.\u201d\n\nThis was not the first interesting piece that Mattarocchia has created with his 3Doodler. In fact he also makes robotic talking skulls, as you can see in the video below.\n\nIf you would like to see the plastic man in person, it is on display at the Firefly Open Studios Velir Gallery in Somerville, Massachusetts. Better yet, if you would like to actually own this amazing piece of art, it can be purchaed on Mattarocchio\u2019s Etsy page , for $100,000. He is also offering the talking skulls for a much more reasonable $300, for those who are interested. Let us know what you think about this amazing piece of work.
