Because of the new health care approach, he, as part of a small subset of patients, was given medication that targets the underlying cause of the disease. \"I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to deliver a new era of medicine, one that delivers the right treatment at the right time,\" Obama said Tuesday in his address.\n\n[READ: SOTU Approach to Health Care: Imply, Don't Announce]\n\nHuman DNA was mapped through the human genome project, which was funded by the U.S. government and completed in 2003, revealing that there are about 20,500 human genes. Mutations in these genes help doctors understand how susceptible a person might be to a particular illness, and allow researchers to target cures that respond accurately.\n\n\"As I was watching [the address] I was delighted,\" says Dr. Richard Weinshilboum, acting director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota. \"The timing is excellent.\"\n\nWeinshilboum worked with Dr. Francis Collins, now the director of the National Institutes of Health, in mapping human DNA. \"The genome project was reported on as if it were a race to the finish line,\" he says. \"But we knew it was a race to the starting line.\"\n\nThe current approach to medicine is one of trial and error, where patients may at times use several types of medications or other treatment methods over courses of several years before finding the one that is right for them. Every person is different, and a treatment that works for one may not work for another.\n\nThis current approach can be expensive, lengthy, and cause patients frustration or painful side effects as they wait to determine the efficacy of a treatment. A personalized medicine approach would span all areas of medicine, from psychiatry to oncology. \"It's an effort to bring the science to the bedside and individualize it truly for every patient,\" Weinshilboum says.\n\n[ALSO: Can Minors Refuse Medical Care? ]\n\nEventually, he says, doctors will be sequencing tumors and trying to understand the biology of that particular patient's cancer. Collins had been the first to map the gene that caused cystic fibrosis, which likely affected Elder's positive outcome.\n\nDr. Scott Weiss, scientific director at Partners HealthCare Center for Personalized Genetic Medicine, says one way Obama could support an personalized medicine initiative is through NIH, the typical route for this type of project.\n\n\"I still think that the major problem here is the NIH budget,\" he says. \"We haven't had an increase in the budget for quite some time.\"\n\nCollins has made it no secret that the agency is short on funding. He said publicly in 2014 that the reason there was no vaccine against the Ebola virus was because of cuts to the NIH budget.\n\nWhether the initiative takes public or private routes remains to be seen. Weiss, who is also a physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, says several large academic medical centers would be poised to do research in personalized medicine if money were available.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Heart disease is the leading cause of death for African American and white women in the U.S.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "State of the Union address hints at the government's intentions for precision treatments.", "zone": "hospitalsoftomorrow/articles", "author": "Kimberly Leonard", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "State of the Union address hints at the government's intentions for precision treatments.", "title": "Hospitals, Doctors Cheer Obama's Call for Personalized Medicine", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/hospital-of-tomorrow/articles/2015/01/22/hospitals-doctors-cheer-obamas-call-for-personalized-medicine", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/c2/ef/52b5b47a424698ec2b955da224ea/150122-obamasotu-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "State of the Union address hints at the government's intentions for precision treatments.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Hospitals, Doctors Cheer Obama's Call for Personalized Medicine - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2015-01-22", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/96279cb/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2Fc2%2Fef%2F52b5b47a424698ec2b955da224ea%2Fresizes%2F500%2F150122-obamasotu-editorial.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "health care,Obama, Barack,State of the Union,health insurance,Affordable Care Act,NIH,health care reform,Kimberly Leonard", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-01-22"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z611x9", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "Personalized Medicine, Genes, DNA, Cystic Fibrosis, Precision Medicine , Human Genome Project, Genetics, Cures, Barack Obama, State of the Union Address"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd283a\"", "article_summary": "A personalized medicine approach would span all areas of medicine, from psychiatry to oncology.\nDr. Scott Weiss, scientific director at Partners HealthCare Center for Personalized Genetic Medicine, says one way Obama could support an personalized medicine initiative is through NIH, the typical route for this type of project.\nObama did not elaborate on the details of his plan for precision medicine, more frequently referred to as personalized medicine, or which avenue he might take in carrying out the initiative.\nWeiss, who is also a physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, says several large academic medical centers would be poised to do research in personalized medicine if money were available.\nBecause of the new health care approach, he, as part of a small subset of patients, was given medication that targets the underlying cause of the disease."}
