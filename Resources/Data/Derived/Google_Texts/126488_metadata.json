These clinics provide primary care for anyone, regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nToday, there are federally funded clinics in 21 Kansas counties, but there soon could be more.\n\nAt least six organizations in Kansas are asking the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for grants to open new clinics. GraceMed, in Wichita, is asking for $650,000 for a new clinic on the south side of the city. CEO David Sanford says that part of the state\u2019s largest city is underserved.\n\n\u201cAreas kind of in the southern part of the county have very few if any doctor\u2019s offices or dental offices,\u201d Sanford says.\n\nThe Greater Wichita YMCA has given GraceMed a little more than four acres of land on the Y\u2019s south campus to build the clinic.\n\n\u201cMedical, dental, pharmacy, vision services, integrated behavioral health. At full capacity, we anticipate serving about 17,000 unduplicated patients per year,\u201d Sanford says.\n\nThat would increase the number of patients GraceMed serves at its eight current locations by half.\n\nThe Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas also is seeking a $650,000 grant. The Pittsburg-based organization serves 40,000 patients through clinics in six counties. But Douglas Stuckey, its chief financial officer, says part of the region remains underserved.\n\n\u201cAnd if you look at the ratio of underserved people, we\u2019ve basically got a donut \u2014and right in the middle is Labette County and Parsons,\u201d Stuckey says.\n\nAbout 1,000 patients from the Parsons area seek care at his organization\u2019s clinics in Pittsburg and Coffeyville \u2014 a distance of about 40 miles either way \u2014 and that\u2019s just a fraction of the unmet need, according to Stuckey.\n\n\u201cAnd if they don\u2019t have transportation to get to Pittsburg or Coffeyville, they either go without, or there is a couple small, free clinics in Parsons, but they\u2019re not open all the time,\u201d Stuckey says.\n\nHe estimates a new clinic in Parsons would provide health care to nearly 5,000 uninsured and low-income people a year.\n\nThe nonprofit organization that runs clinics in Olathe and Paola also is seeking expansion money. The Health Partnership Clinic wants to establish a new clinic in an abandoned Wal-Mart store in Ottawa. The entire $650,000 federal grant would go for operational costs.\n\nCEO Jason Wesco says the vast majority of low-income residents in Franklin County appears to be dispensing with health care, in part because the state hasn\u2019t expanded Medicaid eligibility.\n\n\u201cWe have patients who both earn too much money for Medicaid, which is very restrictive in Kansas, and they\u2019re too poor to apply for the health insurance marketplace,\u201d Wesco says. \u201cThe only way that we can meaningfully expand primary care services like we provide is new access point grants.\u201d\n\nThe grants are funded by the Affordable Care Act, but there\u2019s only enough money to fund about 150 of the 800 to 900 applications. Wesco had hoped Sen. Pat Roberts would help give the Ottawa application a competitive edge. But Roberts declined to provide a letter of support because he opposes the health care reform law.\n\n\u201cThey favored abolition of the Affordable Care Act and could not support our efforts,\u201d Wesco says. \u201cClearly, we\u2019re disappointed to hear that, because this is really our only way to get his constituents \u2014 many of which don\u2019t have insurance \u2014 access to really high-quality care.\u201d\n\nThe current round of grant applications is seen as particularly important because there may be less \u2014 perhaps even no \u2014 money for clinic expansions in the future. That\u2019s because the Republicans who will control both houses of Congress next year are intent on repealing funding for parts of the reform law, if not the entire law.\n\nThat means Wesco and the other Kansas clinic directors seeking grants have several anxious months ahead of them. Decisions about which grants will be funded aren\u2019t expected until May.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Even with the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans still lack health insurance.
