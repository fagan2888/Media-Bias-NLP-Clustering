In California and New York, low-wage workers are celebrating historic agreements to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. And the economy and jobs consistently rank among the top concerns expressed by voters of all political stripes.\n\nOne government institution reigns supreme in its ability to influence wages, jobs and overall economic growth, yet leading candidates for president have barely discussed it at all. The Federal Reserve is the most important economic policymaking institution in the country, and it is critical that voters hear how candidates plan to reform and interact with the Fed.\n\nRelated: The Federal Reserve Bank, Explained\n\nThe Fed too often epitomizes the problems with our economy and democracy over which voters are voicing frustration: Commercial banks literally own much of the Fed and are using it to enrich themselves at the expense of the American working and middle class. When Wall Street recklessness crashed the economy in 2008, American families paid the price.\n\nAt the time, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon sat on the board of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, which stepped in during the crisis to save Dimon\u2019s firm and so many other banks on the verge of collapse. Although the Fed\u2019s actions helped Wall Street recover, that recovery never translated to Main Street, where jobs and wage growth stagnated.\n\nCommercial banks should not govern the very institution that oversees them. It\u2019s a scandal that continues to threaten the Fed\u2019s credibility. An analysis conducted earlier this year by my parent organization, The Center for Popular Democracy, showed that employees of financial firms continue to hold key posts at regional Federal Reserve banks and that leadership throughout the Federal Reserve System remains overwhelmingly white and male and draws disproportionately from the corporate and financial world.\n\nWhen the Fed voted in December to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, the decision was largely driven by regional Bank presidents \u2014 the very policymakers who are chosen by corporate and financial interests. In 2015, the Fed filled three vacant regional president position, and all three were filled with individuals with strong ties to Goldman Sachs; next year, 4 of the 5 regional presidents voting on monetary policy will be former Goldman Sachs insiders. Can we trust these blue-chip bankers to address working Americans\u2019 concerns?\n\nRelated: The New Retirement Investing Rule Is Great \u2014 but Your Broker Can Still Rip You Off\n\nYet despite the enormous power it wields and the glaring problems it continues to exemplify, the Fed has received little attention this election cycle. As noted by Reuters last week, two of the remaining candidates for president, Hillary Clinton and John Kasich, have been mute on what they would do about the central bank. Donald Trump\u2019s sporadic statements about the Fed have been characteristically short on details, prompting former Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Narayana Kocherlakota to call for Clinton, Trump and all presidential candidates to clarify exactly how they plan to oversee the Fed\u2019s management of the economy. Ted Cruz has piped up about the Fed on a few occasions, although his vocal endorsement of \u201csound money\u201d and other policies that contributed to the Great Depression warrant clarification.\n\nThe most detailed Fed reform proposal from a presidential candidate to date was a December New York Times op-ed in which Bernie Sanders wrote that \u201can institution that was created to serve all Americans has been hijacked by the very bankers it regulates,\u201d and urged vital reforms to the Fed\u2019s governance structure.\n\nOn Monday, Dartmouth economist Andy Levin, a 20-year Fed staffer and former senior adviser to Fed Chair Janet Yellen and her predecessor Ben Bernanke, unveiled a bold proposal to reform the Federal Reserve and make it a truly transparent, publicly accountable institution that responds to the needs of working families.\n\nRelated: Banks Got Bailed Out, Homeowners Got Sold Out \u2014 and the Feds Made a Killing\n\nThe New York primary provides a perfect opportunity for the remaining presidential candidates to tell us what they think about the Federal Reserve. Candidates in both parties should specify whether they support Levin\u2019s proposals, and if not, articulate their preferred approach for our federal government\u2019s most opaque but essential institution.\n\nAs Trump, Cruz and Kasich gear up for a potentially decisive primary, they would do well to respond to the many calls for clarity on the Fed. And on Thursday night, Sanders and Clinton will have the chance to clarify their stances on the Fed when they debate in Brooklyn, just a few miles away from Wall Street and the global financial epicenter that is the New York Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nAs New York voters get ready to decide which of the remaining candidates would make the best president, they will be asking themselves which candidate will better handle the economy. The candidates\u2019 positions on the Fed must be part of the equation.\n\nJordan Haedtler is campaign manager of the Fed Up campaign, which calls on the Federal Reserve to adopt policies that build a strong economy for the American public.
