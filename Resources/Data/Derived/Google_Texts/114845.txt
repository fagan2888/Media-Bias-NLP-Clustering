A 17-year-old boy was seriously injured when he got caught in an auger at a Town of Sheboygan Falls farm Sunday afternoon.

Sheboygan County officials were summoned to a farm on Sumac Road shortly before 5 p.m. for a report of a youth caught in a piece of farm machinery, according to the Sheriff's Department.
