Tuesday May 27, 2014, in Nashville, TN. (Photo: Larry McCormack / The Tennessean )Buy Photo\n\nIf we\u2019re actually going to fix public education in this city, it\u2019s important to speak candidly and honestly.\n\nWe\u2019ve proved that tiptoeing around problems and hoping they go away doesn\u2019t work. Confronting challenges head on, with a sense of urgency, is the responsible thing to do.\n\nWith this in mind, I believe Metro Nashville Public Schools is in a state of crisis.\n\nThe evidence is clear. In two years, MNPS has more than doubled its number of low-performing schools on the state of Tennessee\u2019s \u201cpriority\u201d list, which identifies the bottom 5 percent of schools in the state. Our school system went from having six schools on the list in 2012 to, as of last week, 14 schools. Put differently: The number of students in exceedingly low-performing schools has risen from 2,260 to 6,272, according to enrollment data in the state\u2019s Report Card.\n\nThe Metro school board should act decisively to confront this crisis.\n\nI\u2019m ashamed to admit that, during the past two years, the school board has not had a single conversation about persistently failing schools and how to turn them around. The reality is: Schools Director Jesse Register has been setting the agenda, and failing schools do not fit in management\u2019s glossy narrative. It\u2019s overdue time for the elected board to assert authority on behalf of students, parents and taxpayers.\n\nComing to grips with the facts is critical. Of the 14 low-performing schools on the state\u2019s priority list, four were on the list in 2012: Bailey STEM Magnet Middle, Brick Church Middle, Buena Vista Elementary and Napier Elementary. By failing to turn around these schools during the past two years, MNPS has done harm to students and families.\n\nNow, we\u2019ve got 10 new entries on the priority list. Moreover, another nine schools are struggling with pronounced achievement gaps among English learners, economically disadvantaged kids and students with disabilities \u2014 including McGavock High School, which President Barack Obama recently visited amid much fanfare.\n\nBottom line: Following a few years of incremental gains, academic improvement in MNPS has plateaued and now we\u2019re sliding backward relative to the rest of the state. The backslide comes despite paying $3.5 million to a school turnaround firm, the U.K.-based Tribal Group, whose recommendations Register largely ignored.\n\nSo what do we do at this point? The school board needs to develop a rapid-response plan to identify the capacity, expertise and leadership needed to rescue our 14 priority schools. As a starting point, let\u2019s accelerate the board\u2019s policy of inviting qualified charter school operators to help in turnaround efforts.\n\nThe Tennessee Charter School Center \u2014 the attack arm of the local charter movement \u2014 claims that publicly funded, privately run charter schools are a panacea for public education. If that\u2019s the case, then the center should submit proposals to help turn around low-performing schools on the priority list. Let\u2019s muster the courage to help our struggling schools, not turn our backs on them.\n\nOur goal should be: no MNPS schools on the state\u2019s priority list by the time it\u2019s released again in 2016. We need to deal with this crisis on behalf of the 6,272 students in these 14 schools. They deserve the very best chance in life, and the school board should feel obligated to act with urgency.\n\nWill Pinkston represents District 7 on the Metro Nashville School Board.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2014/08/27/pinkston-failing-schools-demand-board-response/14680021/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Pinkston: Failing schools demand board response", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Pinkston: Failing schools demand board response", "title": "Pinkston: failing schools demand board response", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2014/08/27/pinkston-failing-schools-demand-board-response/14680021/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pinkston: Failing schools demand board response", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b7f708985f77c50e3f101b4202cee963e7af0b3a/c=712-0-3544-2832&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/27/-nas-schoolboard0528-12.jpg20140527.jpg", "title": "Pinkston: failing schools demand board response", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Barack Obama", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Barack Obama", "title": "Pinkston: failing schools demand board response", "author": "Will Pinkston", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ab3247e54f417f88f889107d4e536ce8e44c74d7/c=1066-0-3190-2832/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/27/-nas-schoolboard0528-12.jpg20140527.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffcf9ffae20ad5cc11182249bf77aaa4aba103f0/c=712-0-3544-2832/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/27/-nas-schoolboard0528-12.jpg20140527.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b13be91a9615a9843585fcadc4259939d2a6c7d7/c=240-0-4016-2832/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/27/-nas-schoolboard0528-12.jpg20140527.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/41fe6ae09d21e093032327224add51a841a440cc/c=0-219-4256-2613&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/27/-nas-schoolboard0528-12.jpg20140527.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-27T10:27:42-05:00", "shorthed": "Pinkston: failing schools demand board response", "articleid": 14680021, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eff16e362ab1c55fb18dd4faa6b341e433708ce3/c=0-219-4256-2613/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/27/-nas-schoolboard0528-12.jpg20140527.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a983a92c51b952685f5f3df72af1496854487fdb/c=1332-0-2925-2832/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/27/-nas-schoolboard0528-12.jpg20140527.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd134b\"", "article_summary": "They deserve the very best chance in life, and the school board should feel obligated to act with urgency.\nThe school board needs to develop a rapid-response plan to identify the capacity, expertise and leadership needed to rescue our 14 priority schools.\nBuy Photo Will Pinkston speaks at the Metro Nashville school board meeting.\nWill Pinkston represents District 7 on the Metro Nashville School Board.\nOur goal should be: no MNPS schools on the state\u2019s priority list by the time it\u2019s released again in 2016."}
