Examples include the creation of process-improvement teams, use of generic drugs and increased patient-centered medical home capacity. Incentive payments were made to qualifying physicians twice a year.\n\nThe program also features a patient-centered medical home designation, determined by 12 domains measured and reported every six months. Practices that received and maintained the designation received a 10-percent increase in reimbursement for office visits.\n\nThe research team analyzed the program's impact on quality and spending from 2008 to 2011 for more than 3 million beneficiaries in more than 11,000 physician practices. The average amount spent per month per adult patient by a provider in the incentive program was $3.53 less than that spent by nonparticipants, a savings of just over 1 percent. Participating providers spent $5.44 less than nonparticipants for pediatric patients, a savings of 5.1 percent.\n\nParticipants also demonstrated the same or improved performance on 11 of 14 quality measures over time, in areas such as childhood immunizations, well-child checkups, and diabetes prevention and management measures.\n\nLemak said the team's analysis strongly suggests that any comprehensive approach to improving population health may incur higher spending in the first year. The authors say the increase is likely due to primary care physicians' additional work of getting all patients in for initial screenings and physicians' efforts to help patients begin to manage their chronic diseases. Over time, these efforts may pay off in reduced outpatient facility fees and professional charges, according to the study.\n\n\"This study suggests that a statewide program that was developed collaboratively by a major health plan and physicians and that emphasized primary care and population health achieved modest but significant spending reductions and improvement on quality measures over time,\" Lemak said. \"In short, we have demonstrated that the Physician Group Incentive Program's efforts with primary care physicians may be an important lesson for others.\"\n\nExplore further: Physicians embrace Michigan program to improve health care\n\nMore information: \"Michigan's Fee-For-Value Physician Incentive Program Reduces Spending And Improves Quality In Primary Care\" Health Aff April 2015 34:4645-652; DOI: 10.1377/hlthaff.2014.0426\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Fee-for-value\u2014a physician-reimbursement model that maintains traditional fees for service but includes quality and spending incentives\u2014can reduce spending and improve quality in primary care, according to a study led ...", "og": {"url": "http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-04-links-incentives-primary-doctors-quality.html", "image": "http://img.medicalxpress.com/newman/gfx/news/hires/2015/studylinksin.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Fee-for-value\u2014a physician-reimbursement model that maintains traditional fees for service but includes quality and spending incentives\u2014can reduce spending and improve quality in primary care, according to a study led by the University of Michigan.", "title": "Study links incentives for primary care doctors to improved quality, lower cost"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fee-for-value\u2014a physician-reimbursement model that maintains traditional fees for service but includes quality and spending incentives\u2014can reduce spending and improve quality in primary care, according ...", "title": "Study links incentives for primary care doctors to improved quality, lower cost", "url": "http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-04-links-incentives-primary-doctors-quality.html", "image": "http://img.medicalxpress.com/newman/gfx/news/2015/studylinksin.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 287568380}, "ROBOTS": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 325486637469240}, "Keywords": "Medicine Research News, Medicine Research, Health Research News, Health Research, Health Science, Medicine Science", "thumbnail": "http://img.medicalxpress.com/newman/csz/news/tmb/2015/studylinksin.jpg", "viewport": "width=1024"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcafbe\"", "article_summary": "\"In short, we have demonstrated that the Physician Group Incentive Program's efforts with primary care physicians may be an important lesson for others.\"\nAmong the incentives offered by the Physician Group Incentive Program were 25 initiatives to improve process and outcomes of care.\nFee-for-value\u2014a physician-reimbursement model that maintains traditional fees for service but includes quality and spending incentives\u2014can reduce spending and improve quality in primary care, according to a study led by the University of Michigan.\nExplore further: Physicians embrace Michigan program to improve health careMore information: \"Michigan's Fee-For-Value Physician Incentive Program Reduces Spending And Improves Quality In Primary Care\" Health Aff April 2015 34:4645-652; DOI: 10.1377/hlthaff.2014.0426\nThe authors say the increase is likely due to primary care physicians' additional work of getting all patients in for initial screenings and physicians' efforts to help patients begin to manage their chronic diseases."}
