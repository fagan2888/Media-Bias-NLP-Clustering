Okay? And NATO\u2019s not really set up for terrorism. NATO is set up for the Soviet Union more than anything else. And now you don\u2019t have the Soviet Union,\u201d Trump said in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\nPresident Obama on Monday defended the organization after a meeting with NATO\u2019s Secretary General. \u201cNATO continues to be the linchpin, the cornerstone of our collective defense and U.S. security policy,\" the president said. The Pentagon and Trump\u2019s election rivals Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton have also defended the alliance and blasted Trump for his remarks.\n\nRelated: Bernie Sanders Wants a New NATO, Including Russia, to Fight ISIS\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about NATO and the discussion Trump has sparked:\n\nWhat is NATO?\n\nThe organization is the largest peacetime military alliance in the world. Established on April 4, 1949, NATO is an intergovernmental military alliance in which its 28 member states have agreed to defend each other in case of an attack by any external party. Article 5 of the NATO agreement says that an armed attack against one or more of the allies \u201cshall be considered an attack against them all\u201d and following such an attack, each ally would respond with \u201csuch action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\u201d\n\nWhy was NATO formed in the first place?\n\nIt was created after World War II in response to the growing threat of the Soviet Union. Several countries in Western Europe were fearful for their safety in the midst of increasing tensions with the Soviets. The alliance also served to promote European political integration.\n\nEven though the Treaty of Brussels had been signed in 1948, the signing of a new treaty that included that U.S. was thought to be necessary to counter any possible revival of nationalist militarism. With the U.S. providing support to Western Europe, countries were less likely to deal with security concerns by negotiating with the Soviets.\n\nWhat countries are in NATO?\n\nThe treaty originally included 12 nations, but has expanded over the years to 28. The current members are Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nA number of other countries and international organizations \u2014 the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \u2014 also cooperate with NATO in a range of capacities.\n\nCan other countries join?\n\nNATO employs an \u201copen door policy,\u201d in which any European country that meets specific political, economic and military criteria can join. Countries that want to join must also be able to carry out the commitments and obligations of membership, including military contributions to the alliance, a working democratic government based on a market economy, unbiased treatment toward minority populations, a dedication to peaceful resolutions of disputes and democratic institutional structures and civilian-military relations.\n\nDo other countries want to join NATO?\n\nFour countries have announced they would like to become members of NATO: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Ukraine would like to be a member and has applied to join, but the process has stalled amid protests from Russia.\n\nRelated: NATO Countries Continue to Fail to Meet Defense Spending Promises\n\nHow is NATO run?\n\nEach member nation has an ambassador or permanent representative on the North Atlantic Council who is supported by advisors and officials who sit on different NATO committees. The current NATO Secretary General, the Alliance\u2019s top international civil servant and chief spokesperson, is Jens Stoltenberg, the former prime minister of Norway. A Secretary General serves for four years, but a fifth year is possible if all member states agree.\n\nHave member states ever come to the military defense of another member state?\n\nThe first and only time Article 5 of the NATO treaty was invoked was on Sept. 12, 2001, the day after the 9/11 attacks. In response to the attacks, the Organization deployed the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to Afghanistan. Their main missions were to train the Afghan National Security Forces and help the country rebuild its government institutions.\n\nHow do individual countries participate?\n\nAll member countries voluntarily send troops and/or equipment for NATO\u2019s military force as well as contributing money to NATO\u2019s fund civil and military budgets. The civil budget is for personnel expenses and operating costs for NATO\u2019s headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. For 2016, the civil budget is just over $253 million. The military budget, which provides the funding for the entirety of the NATO Command Structure, is a little more than $1.3 billion.\n\nDoes the U.S. actually pay for the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of NATO like Trump claims?\n\nHow much each country contributes to the alliance\u2019s direct budget is based on a cost-sharing formula tied to its Gross National Income. Under that formula, the U.S. provides about 22 percent of NATO\u2019s budget, The U.S. pays for 22 percent of the alliance\u2019s budget, compared to 15 percent for Germany, 11 percent for France, 10 percent for the United Kingdom, 8 percent for Italy and so forth.\n\nThe real point of contention is the indirect funding of NATO. The organization asks all of its member states to put at least 2 percent of their GDP toward their own defense spending. But only five countries \u2014 Poland, the U.S., Great Britain, Greece and Estonia \u2014 actually meet or exceed that goal. The median spending of each country on defense is just 1.18 percent of GDP, compared to 3.7 percent for the U.S.\n\nAs NATO itself explains on its website: \u201cToday, the volume of the US defense expenditure effectively represents 73 per cent of the defense spending of the Alliance as a whole. This does not mean that the United States covers 73 per cent of the costs involved in the operational running of NATO as an organization, including its headquarters in Brussels and its subordinate military commands, but it does mean that there is an over-reliance by the Alliance as a whole on the United States for the provision of essential capabilities, including for instance, in regard to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; air-to-air refuelling; ballistic missile defense; and airborne electronic warfare.\u201d\n\nThis is not a new issue, either, as the NATO website makes clear: \u201cThe combined wealth of the non-US Allies, measured in GDP, exceeds that of the United States. However, non-US Allies together spend less than half of what the United States spends on defense. This imbalance has been a constant, with variations, throughout the history of the Alliance and more so since the tragic events of 11 September 2001, after which the United States significantly increased its defense spending.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump keeps criticizing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as", "title": "NATO: Everything You Need to Know About the Alliance Donald Trump Says Is \u2018Obsolete\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/04/NATO-Everything-You-Need-Know-About-Alliance-Donald-Trump-Says-Obsolete", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/nato-foreign_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/04/NATO-Everything-You-Need-Know-About-Alliance-Donald-Trump-Says-Obsolete", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/nato-foreign_1.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Donald Trump keeps criticizing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump keeps criticizing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as \u201cobsolete.\u201d\u201cOur big threat today is terrorism.\nRelated: Bernie Sanders Wants a New NATO, Including Russia, to Fight ISISHere\u2019s everything you need to know about NATO and the discussion Trump has sparked:What is NATO?\nRelated: NATO Countries Continue to Fail to Meet Defense Spending PromisesHow is NATO run?\nA Secretary General serves for four years, but a fifth year is possible if all member states agree.\nHave member states ever come to the military defense of another member state?"}
