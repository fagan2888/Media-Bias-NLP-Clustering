If the American Revolution was in some large measure a tax rebellion, we should appreciate the bitter irony that the U.S. Constitution was in some large measure a reaction to a tax rebellion, writes Sheldon Richman.

Following the Revolution, Americans were in no mood to substitute a Yankee taxman for a British taxman. Much of the Anti-Federalist case against the proposed Constitution focused on the new national government's virtually unlimited power to tax. But for a host of reasons, Americans' abhorrence of taxation was not enough to thwart ratification.

It's another reason we can reasonably view the move toward the Constitution—toward, that is, the concentration of power in a national government—as a counter-revolution and something for libertarians to abhor, Richman writes.
