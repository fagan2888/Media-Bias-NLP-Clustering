The TIF district would capture property-tax revenue from recently built and still-planned senior housing by Pedcor Investments and from a collection of buildings being rehabilitated by Reverie Estates.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat whole neighborhood has been waiting for this development for as long as I\u2019ve been a councilor and then some,\u201d said Republican councilor Marilyn Pfisterer, who was elected in 2003.\n\n\n\nThe west-side neighborhood will probably have to wait a little longer to see the payoff from a TIF district. Most such districts promoted by the Mayor\u2019s Office have a new real estate development waiting in the wings. That\u2019s not the case with Central State. The city has a master-developer agreement with Central Greens LLC, but the firm, led by former city planner Mike Higbee, has yet to break ground.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Carmel-based Pedcor is pursuing tax credits for a second round of affordable senior-citizens housing. Indianapolis-based Reverie is converting four historic buildings into dorm-style student housing, an event hall, a brewery and office space.\n\n\n\nThe TIF district proposal, sponsored by Pfisterer, Republican Jeff Miller and Democrat Vop Osili, will go to the City-County Council for a hearing and vote Jan. 12. It passed out of the Metropolitan and Economic Development Committee Dec. 8, on a 4-2 vote.\n\n\n\nDemocrat Zach Adamson said he voted against the Central State TIF to protest the administration\u2019s lack of action on another TIF district, in Avondale Meadows near East 38th Street and Keystone Avenue. The council unanimously supported that proposal earlier this year, but Mayor Greg Ballard\u2019s administration has yet to act on it.\n\n\n\nRepublican Will Goodin voted no based on a procedural disagreement, but supports the idea of a Central State TIF.\n\n\n\nCentral State, now known as Central Greens, is large enough to hold most of the core of downtown, and the city\u2019s master plan for it envisions an urban village. It\u2019s been difficult to attract business, however, because the site is in the midst of an impoverished area.\n\n\n\nThe city has already invested $3.6 million in new roads, sidewalks, water lines and sewer, and much of the development that\u2019s happened so far has benefited from some form of public assistance, according to the Department of Metropolitan Development.\n\n\n\nPedcor is building a 62-unit senior citizens complex, Retreat, with low-income housing tax credits on a site that was cleared using a $500,000 state grant, according to the city.\n\n\n\nRetreat has a 70-person waiting list, said Derek Naber, senior project manager with the Department of Metropolitan Development. Pedcor hopes to build a second round of senior housing if awarded tax credits next year.\n\n\n\nReverie opened its dorm-style residence, the Central State Mansion, in August and it is 40-percent occupied, exceeding the developer\u2019s expectations, Naber said.\n\n\n\nThe very first development at Central State, Pedcor\u2019s affordable apartments, the Steeples, would be excluded from the TIF district because it\u2019s already on the tax roll.\n\n\n\nThe question of which buildings to include in TIF districts\u2014such districts prevent growth in tax revenue from benefiting the entire county\u2014has been a point of contention between city councilors and the administration.\n\n\n\nA critic of TIF districts, Adamson protested the fact that a new one in Broad Ripple will include a city-subsidized parking garage completed long before the district was formed.\n\n\n\nNaber said the Central State district extends to the south side of West Washington Street, across from the Central State campus, because most of the storefronts are currently vacant.\n\n\n\nThe administration has no tax-revenue projections for the Central State TIF and no plans to pursue financing for the next round of infrastructure on the site, Department of Metropolitan Development spokesman John Bartholomew said.\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indianapolis planners say the city needs another $7.1 million to prepare the former Central State Hospital campus for redevelopment, but they\u2019re out of resources.
