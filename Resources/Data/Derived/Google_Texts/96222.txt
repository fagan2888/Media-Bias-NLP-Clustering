Trump, coming off a win a night earlier in the Nevada Republican Caucus, said rolling back President Barack Obama executive orders, including one dealing with the border and immigration, repealing ObamaCare and taking care of the veterans would be his priorities.

“Well, the first thing I’d do is knock out some of the executive orders signed by our president,” Trump said. “Especially the one on the border where people are allowed to come in and just pour into our country like Swiss cheese. I’m going to work out immediately to knock out ObamaCare and start taking care of our vets and military … our vets have been absolutely treated horribly and we’re going to take care of our vets. That’s been a very, very big part of my campaign, the vets.”

Stephanopoulos pressed Trump on specifics, to which Trump offered some of his ideas on health care.

“Well, I’ve been specific in terms of the wall,” he said. “I’ve been very specific in terms of ObamaCare, what I’m doing is very specific, whether we use health care savings accounts and that could happen because a lot of people are liking it a lot. ObamaCare is falling out under its own weight. It’s going to be dead by 2017. People are not signing up for it. It’s a disaster. The rates and premiums going up by 45, 55, 65 percent. And we’re going to have great health care. We’re going to make it a fraction of the cost and I’m very specific on it, George. I’m a very specific person, believe me.”
