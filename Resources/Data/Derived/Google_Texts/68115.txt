Add Florida Blue to the list of insurers notifying policyholders they are near a negotiation deadline with a Florida hospital system.

The Northwest Florida Daily News reports that the contract between Jacksonville-based insurance company and Sacred Heart Hospital of Pensacola ends June 30. Both parties told the Daily News they are optimistic an agreement can be reached by the deadline.

Sacred Heart is owned by Ascension Health Care. The Florida Times-Union reported that another Ascension hospital, St. Vincent's ,also is facing a June 30 deadline.

Earlier this month, Humana notified nearly 1 million Florida policyholders that it has failed to reach an agreement with HCA hospitals in the state. That contract also expires at the end of the month.
