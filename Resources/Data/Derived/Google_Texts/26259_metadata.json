Of the 23 nonprofit insurers created, 12 have closed their doors, with many attributing their decision to the risk corridor program after receiving just 12 percent of their requested amounts.\n\nMore than 1 million Americans were insured by the co-ops, and they received a total of $2.5 billion in loans from the government.\n\n\u201cWe expected they weren\u2019t going to get the money, but that\u2019s likely to continue to be a problem,\u201d Pearson said of the language in the omnibus. \u201cReally, any plan that is mostly operating in the individual market, any of the local plans, it\u2019s a huge problem for them.\u201d\n\nContrary to the co-ops, which sell coverage primarily on the federal and state-run exchanges and operate only in the health insurance market, larger insurers are likely to fare better should they receive less from the risk corridor payments than anticipated next year.\n\nPearson said national carriers likely weren\u2019t expecting to receive the full payments in 2014 and will assume the same for payments for 2015 and 2016.\n\n\u201cThey will just spread that across premiums across all businesses, and they can absorb [the losses],\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re still upset, but they can manage through it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Not Counting On It\u2019\n\nEd Haislmaier, a health policy expert at The Heritage Foundation, disagreed that the remaining 11 co-ops would feel the squeeze should they receive less in risk corridor payments again.\n\nHaislmaier said those that have survived did so because they weren\u2019t counting on the money.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re out of the woods elsewhere,\u201d he told The Daily Signal, \u201cbut a lot of these insurers haven\u2019t been counting on the money that\u2019s still in there.\u201d\n\nFor example, HealthyCT, Connecticut\u2019s co-op, did not rely on payments from the risk corridor program to make up losses it incurred in 2014, Ken Lalime, its chief executive officer, told The Daily Signal. The co-op fared better than most last year and is not counting on 2015 payments.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the tools to allow all insurers to be able to take on unknown risk,\u201d he said of the risk corridors. \u201cWithout it in place, it does make things a little more complicated. We\u2019d love the [full funding] to come back, but we\u2019re not counting on it.\u201d\n\nLalime said there\u2019s \u201cnot a lot of confidence\u201d the program has a long-term future, but he does hope Congress will act to reinstate the original language.\n\n\u201cThe co-ops in general have just done a fabulous job in bringing new ideas, innovation, and additional competition to the marketplaces. I think we\u2019ve brought an awareness to the marketplace that you can do some of these things and step into a space that\u2019s ill-defined,\u201d Lalime said. He continued:\n\nI\u2019m proud of those that could, but I feel bad for those that relied on funding from a component of the premium stabilization [the risk corridor program], and that was unable to be funded at a full rate.\n\nHigher Premiums\n\nDespite their disagreement on how the risk corridor program will affect the remaining co-ops, Pearson and Haislmaier agreed that consumers are likely to see increased premiums in 2017 as insurers decide how to address losses and the potential for lower risk corridor payments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so much that [insurers] can increase premiums,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cThey\u2019re limited, but we\u2019re seeing larger 2016 increases in the exchange markets as it is, and that\u2019s likely to continue in 2017. I expect two years of double-digit increases.\u201d\n\nHaislmaier said insurers were likely to increase the cost of plans either way as they got used to the market. However, the change in risk corridor funding likely speeds it up.\n\n\u201cThis accelerates it marginally as opposed to delaying it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe risk corridor program is in effect until 2017. The program seeks to provide stability in the health insurance market by spreading the risk insurers may incur by providing coverage to more unhealthy and costly patients than in the past.\n\nUnder the program, insurance companies that make an excess profit pay into a fund operated by the federal government. Those that incur excess losses, meanwhile, receive money from the fund.\n\nIf there is a shortfall between what insurers pay into the program versus what insurers who lost money request, taxpayer dollars cover the difference.\n\nDuring last year\u2019s debate over the 2015 government spending bill, Republicans, led by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., secured language prohibiting the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from using taxpayer dollars to cover any shortfall.\n\nThe Obama administration announced in October that the risk corridor program would pay $362 million to insurance companies who incurred excess losses. Those insurers requested $2.87 billion, leaving a $2.5-billion shortfall taxpayers\u2014through the original design of the program\u2014would have covered.\n\nInclusion of language regarding the risk corridor program is considered a victory for conservative lawmakers and outside groups, who pushed House and Senate leaders to eliminate the federal government\u2019s ability to use taxpayer dollars to pay insurance companies suffering excess losses.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare's co-ops would have to make up losses incurred should they receive lower risk corridor payments than anticipated for 2015.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Obamacare's co-ops would have to make up losses incurred should they receive lower risk corridor payments than anticipated for 2015.", "title": "Spending Deal\u2019s Risk Corridor Provision Would Affect Co-Ops", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151214_RiskCorridorOmni_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-31T21:06:57+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ZetaJp"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Obamacare's co-ops would have to make up losses incurred should they receive lower risk corridor payments than anticipated for 2015.", "title": "Spending Deal\u2019s Risk Corridor Provision Would Affect Co-Ops", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151214_RiskCorridorOmni_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-12-17T14:44:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-31T21:06:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "omnibus, co-ops, Obamacare, Avalere Health, HealthyCT, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, risk corridor, Marco Rubio"}, "article_summary": "The risk corridor program is in effect until 2017.\nThe Obama administration announced in October that the risk corridor program would pay $362 million to insurance companies who incurred excess losses.\nRepublicans included language restricting the use of taxpayer dollars for Obamacare\u2019s risk corridor program, which they call a taxpayer-backed insurer bailout, in the $1.1-trillion omnibus spending bill released early Wednesday morning.\nA provision of the omnibus spending bill prohibiting taxpayer dollars from being used to \u201cbail out\u201d insurers under Obamacare\u2019s risk corridor program could jeopardize the future of the co-ops created under the health care law.\nOf the 23 nonprofit insurers created, 12 have closed their doors, with many attributing their decision to the risk corridor program after receiving just 12 percent of their requested amounts."}
