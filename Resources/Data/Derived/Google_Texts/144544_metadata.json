We are not so callous or shallow to think that anything could be \u201cworse\u201d than what happened in Charleston this summer, or Colorado Springs this fall. Those were two atrocities, yes; but they were profoundly political acts, too. They resulted in the murder of innocent people; human beings who loved and were loved, and will never come back. Nothing could be worse.\n\nSo this list is, like all listicles, a contrivance. Here, \u201cworst\u201d can be seen as an equivalent to \u201cmost annoying\u201d or \u201cmost aggravating\u201d or \u201cmost please for the love of God can I go on Facebook for just five minutes without seeing this crap?\u201d With that said, please enjoy this quick-and-dirty recap of some of the worst moments in what was \u2014 for American politics, at least \u2014 an extremely no good year.\n\n6. The Supreme Court\u2019s taking on King v. Burwell\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a Supreme Court case inspiring more cynicism and disillusionment than Bush v. Gore \u2014 but King v. Burwell came very, very close.\n\nThe case, which was spearheaded by anti-Obamacare absolutists within the Republican Party and the libertarian movement, was laughable on its face. Its proponents argued that because a single line in the bill, ripped from context, suggested that it was possible that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) intended to deny subsidies to those who lived in states that did not set up their own exchanges, the subsidies making health insurance affordable for millions of Americans in Republican-run states were unconstitutional. As many noted at the time, to accept the argument, one essentially had to believe that the then-Democratic Congress of 2009-2010 purposefully hid a time-bomb within the ACA.\n\nReason ultimately prevailed, with the majority of the Court siding with the government because, as Chief Justice John Roberts put it, the law was clearly intended \u201cto improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them.\u201d Still, the fact that we even got to this point was deeply troubling for those who, against mounting evidence, would like to think the Justices of the Court are more than politicians in robes.\n\n5. Hillary Clinton\u2019s damn emails\n\nWhile I\u2019m no longer inclined to see the scandal around former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server as a total non-issue (hat tip to Jason Leopold for changing my mind on that one), the idea that a story so arcane, technical and far removed from Election Day could matter in 2016 was always ridiculous.\n\nAs is almost always the case when it comes to Clinton, it brought out the absolute worst neuroses and instincts of the mainstream campaign press. The likelihood of finding a \u201csmoking gun\u201d (an email from Clinton with the subject line: \u201cI did Benghazi, and it was good. LOL!\u201d perhaps?) was always infinitesimally small. Clinton isn\u2019t that stupid, for one thing; and even if we hypothetically grant that she is corrupt, that\u2019s not how corruption works. Not in 2015, and not when it comes to someone so firmly enmeshed in the global elite.\n\nYet because the press was bored, scandal-thirsty, and desperate to ensure the Democratic primary wasn\u2019t a total snooze, we spent I-don\u2019t-even-want-to-know how much time talking about Clinton\u2019s emails, her servers, her \u201chome brew.\u201d There was a reason, in other words, that Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 quip about the issue during an October debate went viral.\n\n4. Kim Davis\u2019 15 minutes of fame\n\nAs far as stale leftovers of the culture war go, the story of religious fanatic and Kentucky County Clerk Kim Davis, whose refusal to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples made her a global story, is better than most. I\u2019d certainly be more willing to relive Davis\u2019 histrionics (and Mike Huckabee\u2019s opportunism) than those of Cliven Bundy (and Sean Hannity). But, really, that\u2019s not saying much.\n\nWhat made the Davis story such a drag, though, wasn\u2019t just her bigotry and the Christian right\u2019s eagerness to defend it. No, what made the Kim Davis story such a drag was the way it confirmed that, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of a right to marry, the culture war would endure for quite some time. Not in some separate form, mind you, but rather almost exactly as it was throughout the \u201980s, \u201990s and \u201900s: with huckster zealots like Ralph Reed on one side, self-satisfied elitists like Bill Maher on the other, and with no new arguments, and no new perspectives.
