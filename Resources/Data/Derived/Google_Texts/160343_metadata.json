After eight years away from fundraising and a list a fraction of the size of Obama's, that couldn't be further from the truth.\u201d\n\n\n\nClinton is likely to announce her run for president on Twitter, linking the announcement through a variety of social media platforms.\n\nClinton has been unusually active on Twitter in recent weeks to generate an audience for her expected announcement.\n\nSince the last week of March, she has tweeted twice: in support of the Affordable Care Act and against an Indiana law that some say would discriminate against gays. She has also weighed in on the shooting of an unarmed black man in South Carolina\u2014\u201cPraying for #WalterScott\u2019s family. Heartbreaking & too familiar. We can do better\u2014rebuild trust, reform justice system and respect all lives.\u201d; paid tribute to retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid; and come out against \u201cpayday lenders.\u201d\n\nAfter Clinton announces her candidacy, she will likely jet off to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire early next week. While most presidential campaigns strategize over how to get media attention, Clinton operatives are trying to figure out how to wrangle a ballooning press corps that for weeks has competed over such small-bore issues as which empty Brooklyn loft space will house her campaign headquarters and looked for meaning in every Clinton facial expression and utterance since 2012.\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton have always been prodigious Democratic fundraisers, but they will enter the 2016 election cycle as newcomers to the post-Citizens United world of campaign finance. Super PACs associated with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), for example, have raised $31 million since he announced his campaign last week. And former Florida governor Jeb Bush has embarked on a \u201cshock and awe\u201d fundraising blitz to overwhelm his Republican rivals.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "Freedlander"}, "keywords": "Google, Hillary Clinton, u.s. poli, 2016 Election", "publicationDate": 201504102125, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "On Sunday, Clinton will announce her presidential run and plans to use next week to raise \u2018an insane amount of money,\u2019 an insider says.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Hillary to Launch Campaign This Weekend With Insane Fundraising Push", "tags": "syndication:syndication-google,entity:person/hillary_clinton,topic:politics,obsessional:2016-election", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Hillary to Launch Campaign This Weekend With \u2018Insane\u2019 Fundraising Push\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/10/hillary-to-launch-campaign-this-weekend-with-insane-fundraising-push.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/10/hillary-to-launch-campaign-this-weekend-with-insane-fundraising-push/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47622450.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/10/hillary-to-launch-campaign-this-weekend-with-insane-fundraising-push\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-10T21:25:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"David Freedlander\",\"tags\":[\"syndication-google\",\"hillary_clinton\",\"politics\",\"2016-election\"]}", "news_keywords": "Google, Hillary Clinton, US Politics, 2016 Election", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "David Freedlander", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-04-10T21:25:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/david-freedlanderhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/10/hillary-to-launch-campaign-this-weekend-with-insane-fundraising-push", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "On Sunday, Clinton will announce her presidential run and plans to use next week to raise \u2018an insane amount of money,\u2019 an insider says.", "title": "Hillary to Launch Campaign This Weekend With \u2018Insane\u2019 Fundraising Push", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/10/hillary-to-launch-campaign-this-weekend-with-insane-fundraising-push.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/10/hillary-to-launch-campaign-this-weekend-with-insane-fundraising-push/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1428673516271.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/d/david-freedlander", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton will announce her presidential campaign this Sunday, sources in the Clinton operation tell The Daily Beast.\nAfter that, the nascent campaign will embark on a fundraising push that the Clinton camp says will dwarf anything seen in the history of presidential politics.\nBill and Hillary Clinton have always been prodigious Democratic fundraisers, but they will enter the 2016 election cycle as newcomers to the post-Citizens United world of campaign finance.\n\u201cThe \u2018insane fundraising\u2019 expectations comments are about as connected to reality as that person probably is to the campaign.\nSuper PACs associated with Sen.
