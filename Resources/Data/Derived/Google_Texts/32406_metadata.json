But subsidies can\u2019t be applied to catastrophic coverage \u2014 high-deductible insurance aimed at young people.\n\nUse the calculator at New York State of Health to estimate the value of your subsidy (info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/calculator).\n\nLet\u2019s say you are a family of four in the Bronx \u2014 two adults and two kids \u2014 you earn $60,000 a year and your tier choice is silver.\n\nThe value of your subsidy would be $336.20. If you bought a policy from Affinity Health Plan, you would pay $408.60 a month for a plan that costs $744.80, the calculator shows.\n\nOverall, the average price of premiums in New York State, before subsidies, is set to go up about 5% next year.\n\nPlans in the New York State of Health tiers have four coverage levels: bronze, silver, gold and platinum.

Silver was the most popular tier last year.\n\nPremiums are just one part of the equation. Plans come with deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance, and these costs can hurt.\n\nExpect to see some high deductibles. A study conducted last year by HealthPocket found that the average entry-level bronze plan had a deductible of $5,081, 42% higher than the average for the 2013, pre-health-reform market.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, those higher deductibles scared people away from buying insurance\u201d last year, said Barry Sloane, CEO of Newtek Business Services.\n\nPlans have an out-of-pocket maximum, which is the most you will pay during the year before your insurance plan takes over 100% of the payments.\n\nThis year, the maximum set by the government is $6,600 for an individual plan.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing I tell clients is make sure you have a plan that provides enough coverage,\u201d said Rachel Klein, director of organizational strategy and enrollment at Families USA.\n\n\u201cIt might be worth paying a few dollars more to make sure you can afford health care when you need it during the year.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t forget to dig deep into plans to see if they meet your needs.\n\nAre your drugs covered? What are the co-pays?\n\nCheck to see if the doctors and hospitals you like are part of the network. This is important for both newcomers and those who enrolled last year.\n\nPlans on New York State of Health generally do not cover out-of-network services. But there are consumer protections in place. For instance, if a plan lacks a particular type of physician or provider, the insurer must permit the consumer access to out-of-network providers at the in-network price.\n\nNetworks can change from one year to the next. Oscar Insurance, for instance, has dropped two hospitals, Maimonides Medical Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering, from its network.\n\nAll Oscar members who are currently being treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering or Maimonides will be able to continue receiving treatment for however long they need, rather than the typical 90-day period of mandated transitional care, the company said.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to call your doctor to verify what you see on the website.\n\nIt pays to call the insurance company, too, to make sure you have a firm handle on the plan\u2019s benefits and its costs.\n\n\u201cThe health care system is very complicated,\u201d said Oscar co-founder Mario Schlosser. \u201cCall the insurance company and ask the tough question: \u2018How much will it cost me?\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Phyllis Furman", "twitter": {"description": "Ready, set, shop.You\u2019ll have countless choices and a lot to learn as you set off to buy health insurance on the exchange.", "title": "Get the details on New York's available health care plans", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/details-new-york-health-care-plans-article-1.2013344", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2013342.1416230348!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/462048321.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Phyllis Furman", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-11-17T13:40:36", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/details-new-york-health-care-plans-article-1.2013344", "parsely-title": "Get the details on New York's available health care plans", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-17T08:40:36-0500", "sailthru.title": "Get the details on New York's available health care plans", "nydn_section": "Health", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2013342.1416230348!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/462048321.jpg", "description": "Ready, set, shop.You\u2019ll have countless choices and a lot to learn as you set off to buy health insurance on the exchange.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Ready, set, shop.You\u2019ll have countless choices and a lot to learn as you set off to buy health insurance on the exchange.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Ready, set, shop.You\u2019ll have countless choices and a lot to learn as you set off to buy health insurance on the exchange.", "title": "Get the details on New York's available health care plans", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/details-new-york-health-care-plans-article-1.2013344", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2013342.1416230348!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/462048321.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Phyllis Furman", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2013342.1416230348!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/462048321.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda45d\"", "article_summary": "Eleven insurance companies are selling plans to New York City residents on New York State of Health.\nPlans in the New York State of Health tiers have four coverage levels: bronze, silver, gold and platinum.\nYou\u2019ll have countless choices and a lot to learn as you set off to buy health insurance on the exchange.\nA bronze plan might be right for someone who is healthy and doesn\u2019t expect to visit the doctor much.\nUse the calculator at New York State of Health to estimate the value of your subsidy (info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/calculator)."}
