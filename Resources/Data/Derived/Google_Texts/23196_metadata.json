Mitch Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell took the CEO of Delta Air Lines to break\u00adfast in the ex\u00adclus\u00adive Sen\u00adate Din\u00ading Room last month, the air\u00adline ex\u00adec\u00adut\u00adive and his wife wrote $10,000 worth of checks to help fund Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell\u2019s polit\u00adic\u00adal op\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion.\n\nThe dona\u00adtions, which were re\u00adpor\u00adted to the Fed\u00ader\u00adal Elec\u00adtion Com\u00admis\u00adsion on Wed\u00adnes\u00adday, made Rick and Susan An\u00adder\u00adson the largest con\u00adtrib\u00adut\u00adors to Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell\u2019s Bluegrass Com\u00admit\u00adtee in Ju\u00adly. Delta Air Lines\u2019 PAC con\u00adtrib\u00aduted an\u00adoth\u00ader $2,500 with\u00adin days of the break\u00adfast.\n\nThe prox\u00adim\u00adity between the meal on Cap\u00adit\u00adol Hill and the date of the dona\u00adtions provides a win\u00addow in\u00adto how mod\u00adern Wash\u00ading\u00adton works. It\u2019s a place where in\u00adcum\u00adbent law\u00admakers, es\u00adpe\u00adcially those who\u2014like Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell\u2014face a ser\u00adi\u00adous reelec\u00adtion fight, are re\u00adlent\u00adlessly court\u00ading con\u00adtrib\u00adut\u00adors at all hours to fund mul\u00adti\u00admil\u00adlion-dol\u00adlar polit\u00adic\u00adal cam\u00adpaigns.\n\nMc\u00adCon\u00adnell spokes\u00adwo\u00adman Al\u00adlis\u00adon Moore said no money was so\u00adli\u00adcited over break\u00adfast in the Cap\u00adit\u00adol. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. Asked if Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell reg\u00adu\u00adlarly takes donors to meals at the form\u00adal Sen\u00adate Din\u00ading Room, she said, \u201cNo, Richard An\u00adder\u00adson is a friend.\u201d\n\nStill, Sheila Krum\u00adholz, ex\u00adec\u00adut\u00adive dir\u00adect\u00ador of the Cen\u00adter for Re\u00adspons\u00adive Polit\u00adics, which tracks cam\u00adpaign money, noted of the meal, \u201cThis is the kind of rare ac\u00adcess that most of us will nev\u00ader ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho makes a good enough break\u00adfast com\u00adpan\u00adion for a sit\u00adting sen\u00adat\u00ador in a highly com\u00adpet\u00adit\u00adive reelec\u00adtion cam\u00adpaign to take time out of their busy day?\u201d Krum\u00adholz said. \u201cIt nev\u00ader hurts if the per\u00adson can fol\u00adlow up with a dona\u00adtion, and all the bet\u00adter if it can be a siz\u00adable one.\u201d\n\nTyp\u00adic\u00adally, a sen\u00adat\u00ador\u2019s guest in the sanc\u00adtu\u00adary of the Sen\u00adate Din\u00ading Room would re\u00admain un\u00addis\u00adclosed. But Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell\u2019s meal with An\u00adder\u00adson was in\u00adcluded in a piece about the de\u00adclin\u00ading im\u00adport\u00adance of the din\u00ading room as a place where bi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan deals can be brokered. Here\u2019s the scene painted by Ash\u00adley Park\u00ader in The New York Times:\n\nOne morn\u00ading last month, Sen\u00adat\u00ador Mitch Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan of Ken\u00adtucky, the minor\u00adity lead\u00ader, was din\u00ading with Richard H. An\u00adder\u00adson, the chief ex\u00adec\u00adut\u00adive of Delta Air Lines. When the two men stood up, Mr. An\u00adder\u00adson stopped by the table of Mr. Schu\u00admer, who was there hav\u00ading break\u00adfast as well. The Fed\u00ader\u00adal Avi\u00adation Ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion had be\u00adgun a ban, since re\u00adversed, on flights to Is\u00adrael. \u201cFly to Is\u00adrael!\u201d Mr. Schu\u00admer urged Mr. An\u00adder\u00adson. From across the room, Mr. Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell jok\u00adingly warned his guest to steer clear of Mr. Schu\u00admer: \u201cAn\u00adder\u00adson, stay away from him!\u201d he said. But Mr. Schu\u00admer was un\u00addeterred. Shout\u00ading now, he gamely pressed his point. \u201cTell him to fly to Is\u00adrael!\u201d he bel\u00adlowed. Then, every\u00adone con\u00adtin\u00adued with break\u00adfast.\n\nThe FAA began its ban on flights to Is\u00adrael on Ju\u00adly 22 and res\u00adcin\u00added the or\u00adder about 36 hours later. The con\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtions from the An\u00adder\u00adsons to Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell are dated Ju\u00adly 29. The Delta Air Lines PAC dona\u00adtion is dated Ju\u00adly 28. The dona\u00adtions went to Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell\u2019s lead\u00ader\u00adship PAC, the Bluegrass Com\u00admit\u00adtee, which can be used for polit\u00adic\u00adal op\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtions not re\u00adlated to his reelec\u00adtion cam\u00adpaign this fall against Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic chal\u00adlenger Al\u00adis\u00adon Lun\u00adder\u00adgan Grimes.\n\nThe money was hardly the first in\u00advest\u00adment that Delta and its em\u00adploy\u00adees have made in Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell re\u00adcently. Last Septem\u00adber and Oc\u00adto\u00adber, 22 em\u00adploy\u00adees of Delta and the air\u00adline\u2019s PAC gave $26,500 to the Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell Vic\u00adtory Ken\u00adtucky Com\u00admit\u00adtee, which splits its pro\u00adceeds between Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell\u2019s reelec\u00adtion ac\u00adcount and the Ken\u00adtucky Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party.\n\nAn\u00adder\u00adson him\u00adself has also giv\u00aden $20,000 to the Ken\u00adtucky Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party in the last two years.
