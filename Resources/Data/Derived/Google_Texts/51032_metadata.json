(On assignment, he gloomily surveys the capsized Costa Concordia, another icon of Berlusconi\u2019s Italy.) Brilliantly shot in widescreen by Luca Bigazzi, The Great Beauty both luxuriates in what Jep calls \u201cthis debauched country\u201d and forces him to reassess the hedonistic now versus the glories of Rome\u2019s past. (November, but may return to theaters after the January 16 Oscar nominations.)\n\n3 Gravity See Robert Horton\u2019s list.\n\n4 Before Midnight Nine years after we last saw them, Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) resume their same, long conversation\u2014a loving, quarrelsome test of wills. Unmarried but now the parents of twin daughters, Celine and Jesse feel like old friends to moviegoers after 1995\u2019s Before Sunrise and 2004\u2019s Before Sunset. Again directed by Richard Linklater and co-written with his two stars, Before Midnight becomes an on-again/off-again argument about who has to sacrifice what for a relationship, what sexual spark keeps it burning, and how shared romantic history becomes both a burden and a bond.

Is her daddy not her daddy? And how should we view her free-spirited mother (now dead), an actress who married an actor? Polley, an accomplished actress herself, asks us to question the reliability of storytelling, hers included. (June)\n\n8 The Act of Killing See Horton\u2019s list.\n\n9 (tie) In No Great Hurry: 13 Lessons in Life With Saul Leiter/Cutie and the Boxer Two lively and affecting movies about making art, a topic that usually produces dreary documentaries. Released in August, Zachary Heinzerling\u2019s Cutie follows aging Japanese couple Ushio and Noriko Shinohara around Brooklyn. A drunk who\u2019s coasting on his youthful reputation, Ushio depends utterly on his wife. And Noriko, a late bloomer in her art, reveals a stoic dignity that keeps their marriage working. Directed by Tomas Leach, In No Great Hurry played Northwest Film Forum the very week in November that the 89-year-old photographer died in New York. Belatedly recognized for his impressionistic color street photography of the \u201950s, Leiter is allowed to simply discourse upon life and philosophy. He has no use for clarity or the decisive moment. \u201cTo know everything is not good,\u201d he declares.\n\n10 (tie) Inequality for All/The Waiting Room Two rather didactic docs that tell right-thinking liberals what we already know, but their power lies in the details. Robert Reich amplifies his book Aftershock in Jacob Kornbluth\u2019s Inequality for All. The September release explores how government policy\u2014with both Republican and Democratic fingers on the scale\u2014has been tipped against the middle class since the \u201970s. Less seen during its short March release, Peter Nicks\u2019 low-key advocacy doc The Waiting Room planted its camera in the ER of Oakland\u2019s Highland Hospital to see how patients are processed. Later broadcast on PBS, The Waiting Room is part of the broader Obamacare debate that is, incredibly, still raging. In California, that state\u2019s health-insurance exchange is now working nicely. This doc shows us a health-care system that so many said\u2014and that so many Republican governors continue to say\u2014was working just fine.\n\nNear-favorites: American Hustle, Captain Phillips, The Crash Reel, Dallas Buyers Club, Elysium, Fruitvale Station, Gimme the Loot, A Hijacking, Inside Llewyn Davis, Let the Fire Burn, Mud, Reality, Trance, Short Term 12, Spring Breakers, 12 Years a Slave, The Wolf of Wall Street.
