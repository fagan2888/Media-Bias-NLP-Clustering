It includes pension benefits, which fewer employers offer these days. Employees also have the option to participate in the company\u2019s 401(k) plan.\n\nKroger is the only major retail chain in the area with unionized employees. It has the second-largest share of the grocery market in Dallas-Fort Worth after Wal-Mart.\n\nThe contract was approved early, before a December deadline.\n\nUnion vice president Richard Hanna said the contract includes immediate pay increases of up to 35 cents per hour. The wage scale was modified to give increases to entry-level, top-level and part-time workers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very favorable contract. We\u2019re very happy with it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe agreement received yes votes from 87 percent of the workers, according the union\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really proud to say that there were no significant changes in benefits. We\u2019re still covering spouses. No one is being sent to the exchanges,\u201d Huddleston said.\n\nHe was referring to Affordable Care Act\u2019s online marketplaces where people can shop for insurance on their own. Some fear that companies will push employees out of their plans by making them part-time workers.\n\n\u201cPart-time employees are very important to us. They cover extra hours on the weekend and evenings,\u201d Huddleston said. \u201cIf they become full-time employees, then their dependents can be covered under the health insurance.\u201d\n\nAt Kroger, many part-time employees are students who are covered by their parents and older workers who qualify for Medicare, he said.\n\nHanna said health insurance coverage is for the life of the contract and isn\u2019t affected by any changes that may come from Congress in the future.\n\nKroger Southwest division president Bill Breetz said: \u201cThe agreement is the outcome of thoughtful, respectful and productive work by both the company and union representatives.\n\n\u201cI want to thank our associates for supporting this agreement, as well as for the excellent service they provide every day to our customers and company,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Maria Halkias on Twitter at @MariaHalkias.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The North Texas contract includes health insurance for full- and part-time workers and keeps the defined pension plan.", "og": {"description": "The North Texas contract includes health insurance for full- and part-time workers and keeps the defined pension plan.", "title": "Kroger, store employees approve new labor contract", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/20131025-kroger-store-employees-approve-new-labor-contract.ece", "image": {"width": 669, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131025-kroger_earns_33092641.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/KROGER_EARNS_33092641.JPG", "height": 447}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2013-10-26T01:55:52Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2013-10-26T01:54:38Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Kroger, store employees approve new labor contract\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/20131025-kroger-store-employees-approve-new-labor-contract.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131025-kroger_earns_33092641.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/KROGER_EARNS_33092641.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1263549\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-26T01:54:38Z\", \"section\": \"Retail\", \"author\": \"MARIA HALKIAS\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131025-kroger_earns_33092641.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/KROGER_EARNS_33092641.JPG", "publishtime": "2013-10-26T01:54:38Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd84f1\"", "article_summary": "Most employees will receive wage increases, some immediately and others over the 42 months of the contract, Kroger spokesman Gary Huddleston said.\nThe package covers pay and benefits, including health care for full-time and part-time employees.\nAs some employers say they\u2019re struggling to provide health insurance for full-time and part-time workers and their families, Kroger has it covered in North Texas.\n\u201cPart-time employees are very important to us.\nSome fear that companies will push employees out of their plans by making them part-time workers."}
