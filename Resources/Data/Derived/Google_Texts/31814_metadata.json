And that honesty was on full display Wednesday, after the healthcare expert denounced the policy implications of yet another Obamacare delay but admitted that \u201cfor the political gain, it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nEmanuel spoke with MSNBC\u2019s Alex Wagner about the White House\u2019s unilateral delay of a deadline to kill insurance plans that don\u2019t meet minimum guidelines. The delay will prevent hundreds of thousands of Americans from losing what the Obama administration feels are subpar plans \u2014 at least until after the November midterm elections.\n\nThe White House routinely denies that their changes to Obamcare \u2014 30 and counting \u2014 are politically motivated, instead arguing that they are merely seeking to implement the law most effectively. But Emanuel \u2014 who worked for years as a healthcare expert in the Obama administration \u2014 admitted this new delay isn\u2019t about policy, but the ballot box.\n\n\u201cPolicy-wise, it\u2019s probably a toss-up,\u201d he told Wagner. \u201cI actually think what the White House is doing is to say, \u2018Look, there\u2019s a lot of unrest about it. It\u2019s distracting. If we extend it, it really doesn\u2019t have that big an effect.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThey think, \u2018well, for the political gain, it\u2019s worth it to do that,'\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd it certainly isn\u2019t a big deal. I keep saying \u2014 you know, they seem to be very strategic at the White House \u2014 do some of these things that are good politically but really don\u2019t affect the underlying policy \u2014 that defend the underlying policy. Like, no chance, no way are we going to roll back the individual mandate or anything like that. And so I think that\u2019s part of the strategy.\u201d\n\nWagner seemed a little stunned. \u201cWell, I guess I gotta play devil\u2019s advocate for a second here, Zeke,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause to be honest, it does seem, sort of, transparently political that they would do this ahead of the midterm elections when we know the White House is very concerned about Democrats holding on to their Senate seats.\u201d She also expressed concern over Americans who would be stuck with substandard plans because of the delay.\n\n\u201cI agree with you, Alex,\u201d Emanuel claimed. \u201cI don\u2019t like these substandard plans, I\u2019ve been a very big critic of them. I was a critic of the initial delay. I\u2019m not advocating this delay. I think it\u2019s understandable, and I also think it doesn\u2019t go to the heart of the Affordable Care Act and making sure it really impacts the American healthcare system. But you know, I agree.\u201d\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
