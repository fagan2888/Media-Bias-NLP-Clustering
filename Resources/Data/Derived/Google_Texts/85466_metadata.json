Obese women should gain even less.\n\nGaining too much weight is tied to an increased risk of complications for both mother and child, according to the researchers, who completed the review for The Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research.\n\nFor the new review, the researchers examined data from 65 randomized controlled trials, which are considered the \"gold standard\" of medical research. They were able to combine data from 49 trials involving a total of 11,444 pregnant women.\n\nThe women were randomly assigned to a diet, exercise, a combination of the two or standard care. The diets and exercise programs varied, but could include low-glycemic diets and unsupervised exercise.\n\nWomen who took part in diet, exercise or combination programs were about 20 percent less likely than women in standard-care groups to gain too much weight while pregnant, the researchers report.\n\nThe women who took part in diet, exercise and combination programs were also less likely to develop high blood pressure during pregnancy, compared to those in the standard care group.\n\nThere was no clear benefit among the women in the diet and exercise groups when the researchers looked at other complications, such as cesarean delivery, but it did look like there may be some benefit, they write.\n\nWhile the new study generally did not show fewer complications in the diet and exercise group, Dr. Loralei Thornburg told Reuters Health that it's good that there was no increase in complications.\n\n\"This was very reassuring that there wasn\u2019t an increased risk of preterm birth with moderate exercise,\" said Thornburg, a high-risk pregnancy expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.\n\n\"Most people gain more weight than they probably should during pregnancy,\" Thornburg, who was not involved with the review, told Reuters Health.\n\nShe said women who gain too much weight may not be able to lose it after the baby is born. Then, during the next pregnancy the woman is already heavier and that may increase the risk of complications.\n\n\"In the next pregnancy, if you don\u2019t get it off, you may go from obese to very obese,\" Thornburg said.\n\nShe cautioned, however, that women should check with their doctors before starting a diet and exercise program during pregnancy.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1C3lYDc The Cochrane Library, online June 11, 2015.\n\n(By Andrew M.
