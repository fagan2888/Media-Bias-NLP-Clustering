He had a monkey named Bubbles and some kind of oxygen chamber and he used to be black but he made himself white and he was nuts. That was Michael Jackson in full. Wacko Jacko. After all, as a kid, you know you are changing, but the world seems static. If Michael Jackson is crazy it is inconceivable that he was ever not crazy in the same way it\u2019s hard to imagine your parents as children because they\u2019ve always been so old. One of the hardest lessons of childhood is reckoning with the instability of the world. And the earlier it comes, through death or divorce or whatever upheaval that can be visited on children, the harder it is to take. Maybe that\u2019s all it is to grow up in the end. This is what I was thinking about, anyway, when Michael Jackson died: not what he meant to me but what he became to us. I realized that I had never stopped thinking about him the way he seemed to me in elementary school; that he wasn\u2019t immutably crazy, but a sick man getting sicker: a weird, possibly demented and heinous man, falling apart over many years, wrecking his face and body, all the while a subject of fascination and ridicule.\n\nWe made it a joke because it became normal. The trials. The surgeries. The accusations. The scandals. Michael Jackson\u2019s insanity stopped being insane to us and it turned us coarse and awful. Related Story 32 Republicans Who Caused the Government Shutdown Yes, there are two types of public insanity. There are the breakdowns. Amanda Bynes. Charlie Sheen. Britney Spears. Eruptions of paranoia or mania or rage that spill into view and elicit a balance of concern, scorn, judgment, pity. We don\u2019t handle these moments well, let\u2019s not kid ourselves, but never do these events fade into the scenery. We see it and we point to it. That is broken. That person needs help. This can\u2019t go on. But then there is the more insidious crazy. The slow-boil crazy. The Michael Jackson crazy. The crazy that we accept as routine, that changes so slowly that we fail to recognize when we have accepted what should be appalling, when we have desensitized ourselves to something dark and horrible: when we have become insane ourselves. The same happens in our politics. There are of course the psychotic breaks. Fits of idiocy, depravity, zeal. When a president takes advantage of an intern in the Oval Office or makes false claims about enriched uranium in the State of the Union. When a block of cash is found in the freezer of a congressman or the Supreme Court stops a vote count and says, \u201cOur consideration is limited to the present circumstances.\u201d These are events that stop us in our tracks. But the stopping matters. The stopping saves us from ourselves. Then there is the other crazy, the crazy that creeps up on you, like a messy house that fills with junk until one day you\u2019re a hoarder. The Republican elite caught a ride on the tiger. But the tiger got sick of waiting for the gazelles it was promised. So the tiger ate its master and now here we are. The proliferation of horserace political coverage is of this brand of lunacy, where the presumption is that a political act will be described on the basis of how it will be perceived, and this in turn determines how it is perceived because it\u2019s the only way it can be perceived. \u201cWill the president\u2019s statement hurt him?\u201d Yes, if the coverage asks that question, as the question about the hurt is the hurt, which is how we know it hurts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The current moment in politics came about slowly, not suddenly, but it doesn&#39;t make it any less of a national emergency.", "author": "Jon Lovett", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The current moment in politics came about slowly, not suddenly, but it doesn&#39;t make it any less of a national emergency.", "title": "How the GOP Slowly Went Insane", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/10/systemisbrokebannerreutersjpg/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/10/How-the-GOP-Slowly-Went-Completely-Insane/280614/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9bbb\"", "article_summary": "The Michael Jackson crazy.\nThis is what I was thinking about, anyway, when Michael Jackson died: not what he meant to me but what he became to us.\nGary Cameron/Reuters When I was a kid, all I knew about Michael Jackson was that he was crazy.\nThat was Michael Jackson in full.\nMichael Jackson\u2019s insanity stopped being insane to us and it turned us coarse and awful."}
