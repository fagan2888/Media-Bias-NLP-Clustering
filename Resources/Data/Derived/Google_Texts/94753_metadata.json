But we\u2019ve been careful not to join some of our friends in predicting inflation from the Fed\u2019s postcrisis policies,\u201d they write in a Friday editorial called Bernanke\u2019s Rebuttal.\n\nA free-market champion critical of the Fed\u2019s hyper-easy monetary policy, the journal\u2019s editorial page mocks Bernanke as being thin-skinned and says he should \u201cstop blaming everyone else\u201d for the Fed\u2019s failure to restore U.S. growth and employment to historical levels.\n\nInstead, the Journal editorial calls for somewhat higher interest rates\u2014the key fed funds rate is now near zero\u2014that returns monetary policy to normal and \u201clets markets set rates and allocate capital.\u201d\n\nThe editorial page has repeatedly argued that ultralow rate makes it harder for individuals and businesses to determine the true cost of spending and investment and that is can lead to excessive risk- taking or speculation. You know, the same things that caused the Great Recession in the first place.\n\nThe page also took issue with Bernanke\u2019s insistence that the Fed\u2019s easy-money approach is largely responsible for pushing the U.S. unemployment rate down to 5.5% from a postrecession peak of 10%. Bernanke noted that \u201cjob creation in the United States has outstripped that of other industrial countries by a wide margin.\u201d Read Bernanke\u2019s Blog\n\nThe editorial page points out that the steep drop in unemployment has occurred at the same time that millions of Americans have stopped looking for work, reducing the so-called labor-force participation rate to a 37-year low.\n\n\u201cThe jobless rate would still be close to 8%\u201d if the participation rate had remained steady, the editorial argued.\n\nWho\u2019s right? Who knows? History will ultimately be the judge, though a verdict is probably years away.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Wall Street critics", "creator": "@jbartash", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BV129_aug5_b_MG_20140221142328.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Jeffry Bartash", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Wall Street critics", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/snarky-ben-bernanke-blog-draws-return-fire-from-wall-street-critics-2015-05-01", "author": "Jeffry Bartash", "parsely-title": "Snarky Ben Bernanke blog draws return fire from Wall Street critics", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-05-01T12:04:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Wall Street critics", "title": "Snarky Ben Bernanke blog draws return fire from Wall Street critics", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/snarky-ben-bernanke-blog-draws-return-fire-from-wall-street-critics-2015-05-01", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BV129_aug5_b_MG_20140221142328.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BV129_aug5_b_MG_20140221142328.jpg"}, "article.id": "26E042A8-F019-11E4-87F5-424A34AEBE7E", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Editorial writers at The Wall Street Journal fired back at Bernanke after the ex-central banker on Thursday accused them of consistently being wrong about their predictions of higher inflation since 2006.\n\u201cThe jobless rate would still be close to 8%\u201d if the participation rate had remained steady, the editorial argued.\nWASHINGTON (MarketWatch)\u2014Note to former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke: Be careful about starting flame wars with people who buy ink by the barrel\u2014or who have bigger servers than you do.\nThe page also took issue with Bernanke\u2019s insistence that the Fed\u2019s easy-money approach is largely responsible for pushing the U.S. unemployment rate down to 5.5% from a postrecession peak of 10%.\nBut we\u2019ve been careful not to join some of our friends in predicting inflation from the Fed\u2019s postcrisis policies,\u201d they write in a Friday editorial called Bernanke\u2019s Rebuttal."}
