Health and Human Services Sec. Aldona Wos may be feeling the heat over the statewide scrutiny of high salaries given to top employees.\n\nThe department sent out an infographic today in a press release highlighting what DHHS sees as its top accomplishments. This came a few days after Wos sent a letter to several legislators defending her performance running the state\u2019s largest agency.\n\nThe press release sent Wednesday was light on specifics, with no links to where the facts and figured were pulled from. I\u2019ve asked DHHS for the back-up data used for the infographics and will update this post if and when I hear back.\n\nOn a few of the points, the $22 million in free and low-cost prescription drugs refers to a $773,728 grant the department got in August from the Kate B. Reynolds Charitable Trust. DHHS staff will help low-income patients apply to pharmaceutical companies for an estimated $22 million in donated and reduced-cost medicines.\n\nThe reference to the Office of the Internal Auditor is a plan from Wos to expand the number of auditors in the agency from eight to 40 positions, and the 2,500 \u201cadded\u201d pre-K slots was a legislative decision that offset the scheduled expiration of 5,000 other slots. The state will end up with 2,500 less pre-kindergarten slots for low-income children this year in the state.\n\nAs one would expect, there was no mention in the DHHS graphic of recent controversies that have stung Wos and DHHS \u2013 problems with the state\u2019s new delivery systems for food stamps and Medicaid payments and criticism over high salaries of young staffers and $228,000 one Wos adviser has gotten for eight months of work.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7c1\"", "article_summary": "The press release sent Wednesday was light on specifics, with no links to where the facts and figured were pulled from.\nThe department sent out an infographic today in a press release highlighting what DHHS sees as its top accomplishments.\nThis came a few days after Wos sent a letter to several legislators defending her performance running the state\u2019s largest agency.\nDHHS staff will help low-income patients apply to pharmaceutical companies for an estimated $22 million in donated and reduced-cost medicines.\nThe state will end up with 2,500 less pre-kindergarten slots for low-income children this year in the state."}
