Both U.S. senators from Kansas, Jerry Moran and Pat Roberts, voted against the Freedom Act, albeit for different reasons.\n\n\u201cSenator Roberts voted against the USA Freedom Act because it will not improve the safety and security of the American people,\u201d said Sarah Little, the Republican senator\u2019s communications director. \u201cThe Act will damage our capability to protect Americans from threats.\u201d\n\nWhile Roberts argued the Freedom Act went too far in reforming the NSA, Moran suggested Tuesday that it didn\u2019t go far enough.\n\n\u201cI am concerned with our government\u2019s domestic data collection practices and invasion of Americans\u2019 privacy,\u201d Moran, a Republican, said in a statement. \u201cCongress should provide the U.S. intelligence community with the tools and resources necessary to reduce national security risks, but the USA Freedom Act fails to provide the reforms needed to safeguard individual rights while at the same time not increasing the security of Americans.\u201d\n\nMoran said limited debate in the Senate \u201cfailed to yield meaningful reform legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cEffective intelligence gathering does not have to come at the expense of civil liberties,\u201d Moran said. \u201cCongress must stop waiting until the last minute to address the pressing issues facing our nation.\u201d\n\nThe legislation was signed into law Tuesday night by President Barack Obama, who had voiced his support for the bill and had called on the Senate to approve it before midnight Sunday.\n\n\u201cGlad the Senate finally passed the USA Freedom Act,\u201d the president said on Twitter. \u201cIt protects civil liberties and our national security.\u201d\n\nBefore the final vote was taken, a cloture motion passed 83-14, despite nay votes from both Roberts and Moran. Cloture, which requires 60 votes for passage, is a procedural measure allowing senators to begin considering and amending a House bill.\n\nWhat followed was a trio of failed amendments by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to roll back the reforms in the House bill. In each case, Moran voted against the amendments and Roberts voted in favor.\n\nTuesday\u2019s action follows an uncommon Sunday session of the Senate that didn\u2019t result in the last-minute reauthorization many Patriot Act supporters had hoped for, forcing an expiration of three Patriot Act provisions at midnight Sunday. Before adjourning Sunday night, the Senate passed cloture 77-17 with all 17 votes in opposition cast by Republicans, including Roberts and Moran.\n\nIn the House, the Freedom Act garnered an array of different opinions from the state\u2019s four House members, all Republicans.\n\nReps. Tim Huelskamp and Kevin Yoder voted against the Freedom Act, arguing it didn\u2019t go far enough to curtail the NSA. Rep. Lynn Jenkins voted in favor of the bill, saying it struck a balance between the dual needs of national security and civil liberties. Rep. Mike Pompeo, meanwhile, voted in favor of the Freedom Act but would have preferred a reauthorization of the Patriot Act that didn\u2019t hinder the power of federal law enforcement and intelligence officials.\n\n\u201cPeople in my party are saying the government is reading emails and listening to phone calls without a warrant. That\u2019s just not true,\u201d Pompeo said this week. \u201cThey have misled the people of Kansas and the American people.\u201d\n\nThe Patriot Act has faced flak in recent years from some Democrats and libertarian Republicans after Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor, shed light on the NSA\u2019s vast surveillance programs in 2013.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, State, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "For the first time since the Sept.", "title": "Kansas Sens.
