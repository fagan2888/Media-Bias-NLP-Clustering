But opponents said the incident in Washington state shows that non-GMO farmers have to bear the burden and cost of any lost sales if their crops get contaminated, even at low levels. \u201cCo-existence is a myth,\u201d said Andrew Kimbrell, executive director for the Center for Food Safety, which sued USDA to try to stop its approval of biotech alfalfa. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to control contamination. They say biotech is just another tool in the toolbox. That is not true. It\u2019s a tool that takes over all the other tools and makes them worthless.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Washington state farmer's alfalfa crop tested positive for a genetically modified trait", "title": "Monsanto could get away with GMO contamination", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A Washington state farmer's alfalfa crop tested positive for a genetically modified trait", "title": "Monsanto could get away with GMO contamination", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/16/monsanto_could_get_away_with_gmo_contamination/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/shutterstock_148383890.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Washington state farmer's alfalfa crop tested positive for a genetically modified trait", "title": "Monsanto could get away with GMO contamination", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/shutterstock_148383890.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Agriculture, anti-gmos, Exports, GMO, Monsanto, USDA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3dd2\"", "article_summary": "The trait in question was developed by Monsanto Co. \u2014 it makes the plant resilient to a weed killer that\u2019s also produced by the company.\nTopics: Agriculture, anti-gmos, Exports, GMO, Monsanto, USDA, Sustainability News, Technology News, NewsWashington state agriculture officials confirmed that a farmer\u2019s alfalfa crop was contaminated with a genetically modified trait, a \u201clow-level\u201d presence that nonetheless has prevented him from exporting it.\n\u201cCo-existence is a myth,\u201d said Andrew Kimbrell, executive director for the Center for Food Safety, which sued USDA to try to stop its approval of biotech alfalfa.\nThe only question now is what the USDA is going to do about it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in discussion with the Washington State Department of Agriculture to determine what if any actions are warranted, what our next steps will be,\u201d said USDA spokesman Ed Curlett."}
