For the Minnesota Lynx, that was the year it all came together. Whalen, a healthy Seimone Augustus, a rookie named Maya Moore. All they did was win. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know any better,\u201d Whalen said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know any different.\u201d The Lynx won 27 games, surged through the playoffs and won their first WNBA title in a sweep.\n\nSeems like a long time ago. A year later the Lynx surged into the finals only to be upset by Indiana \u2014 their opponent again in this year\u2019s finals. A year after that the Lynx won another title.\n\nAnd now this: The Lynx, in their fourth finals in five seasons, on the cusp of establishing a legacy of dominance none of the players is ready to yet ponder, will look for their third title in five years starting Sunday at Target Center.\n\nIt\u2019s an opportunity to avenge that 2012 upset, an opportunity for a core group of players to celebrate, again.\n\nIf 2011 seemed so new, this time it feels so sweet.\n\n\u201cEach year we do this it becomes more special,\u201d Whalen said. \u201cIt\u2019s sweeter. Because you know how hard it is, you know how much you want it.\u201d\n\nThat can be said for both teams.\n\nThe Lynx will open the series with four of the five starters from that series with Indiana three years ago: Whalen, Moore, Augustus, Rebekkah Brunson. Indiana looks just as familiar. Forward Tamika Catchings, possibly the best motivator in league history, has said she\u2019ll retire in 2016. Guard Briann January is still with the Fever, as is Erlana Larkins, who came into her own in that series three years ago.\n\nIndeed, in an era where youth is trumpeted, this series is a throwback, with old vets rather than youngsters. The Lynx starters average 30.4 years of age, Indiana 29.2. The Lynx looking for a third title in five years, the fever a second in four seasons.\n\n\u201cThis is a series that fans need to appreciate what they see on the floor,\u201d said Rebecca Lobo, the former player who will be part of the ESPN broadcast crew. \u201cKnowing Catchings only has a season left; this might be her last finals. Knowing this Lynx team, as it is put together right now, may be changing in the coming years. \u2026 It will be a great series.\u201d\n\n\u2018A veteran\u2019s league\u2019\n\nBoth teams have faced obstacles to reach the finals. Augustus, who had knee surgery and a sprained left foot, missed 18 regular-season games. Whalen battled ankle soreness, missing the final few regular-season games. For Indiana, Catchings has dealt with a balky knee and Larkins was limited to 21 games by injuries.\n\nBoth fought through them.\n\nLynx coach Cheryl Reeve acknowledged that neither Augustus nor Whalen is likely to be 100 percent for this series. But the week off since the conference finals has helped.\n\nIndiana, meanwhile, is peaking at the right time, just like it did three years ago. Larkins is back in form, and Catchings is as impactful as ever.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see us all back here,\u201d Augustus said.\n\nBut then again, maybe not. Both teams have added new faces, both young and veteran, to supplement their depth. But both teams rely on a very familiar core group.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a veteran\u2019s league,\u201d Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said. \u201cThey understand the things it takes to win close games and to win playoff series. It\u2019s not a surprise to me to have vets who have carried their teams at this point.\u201d\n\nVets who know how to win.\n\n\u201cPlayers like Skylar Diggins, Elena Delle Donne? They\u2019re all great,\u201d Augustus said. \u201cBut they need to mature and grow. Where we\u2019re at right now is where they\u2019ll be in a couple of years.\u201d\n\nLegacy for later\n\nSo this matchup feels both familiar and special. The WNBA\u2019s old(er) guard in another finals matchup. The Lynx are looking to continue their habit of winning the title every other year. The Fever looking to become the first Eastern Conference team to win a game in the finals since 2012.\n\n\u201cYou never know how long a core group will stay together,\u201d said Indiana coach Stephanie White, who was Lin Dunn\u2019s assistant with the Fever in 2012. \u201cFor us to be sitting here, three years later, with so many familiar faces, it\u2019s a little bit of a surprise.\u201d\n\nOr, maybe, not. There is a reason why both teams are back in the finals, and the reasons start with the veterans who squared off in 2012.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s pretty cool that this is our fourth in five years,\u201d Whalen said. \u201cYou don\u2019t think about it now. Right now we\u2019re thinking about what we have to do, today. Tomorrow. Getting ready. You can enjoy that later.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "In 2011 it was all so new, Lindsay Whalen said.", "title": "Lynx and Fever meet in a finals that's about veterans, not youth", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/lynx-and-fever-meet-in-a-finals-that-s-about-veterans-not-youth/330536771/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/16LYNX102012_21528983.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/16LYNX102012_21528983.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "In 2011 it was all so new, Lindsay Whalen said.", "title": "Lynx and Fever meet in a finals that's about veterans, not youth", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/lynx-and-fever-meet-in-a-finals-that-s-about-veterans-not-youth/330536771/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/16LYNX102012_21528983.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/16LYNX102012_21528983.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "In 2011 it was all so new, Lindsay Whalen said."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2188\"", "article_summary": "A year later the Lynx surged into the finals only to be upset by Indiana \u2014 their opponent again in this year\u2019s finals.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know any different.\u201d The Lynx won 27 games, surged through the playoffs and won their first WNBA title in a sweep.\nThe Fever looking to become the first Eastern Conference team to win a game in the finals since 2012.\nLynx coach Cheryl Reeve acknowledged that neither Augustus nor Whalen is likely to be 100 percent for this series.\nThe Lynx will open the series with four of the five starters from that series with Indiana three years ago: Whalen, Moore, Augustus, Rebekkah Brunson."}
