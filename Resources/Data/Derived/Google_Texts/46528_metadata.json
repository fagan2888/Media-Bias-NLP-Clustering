The video also notes that families may have to change plans repeatedly because, as circumstances change, a plan that fits within a tier one year may not fit in any tier a later year.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nInsurance expert Pat Paule and I compared this requirement to a school where students with grades between 78 and 82 get a B; those between 88 and 92 get an A; but those between 82 and 88 or above 92 get an F. The student with a 98 isn\u2019t valedictorian \u2013 he has a failing grade and doesn\u2019t graduate. Under the new health care law, the most generous insurance policies aren\u2019t rewarded \u2013 they\u2019re labeled \u201csubpar\u201d and cancelled.\n\nMercatus affiliated scholar Chris Conover has noted that there is no technical reason for Congress to have included this particular provision in the law and suggested the cookie-cutter requirement may have been based on the assumption that Americans can\u2019t handle more than four plan designs when buying insurance.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on President Obama]\n\nThese waves of cancellations will bring real hardship to Americans. At the least, many will have to dive back into the exchange Websites which, despite their absence from the headlines, are still largely nonfunctional. Worse, for some Americans, the cancellations will mean changing doctors, interrupting coverage and losing continuity of care.\n\nFor those whose policies are cancelled, 2014 may be an especially difficult year. Enrollment was supposed to have begun in October, but opening day for the rush into the exchanges has been delayed until Nov. 15. That leaves about 30 days to compare plans and prices and successfully navigate the website. Unfortunately, the bizarre bands system adds yet another layer of difficulty and confusion for Americans trying to achieve better health.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Economic Intelligence [Opinion]", "title": "Under Obamacare, Americans Will Continue To Lose Coverage", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "There's another wave of Obamacare health plan cancellations on the way.", "title": "If You Like Your Plan, You Still Can't Keep It", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2014/09/22/under-obamacare-americans-will-continue-to-lose-coverage", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/43/4e/6be0e9174300bb70d81d8caa1655/20140722edstc-a.tif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There's another wave of Obamacare health plan cancellations on the way.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Under Obamacare, Americans Will Continue To Lose Coverage"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 22, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Robert F.
