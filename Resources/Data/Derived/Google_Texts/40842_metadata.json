Bruce Braley for the state\u2019s open Senate seat, and a win would instantly propel Ernst into the role of power-broker in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Ernst has been aided by a who\u2019s who roster of Republican presidential hopefuls in recent months, from Texas Gov. Rick Perry to Sen. Ted Cruz. But Sen. Marco Rubio may be the big beneficiary of her win. Rubio endorsed Ernst while she was locked in a tight primary battle this May, a move that helped bring her national attention and donors. Rubio\u2019s press secretary, Alex Conant, has been on leave from Rubio\u2019s Senate office for more than a month to assist Ernst\u2019s campaign in Iowa.\n\n\n\nFlorida Governor\n\nIt\u2019s Florida, after all. Tuesday\u2019s gubernatorial slugfest is one of this year\u2019s closest\u2014and most expensive\u2014nail-biters. A victory for Rick Scott or Charlie Crist means control of a perennial swing state, and one that has already decided a close presidential contest.\n\nWisconsin Governor\n\nScott Walker has been a favorite of the GOP\u2019s conservative base since his effort to rewrite his state\u2019s collective bargaining laws and became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre when Democrats attempted to recall him in 2012. Now Walker is fighting once again to retain his seat. Recent polls show him edging ahead of Democrat Mary Burke after a bitter and expensive campaign. If Walker loses, his 2016 hopes were little more than putting the cart before the horse. If he wins, he will have to decide whether he\u2019s ready for an even more grueling experience.\n\nOhio Governor\n\nJohn Kasich is on his way to a re-election rout in the Buckeye State this week, leading well into the double digits in the swingiest of swing states. His political rebound, after contentious efforts to reform the state\u2019s collective bargaining laws and expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, makes the margin all the more remarkable. Kasich\u2019s victory is sure to ignite calls for him to seriously consider a run for the White House in 2016. It would be the former House Budget Committee Chair\u2019s second run, following a short-lived effort in 2000.\n\nColorado\n\nThe state\u2019s Senate and gubernatorial races have razor-thin margins in polls, but Republicans have the momentum going into Election Day. Rep. Cory Gardner appears to have successfully handled off Sen. Mark Udall\u2019s \u201cwar on women\u201d-themed attacks, providing a model for other Republican candidates and exposing Democratic weakness in the Rockies. Colorado will be a central battleground in 2016, especially if a swing-state Republican wins the GOP nomination, and GOP gains could signal trouble for Democrats in two years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Florida to Colorado, the Senate and gubernatorial races on the ballot will have an effect on the 2016 presidential race.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The 2016 presidential candidates aren't on the ballot, but they'll be affected by the results.", "title": "What Tuesday's Results Mean for 2016 Candidates", "url": "http://time.com/3555393/2014-midterms-elections-presidential-2016/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/489067391.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/489067391.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The 2016 presidential candidates aren't on the ballot, but they'll be affected by the results.", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What Tuesday's Results Mean for 2016 Candidates"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "iowa, wisconsin, florida, colorado, ohio, 2014 elections, 2016 elections", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time", "author": "https://facebook.com/zekejmiller"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iowa, Wisconsin, Florida, Colorado, Ohio, 2014 elections, 2016 elections"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb0d2\"", "article_summary": "ColoradoThe state\u2019s Senate and gubernatorial races have razor-thin margins in polls, but Republicans have the momentum going into Election Day.\nWednesday marks the official start of the 2016 election, but that doesn\u2019t mean Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections don\u2019t matter to the presidential race.\nErnst has been aided by a who\u2019s who roster of Republican presidential hopefuls in recent months, from Texas Gov.\nColorado will be a central battleground in 2016, especially if a swing-state Republican wins the GOP nomination, and GOP gains could signal trouble for Democrats in two years.\nKasich\u2019s victory is sure to ignite calls for him to seriously consider a run for the White House in 2016."}
