We\u2019re thrilled to be LEAP\u2019s co-pilot in this endeavor.\u201d\n\nThe new center offers a wide range of prevention programs targeting asthma, diabetes, and heart disease, as well as nutrition programs to promote healthy eating and prevent obesity. The Community Leadership Center at Rutgers University\u2013Camden connects the health center to other support services including programs for parents, social services, and family support initiatives. Dyanne Westerberg, chair and chief of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at Cooper University Health Care, will serve as a collaborating physician for the center and medical director for the LEAP Academy.\n\n\u201cWhat makes us unique is that we\u2019ll be immersed and embedded in this school community and we\u2019ll be in a position to intervene in health issues early while giving tools to our students to allow them to make healthy choices,\u201d says Nancy Pontes, director of the Rutgers/LEAP Health and Wellness Center and assistant dean of faculty practice at the Rutgers School of Nursing\u2013Camden.\n\nThe center is open on Tuesdays and Thursdays until it becomes a fully state-licensed center this fall, when it will be open five days a week. It accepts Medicare, Medicaid, and most private insurance carriers. Uninsured patients can pay out of pocket and the center will help them apply for coverage through the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"msvalidate.01": "24A0C96AF1E5CCB0C6FFF95B7B23DD8E", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6f6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is another breakthrough for southern New Jersey and for Camden,\u201d Robinson said during a special grand opening of the Rutgers/LEAP Health and Wellness center.\nThe Community Leadership Center at Rutgers University\u2013Camden connects the health center to other support services including programs for parents, social services, and family support initiatives.\nThe Rutgers/LEAP Health and Wellness Center, located inside LEAP\u2019s Lower School on Cooper Street, is being staffed by Rutgers University\u2013Camden nursing faculty and offers basic primary care services, including vaccinations, immunizations, wellness exams, and physicals.\n\u201cFor the Rutgers School of Nursing\u2013Camden, this school-based health and wellness center at LEAP is a launching pad for faculty practice; for exceptional undergraduate and graduate clinical teaching; and for learning and research.\nSchool-based health centers not only enable children with acute or chronic illness to attend school and receive on-site care, but also improve their overall health and wellness through health screenings and disease prevention activities."}
