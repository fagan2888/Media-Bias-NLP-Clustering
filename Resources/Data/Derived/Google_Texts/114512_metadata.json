Very upset. Frustrated and angry. Seething about the government\u2019s handling of Ebola, the front-page headline in The New York Times read last Saturday.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem with this pose, so obligingly transcribed for him by the Times. It\u2019s his government. He is the president and has been for six years. But President Barack Obama reflexively insists on playing the shocked outsider when something goes wrong within his own administration.\n\nIRS? \u201cIt\u2019s inexcusable, and Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it,\u201d he thundered in May 2013, when the story broke about the agency targeting conservative groups. \u201cI will not tolerate this kind of behavior in any agency, but especially in the IRS.\u201d\n\nExcept that within nine months Obama has grown far more tolerant, retroactively declaring this to be a phony scandal without \u201ca smidgen of corruption.\u201d\n\nObamacare rollout? \u201cNobody is more frustrated by that than I am,\u201d an aggrieved Obama said about the botching of the central element of his signature legislative achievement. \u201cNobody is madder than me.\u201d\n\nVeterans Affairs scandal? Presidential Chief of Staff Denis McDonough explained: \u201cSecretary [Eric] Shinseki said yesterday \u2026 that he\u2019s mad as hell and the president is madder than hell.\u201d A nice touch \u2014 taking anger to the next level.\n\n\u201cI will not stand for it,\u201d the president himself declared. But because the administration itself said the problem was long-standing, indeed predating Obama, this means he had stood for it for 5\u00bd years.\n\nThe one scandal where you could credit the president with genuine anger and obliviousness involves the recent breaches of White House Secret Service protection. The Washington Post described the first lady and president as \u201cangry and upset,\u201d and no doubt they were. But the first Secret Service scandal \u2014 the hookers of Cartagena \u2014 evinced this from the president: \u201cIf it turns out that some of the allegations that have been made in the press are confirmed, then of course I\u2019ll be angry.\u201d An innovation in ostentatious distancing \u2014 future conditional indignation.\n\nThese shows of calculated outrage \u2014 and thus distance \u2014 are becoming not just unconvincing but unamusing. In our system, the president is head of state and head of government. Obama seems to enjoy the monarchical parts. But when it comes to the actual business of running government, he shows little interest and even less aptitude.\n\nHis principal job, after all, is to administer the government and to get the right people to do it. (That\u2019s why we typically send governors rather than senators to the White House.) That\u2019s called management. Obama never managed anything before running for the biggest management job on earth. It shows.\n\nWhat makes the problem even more acute is that Obama represents not just the party of government but a grandiose conception of government as the prime mover of social and economic life. The very theme of his presidency is that government can and should be trusted to do great things. And therefore society should be prepared to hand over large chunks of its operations \u2014 from health care (one-sixth of the economy) to carbon regulation down to free contraception \u2014 to the central administrative state.\n\nBut this presupposes a Leviathan not just benign but competent. When it then turns out that vast, faceless bureaucracies tend to be incapable, inadequate, hopelessly inefficient and often corrupt, Obama resorts to expressions of angry surprise.\n\nHe must. He\u2019s not simply protecting his own political fortunes. He\u2019s trying to protect faith in the entitlement state by portraying its repeated failures as shocking anomalies.\n\nUnfortunately, the pretense has the opposite effect. It produces not reassurance but anxiety. Obama\u2019s determined detachment conveys the feeling that nobody\u2019s home. No one leading. Not even from behind.\n\nA poll conducted two weeks ago showed 64 percent of likely voters \u2014 in competitive races \u2014 think \u201cthings in the U.S. feel like they are out of control.\u201d This is one degree of anxiety beyond thinking the country is on the wrong track. That\u2019s been negative for years, and it\u2019s a reflection of failed policies that in principle can be changed. Regaining control, on the other hand, is a far dicier proposition.\n\nWith events in the saddle and a sense of disorder growing \u2014 the summer border crisis, Ferguson, the rise of the Islamic State, Ebola \u2014 the nation expects from the White House not miracles but competence. At a minimum, mere presence. An observer presidency with its bewildered-bystander pose only adds to the unease.\n\nCharles Krauthammer is a columnist for The Washington Post.
