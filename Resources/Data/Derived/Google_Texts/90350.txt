On Oct. 9, I went to one of my favorite spots around, Rabbit Mountain Open Space. This morning was particularly beautiful, with the setting full moon and the first rays of dawn casting an exquisite light over the landscape.

When we arrived back at the parking lot, I was surprised and dismayed to find a $60 parking ticket on my car. I learned that parking at Boulder County Parks and Open Space is restricted to the hours between sunrise and sunset.

This may not be a problem for most of the year, but for at least a few weeks, it seems as though these restrictions punish people who want to get in a run, hike or ride before they go to work. Because even though the time of sunrise and sunset may change, school and work hours do not. For the next two weeks, it will be impossible for me to go to Rabbit Mountain (or any other Open Space park), before 7 a.m, because even though it is light, the sun doesn't officially rise until after 7 a.m.

Advertisement This is one of the most restrictive parking policies for open space in the area. Our neighboring National Park has no restrictions on parking or hiking- users may access trails and parking areas around the clock. Douglas and Jefferson counties have more reasonable hours than Boulder â€” parking is allowed from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset.

I would suggest that Boulder County Commissioners change this policy to allow parking from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset. This change would allow the active citizens of Boulder County more time to enjoy the natural resources that make Boulder such a desirable place to live, and which are supported by our tax dollars.
