LOS ANGELES (AP) — Uggie, the Jack Russell terrier who became a canine star for his scene-stealing role in the Oscar-winning movie “The Artist,” has died.

His owner, animal trainer Omar Von Muller, said Wednesday that Uggie was euthanized Friday after a bout with prostate cancer. The dog was 13.

In “The Artist,” Uggie played the canine companion to Jean Dujardin’s fading silent-film star. The movie won Academy Awards for Best Picture, lead actor and director in 2011.

Uggie’s other credits included the films “Water for Elephants” and “Mr. Fix It.”

He retired in 2012 in a ceremony at the famous Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, where he became the first dog to leave his paw prints in concrete alongside the prints of human stars.
