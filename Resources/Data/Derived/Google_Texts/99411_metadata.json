Mary Fallin\u2019s favor in a dispute with the news media over the openness of records.\n\nThe judge ruled the governor can lawfully withhold from the public documents covered by a deliberative process privilege.\n\nAt issue in the dispute are 31 documents about a 2011 decision involving Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe court finds the deliberative process privilege is recognized under common law in Oklahoma, and it is supported by Supreme Court rule as an exception to the Oklahoma Open Records Act,\u201d District Judge Barbara Swinton ruled.\n\n\u201cThe court finds the deliberative process privilege thus may be used by the defendant to protect the content of the documents withheld.\u201d\n\nAn appeal is expected eventually.\n\n\u201cThis is only the beginning of our work and we look forward to the next steps in the process to ensure that our client and the people of Oklahoma have the transparency they are afforded by the law,\u201d said Ryan Kiesel, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma.\n\nThe ACLU of Oklahoma last year sued the governor for the records, on behalf of The Lost Ogle, a satirical online news site.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased by the court\u2019s ruling,\u201d said Alex Weintz, a spokesman for the governor.\n\nHe said the ruling is expected to be \u201cjust the first step in a longer legal process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governor welcomes the chance to resolve this issue in court and provide clarity as to the provisions and limits of the Open Records Act,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\n\u201cWhile the legal process plays out, our office continues to be committed to transparency and openness. We have, to date, released over 100,000 pages of documents in response to open records requests, more than all other Oklahoma governors combined,\u201d Weintz also said.\n\nFallin in 2011 rejected a $54 million federal grant that would have paid for the creation of an online exchange, or marketplace, in Oklahoma for purchasing private health insurance plans.\n\nThe governor rejected it after opposition surfaced to establishing the exchange, one of the key components to the new federal health care law known as Obamacare.\n\nFallin in March 2012 released more than 51,000 pages of documents about her decision in response to open records requests from The Oklahoman, The Associated Press and other news organizations.\n\nShe withheld 31 documents totaling 100 pages. Her general counsel claimed those pages were exempt from the state Open Records Act on the grounds of executive privilege, deliberative process privilege and attorney-client privilege.\n\nBrady Henderson, the legal director of the ACLU in Oklahoma, interpreted Tuesday\u2019s ruling as a partial victory.\n\n\u201cThe governor went into court with three privileges and she\u2019s come out with one,\u201d he said. \u201cThe court said, \u2018There\u2019s not constitutional or statutory authority for executive privilege. I\u2019m not going to recognize it.\u2019 Likewise, she does not recognize any properly asserted attorney-client privilege ... so she effectively rejects two of the three arguments by the governor.\u201d\n\nThe judge noted in her five-page order that the main purpose of the deliberative process privilege \u201cis to ensure that subordinates within an agency will feel free to provide the decision maker with their uninhibited opinions and recommendations without fear of later being subjected to public ridicule or criticism.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear Tuesday if the governor claimed the deliberative process privilege on all of the 31 withheld documents.\n\nThe judge gave the governor 20 days to prepare a log listing what privilege was asserted for each document.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
