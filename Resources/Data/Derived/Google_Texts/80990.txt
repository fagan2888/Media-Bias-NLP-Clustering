Bison from Wind Cave National Park are scheduled to be transferred to preserves in South Dakota and other states to help form new or boost existing herds.

The National Park Service says about 70 bison are part of this year's relocation effort. The bison transferred out of state are going to Missouri, Iowa, Kansas and Illinois.

The transfers are allowed under an agreement between the Park Service and The Nature Conservancy.

Wind Cave's bison herd is known for its high levels of genetic purity and diversity.

The approximately 70 animals set to be transferred will be among the dozens of bison that will be blood tested Tuesday. The park tests the bison every year. The animals also get an ear tag and are weighed and measured.
