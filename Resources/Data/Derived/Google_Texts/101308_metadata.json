Dewhurst to Texas GOP: Don't get complacent\n\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said here on Saturday that Texas could turn blue if Republicans get \u201ccomplacent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re complacent, yeah, it could happen,\u201d said Dewhurst, who last year lost to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the state\u2019s GOP Senate primary.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDewhurst, speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, said efforts to flip the deep-red Lone Star State to the Democrats probably wouldn\u2019t be successful \u201ctoday,\u201d but could eventually pan out. The state is home to Battleground Texas, an effort to turn the state blue led by Obama veterans.\n\nElections are \u201cdecided by who turns out,\u201d Dewhurst said. \u201cAnd increasingly we\u2019re seeing fewer and fewer people turn out for our elections. So if the Democrats get all of their base turned out and our base is complacent, you know, we could have a problem.\u201d\n\nBut he offered an unequivocal \u201cno\u201d when asked whether the likely GOP gubernatorial nominee, Greg Abbott, was threatened by Democratic State Sen.
