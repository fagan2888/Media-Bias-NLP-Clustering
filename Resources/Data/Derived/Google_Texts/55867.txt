Kasich stated, [relevant exchange begins around 1:50] “I’m not for Obamacare, and I didn’t join forces with the president. All I know is that Ronald Reagan expanded Medicaid, I think about three times. And I had a chance to bring Ohio money back to Ohio, and to me it’s a conservative principle, Ed. It’s not just to help people, but it’s to get them trained, to hold them personally responsible for what they do, and to get them on their feet.”
