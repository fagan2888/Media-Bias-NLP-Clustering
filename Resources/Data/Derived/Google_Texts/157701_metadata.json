(AP) - The newly elected chairwoman of the Eastern Pequot Tribe says her people will never abandon their quest to receive federal recognition.\n\nKatherine Sebastian Dring was the only candidate for the top leadership position in Saturday\u2019s tribal elections, The Day reported (http://bit.ly/1Ip2FdC) Sunday. Dennis Jenkins did not seek re-election to the council. Four vacancies remain open.\n\nAbout 80 tribal members attended the vote at the tribe\u2019s annual meeting at its longhouse, Sebastian Dring said, and members are confident they can still regain federal recognition.\n\n\u201cFor native people, the cause is never-ending,\u201d she said shortly after her election. \u201cWe will never give up.\u201d\n\nThe Eastern Pequots began pursuing federal recognition in the 1970s. But The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs dropped a provision last month allowing three state-recognized tribes in Connecticut - the Eastern Pequots, Schaghticokes and Golden Hill Paugussetts - to reapply for recognition.\n\nConnecticut has two federally recognized tribes, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and the Mohegan Tribe.\n\nSebastian Dring said the tribe originally pursued recognition to secure federal aid for health, education and housing programs and possible economic development. The Eastern Pequots won recognition in 2002 but it was withdrawn three years later when the state and Ledyard, North Stonington and Preston objected.\n\nThe tribe has between 1,100 and 1,200 members, but only about 30 live on the reservation, Sebastian Dring said.\n\n\u201cPrimarily, that\u2019s because most of the reservation is undeveloped,\u201d she said. \u201cNo paved roads, no electrical service, no water service. The tribal members who live there have had to pull family resources together to put in wells and whatever else they need. It\u2019s tough, so we hope to be able to put that infrastructure in place.\u201d\n\nShe said the tribe overwhelmingly endorsed the initial phase of a development project that calls for a cultural center and eventually tribal housing.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Day, http://www.theday.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The newly elected chairwoman of the Eastern Pequot Tribe says her people will never abandon their quest to receive federal recognition.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/26/eastern-pequot-tribe-to-still-pursue-federal-recog/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The newly elected chairwoman of the Eastern Pequot Tribe says her people will never abandon their quest to receive federal recognition.", "title": "Leader: Eastern Pequots still pursuing federal recognition"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "The newly elected chairwoman of the Eastern Pequot Tribe says her people will never abandon their quest to receive federal recognition.", "card": "summary", "title": "Leader: Eastern Pequots still pursuing federal recognition"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe will never give up.\u201dThe Eastern Pequots began pursuing federal recognition in the 1970s.\nThe Eastern Pequots won recognition in 2002 but it was withdrawn three years later when the state and Ledyard, North Stonington and Preston objected.\nNORTH STONINGTON, Conn.
