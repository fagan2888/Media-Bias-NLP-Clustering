Rick Perry on Thursday proposed a partnership between Texas health care providers and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs that would help reduce backlogs at VA facilities by expanding health care options for veterans in the state.\n\nDuring an appearance at Fort Hood, Perry announced efforts to identify Texas hospitals willing to take more patients from backlogged VA facilities.\n\n\u201cThere is no greater charge than taking care of those who have served in our nation\u2019s Armed Forces, which is why we are working to offer alternatives for veterans who have found their federal options lacking, or worse, nonexistent,\u201d Perry said at a groundbreaking for a new medical facility specializing in mental health treatment.\n\nPerry also proposed reimbursement for participating Texas hospitals through Medicare so providers are paid more quickly.\n\nSeveral of the largest health systems in Texas - some of which already accept VA patients - have signed onto the idea, according to Perry aides. Perry\u2019s plans would require the federal government\u2019s approval.\n\nAlso Thursday, officials with the Texas Veterans Commission announced they are looking at setting up \u201cstate strike force teams\u201d that would help with delays in access to health care. These teams of counselors would work with veterans on getting them quicker access to health care.\n\nThe U.S. Senate and House this week have passed bills making it easier for veterans who have encountered delays getting initial visits to receive VA-paid treatment from local doctors instead. Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Perry\u2019s proposal to the Veteran Affairs Department builds on those measures by identifying hospitals \u201cwilling to step up\u201d and offering a solution to slow reimbursements for providers.\n\nFederal data released this week showed that VA facilities in Texas have some of the longest wait times for veterans trying to see a doctor for the first time. The FBI has launched an investigation into the Veteran Affairs Department amid allegations of falsified records and inappropriate scheduling practices.\n\nVeterans aren\u2019t supposed to wait more than 14 days for an appointment, but a national audit this week stated that\u2019s \u201cnot attainable,\u201d given growing demand for VA services and poor planning.\n\nAmong providers that have bought into the plan proposed by Perry are Baylor Scott and White, Christus Health and hospitals and clinics operated by the University of North Texas and University of Texas systems, Nashed said.\n\nChristus Health spokeswoman Abby McNeil said their system that operates more than 40 hospitals and facilities in Texas and beyond has difficulties getting reimbursed for VA patients. Christus now has a backlog of 1,500 claims across Texas that are more than 30 days late in being paid, she said, adding that the system has sought help from Texas\u2019 congressional delegation.\n\nThe idea for the \u201cstrike force teams\u201d was discussed during a meeting in Houston Thursday of the state Senate Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee.\n\nThe teams would be similar to ones set up in 2012 to deal with disability claims backlogs at VA facilities in the state.\n\nState Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, who chairs the committee, said she has asked the Texas Veterans Commission to create a plan within the next two weeks for the new teams.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, Georgia Barraza, told committee members about delays her father, George Barraza, 59, encountered in trying to get medical care at a VA facility in Houston. She said her father died in April as he waited for a June appointment to get treatment for liver cancer.\n\n\u201cI just feel if my dad had money, private insurance, maybe he would have been diagnosed. Maybe he would be here today. I don\u2019t feel he was taken care of in the way he should have been,\u201d Barraza said.\n\n___\n\nLozano reported from Houston.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
