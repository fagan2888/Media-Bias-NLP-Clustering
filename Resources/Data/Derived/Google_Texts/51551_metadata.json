It requires debunking.\n\nMooney\u2019s article begins with the Republican party\u2019s frankly bizarre campaign against birth control coverage. Regarding the \u201cLittle Sisters of the Poor\u201d case, Mooney claims that, under the Affordable Care Act, the religious order \u201cis forced to provide [birth control] to their employees.\u201d\n\nThat is false, full stop.\n\nThere is no ambiguity, or wiggle room, or doubt about it. The law clearly states that any religious organization desiring not to provide birth control simply has to say so by filing a form or sending a letter and it will be exempted from the requirement to provide that kind of coverage. Virtually any source on the subject confirms this accommodation exists, but Mooney clearly is not interested in facts.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy, who provided the fifth vote in the Hobby Lobby decision, wrote admiringly of this accommodation the law provides religious organizations, stating:\n\nThe accommodation works by requiring insurance companies to cover, without cost sharing, contraception coverage for female employees who wish it. That accommodation equally furthers the government\u2019s interest but does not impinge on the plaintiffs\u2019 religious beliefs.\n\nIf a religious organization wants to opt out of the ACA\u2019s rule that women are entitled to birth control coverage, all the organization has to do is say so. The ACA then arranges for those women, who have a constitutionally-protected right to use birth control, to get coverage without any contribution from the religious organization. Mooney\u2019s claim that the Sisters are forced to provide the contraception is the opposite of the truth. A correction should be run.\n\nIn the Supreme Court, the religious organizations are arguing that because their employees will still get birth control coverage (from a third-party) after they opt-out, they are somehow \u201cinvolved\u201d and that this violates their conscience. It\u2019s an extremely weak argument that is far more political than it is religious. After all, employees can spend their money, earned working for a religious organization on birth control (or gambling, or alcohol, etc.) and no one takes seriously the idea that the religious organization has a right to prevent them doing what they want with their money.\n\nBut it\u2019s obvious that Mooney doesn\u2019t care what the mechanism is for women to obtain birth control coverage \u2014 it\u2019s against his religion and he doesn\u2019t want them to have it. If his religious views are not followed by others, he howls at the moon that it\u2019s \u201coppression\u201d by \u201cliberals.\u201d His effort to impose his beliefs on women who don\u2019t share those beliefs threatens our freedom and our constitutional values, and it must be opposed.\n\nApparently unsatisfied lashing out against women\u2019s health insurance, Mooney then has the nerve to bring up the millions of immigrants who have come to the United States fleeing \u201ctyranny\u201d and \u201cpersecution,\u201d as part of a rhetorical nod to the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nThis is the same Alex Mooney who voted to prevent Syrian refugees from coming to the United States one week before publishing this op-ed! The same Alex Mooney who opportunistically praised the Syrian people to the sky (\u201cI rise today to give a voice to the people of Syria ... \u201d) in a YouTubed floor speech so he could attack the president this past June. A few months later he votes to slam the door in Syrians\u2019 faces.\n\nIn spite of this, would you believe Mooney\u2019s op-ed contained the word \u201chypocrisy?\u201d It did. I kid you not.\n\nOf course, because of the deep unpopularity of President Obama in West Virginia, Mooney\u2019s actions make political sense. He thinks he can misrepresent the law and get away with it, as long as he claims he\u2019s \u201copposing Obama.\u201d He can pretend to \u201cstand with Syrians\u201d to oppose the president in June, and jump on board with legislation attacking the very same Syrians in November, so long as he carefully plays the anti-Obama chords.\n\nBut what happens to West Virginia while Mooney is posing?\n\nWe\u2019re short a congressman, is what. Mooney has not taken a single action that benefits his constituents \u2014 actual West Virginians \u2014 since he took office. He basically uses public office as a platform to promote himself. The centerpiece of his op-ed is a resolution that does nothing. Resolutions don\u2019t have the force of law \u2014 no one here will benefit from his grandstanding resolution even if he gets it passed \u2014 very much the same way no Syrians will benefit from his pretending to be their ally in his big floor speech, only to stab them in the back when it suited him later.\n\nWest Virginia has real problems a congressman could work to solve. We need federal road money to rebuild our highways and create new ones. We need funds to recover old industrial sites and to retrain workers for new industries. We may need accommodations on bonding requirements to keep mining companies in business. We need help with the prescription drug epidemic. A congressman who was interested in West Virginia could get to work on these things instead of always jumping on the latest hot talk-radio issue that contains the word \u201cObama.\u201d But we don\u2019t have that congressman \u2014 we have Alex Mooney.\n\nWhen you hire a congressman who is only in it for himself, that\u2019s exactly what you get. West Virginia needs to send Alex Mooney on down the road.\n\nChristopher J.
