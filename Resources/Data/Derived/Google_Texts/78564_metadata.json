We need to play with some desperation,\u201d Avs defenseman Tyson Barrie said at the team\u2019s morning skate.\n\n\u201cI think this is huge.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuge\u201d games don\u2019t normally crop up in the second week of the season. But the Avalanche, at 1-4-1 after a four-game road trip, is on the brink between struggling and falling into a deep hole.\n\nBut the Avs \u2014 who face a fellow one-win team in the Panthers \u2014 play seven of their next nine games in Denver.\n\nStep 1 in reversing their early-season slide is limiting the number of opponent shots. The Avs are allowing 35.7 shots per game, the third-worst mark in the NHL.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Barrie said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many teams who come out with winning records when they\u2019re getting outshot by crazy amounts or when the possession is lopsided.\u201d\n\nThe Avs will put Berra back in net for the first time since he injured his neck early in a game last week at Ottawa.\n\nNo. 1 goaltender Semyon Varlamov will come off the Avs\u2019 injured reserve list Wednesday, coach Patrick Roy said, and will start in net Friday against Vancouver.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure we skate well on our forecheck (defensively) and get some pucks back to generate some offense,\u201d Roy said.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Reto Berra starting Tuesday; Avs \u201cneed to play with some desperation\u201d", "title": "Reto Berra starting Tuesday; Avs \u201cneed to play with some desperation\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/21/reto-berra-starting-tuesday-avs-need-to-play-with-some-desperation/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141016__reto-berra-avs-101614p1-2.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141016__reto-berra-avs-101614p1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-21T13:52:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:23:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde3e3\"", "article_summary": "But the Avs \u2014 who face a fellow one-win team in the Panthers \u2014 play seven of their next nine games in Denver.\nWe need to play with some desperation,\u201d Avs defenseman Tyson Barrie said at the team\u2019s morning skate.\n1 goaltender Semyon Varlamov will come off the Avs\u2019 injured reserve list Wednesday, coach Patrick Roy said, and will start in net Friday against Vancouver.\nThe Avalanche will make its first step back toward normalcy in net Tuesday night when backup goaltender Reto Berra starts for Colorado against the Florida Panthers at the Pepsi Center.\nThe Avs are allowing 35.7 shots per game, the third-worst mark in the NHL."}
