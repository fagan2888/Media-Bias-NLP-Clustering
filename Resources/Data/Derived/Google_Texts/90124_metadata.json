Better to be a face on Rushmore, of course, and don\u2019t be so foolish as to think he\u2019s not working that as well.\n\nBut for now it\u2019s a matter of recasting defeat in last week\u2019s election as a failure on the part of Democrats and some sour voters what a great figure he has been, and well, what a great figure he is and will continue to be.\n\nI don\u2019t think we will ever escape Obama, because is legacy project is his life\u2019s work. When he\u2019s out of office he will continue to fly around giving speeches and conducting his patented campaign style events\u2013a multicultural background of smiling faces, sleeves rolled up as if he\u2019s ready to get at the work of the future, pounding his opponents as knuckledragging subhumans\u2013all in an effort to cement his place in history and caution future historians that stepping out of line will threaten careers and reputations.\n\nBut back to today.\n\nLast week, after the devastating election in which the Obama brand wiped out rank upon rank of the Democrats\u2019 future, the President told the American public that he heard those who voted and he also heard the two thirds of eligible voters who did not vote.\n\nHead scratching ensued. What did he hear from the silent stay-at-homes? The implication was that he knew how they wanted to vote and he was taking their support for his policies by declaration even if he wasn\u2019t allowed to actually count their votes.\n\nThat interpretation was somewhere around the plate but not in the strike zone.\n\nSunday, speaking to Bob Schieffer of Face The Nation, Obama sharpened his aim. What about the election? Obama answered that \u201cwe\u201d need to be better salesmen. \u201cWe have got to sell it,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe have got to reach out to the other side and, where possible, persuade.\u201d That\u2019s directed to you hard headed Republians.\n\nBut the next bit was about his fellow Democrats, who ones who pretended they didn\u2019t know him, who didn\u2019t vote with him even if their records said they had, and wouldn\u2019t even admit they had voted Obama in two Presidential elections. (Bad Dems! Bad Dems!). \u201cAnd I think there are times, there\u2019s no doubt about it, where I think we have not been successful in going out there and letting people know what it is that we\u2019re trying to do and why this is the right direction. So there is a failure of politics that we have got to improve on.\u201d\n\nIn other words, y\u2019all should have stood with me. Those voters who didn\u2019t show up were my voters, who support my policies, and you betrayed them when you tried to distance yourself from me.\n\nI am what you should be selling. This is about me. Barack Obama. That\u2019s your sales pitch. You were dopes when you didn\u2019t understand how great I am.\n\nObama doesn\u2019t have another chance to test his theory of self regard with the voters, unless he were to crowbar his way into the Hillary campaign\u2013and every sign from Clinton World says they are not buying his pitch, and will start putting mega daylight between Hillary and Obama The Great.\n\nSo this is a theory that won\u2019t be put to the correct test, an election. Instead, this is a pitch to history and to those who write it. It\u2019s a pitch that says, \u201cHey, if you write the right stuff, there\u2019s a huge audience to buy your books. If you write the wrong stuff, you\u2019ll be stuck with a minuscule audience of retrograde Repubs, and your royalty checks will suffer.\u201d\n\nHowever, there will historians who don\u2019t mind swimming upstream,and they will likely focus on the deception of the Obama years.\n\nTo be sure, the issue of Presidential deception\u2013lies, if we are to be frank\u2013 must be laid out in future history books or the historian will risk irrelevancy. The list of Obama Administration deception is long\u2013Benghazi, Fast and Furious, IRS\u2013but the inevitable focus will be Obama\u2019s signature piece of legacy legislation: Obamacare.\n\nThe President sold it by saying you would save $2,500 a year. You didn\u2019t. The President said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor, if you like your health insurance policy, you can keep it. You couldn\u2019t keep either.\n\nBut the biggest lie, as it turns out, was simply the way the President and his people concealed from the public basic fact of the legislation: transparency was the first casualty, specifically targeted by the White House.\n\nObamacare architect Jonathan Gruber admitted it\u2013no, he boasted about it\u2013in a conference in late 2013, the video of which has just come to light.\n\nObamacare, he said, \u201cwas written in a tortured way to make sure [the Congressional Budget Office] did not score the mandate as taxes. If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.\u201d Remember SCOTUS ruled Obamacare constitutional because the mandate is a tax, which a legitimate Congressional power. So we lie to the public about the tax, but use the taxing authority as a constitutional shelter.\n\nGruber continued. \u201cIn terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you had a law which said that healthy people are going to pay in \u2013 you made explicit healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed. Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.\u201d In other words, if you lie you have the edge. \u201cAnd basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really really critical for the thing to pass. Look, I wish we could make it all transparent \u2013 but I\u2019d rather have this law than not.\u201d\n\nWe had to hoodwink people to get it passed. We had to lie. We were happy to lie to get it passed. We believe we were doing the best thing for people no matter what they thought.\n\nThat, in a thimble, is the legacy of President Obama.\n\nWatch him try to escape it.
