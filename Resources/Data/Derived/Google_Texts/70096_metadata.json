Interior designers hung sharply tailored draperies alongside furniture covered in pinstripes. Sophisticated shades of gray were everywhere, as was navy blue.\n\nBut \u201csince the pendulum always swings, we\u2019re starting to see fresh feminine spaces,\u201d says interior designer Brian Patrick Flynn, \u201cregardless of who lives in them.\u201d\n\nThe trend that designers are calling \u201cthe new feminine\u201d isn\u2019t a return to an excess of florals, shabby-chic lace and other cliches from a decade ago. Instead, \u201cfeminine style\u201d has evolved into \u201can aesthetic that\u2019s classic with a soft, eclectic spin,\u201d says Flynn, founder of Flynnside Out Productions.\n\nPretty is back, but designers are using traditional florals on furniture with edgy, sleek lines to create modern mashups. Even pink has enjoyed a resurgence, with Pantone\u2019s \u201ccolor of the year\u201d for 2015 a magenta called \u201cmarsala.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a period in design when \u2018pretty\u2019 or \u2018feminine\u2019 were considered bad words,\u201d says New York-based designer Young Huh. \u201cIt was considered lightweight and not serious. Ideal rooms were masculine, a bit somber.\u201d But now, \u201cthere is a new generation discovering chintz and florals.\u201d\n\nSo how do we pull off this new look to give rooms a beautiful, feminine touch without getting too \u201cgirly\u201d?\n\nContrast is key\n\nAnne Maxwell Foster and Suysel dePedro Cunningham, the designers behind the design firm Tilton Fenwick, suggest layering a feminine room with an eclectic mix of furniture and patterns.\n\n\u201cWe love traditional-style upholstery details (like a gathered, skirted chair, for example), but aren\u2019t afraid to pair it with a clean and modern side table,\u201d they said in an e-mail.\n\nHuh also emphasizes contrast: \u201cWhen I think of feminine elements, I turn toward traditional design, such as the curvilinear shapes of Louis VI pieces, floral or other nature-inspired textiles and wallpapers, trims and passementerie, and traditional curtain and furniture making,\u201d she says. \u201cBut \u2026 having modern bookcases, simple molding and contemporary architectural lighting make the feminine embellishments look new and fresh within that context.\u201d\n\nShake up the colors\n\nPink is possible, but it doesn\u2019t have to be your starting point.\n\n\u201cNot once has a female client asked for a pink room,\u201d says Flynn. \u201cThere are so many colors to choose from that add a soft, feminine spin. You can never go wrong with white on white, but if that\u2019s too impractical, mint green and red, lavender and white, and turquoise mixed with just about anything are excellent modern-day feminine options.\u201d\n\nIf your heart is set on pink, he says, \u201cpair it with navy blue. Dark blue and muted pink strike a gender-neutral balance and also create a super preppy vibe.\u201d\n\nThe Tilton Fenwick designers suggest uncommon color pairings. \u201cColor combinations like olive green and turquoise, for example, feel unique and fresh rather than stuffy and dated,\u201d they say. \u201cIt allows you to use traditional patterns in fabrics and textiles without feeling dowdy.\u201d\n\nOne of Huh\u2019s favorite tricks for giving a feminine room edge is to add black (or another \u201cmasculine\u201d color). \u201cPaint some molding black, (or) the legs of a chair, add black trim to traditional chintz pillows and all of a sudden you\u2019ve made that \u2018nice girl\u2019 look sexy,\u201d she says.\n\nDon\u2019t fear the flowers\n\nAlthough an overload of floral patterns will look dated, don\u2019t avoid flowers completely if you love them.\n\n\u201cFlorals are a great starting point for a feminine feel,\u201d but pair them with a more modern and clean palette, say the designers at Tilton Fenwick. They also suggest mixing in \u201cmore modern or unexpected furniture pieces, art and accessories \u2014 a modern photograph for example \u2014 that adds a layer of interest.\u201d\n\nBreak the rules\n\nIf a client wants some shabby chic, Flynn gives it an eclectic twist \u2014 for example, instead of white lace, weathered ivory finishes and lots of silver. \u201cI like to simply stick with weathered wooden finishes in high-energy colors, then mix hand-woven or blocked prints in,\u201d he says. \u201d This results in a well-traveled look packed with organic textures and shapes.\u201d\n\nTake it a step further and you\u2019ve got what Flynn calls \u201crustic elegance\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe clever juxtaposition of weathered finishes and farmhouse elements mixed with clean, tailored lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just completed a dining room which my female client wanted to feel very folk-art-inspired. To pull it off, we covered the walls and windows with a soft shade of gray, added tailored drapery and then brought in almost all worn, weathered pieces. While there are definitely moments of femininity, the space is just as appealing to men as it is to women.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Home decor shows its feminine side: How to keep it sophisticated", "title": "Home decor shows its feminine side: How to keep it sophisticated", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/06/home-decor-shows-its-feminine-side-how-to-keep-it-sophisticated/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150206__20150207_C3_FE07AHFEMp4.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150206__20150207_C3_FE07AHFEMp4.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-06T17:04:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T00:02:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef9b\"", "article_summary": "Pretty is back, but designers are using traditional florals on furniture with edgy, sleek lines to create modern mashups.\nSophisticated shades of gray were everywhere, as was navy blue.\nInstead, \u201cfeminine style\u201d has evolved into \u201can aesthetic that\u2019s classic with a soft, eclectic spin,\u201d says Flynn, founder of Flynnside Out Productions.\nWhile there are definitely moments of femininity, the space is just as appealing to men as it is to women.\u201d\nDon\u2019t fear the flowersAlthough an overload of floral patterns will look dated, don\u2019t avoid flowers completely if you love them."}
