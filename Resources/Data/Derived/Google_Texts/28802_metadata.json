During his Monday program, Beck admitted to his audience at TheBlaze.com that he had been suffering from a rare neurological disease for five years, but after undergoing hormone therapy, electric stimulation and other treatments -- not to mention relying on his faith in God -- the disease has been reversed, and he's on his way to an almost total recovery.\n\nThen on Tuesday, MSNBC's Ed Schultz stated that Beck had \u201caccess and opportunity\u201d to get the best treatment possible and declared: \u201cI hope that his story motivates those who think that ObamaCare is bad, that maybe they will rethink\u201d their opposition to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd during his Wednesday radio program, Beck responded by calling Schultz\u2019s commentary \u201cthe most ridiculous and third-grade argument I have heard\u201d since \u201cit was a private center doing ground-breaking work\u201d for veterans -- which the Veterans Administration won't pay for -- \u201cthat helped heal me.\u201d\n\nFive years ago, the conservative host's health problems began with vocal cord paralysis, eyesight problems and what doctors at first believed was a painful nerve disease.\n\nWhile speaking to his audience on Monday, Beck stated:\n\nI have never lied to you, but I have omitted a few really important facts because -- they scared me. I didn\u2019t have any answers, and the answers I was being given at the time meant \u2026 the end of our time together. We didn\u2019t know at the time what was causing me to feel as though, out of nowhere, my hands and feet, or arms and legs would feel like someone had just crushed them, set them on fire or pushed broken glass into them.\n\nAt the same time, Beck said, something unusual happened that he thought was an advantage: He only needed two to four hours of sleep a night. \u201cDoctors tell me that up until recently, I hadn\u2019t had a real REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep in maybe as long as a decade,\u201d he noted.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe conservative activist's health issues were among the reasons he decided to move to Dallas, which has a warmer climate than New York City.\n\n\u201cThen \u2026 my body began going into a seizure-like state,\u201d Beck said, adding that the episodes most frequently occurred on planes or after a large performance or speech. In one of the most frightening moments of his life, he was tested for traumatic brain injury and found that he was functioning in the bottom tenth percentile.\n\nSoon after, Beck learned about the Carrick Brain Centers, a place in Irving, Texas, he had seen \u201cwork miracles\u201d on people.\n\n\u201cAfter a few short visits, they found that I had several things going on, from an autoimmune disorder to adrenal fatigue,\u201d he continued. His doctors told him he should not have been able to stand, and only his faith in God had kept him moving. Had he remained in New York City, they said, he probably wouldn\u2019t be alive today.\n\n\u201cAfter months of treatment and completely changing the way I eat, sleep, work and live, along with ongoing hormone treatment and intensive physical therapy, I have reversed the process,\u201d Beck said. \u201cSome of the physical scars will be with me for the rest of my life \u2026 but my brain is back online in a big way.\u201d\n\nThen on Tuesday, Ed Schultz -- the host of MSNBC's The Ed Show \u2013 refrained from tossing barbs at Beck but used the situation to address the conservative activist's \u201cviewers and people that basically are followers and worshipers of what the guy says and does.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI hope that his story motivates those who think that ObamaCare is bad, that maybe they will rethink the situation, that seeing a doctor and having it covered is paramount to a good life, to a chance at a good life,\u201d the liberal host stated.\n\nSoon after, Beck posted a message on the Facebook social website in which he stated:\n\nSorry, Ed. It was a private center doing ground-breaking work for VETS -- that the [Veterans Administration] won't pay for -- that helped heal me.\n\nIf private care like this were not available, many like me and much worse may be dead. Private charity and private clinics pave the way on experimental treatment.\n\nAnd during his Wednesday radio program, he called Schultz\u2019s commentary \u201cthe most ridiculous and third-grade argument I have heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even gonna try to change Ed Schultz\u2019s mind,\u201d the radio host stated. \u201cI am just going to speak peace, and I\u2019m gonna speak the truth.\u201d\n\nIn a sign that his sense of humor has returned, Back stated: \u201cRush Limbaugh says he does the show with half his brain tied behind his back. With me, it\u2019s actually been true. But now, it\u2019s back online!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "This week has been a busy time for conservative icon Glenn Beck.
