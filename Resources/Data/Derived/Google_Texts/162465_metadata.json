Congratulations. All those hours you spent on internships and resumes have really paid off. Now what?\n\nGetting a job is the first step towards financial independence, but making money is not the same thing as managing your money. Before you start living large, here\u2019s our strategic advice for making the most of this critical, money-growing time.\n\nSign up for that 401K. Ask about your company\u2019s retirement benefits. If your company offers a 401(k), will it match your contributions? If it does, put aside the greatest percentage you can. Although your take-home pay will be less, so will your taxes, since that money isn\u2019t taxable until you withdraw it. It is much easier to start putting money aside when you\u2019re in your 20s than to try to catch up with retirement savings when you\u2019re in your 30s and 40s.\n\nRelated: 5 Key Retirement Strategies for Millennials to Use Right Now\n\nIf your company does not offer a 401(k), consider an IRA. They offer the same tax-free opportunity as a 401(k), but there are a few differences. First, you decide where to invest\u2014not your company. That\u2019s a good thing if you know about investing; otherwise let an expert advisor at Vanguard, Fidelity or Black Rock guide you. Second, if you want to draw from the account before you\u2019re 59 \u00bd, you\u2019ll pay a 10 percent penalty.\n\nMake sure you have health insurance. Review your company health insurance plan, and don\u2019t forget about premiums, deductibles, the cost of prescriptions, and dental care.\n\nIf your employer doesn\u2019t offer health insurance, it\u2019s your responsibility to enroll in a health insurance policy or ask your parents to cover you, if you\u2019re eligible.\n\nPay off your student debt.\n\nIf you have a single loan, it\u2019s easy enough to figure out what you owe each month. But multiple loans complicate things. Work with your bank to set up auto payments so you don\u2019t default\u2014and you could get a slight rate deduction. Not sure how much of your salary to devote to tackling student debt? As a general rule, an affordable student loan payment should not exceed 8 to 10 percent of your monthly income.\n\nRelated: The Education Department Is Failing Students Who Got Defrauded\n\nDepending on the terms of the loan, it might be worthwhile to make extra payments on the loan with the highest interest rate. Many lenders offer a grace period of about six months before borrowers are required to start paying. If that\u2019s you, start putting aside money during the grace period to use as an emergency fund later.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re having trouble making loan payments, look into loan forgiveness. Sometimes you can obtain it for choosing a job in a certain field, or by meeting other criteria.\n\nLive as cheaply as possible. \u201cThe cheaper you can live, the greater your options,\u201d Mark Cuban writes in How to Win at the Sport of Business. As a new college grad, the future entrepreneur, investor, and owner of the Dallas Mavericks owner slept on the couch or floor of an apartment he shared with roommates. He used the money he saved to invest in his first business, MicroSolutions.\n\nHe strongly recommends using any money you earn or save to pay off bills and debts, and to start building a nest egg. Eliminate that morning cup of joe at Starbucks. Make or bring your own lunch. Avoid taxis and take-out. Drop the gym membership to exercise or run outside. Shop in vintage stores, or swap items with friends, for must-have wardrobe splurges.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban to Young Millennials: Live Cheap\u2014Clothes, Cars Don\u2019t Matter\n\nAvoid credit card debt. If you can\u2019t pay for a purchase in full by the end of the month, don\u2019t buy it with a credit card. Credit card debt comes with ridiculously high interest rates. The sale items you buy today could end up costing you much more over time. Do not use credit cards to fund an expensive lifestyle you can\u2019t afford.\n\nBut you shouldn\u2019t avoid credit cards completely either. Use them responsibly to build credit. A strong credit score could help you land a more favorable loan for a car or mortgage in the future. Landlords often require a credit check before they rent you an apartment.\n\nBuild up savings.\n\nStick to a budget\u2014and live within your means. Apps like Mint and HelloWallet can help you manage your money, and keep track of your spending. Keeping a record of your expenses and deductions will come in handy at tax time. Keep receipts for transportation costs, wardrobe, computer and cell phone purchases, and software.\n\nRelated: \u2018Irresponsible\u2019 Millennials Saving More Than Almost Every Other Group\n\nIf you can swing it, start building an emergency fund with three to six months of salary. Online savings accounts offer some of the best interest rates around.\n\nInvest in yourself. Collect as many experiences as possible. Take every opportunity to learn new skills and software on the job and off. \"If you're starting your first job, you should seek to learn as much as possible, from as many contacts as possible so that you build a strong foundation for your career,\u201d advises Dan Schawbel, author of Promote Yourself: The New Rules for Career Success. \u201cOutside of work,\u201d says Schawbel, \u201cyou should be brushing up on your skills by taking courses, reading books, and going to networking events so that you're more connected and become better at your job and future jobs.\" Check to see if your company offers tuition reimbursement or tuition assistance, paid time off, corporate discounts, bonuses, or any other employee benefits.\n\nUse any trial periods to assess if the company is right for you. Sure, you\u2019re there to prove your worth and value to the company, but it\u2019s critical that you make sure the work environment is a good fit for you, too. Many folks are so focused on making it through the 60-day or 90-day trial period that they forget the period of evaluation goes both ways. Some headhunters will even tell you to keep looking for a job during your first few months on a job, just in case the current one doesn\u2019t work out.\n\nRelated: Everything You Need to Know About Private Student Loans\n\nDon\u2019t eat lunch alone. In his book, Never Eat Alone and Other Secrets to Success, Keith Ferrazzi encourages building relationships, as opposed to merely networking. He urges folks to take every opportunity to connect with others. Instead of eating lunch at your desk, he recommends asking a co-worker to join you and sitting together.\n\nBecause as everybody knows, your network is your net worth. The ability to build and maintain relationships is crucial to your personal and professional success. But if you\u2019re only reaching out to contacts when you need something, you\u2019re not getting the full benefit of a relationship or connection.\n\nFrom this pool of contacts, you will choose a mentor, a person who can help guide you. A resourceful mentor can help you see the big picture, define your long-term and short-term career goals, and offer calm and wise perspective and advice in tricky situations.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "So you just landed a new job or got your first job.
