A 19-year-old man was shot and killed on Thursday night on Lembeck Avenue in Jersey City, officials said.

Jersey City police reported to the corner of Lembeck and Ocean avenues around 7:25 p.m. on Thursday night on a report of shots fired, Hudson County Assistant Prosecutor Gene Rubino said. The officers were then redirected to 91 Lembeck Ave., where they found a man on his back and bleeding, Rubino said. EMS came to the scene and attempted to treat the victim, Christopher Lemoine, 19, Rubino said. Lemoine was pronounced dead at 8:03 p.m., he said.

No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing, said Rubino. Anyone with information should call the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office Homicide Unit at (201) 915-1345. All calls will be kept confidential.

"I heard three pops," said a woman who lives in the neighborhood. "Then my husband called 911, but we had a hard time getting through."

"I saw 3 or 4 young men run across the street and put something in a garbage can," said the woman's husband. "Later, they came back to retrieve it."
