He attended Our Lady of Lourdes School in Milltown and East Brunswick High School. Koch enlisted in the U.S. Army in March 2006 and was a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division. He is the recipient of the Bronze Star, Purple Heart and the Meritorious Service Medal. He died about one month before he was due to come home.\n\nKoch Lane in the township was dedicated in his honor last year.\n\n\"For us, it's a great tribute for Steven \u2014 a very humble, young man that really put a lot of dedication and courage into what he was trying to do,\" said Koch's father, Bill Koch Jr. \"Seeing his name on a race car, he probably would have laughed. It's a very nice gesture. It's bittersweet all the way around, but it's a nice tribute for those that were killed in action and their families.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Koch said, he and his wife are unable to attend because of prior commitments concerning Memorial Day services in the area.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that people remember and think about these guys that sacrificed to protect freedom and the nation and protect people that can't protect themselves,\" he said. \"That's a big thing I write about that Steve talked about.\"\n\nU.S. Army Cpl.

Koch that will go out and defend our borders. We really appreciate all that the members of our Armed Forces do and we're proud to have him on the car this weekend.\"\n\nAnother New Jersey native, Navy SEAL David M.
