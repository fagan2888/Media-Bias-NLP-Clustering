WEBB: I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with that. The CNN Democratic debate transcript, annotated, Washington Post, October 13, 2015\n\nVDARE.com immediately tweeted:\n\n#JimWebb has no problem with illegals getting ObamaCare. He's over. #DemDebate \u2014 Virginia Dare (@vdare) October 14, 2015\n\nBut the redoubtable Ann Coulter, who had been cheering Webb on, beat us by seconds:\n\nOkay, Webb just lost my vote. He \"wouldn't have a problem\" with illegals getting free health care. GO TRUMP, GO! \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) October 14, 2015\n\nOf course, the revelation that Democrats want to force American taxpayers to subsidize their own demographic dispossession is not generally a surprise. The candidates scrambled to outbid each other in showering benefits on \u201cundocumented immigrants\u201d\u2014even Bernie Sanders, who at one point showed qualms about an \u201cOpen Borders\u201d policy because of its impact on American workers, completed his ignominious clich\u00e9d collapse into pandering (\u201cMy view right now\u2014and always has been\u2014is that when you have 11 million undocumented people in this country, we need comprehensive immigration reform, we need a path toward citizenship, we need to take people out of the shadows\u201d).\n\nBut it is a surprise, or at least it\u2019s significant, in the case of Jim Webb.\n\nI should stipulate at this point that I\u2019ve known Webb for more than 35 years, since we were both (Republican) staffers on the Hill and I contacted him because of my admiration for his great Vietnam War autobiographical novel Fields of Fire. (How come it never became a movie?) Even back then, his peers talked about Webb as a future presidential contender because of his obvious abilities, courage, academic achievements and legendary war record.\n\nI should further stipulate, because I don\u2019t want to get him into trouble, that we\u2019ve had no political conversations for at least a decade, certainly since he began his awkward transition back into the Democratic Party\u2014people forget that, from a blue-collar Southern background, he was a convert to Reaganism.\n\nI will also say that in my personal experience, and contrary to the widespread impression, he\u2019s actually nice. (Of course, that\u2019s also my experience of Donald Trump).\n\nWithout revealing details of our conversations long ago: whereas immigration patriots are often all too aware that immigration enthusiasts have absolutely no conception that opposing viewpoints exist, I am certain that Jim Webb does know they exist\u2014even if he now chooses to disagree with them.\n\nYou can see this implicitly in the rest of his answer to Lopez\u2019 question:\n\nLet me start by saying my wife is an immigrant. She was a refugee, her family escaped from Vietnam on a boat\u2013 her entire extended family, after the communists took over, when hundreds of thousands of people were out there and thousands of them were dying. Went to two refugee camps, she never spoke English in her home, and she ended, as I said, graduating from Cornell Law School. That\u2019s not only American dream, that\u2019s a value that we have with a good immigration system in place. No country has\u2014is a country without defining its borders. We need to resolve this issue. I actually introduced an amendment in the 2007 immigration bill\u2026 LOPEZ: \u2026Thank you, Senator. WEBB: \u2026Giving a pathway to citizenship to those people who had come here, and put down their roots, and met as a series of standards\u2026 COOPER: \u2026Thank you, Senator. WEBB: \u2026lost\u2013 I introduced that in 2007\u2014We need a comprehensive reform, and we need to be able to define our borders.\n\n(Emphases and links added).\n\nWebb here conflates legal and illegal immigration in the approved Democrat/ Main Stream Media style, and talks about the notorious \u201cpathway to citizenship\u201d (with \u201ca series of standards\u201d that of course will never be enforced).\n\nBut note that he does also say \u201cwe need to be able define our borders\u201d\u2014ironically, an echo of Reagan\u2019s 1983 comment: \u201cThis country has lost control of its borders. And no country can sustain that kind of position.\u201d [Reagan pledges support for stalled immigration reform bill, By Richard L. Strout, Christian Science Monitor October 21, 1983]The other Democratic candidates gave no sign of acknowledging that a nation-state needs borders, or for that matter should exist at all. And this unfortunate insight can hardly have earned Webb any points with Democratic activists. But he said it anyway.\n\nThere\u2019s even stronger evidence of Webb\u2019s suppressed deviationism in this exchange about Affirmative Action (a.k.a. quotas). Tellingly, Webb was the only contender asked about this key neosocialist offensive:\n\nANDERSON COOPER: Senator Webb, in 2006, you called Affirmative Action \u201cstate-sponsored racism.\u201d In 2010, you wrote an op/ed saying it discriminates against whites. Given that nearly half the Democratic Party is non-white, aren\u2019t you out of step with where the Democratic Party is now? WEBB: No, actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been. The Democratic Party, and the reason I\u2019ve decided to run as a Democrat, has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice. And that is not determined by race. And as a clarification, I have always supported Affirmative Action for African Americans. That\u2019s the way the program was originally designed because of their unique history in this country, with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed. What I have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone, quote, \u201cof color,\u201d other than whites, struggling whites like the families in the Appalachian mountains, we\u2019re not being true to the Democratic Party principle of elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have\u2014by culture, by the way\u2026\n\n(Emphases and links added.)\n\nReaders may judge by following the hyperlinks whether Webb has actually \u201calways supported Affirmative Action.\u201d But his argument that it should only be applied to \u201cAfrican Americans,\u201d and his criticism of \u201cdiversity programs that include everyone, quote, \u2018of color,\u2019 other than whites,\u201d unmistakably reveals he thinks quota preferences should not be extended to include Hispanics, Asians or, especially, recent immigrants.\n\nOf course, it is indeed utterly absurd and outrageous that immigrants who have no history of being disadvantaged in the U.S.\u2014and who anyway chose to come here\u2014should receive quota preferences above absolutely all American whites, regardless of those whites\u2019 circumstances. The logic of this position has been amply documented by VDARE.com: for example, here\n\nBut this absurdity has been clear for more than twenty years. My much-denounced single (1) reference in Alien Nation to my son Alexander\u2019s blond hair and blue eyes was exactly in the context of this paradox: white Americans are squeezed out by immigrants who happen to fall into the politically-favored \u201cprotected classes,\u201d as Alexander manifestly does not. It\u2019s also clear by now that the American Left positively demands the power to discriminate of favor of its clients, against whites (and Republicans are too stupid and cowardly to oppose them).\n\nAnd yet Webb, however fleetingly and inadequately he expressed it, does not agree. And, again, he said so. This was certainly not because he felt trapped by his record\u2014he had next to him at the podium far grosser examples of flip-flops (or \u201cevolving,\u201d as the MSM calls switches in a Leftward direction), like Hillary Clinton on homosexual marriage. He said it because it\u2019s what he thinks.\n\nBut despite all this, even Jim Webb felt unable to defy the other Democratic candidates\u2019 monolithic consensus lauding immigration, both legal (which was unmentioned) and illegal (which was fawned upon).\n\nExactly 23 years ago, in the wake of my National Review \u201cTime To Rethink Immigration\u201d cover story, Jack Miles wrote a long article in The Atlantic concluding that, if the immigration debate were really beginning, \u201c\u2026it will begin on the right (immigration was the cover story in the June 22 issue of National Review) but quickly be seized by the left\u201d because of immigration\u2019s impact on American workers and on blacks. [Blacks vs. Browns, October 1992].\n\n(For an example of the debate that actually did begin in the 1990s, before being brutally aborted, see Miles\u2019 very reasonable review of Alien Nation [The Coming Immigration Debate| An Englishman takes an alarmed look at a quintessentially American issue, The Atlantic, April 1995]).\n\nThere was every reason for Miles to think this. Mass immigration clearly does affect American wages and displace workers, and blacks are particular victims. Moreover, the First Great Wave of immigration was brought to an end in the 1920s in large part precisely because of the resistance of organized labor, notably led by the American Federation of Labor chief Samuel Gompers. Many individual liberals and union members are aware of problems with immigration: some of them write for VDARE.com\n\nBut in fact, 23 years later, the immigration issue has not been \u201cseized by the Left.\u201d This fact provides further proof of Sean Trende\u2019s brilliant perception that, whereas the GOP is a coalition of ideological factions dominated (alas) by an interest group, the Democrats are a coalition of interest groups dominated by an ideological faction\u2014identity-politics Cultural Marxism.\n\nAnd if even Jim Webb\u2014with his explicit emphasis on the working class, with nothing to lose and everything to gain\u2014has been scared off, it now seems safe to say that the American Left will never seize the immigration issue.\n\nWhich is not to say that many of its individual members won\u2019t be voting for President Trump.\n\nPeter Brimelow [Email him] is the editor of VDARE.com.
