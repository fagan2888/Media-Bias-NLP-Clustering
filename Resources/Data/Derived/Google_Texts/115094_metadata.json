It\u2019s thrilling to go back over the year and pick out the best moments to share with readers. But how do you narrow it down to just 10 shows? How do you compare a comedy like \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d with a drama like \u201cPerson of Interest\u201d? And worst of all: What if you\u2019ve missed something?\n\nI did make a top-10 list, which you can see at the HitFix critics\u2019 poll \u2014 a list I\u2019ve been sketching out and expounding upon with more nuance for the Year in TV series. But while looking at shows as a whole is a fascinating process, one of the unique and frustrating elements of episodic television is that some half-hours are better than others. An outstanding episode can mean something more than a whole show, sometimes because it\u2019s framed like a short film, and sometimes because it takes what the show does to a level the other episodes can\u2019t attain. It\u2019s the episode you recommend when you tell a friend, \u201cYou need to watch this show.\u201d\n\nIn that spirit, I asked nine other critics to tell me a little bit about one of their favorite episodes of the year. Their answers come from Emmy-winning shows and from cult hits on late-night television, from 22-minute sitcoms to 90-minute miniseries installments. But they are all episodes to be remembered\u2014and here\u2019s why.\n\n\n\n\u201cRick and Morty,\u201d \u201cRixty Minutes\u201d\n\nThe entire first season of Rick and Morty impressed me, but it was \u201cRixty Minutes\u201d that blew me away and cemented the series as one of my new favorites. The centerpiece of \u201cRixty Minutes\u201d isn\u2019t the actual plot \u2014 there isn\u2019t much of one \u2014 or the brilliance of using mindless channel surfing as a way to show the infinite number of alternate universes, the different twists and turns various members of the family could have taken. Instead, it\u2019s a sweet but disturbing conversation between Morty and his sister, who just found out that in many of these alternate universes she doesn\u2019t even exist. Morty reveals his own grave and \u201ccomforts\u201d her by saying, \u201cNobody belongs anywhere. Everybody\u2019s gonna die. Come watch TV.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a line that sneaks up and catches you off guard with its dark humor and brutal honesty \u2014 there is no better form of escapism than television, even when it gets a little too real \u2014 but it\u2019s also representative of what made \u201cRick and Morty\u201d one of the most unique series on television this year. \u2014 Pilot Viruet, Flavorwire\n\n\u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d \u201cA Few Words\u201d\n\nComing in the middle of its most flooring season to date, there was still something that felt almost impossible about \u201cA Few Words.\u201d \u201cThe Good Wife\u2019s\u201d strength has always been its narrative plate-spinning: somehow keeping half a dozen ongoing plots in motion each episode while dealing with a case of the week. \u201cA Few Words\u201d outdid even that by slowing everything down to focus on protagonist Alicia Florrick \u2014 both her personal evolution over five seasons and her tricky symbolism as a feminist role model \u2014 when she\u2019s asked to deliver a keynote on her status as a mom who \u201copted out\u201d of work before returning to the law.\n\n\u201cThe Good Wife\u201d grapples with bigger issues without sacrificing the dimensions of its characters better than any other show \u2014 we\u2019re never lectured to. \u201cA Few Words\u201d arrives at its themes organically: Alicia realizing how beholden she is to the men in her life, wrestling with her privilege, and slowly awakening to the realization that she wants to control her fate. \u201cA Few Words\u201d serves as the crucial locus point between Alicia\u2019s self-doubt and the more self-reliant path she had already embarked on, and it did that while being an incredibly compelling episode of dramatic television. \u2014 David Sims, the Atlantic\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHannibal,\u201d \u201cMizumono\u201d\n\nMy God, this is an emotionally devastating episode of television. You might not think it possibly could be, considering it\u2019s about a cannibal serial killer and the criminal profiler who loves/loathes him engaging in an elaborate game of cat and mouse, and you\u2019ve seen that before. But there\u2019s a point around the halfway mark of this episode where showrunner Bryan Fuller\u2019s masterful design for his entire season snaps into place, and the show goes not just for broke, but for astonishing. Yes, the episode is remarkably plotted, leaving a surprisingly large number of cast members bleeding out on the floor of Hannibal\u2019s posh mansion and packing one final surprise into a scene that comes after the closing credits. But as mentioned, \u201cMizumono\u201d works so well because it\u2019s a payoff to two seasons worth of buildup, the moment when the show\u2019s emotionally rococo view of the universe fully flowers. Hannibal is, at its most basic level, about what it means for two men to have a deeply intimate friendship, where they know everything about each other. And that means that \u201cMizumono,\u201d in which one of the two betrays the other, must necessarily be about the deep scars of heartbreak. Fuller and company make sure you feel every one of them. \u2014 Todd VanDerWerff, Vox\n\n\u201cSherlock,\u201d \u201cHis Last Vow\u201d\n\n\u201cHolmes is as inhuman as a Babbage\u2019s Calculating Machine, and just about as likely to fall in love,\u201d Arthur Conan Doyle wrote in 1892, establishing the intentional omission of romantic desire in his detective\u2019s personality profile. In 2014, \u201cSherlock\u2019s\u201d Holmes referred to love as an easily exploitable human error.\n\nBut in dismissing this inherently human emotion, Sherlock created a blind spot into which stepped a woman \u2013 John Watson\u2019s new wife, Mary, played by Martin Freeman\u2019s partner Amanda Abbington. In one thrilling scene, everything that occurred between \u201cThe Empty Hearse\u201d and that heart-stopping moment in \u201cHis Final Vow\u201d became mere distractions as sweet Mary\u2019s unveiling invited viewers to reevaluate their own powers of deduction. Holmes\u2019 initial appraisal told us, among other things, that she was a size 12 clever romantic who bakes her own bread, loves cats \u2026 and is a liar.\n\nWhat else did we notice along the way? We saw what was genuine: her strength, quick intellect, and admiration for Sherlock matched her adoration of his best friend. Mary fit into Sherlock\u2019s puzzle so beautifully that he didn\u2019t let her go, even when a blackmailer shattered her genteel veneer. The \u201cliar\u201d designation became an afterthought until the writers made us realize it was everything. Knowing what the real mystery was made an encore viewing of Season 3\u2019s episodes a differently satisfying experience. \u201cHis Final Vow\u201d proved that the detective did love, in his way; so great is Sherlock\u2019s affection for Watson that he was ready to sacrifice his freedom to protect Mary. \u2014 Melanie McFarland, IMDb\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cSymbolic Exemplar\u201d\n\nThe ostensible theme of \u201cTransparent\u201d is transformation, and all season long, we watched the evolution of genders and individuals within one family. But what \u201cThe Symbolic Exemplar\u201d examines with awe-inspiring focus is another of the show\u2019s themes: expectations. Ali\u2019s expectations for her date with a new man are so overwhelming that they affect what she perceives. Maura wants to be truly seen in her big moment in the talent show, but she\u2019s terrified of making a fool of herself. Her children want to not be embarrassed by who Maura is in that moment, and they also want credit for merely showing up. What\u2019s fantastic about the episode \u2014 and what\u2019s heartbreaking about Maura\u2019s kids giggling then slinking away during the performance of \u201cSomebody That I Used to Know\u201d \u2014 is the rigorous excavation of why every single person let everyone else down. Maura hasn\u2019t been truthful about her identity for so long that deception is a reflexive habit for all the Pfeffermans. Confusion, pain and anger get in the way of each character\u2019s expectations, and creator Jill Soloway depicts all these messy emotions without bitterness or an overdose of melodrama. The episode, which is anchored so beautifully by Jeffery Tambor\u2019s depiction of Maura\u2019s bravery, serves as the emotional heart of a series that brilliantly examines the cost of expectations and the painful necessity of evolution. \u2014 Mo Ryan, the Huffington Post", "article_metadata": {"description": "Television critics spoke to Salon about the particular episodes that stood out from the rest in 2014", "title": "The best episodes of 2014: Top critics on their favorite TV of the year", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Television critics spoke to Salon about the particular episodes that stood out from the rest in 2014", "title": "The best episodes of 2014: Top critics on their favorite TV of the year", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/28/the_best_episodes_of_2014_top_critics_on_their_favorite_tv_of_the_year/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/2014_best_episodes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Television critics spoke to Salon about the particular episodes that stood out from the rest in 2014", "title": "The best episodes of 2014: Top critics on their favorite TV of the year", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/2014_best_episodes.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Game of Thrones, hannibal, Mad Men, Masters of Sex, review, Rick And Morty, sherlock, The 100, The Good Wife, transparent, year in tv 2014", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb8f7\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s thrilling to go back over the year and pick out the best moments to share with readers.\nTheir answers come from Emmy-winning shows and from cult hits on late-night television, from 22-minute sitcoms to 90-minute miniseries installments.\nWe saw what was genuine: her strength, quick intellect, and admiration for Sherlock matched her adoration of his best friend.\nKnowing what the real mystery was made an encore viewing of Season 3\u2019s episodes a differently satisfying experience.\nIt\u2019s the episode you recommend when you tell a friend, \u201cYou need to watch this show.\u201dIn that spirit, I asked nine other critics to tell me a little bit about one of their favorite episodes of the year."}
