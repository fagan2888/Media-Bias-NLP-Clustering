If one searches on the terms effect of crippling sanctions, one finds over 800,000 results at Google. A quick review of the first great many confirms, at the very least, that Iran, an enemy (so-called), is the primary subject. Debate rages as to whether sanctions are effective for accomplishing their intended goals, but there seems to be a fair amount of detailed information that they are certainly effective at damaging the enemy\u2019s middle class.\n\nThis just in! Partisan radicals have stormed buildings nationwide and are holding hostages at gunpoint. If their demands are not met, they will kill as many hostages as they need to until the Obama administration backs down on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHere we are, the 21st Century barely warming up, and a select band of partisan radicals famous for co-opting an unholy trinity of political party, fake philosophy, and extremist religion are proposing just such crippling sanctions that would certainly do more to harm the middle class than they would to meet stated objectives. The problem is, those partisans are right here in America, the regime they seek to change is our own, and the net result is that they are treating America as the enemy.\n\nTerrorism is the application of violence or threat of violence to attain political goals. Repeal of the ACA is the obstructionist GOP contingent\u2019s stated political goal. That the threat of government shutdown almost certainly results in the death of greater than 0% of those affected is, of necessity, a threat of violence in the same way that this particular politically partisan contingent construes taxation to be violence. Ergo, GOP obstructionist radicals are, like Al Nusra Front, terrorists actively engaged not only in threats of violence against the American people for their political goals, but in the undermining of national security. Adding insult to injury, their assault on the American people won\u2019t even accomplish their goal if they start executing hostages.\n\nTaxation as theft\n\nMr. Boehner said the dispute with Democrats amounted to a question of \u201chow much more money do we want to steal from the American people to fund more government.\u201d\n\nClearly, we are dealing with folks that believe that the apparently non-violent is, by extension, actually violence. For them, the abstract is concrete. I believe I fairly make their case when I put it thusly:\n\nThe government sends you a polite letter notifying you that taxes are due and payable. You send a polite letter back indicating that you will not relinquish your funds upon their polite request. The government proceeds to shuffle about other seemingly polite pieces of paper such that you are required to appear in court. Not wishing to appear ungracious, you make your appearance. The judge informs you, ever so politely, that payment is not optional. It is mandatory. You politely decline. The government proceeds to shuffle about more seemingly polite pieces of paper. At some point, gentlemen armed with guns and authority arrive at your home or place of employment, presenting polite pieces of paper indicating seizure of a variety of your assets. Followed through to its logical fruition, the peaceful and noncompliant citizen is eventually faced with drawn weapons. Violence!\n\nTerrorism\n\nThe use of violence or the threat of violence, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political goals. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n\nSimplified rendering of the latest GOP legislative tactic: Repeal Obamacare (political goal) or we will shut down the government.\n\nFox News: Capitol Hill report warns shutdown could pose risks to national security\n\n\u201cWe had victory today,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said after the vote. \u201cThe House has listened to the American people. Now it\u2019s time for the U.S. Senate to listen.\u201d\n\nYes, because taking America hostage and issuing a credible threat of indiscrimate death to achieve your political goals is a victory. Added bonus, you actually jeopardize American national security. We see what you did there.\n\nWith that bit of preamble out of the way, let\u2019s take a look at a slice of America as an example of the potential effects of a government shutdown, shall we?\n\nAmerica Under Siege\n\nWhat a government shutdown would look like in Nevada\n\nThe current threats, however, may be more plausible than earlier occasions when Congress sounded an alarm. For the first time, there\u2019s a solid faction of the Republican Party openly angling for a shutdown and for lawmakers to vote to prove how much they really hate Obamacare. And it\u2019s not like Democrats are about to wave a white flag in surrender just days before the health care exchanges are scheduled for their national debut. So if a government shutdown is on the horizon, what would it look like for Nevada? Here\u2019s a list of what and where to expect the local effects.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, however illusory, let\u2019s assume that while the numbers presented in the Sun\u2019s article will differ from region to region, the effect of a government shutdown as experienced elsewhere in the country will essentially mirror the effect in Nevada.\n\nNumber, numbers everywhere, and not a drop of blood to drink. Pity that, because we only seem to understand blood. Allow me to reframe issue a touch. We\u2019re not just dealing with clowns in clown cars here. We\u2019re dealing with clowns like this:\n\nHold on, what? Blood? Clowns? Bloodthirsty clowns? What the hell?\n\nSimple. Numbers are the crunchy outside. Blood is what makes numbers gooey in the middle. These clownish bloodthirsty freaks holding America hostage talk numbers, numbers without calling attention to the fact that it\u2019s actual American blood they\u2019ll gladly spill in pursuit of their agenda. Hell, even if they actually believe that they\u2019re preventing a greater harm, Obamacare, with its fictitious death panels, that\u2019s just not going to wash. Destroying the village to save it wasn\u2019t good enough for My Lai. It\u2019s not good enough for us here. And it doesn\u2019t change the fact that threatening violence in pursuit of a political goal is a form of terrorism.\n\nThis is one arena where GOP & Co. have Team Blue at a severe disadvantage. These clown-headed redshirts (therein lies our sole cause for optimism where they are concerned) are content to use their croupier\u2019s rakes to push little plastic political soldiers around on maps and to hell with the short-term consequences, except when that means they get to gorge on blood-filled numbers that fall out of their cracked and broken toys. It makes great political theater, after all. Pass the popcorn!\n\nTeam Blue, on the other hand (provided I leave my cynicism at the door for a moment), positions itself as those who see those little plastic figures as representing very real people, so short-term consequences are as important as the long ones. If the Blues can\u2019t outnumber these Clown Patrol at the polls in deep red territory, at some point Team Blue needs to be willing to make the painful sacrifices necessary to meet bloodthirsty clowns in the abstract.\n\n\u201cHyperbole!\u201d you say. \u201cHogwash,\u201d I reply.\n\nFor that matter, at the end of this post, I suggest how to concretely drub them about the head and shoulders with their own abstractions. Far be if from me to show up with a bucket of bitching and not have a solution to offer.\n\nA Dash of Legalese\n\n\u201cBut for\u201d \u2013 In the law, a proximate cause is an event sufficiently related to a legally recognizable injury to be held to be the cause of that injury. There are two types of causation in the law: cause-in-fact, and proximate (or legal) cause. Cause-in-fact is determined by the \u201cbut for\u201d test: But for the action, the result would not have happened. For example, but for running the red light, the collision would not have occurred. For an act to cause a harm, both tests must be met; proximate cause is a legal limitation on cause-in-fact. Proximate Cause @ Wikipedia\n\nA Look at Those Tasty, Crunchy Numbers and Their Gooey, Bloody Filling\n\nGod always punishes us for what we can\u2019t imagine. Stephen King, Duma Key\n\nThe article at the Las Vegas Sun highlights a great many consequences that, but for GOP terrorist hostage-taking, would not occur.\n\nApproximately 11,000 civilian federal workers in Nevada may be furloughed or asked to work, temporarily, without pay. Does this mean their bills stop? That a bank will kindly waive mortgage payments? That they cease needing food, clothing, healthcare, fuel, automotive insurance, or a host of other necessities? Of course not. Is it really that much of a stretch of the imagination to believe that at least one of these workers or their family members may actually die as a result of such deprivations as may be caused by the GOP\u2019s act of terror? To wit, I posit that some percentage greater than 0% of affected workers and/or their family members face a threat of death that, but for GOP hostage-taking, they would not face.\n\nActive duty service members should not expect to be paid until after the shutdown is ended. I posit that some percentage greater than 0% of active duty service members, distracted by a financial crisis imposed on them by GOP terrorists, and perhaps other service members and/or civilians that rely upon the effective discharge of their duties, will die. Is it really too much to imagine that an interruption of soldiers\u2019 allotments to their families back home be would weigh heavily and distractingly on their hearts? That worries about keeping the lights on and mortgages paid back home would add to the already inordinate burdens they bear in the name of patriotism and service to country? Do we not have enough active duty military suicides already? But for GOP terrorism, this additional risk would not exist.\n\nWhat about the risk of death faced by military contractors and their families? Is it too much to think that even one might die for no other reason than hardships caused by GOP terrorism?\n\nSome in the country, depending on the ability of their state to bridge the gap between unemployment benefits due and funds available from the federal government, might suddenly find themselves even farther up shit creek without a paddle. Again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch of the imagination to suggest that greater than 0% of the people already struggling to survive will experience the slashing of their unemployment benefits in the form of death that, but for GOP terrorism, would not occur.\n\nSocial Security benefits for existing recipients may be safe, for some value of the word \u201csafe,\u201d but new applicants and those awaiting adjudication won\u2019t be so lucky. Will every single one of those unfortunates be able to bridge the gap between existing resources and the start of their benefits? That\u2019s yet another risk the GOP is willing to take with American lives.\n\nThe same goes for new applicants for VA benefits. Once again, when it comes to fully supporting our troops, the men and women who put themselves in harm\u2019s way for the good of our nation, the GOP sees no problem with putting this incredibly at-risk population under the gun. Think that active duty suicide rate was jaw dropping? Can anyone believe that a government shutdown will do anything to improve on the suicide rate among veterans? Yet again, but for GOP terrorism, some percentage greater than 0% of veterans will likely die.\n\nSurely none of this affects civilians who work in the home construction market, right? Wrong. FHA won\u2019t be processing loans under a shutdown. No loans, no purchases. No purchases, less work for contractors, less sales for home improvement businesses and suppliers. Take everything you know about trickle-down economics and apply it to loss instead. If someone, due to a political hit on an already struggling recovery, should lose their job, how much luck are they going to have, as a new applicant, in getting unemployment benefits from strapped state coffers? Don\u2019t get weary of my repetition just yet. Death is death, after all, each one a tragedy, each one a mere speck of collateral damage the GOP is willing to embrace as part of its political machinations. But for GOP terrorism, some percentage greater than 0% of workers in the construction and allied trades will die.\n\nAre the good folks in the private sector working to address our renewable energy issues immune? Nope. As indicated in the article, programs expecting payments at the beginning of the fiscal year might just have to wait. Sometimes waiting is not an option. If those concerns cannot find a way to stay operational while funds are pending, doors get closed, sometimes permanently. Not only is that bad for our energy independence and bad for the environment, that\u2019s bad for workers who, like construction industry workers, could end up competing for limited assistance resources. Yet again, but for GOP terrorism, some percentage greater than 0% of workers in the renewable energy industry will die.\n\nThink the latest attempt at slashing $40 billion from food stamps was extreme? Heaven help you if you rely on that or similar public assistance if your state draws the short straw when it comes to timing. Yet again, but for GOP terrorism, some percentage greater than 0% of public assistance recipients will die.\n\nEven vacationers, but more importantly, those who depend upon them, would feel the bite. With visa and passport processing being delayed, a great many, tens of thousands if history is a sufficient guide, will have to cancel plans. Those counting on tourism revenue will surely be adversely affected. Remember, all it takes is one layoff, one desperate soul pushed beyond despair. That\u2019s a life and death risk the GOP is willing to take. Yet again, but for GOP terrorism, some percentage greater than 0% of tourism and hospitality workers will die.\n\nAll of that, all of those possible indiscriminate deaths that, but for GOP terrorism wouldn\u2019t even be up for discussion, and their hostage-taking goal won\u2019t even stop Obamacare thanks to the fact that the money that needs to be spent for the next stage in the rollout has already been spent. As pointed out in the article, at least this time we don\u2019t have to worry about critical emergency services. We\u2019ll just have to wait for America\u2019s own Al Nusra Front as embodied in the current obstructionist GOP contingent to pull out their guns again when the next debt ceiling debacle comes into play.\n\nNow, I realize that the temptation will be great to rebut with the claim that death is an unfortunate possible unintended consequence of even the most well-intended policies. I submit that the difference here is quite stark and simple. Faced with a failure to prevail in the election booth, terrorists hiding behind the GOP front are overtly threatening to harm our nation if their demands are not met. As for my seemingly strident cry, again and again, that greater than 0% of affected populations will die, let me as you this. What is more likely to be true, an absolute assertion that nobody will die as a result of this GOP threat (100% will survive), or that even one will will perish? How does this differ from a madman pointing a scary rifle into a crowd and letting off ten rounds if he doesn\u2019t get his way? Would it even matter if all ten rounds miss? The threat is all too horribly real.\n\nTo recapitulate, nearly verbatim, from the beginning of this post, terrorism is the application of violence or threat of violence to attain political goals. Repeal of the ACA is the obstructionist GOP contingent\u2019s stated political goal. The threat of government shutdown which, as suggested above, almost certainly results in the death of greater than 0% of those affected, is, of necessity, a threat of violence in at least the same way that this particular politically partisan contingent construes taxation to be violence, although I contend that my claim is far more grounded in reality. GOP obstructionist radicals are, like Al Nusra Front, terrorists actively engaged, not only in threats of indiscriminate violence, in this case directly against the American people, for the attainment of political goals, but also in compromising America\u2019s national security. Perhaps its time we start treating them as terrorists.\n\nTo the extent that their efforts undermine national security, I would also argue that the GOP terrorist contingent lends aid and support to the enemy and should, as such, be charged and tried for treason.\n\n\u2014-\n\nImage credits:\n\nAl Nusra Front Executions.
