Now that we’ve all watched the Avs’ final preseason game on 40-watt Wal-Mart light bulbs from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, a few observations on the Avs’ 1-5-2 record:

– Avs won tonight despite a couple of atrocious calls near the end of regulation and overtime that could have given the Kings a really cheap win. Am I a homer for saying that? Not this time, sorry. Jarome Iginla was called for a pathetic interference call near the end – which drew a vociferous objection from Iginla, which almost never happens from him – and another one in overtime on Alex Tanguay for a no-big-deal hit on Kings D-man Brayden McNabb, who will probably always be best remembered for a pathetic cheap shot on Avs prospect Joey Hishon in the 2011 Memorial Cup.

McNabb is one of those marginally talented punk players who might just make himself a nice living in the NHL. Be prepared to hate him. A lot. Matt Cooke would think he’s a good player, in other words.

– The penalty kill was credited with blanking the Kings tonight, but, man they still make things way too tough on Semyon Varlamov. He had to stand up to withering assault on the final two phantom Kings PPs. Doesn’t matter how they happen – the Avs need to make it easier on Varly when a penalty is called. Clear the puck! Why is this not one of Patrick Roy’s chief tenets to his team by now? The Avs were 24th in the league last year in killing penalties and they look even worse now.

– Dennis Everberg scored a goal for the Avs. That could clinch a spot on the opening night roster, at least while John Mitchell, Jamie McGinn, Patrick Bordeleau and Jesse Winchester continue to convalesce with injuries.



– Matt Duchene started to click more tonight. This is a good sign.

– Really, the Avs outplayed the Kings for most of regulation, until the referees took control and put them on the defensive. Hey, most of the time the Kings should outplay the Avs without the referees, and they probably will at some point again. But tonight, the Avs showed that they won’t be an easy team to beat when all things are equal. The penalty kill is the NUMBER ONE PROBLEM ON THIS TEAM STILL, AND MUST BE ADDRESSED, if they are to get to the next level.

– Other than pre-existing conditions to McGinn and Mitchell, the Avs escaped the preseason mostly unscathed when it came to injuries. That’s a win. Winchester remains out with a concussion, and I don’t have any idea how long it will be. But aside from that, it is over and let’s drop the puck already for real.
