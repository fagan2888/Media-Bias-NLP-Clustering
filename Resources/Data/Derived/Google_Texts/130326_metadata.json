I know, it's hard to imagine.\n\nThis is the reality that framed a recent Washington Post story that ran under this headline: \"Question of beard and religious freedom unites groups who\u2019ve been opponents.\" As often happens, this story has little or no sense of history. \"History\" is something that happened, oh, last year. The story pivots on the rights of a prisoner:\n\nGregory Houston Holt is an Arkansas prison inmate who is also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad. According to his brief to the court, he feels his Muslim faith requires him to follow this dictate: \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger said, \u2018Cut the moustaches short and leave the beard (as it is).\u2019 \u201d\n\nHolt said he is willing to compromise with prison officials and keep his beard trimmed to one-half inch. But Arkansas corrections officials allow beards only for dermatological conditions -- not religious beliefs -- and even then they must be trimmed to one-quarter inch.\n\nOf such, Supreme Court cases are made.\n\nThe Post team is interested in Holt, but at the heart of this story is the fact that -- in the eyes of the dominant news source here in Beltway land -- it is strange that cultural conservatives (think Becket Fund for Religious Liberty) are rising to the defense of, well, someone other than an evangelical ministry leader or an order of Catholic nuns who back the Vatican on issues of sexual morality.\n\nCan you feel the love? Well, maybe not. Can you sense the presence of raised eyebrows in the newsroom?\n\nHolt\u2019s case has attracted an outpouring of support from groups who divided last term on important Supreme Court cases involving the health-care act and whether local government meetings could open with sectarian prayer.\n\nIn this case, conservative legal organizations such as the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Rutherford Institute are on the same side as Americans United for the Separation of Church and State and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAnd Holt has the support of the Obama administration.\n\nSo what is the journalistic issue in this story, which is actually pretty good?\n\nI think it's fascinating that the Post team seems to think that this broad church-state coalition is a new thing. In other words, the news is that this team has REUNITED to work on this case, in defense of a unique religious believer, a man that many would view with distrust. Truth be told, strong advocates of the First Amendment once stood together to defend the rights of neo-Nazis to march through a Chicago suburb that included many, many Holocaust survivors.\n\nSo here is my question: What shattered the Clinton-era coalition?\n\nThat question doesn't interest the Post team. This is as close as readers will get:\n\nAmericans United for the Separation of Church and State is one of the groups supporting Holt that was on opposite sides of conservative legal groups in the legislative prayer and contraceptive mandate cases.\n\nGregory Lipper, an attorney for the organization, said the difference is that the previous cases would affect third parties, such as those who don\u2019t want to hear prayers at municipal meetings or employees who want access to all forms of birth control.\n\nHolt\u2019s request for a beard imposes no burden on any other inmate or anyone else, Lipper said. His group urges the court to make sure that when government accommodates the needs of an individual\u2019s religious beliefs, it does so in a way \u201cconditioned on the equal rights of others.\u201d\n\nWell, what about the rights of the Jews in Skokie?\n\nOnce upon a time, groups on the political left were much more consistent in their defense of First Amendment rights, even when freedom of expression caused tension and sometimes pain. But times have changed and First Amendment liberalism is not as popular as in the past. In fact, it is often called \"conservatism\" these days.\n\nThere is a story in there, but one that requires knowing a bit of history.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The history of church-state relations in the United States is a very \r\ncomplicated subject, the kind of intellectual terrain that you could spend \r\nseveral semesters exploring in\u00a0a graduate degree\u00a0(as I once did, late in \r\nthe\u00a0Vietnam War era).\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn recent decades, roughly the era defined by the rise of the Religious \r\nRight, there have been several distinct stages in church-state affairs.
