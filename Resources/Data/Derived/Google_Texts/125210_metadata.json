Why Don\u2019t Republicans?\n\nRepublicans continue to stand alone in the fight for income inequality. Quinn Dombrowski / Flickr\n\nIncome inequality is killing the economy. Retailers, bankers and Democrats agree on that. Really.\n\nIt\u2019s only Republicans who continue to insist that income inequality is great, so no one, least of all them, should make any effort to constrict the abyss between America\u2019s struggling 99 percent and Americans who indulge themselves in $475,000 bottles of House of Creed Bespoke perfume.\n\nNow that Wall Street and Main Street have endorsed Democratic economic principals to reduce inequality for the sake of the economy, voting Nov. 4 is easy. Vote Democrat. That\u2019s the party both bankers and retailers say has the solution to economic revival.\n\nAdmittedly, this is all a little hard to believe after Republicans have diligently depicted themselves as business and bank huggers for so long.\n\nTurns out, though, that\u2019s a sad, one-sided relationship. Bankers and retailers aren\u2019t returning the love when it comes to economic policy. They\u2019ve recognized the enemy to their bottom lines, and it is the rising costs and stagnant wages borne by workers since the dawn of the recession.\n\nAnd both bankers and retailers want action. They want incomes, consumer confidence and purchases all to rise, triggering business profits to do the same. They\u2019ve discovered that extra personal jets, mega yachts and $475,000 perfume purchased by the one percent have failed to stimulate the economy.\n\nWhat\u2019s essential to revival is more buying by the hulking mass of everybody else. That\u2019s what Wall Street firms have said in recent reports. And that\u2019s what the Center for American Progress, a think tank that supports middle-out economics, found in an analysis of the financial statements of 65 of the nation\u2019s top retailers.\n\nHere, for example, is what Morgan Stanley economists had to say last month in their report Inequality and Consumption:\n\n\u201cSo, despite the roughly $25 trillion increase in wealth since the recovery from the financial crisis began, consumer spending remains anemic. Top income earners have benefited from wealth increases but middle and low income consumers continue to face structural liquidity constraints and unimpressive wage growth. To lift all boats, further increases in residential wealth and accelerating wage growth are needed.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the prescription to cure consumer spending anemia is raises for workers. Remember, it is Republicans who have blocked raising the federal minimum wage from its poverty-level $7.25 an hour, with some party darlings, such as Michele Bachmann, a former candidate for the GOP presidential nomination, contending that the minimum wage should be abolished because no wage is too low.\n\nThen there\u2019s the August report from rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s titled: How Increasing Income Inequality Is Dampening U.S. Economic Growth, And Possible Ways To Change The Tide. It says:\n\n\u201cThe challenge now is to find a path toward more sustainable growth, an essential part of which, in our view, is pulling more Americans out of poverty and bolstering the purchasing power of the middle class. A rising tide lifts all boats\u2026but a lifeboat carrying a few, surrounded by many treading water, risks capsizing.\u201d\n\nApparently, Wall Street economists love boat metaphors.\n\nTo haul the many out of the water and into a more stable economic ship, S&P suggests this:\n\n\u201cThat said, some degree of rebalancing \u2013 along with spending in the areas of education, health care, and infrastructure, for example \u2013 could help bring under control an income gap that, at its current level, threatens the stability of an economy still struggling to recover.\u201d\n\nRemember, it is Republicans across the country that have cut spending on education and refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt is Republicans in Congress who have repeatedly stomped on attempts by Democrats to stimulate the economy by spending on desperately needed repairs to infrastructure\u2014that is facilities such as roads, bridges, public buildings and sewers. Numerous economists have pointed out that the cost of borrowing for these job-creating projects is so low right now that the loans are virtually free.\n\nWall Street and Main Street have had their disputes since the Great Recession. But they agree that for the good of the country\u2019s economy, incomes must rise for the majority. In a report issued earlier this month, the Center for American Progress (CAP) documented retailers\u2019 belief that stagnant wages are damaging business. It\u2019s called Retailer Revelations: Why America\u2019s Struggling Middle Class has Businesses Scared.\n\nCAP tabulated the risks to business stability that the nation\u2019s top retailers reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. CAP found that 88 percent said weak consumer spending imperils stock prices, and 68 percent said consumers\u2019 flat or falling incomes threaten business profits.\n\nThe CAP report lists large retailer (Kohl\u2019s and Sears) after large retailer (Best Buy and J.C. Penney) suffering faltering sales. It quotes Container Store CEO Kip Tindell saying, \u201cConsistent with so many of our fellow retailers, we are experiencing a retail funk.\u201d\n\nCAP explains the funk, \u201cThe fortunes of the retail sector and the middle class are inherently linked \u2013 when family incomes fail to rise, when the cost of living increases, or when workers cannot find jobs, retailers\u2019 sales decline.\u201d\n\nSome retailers have taken action themselves. Earlier this year, for example, Gap Inc. and IKEA announced plans to raise their workers\u2019 wages to at least $10 an hour. Costco increased wages by $1.50 an hour during the recession, so workers start at $11.50 an hour.\n\nCEO Craig Jelinek explained: \u201cI just think people need to make a living wage with health benefits. It also puts more money back into the economy and creates a healthier country. It\u2019s really that simple.\u201d Costco\u2019s stock prices have tripled since 2009.\n\nStill, not every retailer is going to raise wages voluntarily. The world\u2019s largest, Walmart, for example, just cut its workers\u2019 health benefits. That\u2019s where government steps in. For the good of struggling Americans and the ailing economy, government can order employers to pay a living wage. To create jobs and stimulate the economy, government can invest in infrastructure. As during the Great Depression, a government of the people, by the people, for the people can act for the benefit of the majority of the people.\n\nRepublicans oppose that. They prefer the failed trickle-down economics that sunk the middle class. So on November 4, vote to ship them home. Retailers, bankers and workers across America will thank you.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4201\"", "article_summary": "Wall Street and Major Retailers Agree That Inequality is Killing Us.\nRepublicans continue to stand alone in the fight for income inequality.\nEarlier this year, for example, Gap Inc. and IKEA announced plans to raise their workers\u2019 wages to at least $10 an hour.\nNow that Wall Street and Main Street have endorsed Democratic economic principals to reduce inequality for the sake of the economy, voting Nov. 4 is easy.\nThen there\u2019s the August report from rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s titled: How Increasing Income Inequality Is Dampening U.S. Economic Growth, And Possible Ways To Change The Tide."}
