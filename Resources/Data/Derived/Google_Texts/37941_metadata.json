If you look at the number that have been killed by gun violence, it\u2019s in the tens of thousands...For us not to be able to resolve that issue has been something that is distressing, but it is not something that I intend to stop working on in the remaining 18 months.\"\n\nFirst, it is complete nonsense when Obama says the \"United States is the one advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient, common-sense gun safety laws.\" The U.S. has hundreds of gun laws on the books both at the state and federal levels. Further, there are no laws that aren't already in place that could prevent the type of \"gun-violence\" Obama refers to. Second, when President Obama refers to the \"tens-of-thousands\" of people killed by \"gun-violence,\" he's being extremely disingenuous by a) failing to point out that majority are suicides b) the majority of the remaining occur in very specific parts of the country like Chicago, a city that has the strictest gun control measures around. Third, Americans should be concerned about what Obama is working on to implement more gun control without Congress. Earlier this week we saw report about the administration using the Social Security Administration to put people who need help managing their benefits on the no-gun buy list. We've already seen this type of government overreach implemented at Veterans Administration hospitals and clinics across the country.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that a recent Pew Research Center poll shows more Americans believe gun rights should be protected while fewer believe more gun control should be implemented.\n\nThanks to RCP for the video.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vows to do more. .05/26/2016 6:12:47AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Vows to do more.", "title": "- Obama Says He's \"The Most Frustrated\" About His Gun Control Agenda Being Stopped", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/07/24/obama-whines-about-his-gun-control-agenda-being-stopped-n2029953", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/197/2015-07-16T215143Z_1_LYNXNPEB6F17Q_RTROPTP_3_USA-SHOOTING-TENNESSEE-OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Vows to do more.", "title": "- Obama Says He's \"The Most Frustrated\" About His Gun Control Agenda Being Stopped", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/07/24/obama-whines-about-his-gun-control-agenda-being-stopped-n2029953", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/197/2015-07-16T215143Z_1_LYNXNPEB6F17Q_RTROPTP_3_USA-SHOOTING-TENNESSEE-OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama Says He's \"The Most Frustrated\" About His Gun Control Agenda Being Stopped , Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaca6\"", "article_summary": "Third, Americans should be concerned about what Obama is working on to implement more gun control without Congress.\nThe U.S. has hundreds of gun laws on the books both at the state and federal levels.\nFinally, it should be noted that a recent Pew Research Center poll shows more Americans believe gun rights should be protected while fewer believe more gun control should be implemented.\n\"And if you look at the number of Americans killed since 9/11 by terrorism, it\u2019s less than 100.\nWith just a year and a half left to go for his time at the White House, President Obama is telling the BBC what his greatest frustration has been as commander-in-chief: having his gun control agenda \"stymied.\""}
