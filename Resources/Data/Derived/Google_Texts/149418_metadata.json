A review of the speech from some historical remove must concede that Obama did not, in fact, say all that much. It was an oration full of lofty rhetoric, and much of it was pleasing at the time. The effusive praise that the speech received in the press, however, was artificial and fabricated by a media culture that wanted the address to mean more than it did.\n\nIt is forgotten that this speech was delivered in response to the discovery of inflammatory remarks made by Obama\u2019s long-time pastor Jerimiah Wright. The president might have hoped that he could have ignored race in the 2008 campaign, save for occasionally acknowledging his supposed ability to transcend race. In the minds of millions, Obama did rise above the thorny issue of racial tensions, and many justifiably believed what they read in the press. Maybe the future president could expunge what Obama called the \u201coriginal sin of slavery?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth blacks and whites carry enormous expectations for Mr. Obama,\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported in the wake of the president\u2019s election. \u201cA post-election Gallup poll found that 70% of voters think race relations will improve with his election, compared with 56% who thought so five months ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany blacks believe Mr. Obama will not only change the way whites see blacks but also the way blacks see themselves \u2014 that blacks will shed the stigma of inferiority that has haunted them since slavery, that Mr. Obama will give inner-city black kids new hope and blacks everywhere more opportunity,\u201d the report continued.\n\nThese words and the failed promise they now represent are today heartrendingly tragic. Obama might be due some measure of sympathy for failing to live up to the impossible expectations imposed on him by the media, but he did not do anything to dispel the notion that he could serve as a savior who would offer the country absolution for its racial transgressions.\n\nBy 2009, faith in Obama\u2019s ability to lead the country toward harmonious and neighborly relations across racial boundaries was ebbing. \u201cCurrently, 41% of Americans believe race relations have gotten better since Obama\u2019s win; another 35% think they have not changed, while 22% say they have gotten worse,\u201d Gallup reported in the autumn of 2009. \u201cLast November, 70% thought race relations would improve as a result of the landmark outcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty-three percent of blacks and 39% of whites think relations have improved overall, but only 11% of blacks and 7% of whites think they have improved a lot,\u201d the poll read.\n\nToday, Obama is a lame duck, and his administration is seen as no more post-racial than any of his predecessors.\n\n\u201cAssessments on how President Obama, the first African-American elected to the White House, is handling race relations have soured a bit,\u201d a USA Today survey released on Tuesday revealed. \u201cIn a poll in August, before the two police incidents, Americans approved of how he was doing on race issues, 48%-42%. Now his disapproval rating on that issue has jumped by 10 points, to 50% disapprove, 40% approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s approval on handling race relations had dropped among whites to 33% from 42%. It also has dropped by double digits among blacks, although the small sample sizes make it hard to be precise,\u201d the report continued.\n\nIt is strange that USA Today\u2019s editors would decline to provide Obama\u2019s approval rating on race among African-American respondents even despite the small sample size (a feature of all polling subgroups). USA Today\u2019s Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page had no such qualms. \u201c33% of whites, 57% of blacks now approve of Obama\u2019s handling of race relations,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\n\nObama long ago gave up trying to play the role of racial healer. The low marks he is receiving from voters has much to do with the heightened racial tensions arising from events that merely occurred under his watch; the trial of George Zimmerman, and the riots and protests which followed non-indictments in two cases in which unarmed black men were killed by police.\n\nBut Obama is not blameless for the present state of racial tensions. When it served his campaign, his political operatives incubated a toxic form of victimhood in 2012. The president did nothing to tamp down poisonous concept of coded racism, a practice in which liberals parse ordinary comments with the aim of divining latent racism. The willow witching of prejudice from everyday occurrences and statements became a favored pastime for Obama supporters during his campaign, and it was irresponsible to allow this rampant practice to continue. But the Obama campaign did nothing to stop it.\n\nAs recently as the spring, Obama\u2019s U.S. Attorney General implied before an audience of Al Sharpton supporters that both he and the president are subject to racially motivated opposition from the Republican members of the Congress of the United States. When it suits them, the administration is perfectly happy to indulge in a little agitation of their own on matters relating to race. As such, they deserve quite a bit of the blame for the present lamentable state of affairs.\n\nWhen it matters, and when racial violence appears imminent, Obama often adopts the right tone. But all the tone in the world cannot account for the administration\u2019s exploitation of racial tensions when it suited their interests. They deserve the public\u2019s indifference and the rebuke of historians who appraise this woeful period of American history honestly.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Tragic.", "title": "Americans think Obama failed to live up to his promise on race relations", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/12/09/americans-think-obama-failed-to-live-up-to-his-promise-on-race-relations/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-09T17:01:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-09T16:45:37+00:00"}, "keywords": "2008, 2014, Barack Obama, race,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Americans think Obama failed to live up to his promise on race relationsposted at 12:01 pm on December 9, 2014 by Noah RothmanThe expectation that Barack Obama would reshape American race relations for the better were perhaps never higher than in March of 2008 when, as a candidate, Obama delivered his much-anticipated speech on race.\n\u201cAssessments on how President Obama, the first African-American elected to the White House, is handling race relations have soured a bit,\u201d a USA Today survey released on Tuesday revealed.\n\u201c33% of whites, 57% of blacks now approve of Obama\u2019s handling of race relations,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\n\u201cLast November, 70% thought race relations would improve as a result of the landmark outcome.\u201d\u201cFifty-three percent of blacks and 39% of whites think relations have improved overall, but only 11% of blacks and 7% of whites think they have improved a lot,\u201d the poll read.\nBy 2009, faith in Obama\u2019s ability to lead the country toward harmonious and neighborly relations across racial boundaries was ebbing."}
