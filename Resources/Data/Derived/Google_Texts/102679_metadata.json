And life at the supermax prison, the defense said, is anything but pleasant -- as Tsarnaev would be locked in a cell 23 hours a day and receive extremely limited privileges.\n\nThe defense's intention is to get jurors to understand that life imprisonment at the supermax facility is punishment enough for their client, and death is unnecessary.\n\nProsecutors, though, responded by saying there is absolutely no guarantee Tsarnaev would end up at the Colorado prison -- and that, over time, additional privileges can be earned.\n\nRELATED Poll: Most Bostonians oppose death penalty for marathon bomber\n\nA recent poll indicated that most Boston residents oppose giving Tsarnaev the death penalty. The Richards family, whose 8-year-old son, Martin, was one of three killed in the bombings, said last month they also oppose executing Tsarnaev.\n\nAccording to a court document, the defense plans next to call noted anti-death penalty advocate Sister Helen Prejean to testify Thursday, NBC News reported. During the early 1980s, Prejean campaigned against capital punishment for Louisiana inmate Patrick Sonnier in a case that was ultimately told in the 1995 film Dead Man Walking, starring Sean Penn.\n\nProsecutors said they plan to file a motion to prevent Prejean from testifying.\n\nFrom the start, defense attorneys' ultimate goal was to spare Tsarnaev the death penalty. During the trial and the penalty phase, the lawyers attempted to paint Tsarnaev as a young man who was swayed to terrorism by his radical older brother, Tamerlan, who was killed as police attempted to apprehend the pair four days after the bombings.\n\nTsarnaev's defense could rest its case Thursday, analysts say, after three weeks of testimony. Two more witnesses, including Prejean, are all that remain on the defense's witness list. Tsarnaev is not expected to take the stand.\n\nJurors also heard testimony Wednesday from a medical expert who said the brain is often still developing at the age of 19, opening the door for defense lawyers to argue that Tsarnaev was effectively a very young man who was severely manipulated by his older brother. Dzhokhar was 19 at the time of the bombings and Tamerlan was 26.\n\nDefense attorneys also argued that a life imprisonment sentence is better for the country, because Tsarnaev wouldn't be executed for a number of years and he would remain in the public spotlight for much of that time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Attorneys and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- who was convicted last month of the Boston bombings -- are still going to court to determine what will happen to him now.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Attorneys and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- who was convicted last month of the Boston bombings -- are still going to court to determine what will happen to him now.", "title": "Jurors hear arguments for, against death penalty for Boston bomber", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2015/05/07/Jurors-hear-arguments-for-against-death-penalty-for-Boston-bomber/9241430981479/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/9241430981479/2015/1/6657dd041b9a780e90728983d2a8a87a/v2.1/Jurors-hear-arguments-for-against-death-penalty-for-Boston-bomber.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/9241430981479/2015/upi/6657dd041b9a780e90728983d2a8a87a/v2.1/Jurors-hear-arguments-for-against-death-penalty-for-Boston-bomber.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Attorneys and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- who was convicted last month of the Boston bombings -- are still going to court to determine what will happen to him now.", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jurors hear arguments for, against death penalty for Boston bomber"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., Sean Penn, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, P.
