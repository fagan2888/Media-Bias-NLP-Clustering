I really do. I like the concept,\" she added. \"But I'm concerned (about) what happens after three years. We don't know if it's going to be another debacle.\"\n\nAt a school board meeting Thursday, the Clark County Education Association, which represents the teachers, unveiled what little information it had about the controversial proposal to overturn control of the trust to locally based health care delivery firm WellHealth and a third-party administrator.\n\nThe plan would decrease from 5.800 health care providers currently operating with the trust to about 5,200, according to WellHealth representatives. Deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums and co-pays largely would remain the same, or even get cheaper, provided members seek services within the WellHealth network.\n\nBut WellHealth representatives also struggled to answer basic questions from trustees, including how much premiums will rise and where it will find cost savings to prevent the trust's implosion.\n\nThose details, said Steven Keltie, president of business, development and marketing for WellHealth, depend on how much money the Clark County School District provides to keep the trust afloat.\n\nUnder one option provided to the board, the district's contribution for each member's monthly premium would rise by $24.24, at a cost of about $900,000 a month or nearly $11 million a year. Another option would require plan changes for members, or a mix of both. Changes to district funding for teacher health costs are subject to ongoing contract negotiations with the union.\n\nWellHealth representatives insisted any of those options would allow the trust to eliminate its deficit within three years, but trustees remained cautious about approving such a vague plan.\n\n\"It feels like we're in a Catch-22,\" said District G Trustee Erin Cranor. \"If we approve the plan design and the network and we don't know the money side \u2014 unless the district subsidizes (the trust) at $900,000 a month, the plan design gets redesigned.\n\n\"So we will have approved a plan design, but then we'll have to redesign the plan.\"\n\nThe board took no action Thursday, but if it eventually approves the union's proposal, all contracts currently issued through the trust will roll over to WellHealth on Jan. 1, with open enrollment starting Oct. 17.\n\nContact Neal Morton at nmorton@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0279.
