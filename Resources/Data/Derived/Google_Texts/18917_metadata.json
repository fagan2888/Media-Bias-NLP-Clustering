( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nThe first of 7,000 to 8,000 little rubber ducks racing down the Big Thompson River Saturday broke a record.\n\nThe yellow plastic duck belonging to Brittany Ruggler raced from the Railroad Avenue bridge to the bridge near the splash park in Fairgrounds Park in eight minutes.\n\n\"There's a lot of fast ducks this year. The river's running fast,\" said Dave Mills, a member of the Loveland Rotary Club tasked with scooping up the ducks and dumping the first few dozen into a white bucket to separate out the winners from the rest that went into blue bins.\n\nThe Loveland Rotary duck race is one of many offerings during the 32nd annual, two-day Old Fashioned Corn Roast Festival that celebrates the crop with a parade, corn-eating and corn-shucking contests, and music, food and brews. This year, the festival is themed Loveland Strong in remembrance of the September 2013 flooding.\n\nThe festival, which had been held at Fairgrounds Park for several years until last year, relocated to downtown Loveland to Fourth Street and Railroad Avenue. The result was a smaller crowd for the duck race.\n\n\"We like it here better, because more people have the opportunity to watch the race, because they're already here for the Corn Roast,\" said Lynn Matson, co-chairman of the duck race committee. \"It's a half-mile from downtown.\"\n\nThe launching place for the little ducks used to be a half-mile further up the river, but the Rotarians wanted more people to see the racing ducks, said John Stewart, co-chairman of the duck race committee with Matson.\n\n\"It's about watching the Big Thompson River turn yellow with ducks,\" Stewart said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ducks moved faster this year, likely due to the after-effects of the September 2013 flood, Stewart said.\n\n\"We probably have faster waters. It looks faster to us,\" he said. \"There's probably less trash in it, too. It probably got cleaned out from the flood.\"\n\nAt 4 p.m., the Rotarians released 67 big ducks, many of them painted or in costume, into the river. It took 10 minutes for the duck sponsored by Rocky Mountain Quick Lube to cross the finish line after following a course into a narrow river current for the last leg of the race.\n\nThe first five big ducks to cross the line earned ribbons.\n\nAt 4:10 p.m., the Rotarians sent out the little ducks, so that the first 70 to cross the finish line were prize winners, with the top four winning cash prizes of $250 to $1,000. The other three winners were Tom Slezak, Elaine Tutcher and Judy Scudamore.\n\n\"I just want to grab them to help them win the race,\" said Anthony Infante, 9, of Loveland, who watched the race at the finish line.\n\nGene and Ellen Thomerson of Loveland came to the race for the first time this year.\n\n\"It's so amazing. We keep thinking it's coming to an end, and they keep coming,\" Ellen said.\n\nThe Rotarians expect to net $32,000 from the race to be used toward the dictionary program, where every third grader living within Thompson School District receives a free dictionary. Anything above the cost of the program will go toward the club's high school scholarship program.\n\nContact Reporter-Herald Staff Writer Shelley Widhalm at 970-669-5050 or swidhalm@reporter-herald.com.
