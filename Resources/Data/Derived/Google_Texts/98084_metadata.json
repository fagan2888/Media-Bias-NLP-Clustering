This law is unnecessary, intrusive and an attempt to replace [parents] as the authority on their child.\u201d\n\nBut Commissioner Mike Williams, who was part of the unanimous vote for the ordinance, says it\u2019s about healthier kids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar to school lunch where they used to take ketchup as a vegetable,\u201d he said. \u201cOur health officers have been working with our day cares to create a healthier environment. It\u2019s about good nutritious food in day cares.\u201d\n\nAsked how he responds to suggestions it may be overreaching, Williams says the city has the authority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like any other licensed facility, whether it\u2019s a store or bar or restaurant,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like lunches in schools. We have similar oversight over any facility. I don\u2019t see it as overreach.\u201d\n\nNewly elected commissioner Dave Piepkorn disagrees.\n\n\u201cIf I would have been there I would have made a lot more of it, and I definitely wouldn\u2019t have voted for it,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously obesity is a concern, but I think the government involvement is too much. Especially with day cares, I think that\u2019s the parent\u2019s responsibility.\u201d\n\nPiepkorn was elected to the commission in June but had not been seated yet when the ordinance was voted on. He said the ordinance was rushed through so he wouldn\u2019t get a vote.\n\n\u201cI think there was a lot of that stuff they were trying to shovel through before I got there.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the commission has pushed stringent new ordinances addressing child health.\u201d\n\nPiepkorn said in May the commission passed an ordinance requiring all children older than 1 \u201cbe scheduled to participate in at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day,\u201d with children 3 and older getting at least 30 minutes of \u201cstructured and guided physical activity.\u201d\n\n\u201cToddlers and preschool-age children shall not be sedentary or sit passively for more than 60 minutes continuously, except when sleeping.\u201d\n\nThese ordinances apply only to day care facilities that are required to be inspected by the the North Dakota Department of Human Services. Family day-care centers operating in private residences with no more than seven children at a time do no have to comply. t\n\nRead More on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fargo is cracking down on juice consumption in day cares facilities.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Fargo is cracking down on juice consumption in day cares facilities.", "title": "Fargo Limits How Much Juice Day-Care Kids Can Drink", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140718_JuiceAbuse_Watchdog.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1zRBjHX"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Fargo is cracking down on juice consumption in day cares facilities.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140718_JuiceAbuse_Watchdog.jpg"}, "title": "Fargo Limits How Much Juice Day-Care Kids Can Drink", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2014-07-18T14:28:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "regulations, fargo, day care, juice, natural juice, diet"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde945\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMy day care reports to me my son\u2019s activities and what he consumes, and if my day care is not performing up to my standards, then the free-market solution is to fire them.\nFARGO, N.D. \u2014 Fargo is cracking down on juice consumption in day cares facilities.\nFamily day-care centers operating in private residences with no more than seven children at a time do no have to comply.\nTony Gehrig, who campaigned for a seat on the commission but lost in June, says these ordinances go too far.\n\u201cI am the authority on my child\u2019s well-being, not our city commissioners,\u201d he told Watchdog."}
