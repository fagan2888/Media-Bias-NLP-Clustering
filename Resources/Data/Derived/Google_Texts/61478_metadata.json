Thus, it imposed only a temporary \u201cmoratorium\u201d on new taxes on Internet access and protected existing taxes through a \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause.\n\nCongressional extensions of ITFA in 2001, 2004, and 2007 maintained those two key features. This latest ITFA legislation, though, eliminates both \u2014 the first time Congress has seriously considered doing so.\n\nEvery state would feel the impact. The seven states with taxes would start losing revenues this year, forcing some to cut services or raise other taxes to keep their budgets balanced. The remaining states would continue to lose as much as $6.5 billion in potential revenue each year from their inability to tax Internet access charges.\n\nThe forgone revenue would likely grow substantially over time as more people sign up for Internet access and current subscribers trade up to faster, more expensive, service.\n\nThe House bill would have other, unintended effects. Eliminating the grandfather, for example, would put at risk numerous other state and local taxes that Internet access providers pay on the things they buy in order to provide Internet service, such fiber-optic cable, or gasoline for their vehicles. Almost all of these taxes existed before 1998, so the grandfather protects them from legal challenge. But if Congress eliminates the clause, Internet access providers could challenge these taxes in court as indirect taxes on access service and therefore voided by ITFA.\n\nThe bill\u2019s proponents argue that banning taxes on Internet access charges is necessary to close the \u201cdigital divide\u201d between low- and high-income households. Keeping monthly Internet access as inexpensive as possible by exempting it from roughly $2-$4 in taxes will encourage low-income people to subscribe and service providers to extend broadband service to low-income neighborhoods, they claim.\n\nBut there\u2019s scant evidence to support this argument. Studies haven\u2019t found a significant difference, in either the share of households with broadband or the availability of broadband service, between states that tax access and those that don\u2019t. And numerous studies find that Internet access costs are a smaller cause of the \u201cdigital divide\u201d than unfamiliarity with computers and the Internet and a belief that the Internet is irrelevant to the person\u2019s life.\n\nIn fact, a permanent ITFA would likely impede the goal of getting more people online \u2014 especially low-income people who don\u2019t have Internet at home. Many people first use the Internet in public schools, libraries, and community centers, all of which rely on state and local tax revenue. The less state and local revenue that such institutions receive, the less they could provide Internet service.\n\nSome in Congress argue that states and localities should accept a permanent ITFA as part of a deal that would also include enactment of the Marketplace Fairness Act, which would empower states to require large Internet merchants to charge sales tax on all taxable sales. Any extension of the moratorium, however, must include the grandfather clause. Eliminating that clause would threaten to invalidate many existing taxes on Internet access providers, as noted earlier.\n\nCongress\u2019 proper course would be to end, not extend, the ban on state and local taxation of Internet access. The Internet is no longer an infant industry needing protection from taxes that apply to other services for which Internet access is a close substitute. Cable television service is widely taxed, for example, but if someone decides to pay Verizon $50 a month so that they can stream Netflix to their TV, ITFA bans the taxation of the access charge. This unequal treatment doesn\u2019t makes sense.\n\nEven if Congress wants to renew ITFA, surely the terms should be no more favorable than in 1998 \u2014 a temporary exemption for taxes on access service, with pre-1998 taxes still grandfathered \u2014 and must include the Marketplace Fairness Act, which the Senate has passed with broad bipartisan support.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Congress\u2019 proper course would be to end, not extend, the ban on state and local taxation of Internet access.", "description": "Congress\u2019 proper course would be to end, not extend, the ban on state and local taxation of Internet access.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Congress\u2019 proper course would be to end, not extend, the ban on state and local taxation of Internet access.", "title": "Congress poised to slam states on Internet access charges", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/212002-congress-poised-to-slam-states-on-internet-access-charges", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/212002-congress-poised-to-slam-states-on-internet-access-charges", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-14T15:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Michael Mazerov", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-14T15:00:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/212002-congress-poised-to-slam-states-on-internet-access-charges", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Congress\u2019 proper course would be to end, not extend, the ban on state and local taxation of Internet access.", "card": "summary", "title": "Congress poised to slam states on Internet access charges"}, "dcterms.title": "Congress poised to slam states on Internet access charges"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce65d\"", "article_summary": "Thus, it imposed only a temporary \u201cmoratorium\u201d on new taxes on Internet access and protected existing taxes through a \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause.\nThe remaining states would continue to lose as much as $6.5 billion in potential revenue each year from their inability to tax Internet access charges.\nBut if Congress eliminates the clause, Internet access providers could challenge these taxes in court as indirect taxes on access service and therefore voided by ITFA.\nThe bill\u2019s proponents argue that banning taxes on Internet access charges is necessary to close the \u201cdigital divide\u201d between low- and high-income households.\nThe Internet is no longer an infant industry needing protection from taxes that apply to other services for which Internet access is a close substitute."}
