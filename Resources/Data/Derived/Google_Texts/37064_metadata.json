Even when government agencies attract top cyber professionals, they struggle to retain them.\n\nThe federal cyber force has suffered a spate of high-profile departures, including at the FBI, where a high-ranking investigator decamped for the private sector just this week.\n\nFederal officials most frequently cite budget constraints as their chief impediment to hiring talent, arguing they can\u2019t compete with the huge paydays available at tech companies.\n\nAn April study by the Partnership for Public Service found that senior-level cybersecurity employees in government earn between $24,000 and $33,000 less than those in the private sector. Federal entry-level workers in the field earn $8,000 to $14,000 less than private entry-level workers.\n\nBut the challenges go beyond a disparity in pay, because people attracted to government work aren\u2019t typically looking for a huge paycheck; some are drawn to public service and finding a compelling \u201cmission\u201d for their careers.\n\nBut in order to find their \u201cmission,\u201d those recruits have to survive a hiring process that is bureaucratic, arduous and slow, experts say.\n\nIn 2011, the hiring process for cybersecurity positions took an average of 50 days at the Department of Health and Human Services, and almost 130 days at the Treasury Department, according to a Government Accountability Office report.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) can grant direct-hiring authority, which allows agencies to speed up the process by eliminating some of the usual requirements when \u201cthere is a critical hiring need for a position or group of positions.\u201d\n\nThe OPM has granted agencies direct-hire authority for information security professionals, but there are other positions of critical importance for the government to fill, some say.\n\nMontana Williams, a senior manager of Cybersecurity Practices at the ISACA and former Homeland Security official, said many civilian agencies haven\u2019t taken full advantage of the exemption to federal hiring rules.\n\n\u201cWe have everything in place to do this the right way,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut agencies are failing to use existing rules that are already in place by OPM.\u201d\n\nThe onerous background check process is also an impediment, especially for intelligence and military agencies.\n\nHeather Lawrence, a young cybersecurity professional from the competitive University of Florida hacking team, said she considered public-sector employment. Lawrence told The Hill that based on the requirements these agencies presented at recruitment events, \u201cmany people were like, I feel like this is a waste of my time.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the weed question.\n\nCongress authorized the FBI last year to hire 2,000 new people, many of whom were earmarked for cyber jobs, but director James Comey told a Manhattan conference that he was hamstrung by the agency\u2019s three-year moratorium on marijuana use.\n\n\u201cI have to hire a great workforce to compete with those cyber criminals and some of those kids want to smoke weed on the way to the interview,\u201d Comey said.\n\nHiring experts are also concerned that the roles that agencies are trying to fill aren\u2019t clearly defined, meaning that the government has no way to accurately assess the strengths and weaknesses of its workforce.\n\nWithout an accurate assessment, the government is often putting the right people in the wrong jobs, Williams said.\n\nA generic job description will attract a vast swath of unqualified applicants, Williams noted. If one of those applicants has preference \u2014 if he or she is a veteran, for example \u2014 they might get hired even if \u201cthey don\u2019t necessarily have the skills to do the job.\u201d\n\nThis is also part of the reason the federal hiring process is so protracted: agencies have to wade through a huge swath of unqualified candidates. One official in human resources for the FBI described it as a \u201cfunneling process.\u201d\n\nAnd even if a high-quality candidate survives the screening process to land a federal job, he or she faces a unsure path to advancement focused on tenure \u2014 making the jump to the private sector much more attractive.\n\nSome agencies are moving to address the lack of merit-based promotions in the system.\n\nThe Department of Defense, for example, is reviewing a broad personnel reform document that an official confirmed would emphasize talent over seniority \u2014 including a revision to the pay table that would reward high-performing individuals in critical areas such as cybersecurity on a merit basis.\n\nWilliams also says that while there is a lot of federal funding earmarked for boosting the cybersecurity talent pipeline, not enough is spent on continuing education for the workforce that\u2019s already in place.\n\n\u201cThis is critically important in cybersecurity because cybersecurity skills are perishing,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The federal government is notoriously bad at hiring qualified cybersecurity professionals.", "description": "The federal government is notoriously bad at hiring qualified cybersecurity professionals.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Katie Bo Williams", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The federal government is notoriously bad at hiring qualified cybersecurity professionals.", "title": "Money, bureaucracy and weed: Why the feds are failing at cyber", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/251707-money-bureaucracy-and-weed-why-the-feds-are-failing-at-cyber", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/biz_cybersecuritystory.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/251707-money-bureaucracy-and-weed-why-the-feds-are-failing-at-cyber", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-24T06:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-24T06:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/251707-money-bureaucracy-and-weed-why-the-feds-are-failing-at-cyber", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The federal government is notoriously bad at hiring qualified cybersecurity professionals.", "card": "summary", "title": "Money, bureaucracy and weed: Why the feds are failing at cyber"}, "dcterms.title": "Money, bureaucracy and weed: Why the feds are failing at cyber"}, "article_summary": "The federal cyber force has suffered a spate of high-profile departures, including at the FBI, where a high-ranking investigator decamped for the private sector just this week.\nBut in order to find their \u201cmission,\u201d those recruits have to survive a hiring process that is bureaucratic, arduous and slow, experts say.\nThe skills gap has created a fierce competition for talent that the private sector is unquestionably winning.\nEven before the Office of Personnel Management breach that compromised the personal information of 21 million federal employees, demand for sophisticated cybersecurity talent was outpacing supply.\nFederal officials most frequently cite budget constraints as their chief impediment to hiring talent, arguing they can\u2019t compete with the huge paydays available at tech companies."}
