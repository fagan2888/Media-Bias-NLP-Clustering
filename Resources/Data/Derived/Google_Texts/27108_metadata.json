Less noticed, though, as Putin blasted the U.S. for \u201cmeddling\u201d in the affairs of international soccer, was a more grim piece of news: The Russian president has signed a new law that makes it illegal to reveal the death of Russian soldiers in peacetime.\n\nUnder near-universal condemnation for continued support of an armed uprising in Eastern Ukraine, Russia has consistently and forcefully denied that it has either soldiers or equipment in the war-torn country, part of which it invaded last year.\n\nRelated: A Bizarre Tale of Russia Concealing Its Soldiers\u2019 Deaths in Ukraine\n\nHowever, inconveniently for the Kremlin, corpses of Russian soldiers are being returned to their families bearing wounds that suggest death in a war zone. Journalists and, increasingly, the Russian public have been publicizing this fact and pushing back against the Kremlin\u2019s insistence that it has no troops deployed to Ukraine.\n\nNow, it appears, simply stating the simple fact that a Russian soldier is dead can land someone in jail.\n\nAccording to Agence-France Presse, the edict signed by Putin on Wednesday, declares that \u201cinformation revealing losses of personnel...in peacetime during special operations\u201d is now classified as a state secret.\n\nWhat constitutes a \u201cspecial operation\u201d under the law is not explained, presumably leaving prosecutors wide latitude in deciding whom to prosecute.\n\nRelated: Putin Isn\u2019t Reviving the USSR; He\u2019s Creating a Fascist State\n\n\u201cNot only is this decree a blatant attack on freedom of expression, it also has sinister undertones that will intensify speculation President Putin has something to hide \u2013 specifically losses incurred by Russia\u2019s military in Ukraine,\u201d said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International\u2019s Europe and Central Asia Director.\n\n\u201cThis new decree raises some disturbing questions, such as whether journalists and civil society activists reporting on alleged losses in Ukraine in future might be criminally prosecuted for treason,\u201d said Dalhuisen. \u201cIt also means families of soldiers killed during \u2018special operations\u2019 will be deprived of the truth about the fate of their loved ones.\u201d\n\nThe ruling lends new credence to a Bloomberg report, angrily denied by Moscow, that Russian forces have moved mobile crematoriums into Ukraine in order to dispose of the bodies of troops killed there.\n\nUntil the new edict was signed, it was unclear how cremating soldiers\u2019 corpses would benefit the Kremlin, given that friends and loved ones would inevitably realize that they had disappeared and raise concerns. However, now that publicizing a soldier\u2019s death is punishable by imprisonment, the possibility that cremation is being used to make it easier to transport bodies surreptitiously to obliterate war wounds appears more plausible.\n\nRelated: Putin Clamps Down on Russian Activists, Free Speech\n\nEarlier this month, a group of activists aligned with murdered opposition politician Boris Nemtsov came together to release a report that Nemtsov had been working on when he was gunned down just steps from the Kremlin. It had gathered evidence of Russian involvement in Ukraine and alleged that thousands of troops had been deployed there, with hundreds killed.\n\nOne of Nemtsov\u2019s allies who helped complete the report, journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr., was hospitalized in Moscow this week after collapsing in public. The possibility that he was poisoned has been raised, and his family is demanding a toxicology report.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies have, with little success, tried to convince the Russian people that there are no Russian troops fighting in Ukraine.
