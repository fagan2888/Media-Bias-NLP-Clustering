Tribal members from the north and as far as the southwest and Grand Canyon attended the event including: the Cuhuilla\u2019s from Riverside, California; Cocopah\u2019s from Arizona; the Hualapai and Havasupai from the Grand Canyon areas; Keowee\u2019s from Martinez, California; Maricopa\u2019s from Laveen, Arizona; the Mojave\u2019s from Needles, California; Yavapai-Apache Nation from Flagstaff, Arizona; and the Quechan\u2019s from Winterheaven, Arizona.\n\nThe day-long Gathering included a softball game; horseshoe tournament; bird dancing and singing, sharing meals, Peon tournaments and tribal booths. The tradition goes way back in the Kumeyaay history.\n\n\u201cThe Viejas Birdsingers\u2019 Gathering, like all of our gatherings, is a tradition to bring everyone together,\u201d said Ral Christman Sr. who emceed the event. \u201cThe happiness, the cheer and sharing is like a rejuvenation of the land and a yearly cleansing and a celebration to give thanks for all that we have.\u201d\n\nAnother focus of the event is for educational purposes. \u201cFor the older members it\u2019s a time to reminisce about old times they used to have when they gathered together,\u201d Christman said. \u201cFor young kids it\u2019s a time to come out and take part as they learn from the elders, and then someday they can teach it.\u201d\n\nThe Gathering is also the time when the event of crowning Miss Kumeyaay takes place. This year there were six contestants from various areas of the Kumeyaay nations. The winner was Toni Marie Dominguez from Santa Ysabel, California.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had a winner who has a parent from this side of the border and the other side of the border in Mexico,\u201d Christman said. \u201cThe United States government split our tribe in half, so to this day we still have several Kumeyaay reservations south of the border. That\u2019s where Toni\u2019s father was from. He has passed on; and her mother is from Santa Ysabel. So, through blood, the Kumeyaay winners are representing both the northern Kumeyaay nations and also those of Baja California.\u201d\n\nThe Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians held their annual Yucca Festival Gathering in the spring. Christman explained the Yucca Festival is about the Viejas community and is a time of harvesting to get ready for the summer months. The Birdsingers\u2019 Gathering \u2013 like the Pow Wows of other local tribes, Barona and Sycuan \u2013 is where they invite all communities on Kumeyaay land and tribes in the bird singing culture. Watching so many of the visitors on the Viejas reservation was very heartwarming and exciting to Christman.\n\n\u201cSo many things were special,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Miss Kumeyaay was announced, her friends and family came up to share in the celebration; and we saw communities from both the northern area and the Baja area come out and dance with her and all the past Miss Kumeyaay\u2019s.\u201d\n\nVirginia Christman, Elder, Past Vice Chairman of the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians, keeper of the tribe\u2019s cultured past and mother of Ral Christman, is a vibrant leader of these traditional celebrations. A teacher of bird dancing, she was forefront in teaching and participating with women young and old throughout the day.\n\n\u201cSome of the dances are from a long time ago,\u201d Ral Christman said. \u201cThe hand gestures of the ladies are re-creating a story that\u2019s thousands of years old. In doing the dances, they are walking in the steps of past generations. This is a sacred tradition to re-create stories through the songs about our migrations, morality, animals and nature. It\u2019s a giant metaphor for how we are supposed to act to each other, and kind of like a musical bible where there are stories and metaphorical and allegorical understandings; because it\u2019s not written, it\u2019s from oral our culture.\u201d\n\nChristman said it was exciting to see so many visitors from other tribes sharing in the Kumeyaay tradition. \u201cHearing or watching fast-paced songs talking about happy things; it was a great day. Our culture is really flourishing right now and coming back very strong.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An estimated crowd between 800 \u2013 1,000 attended the 16th annual Viejas Birdsingers\u2019 Gathering on August 16, 2014.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/20/viejas-birdsingers-gathering-shares-rich-traditions-156949", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/2._viejas_tribal_elder_virginia_christman_right_with_other_tribal_women_bird_dancing.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Viejas Birdsingers\u2019 Gathering Shares Rich Traditions"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-09-20T12:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Viejas Birdsingers\u2019 Gathering Shares Rich Traditions"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/20/viejas-birdsingers-gathering-shares-rich-traditions-156949", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Viejas Birdsingers, Viejas Birdsingers\u2019 Gathering, Cuhuilla Indians, Cocopah Indians, Hualapai Indians, Havasupai Indians, Keowee, Maricopa Indians, Mojave Indians, Yavapai-Apache Nation, Quechan, Kumeyaay, Toni Marie Dominguez, Ral Christman Sr., Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians, Yucca Festival Gathering, Miss Kumeyaay, Diana Saenger", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Viejas Birdsingers\u2019 Gathering Shares Rich Traditions"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8a1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Viejas Birdsingers\u2019 Gathering, like all of our gatherings, is a tradition to bring everyone together,\u201d said Ral Christman Sr. who emceed the event.\nAn estimated crowd between 800 \u2013 1,000 attended the 16th annual Viejas Birdsingers\u2019 Gathering on August 16, 2014.\n\u201cSome of the dances are from a long time ago,\u201d Ral Christman said.\nThe day-long Gathering included a softball game; horseshoe tournament; bird dancing and singing, sharing meals, Peon tournaments and tribal booths.\nWatching so many of the visitors on the Viejas reservation was very heartwarming and exciting to Christman."}
