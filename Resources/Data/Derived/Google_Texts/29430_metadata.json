This trip is part of our ongoing effort to maintain direct lines of communication with senior Russian officials and to ensure U.S. views are clearly conveyed.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Shiny New Tank Breaks Down\n\nNot so fast, said the Kremlin.\n\nEarly Monday evening Moscow time, Putin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Moscow radio station that no decision had been made about Putin\u2019s participation in the meeting. \u201cWe will let you know if such a meeting takes place,\u201d he said, according to government-run news site Sputnik.\n\nThe gamesmanship didn\u2019t end there. On Monday, according to the Associated Press, the Russian foreign ministry released a statement saying that the meetings were part of a bid to \u201cnormalize bilateral relations on which global stability largely depends,\u201d while at the same time accusing the U.S. of causing the current crisis in Ukraine by trying to \u201cisolate\u201d Russia.\n\n\u201cWe emphatically raise the issue of the need to resolve the problems created by Washington in our bilateral agenda,\u201d the statement said.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Got a Cool New Tank: How Many Can He Afford?\n\nThe claim gets at the justification used by some who defend Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula last year as a necessary step caused by an increasingly Western orientation of countries in Eastern Europe that were once part of the Soviet Union.\n\nRussia has seen moves by the U.S. and its allies to encourage the opening of Eastern European economies to increased trade and overall closer relations with Western countries as a sort of aggression by non-military means. The idea that Ukraine, long part of Russia, might turn to the West made Russia fear a loss of both influence over a key neighbor, and potentially one of the major port for its Black Sea fleet. As a result, the argument goes, Russia had no strategic choice but to invade Crimea, securing the port of Sevastopol and destabilizing Ukraine in a single blow.\n\nOf course, few in the West would accept that logic, much less allow that it justifies the invasion of a sovereign country, which partly explains why relations between the West and Moscow are so strained these days.\n\nRelated: Ukraine \u2013 Top U.S General Says Russia-Backed Rebels Ready to Strike\n\nKerry will have a full agenda when he meets with Lavrov \u2013 and maybe Putin \u2013 tomorrow. In addition to the status of Ukraine, he is expected to address the ongoing humanitarian disaster in Syria, where Russia has been supportive of President Bashar al Assad\u2019s brutal defense of his regime against Syrian citizens seeking democratic rule. The topic of continued negotiations with Iran over the status of its nuclear program \u2013 talks in which Russia has played an important role despite ongoing tension surrounding other matters \u2013 is also expected to be discussed.\n\nKerry has not been to Russia since 2013, before the current tensions arose. During that visit he met with both Putin and Lavrov.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s visit to Russia Tuesday hit its first snag before he e", "title": "Putin May Be a No-Show During Kerry Visit to Russia", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/11/Putin-May-Be-No-Show-During-Kerry-Visit-Russia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03182014_Putin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/11/Putin-May-Be-No-Show-During-Kerry-Visit-Russia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03182014_Putin.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s visit to Russia Tuesday hit its first snag before he e", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb70f\"", "article_summary": "Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s visit to Russia Tuesday hit its first snag before he even arrived in the resort town of Sochi for meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\nKerry has not been to Russia since 2013, before the current tensions arose.\nDuring that visit he met with both Putin and Lavrov.\nEarly Monday evening Moscow time, Putin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Moscow radio station that no decision had been made about Putin\u2019s participation in the meeting.\nRelated: Ukraine \u2013 Top U.S General Says Russia-Backed Rebels Ready to StrikeKerry will have a full agenda when he meets with Lavrov \u2013 and maybe Putin \u2013 tomorrow."}
