On Sunday, Mattress Now in Panama City Beach hosted their first "Puppies and Pillows" event.

While it may seem like an unusual combination, the store owner, Karen Hale, said she wanted to do what she could to help raise money for the Humane Society of Bay County.

Several adoptable pups were outside the store during the event and one lucky dog found a forever home.

Event goers or passersby, on the hunt for a new mattress, took home a brand new pillow for their donations.

"Animals have always been in my heart," owner Karen Hale said. "If I think of anything that I ever want to do or donate to or give money to, animals come to my mind first, so it's really what I feel."

Hale said 10 percent of the store's proceeds this month will go to the county's humane society.

Hale said she plans to host another Puppies and Pillows event in the future.
