I\u2019m not trying to compete with AT&T and Charter,\u201d Haines said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to offer something where there wasn\u2019t anything.\u201d\n\nIn the past two years, Haines, who offers wireless broadband, said he has built 28 towers in his region, as well as other infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI expand into new areas everyday as more people learn about us,\u201d said Haines, the sole employee of America Internet and Communications.\n\nHaines told Tennessee Watchdog his business covers 70 percent of the county.\n\nHaines has about 250 customers. His business seems contrary to the conventional wisdom that most of Bradley County is in the sticks, relying on fumes and dial-up to get online.\n\nAs reported, officials with the Chattanooga-based Electric Power Board, a government utility that offers ultra high-speed Internet, have made such comments in the recent past.\n\nEPB officials successfully lobbied the Federal Communications Commission to override a state law that kept them from expanding outside municipal boundaries.\n\nThese officials repeatedly said Internet is infrastructure, comparable to an Interstate, and these rural areas need more than dial-up for economic development.\n\nHaines said he doesn\u2019t necessarily have the most technologically advanced service \u2014 even though it\u2019s more advanced than dial-up \u2014 yet a move into Bradley County by EPB would place his business is in serious trouble.\n\n\u201cI started my business in 1998,\u201d Haines said. \u201cI was there before Comcast and EPB and before AT&T. I managed to work with Comcast, but when EPB came in they decided to take over. They took all but 30 of my customers and would not open their network for us to use.\u201d\n\nEPB spokesman John Pless said Monday it won\u2019t expand without legislative approval.\n\n\u201cIf that occurs, we have researched a small area with about 800 homes at the edge of our current service territory that would serve as a test,\u201d Pless said.\n\n\u201cEPB will only consider expanding into an area if we receive an official letter of request from local elected officials. At that point, we would need to complete a business plan to determine the feasibility of moving forward.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Haines\u2019 situation, Pless said Haynes has yet to reach those 800 homes.\n\nEPB CEO Harold DePriest reportedly said the expansion would serve almost 1,000 people, about 800 of whom have no option other than dial-up.\n\nDePriest has reportedly said expanding into the county would cost between $50 to $60 million \u2014 throughout all of Bradley County \u2014and taxpayer money would fund none of it.\n\nPless said EPB would make that money solely off revenue from services it provides, none of it backed by taxpayer or electric ratepayer money.\n\nEPB accepted $111 million in federal stimulus money from taxpayers to create their government-owned ultra-high speed Internet service to compete against private providers in Chattanooga.\n\nJustin Owen, president of the Nashville-based Beacon Center of Tennessee, a free-market think tank, said Monday government-owned Internet is problematic.\n\n\u201cBe careful what you wish for,\u201d Owen said.\n\n\u201cIf you want the Obamacare of the Internet, then that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get.\u201d\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org\n\nFollow Tennessee Watchdog and receive regular updates through Facebook and Twitter\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
