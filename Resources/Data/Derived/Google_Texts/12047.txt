President Obama got a bout of good news ahead of the Christmas holiday with a new poll showing his approval rating at 48 percent — his highest rating in CNN/ORC polling since May 2013.

Half of Americans still disapprove of the president’s job performance, but the uptick provides a glimmer of hope heading into the new year for a president who, after seeing his party suffer losses at the polls in November’s midterms, decided to move recently on big-ticket agenda items like immigration and moving to normalize relations with Cuba.

Fifty-six of respondents still said Mr. Obama has fallen short of their expectations and 49 percent said his policies would take the country in the wrong direction.

But for the first time in seven years, a majority of Americans — 51 percent — also say they have a positive view of the economy, up from 38 percent in October.

The government reported on Tuesday that third-quarter GDP grew at an annual rate of 5 percent, which was up 1.1 percentage points from November’s initial estimate.

The survey of 1,011 adults was taken Dec. 18-21.
