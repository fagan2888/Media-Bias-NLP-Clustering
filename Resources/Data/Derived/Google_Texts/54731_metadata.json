Trump phoned in to the Fox & Friends morning talk show at 7:30 to get in a pre-emptive \u201cI told you so.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Big Reveal on Immigration Plan Is Just More Empty Words\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who says you\u2019ve got to start uncoupling from China because China\u2019s got problems. They have big problems, and they\u2019re bringing us down,\u201d Trump said, to the apparently unanimous agreement of the three hosts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking about China for years,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cYears,\u201d Fox host Steve Doocy echoed, nodding his head in agreement.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s going bad and it\u2019s going to bring us down too because we\u2019re so heavily coupled with China,\u201d Trump added. \u201cLook, we are being run by people who don\u2019t have a clue, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re totally incompetent.

He ended with the instruction: \u201cVote Trump.\u201d\n\nMarkets are crashing - all caused by poor planning and allowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda. This could get very messy! Vote Trump. \u2014 Donald J.
