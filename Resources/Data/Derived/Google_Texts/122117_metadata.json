He\u2019s suggested that the suit would not be launched by individual congressional members but by the House as a bloc through an authorizing resolution, similar to last July\u2019s Obamacare challenge . Courts seem more agreeable to the resolution route when granting legal standing, which has always been a difficult area in congressional suits. But the case law in this area is far from certain, and Boehner and his attorneys should be fully prepared for a tough fight.\n\nA big question the courts haven\u2019t directly tackled is to what extent congressional plaintiffs are required to show \u201cinstitutional injury\u201d in order to get the judge to hear their full case. When congressional members have sued individually claiming institutional injury, they\u2019ve generally had to show that their votes were completely \u201cnullified,\u201d meaning that they have no recourse outside a lawsuit and that there was \u201cactual confrontation\u201d with the executive.\n\nSo far, in cases where the House passed a resolution to sue, the courts haven\u2019t followed a \u201cvoter nullification\u201d inquiry, because the complaint has \u201cinstitutional authorization.\u201d What may be a problem, however, is that in each of those cases the institutional harm in question involved a party (such as the White House or a corporation) refusing to abide by a congressional subpoena. In such cases, when Congress\u2019s request for documents or witness testimony is refused, it\u2019s obvious that their congressional powers have been nullified and that they have little recourse except to sue.\n\nIf Boehner\u2019s team is required to jump this nullification hurdle, two relatively recent cases involving suits by individual members will be key. In Raines v. Byrd (1997), six individual members claimed that the Line Item Veto Act, which let the president \u201ccancel\u201d items in congressionally passed appropriations bills, \u201cdilute[d] their Article I voting power.\u201d The court ruled that this was a mere \u201cabstract dilution of institutional legislative power\u201d and that they had to show a more concrete example of voter nullification.\n\nCentral to the court\u2019s argument was that the vote of the six plaintiffs against the bill had been \u201cgiven full effect\u201d and that they had \u201csimply lost that vote.\u201d Further, the court said, the members could have \u201crepealed the Act\u201d or \u201cexempted appropriations bills from its reach.\u201d The Line Item Veto Act would seem to offer little analogy to Obama\u2019s amnesty memos, however, and as the Congressional Research Service has noted, Raines did not \u201celiminate a Member\u2019s ability to establish standing to challenge an executive action.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Raines court, crucially the six plaintiffs failed to show that they voted against a specific bill, that there were sufficient votes to kill it, and that it was nonetheless implemented by the executive. This would appear to apply to the DREAM Act, which was killed 24 times in Congress but nonetheless implemented by the executive through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. In addition, Boehner\u2019s attorneys could apply the reasoning in Raines to the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) \u2014 specifically, to the memo that effectively nullifies section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which prohibits citizen minors from sponsoring illegal-alien parents for visas.\n\nSignificantly for Boehner, the Raines court did \u201cattach some importance\u201d to the fact that the six plaintiffs had not been authorized by way of a House resolution. This was also reiterated in Campbell v. Clinton (2000), a case more analogous to the amnesty-memo context because it involved an executive action rather than an act of Congress. That case involved 31 congressmen suing President Clinton for allegedly violating the War Powers Clause by directing U.S. troops to commit airstrikes on Yugoslavia without congressional authorization.\n\nCiting a line from the Campbell opinion, the Congressional Research Service has emphasized that congressmen don\u2019t necessarily have standing \u201cwhenever a President allegedly acts in excess of statutory authority,\u201d but it omitted that the court also explained its \u201cgreat reluctance\u201d to get involved in inter-branch disputes \u201cthat involve matters of war and peace.\u201d The war power is almost wholly within the purview of the commander-in-chief. With immigration, a wholly legislative matter, Obama clearly ignored the limits of executive power, raising his conduct to the level of a \u201cdirect confrontation\u201d between the branches.\n\nTo meet the standard of voter nullification and direct confrontation, Boehner should also address Obama\u2019s purported use of \u201cprosecutorial discretion.\u201d Letting it become the norm effectively nullifies future immigration bills that fail to comport with his policy preferences, such as his aim to keep importing low-skilled workers (who are also potential Democratic voters).\n\nSuch a threat is not speculative. Obama has said he has a \u201c pen and a phone \u201d and that he can no longer be prevented from suppressing acts of Congress he doesn\u2019t like or from unilaterally pushing through initiatives he does. By pushing through DACA, he bypassed 24 separate votes of Congress, going back to 2001, against the DREAM Act, even though on 22 occasions he admitted that he had no authority to do so. Further, the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department has reinterpreted so broadly what the president can now do in the area of immigration that it will rubber-stamp any executive amnesty if it can be framed simply as promoting \u201cfamily unity\u201d or conserving \u201climited resources.\u201d\n\nFinally, the Raines court noted that congressional plaintiffs failed in part because the Line Item Veto Act could still be open to a constitutional challenge by a private individual \u201cwho suffers judicially cognizable injury.\u201d Because of the American public\u2019s lack of standing in challenging the government\u2019s non-enforcement of our immigration laws, this line from Raines should provide added impetus to a federal court to agree to hear the case.\n\nIn the cases of DACA and DAPA, Congress consistently voted on an area of policy wholly within its purview and in that was never questioned by previous presidents.
