Aberdeen, SD

Paramedics in Aberdeen are asking the public to help them save lives using a smart phone app.

The dispatch center has technology that’ll alert people who know CPR if someone nearby needs it. The technology sends alerts through the PulsePoint App and has been online less than a week.

When paramedics respond to an emergency call, they’re often up against time. That’s why JR Huebner is happy the PulsePoint App is now an option for people in Aberdeen.

“The goal for us is to get people there as soon as possible, starting CPR with the hope that we can save more lives,” Huebner said.

People who know CPR and download the app on their smart phones can ask for alerts when someone near them in a public place needs CPR.

When a 911 call comes in, technology at the dispatch center will track its location. Those within a quarter mile will get an alert, Huebner said.

“I think it’d be great. Depending on how severe the attack or incident might be, a couple of minutes makes a huge difference,” Gaylan Lang said.

Even though he’s an avid runner, Lang still needed a heart stint a few years ago. So he knows anyone could require CPR one day, even if they lead a healthy lifestyle. That’s why he’s hopeful the app will become popular with many people certified in CPR.

Huebner says an ambulance response time in town with Aberdeen Fire and Rescue is three to five minutes. When someone’s in cardiac arrest, he says, survival chances decrease ten percent for every minute that passes.

“This just basically enhances our circle of responders that can get to the scene quicker,” Huebner said.

Huebner says about 100 people in the Aberdeen area downloaded the app within the first couple days of the technology being online. He’s hopeful it will continue to expand.
