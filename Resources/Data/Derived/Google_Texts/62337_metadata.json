These are all issues millennials are passionate about.\n\nThe organization shelled out $250,000 for the ad buy, and the commercials rolled out Thursday in six college towns in three states: Gainesville, Fla., Tallahassee, Fla., Greenville, N.C., Chapel Hill, N.C., Madison, Wis., East Lansing, Mich., and Ann Arbor, Mich.\n\nSimilarly, the College Republican National Committee turned its attention to 16 states for a $1 million digital ad campaign with a bridal theme married to pop culture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a conversation starter,\u201d a CRNC official told The Daily Signal of the #SayYesToTheCandidate campaign.\n\nOn Monday, the #CareLikeCrazy ads from Rock the Vote also will be seen in Atlanta, Columbus, Ohio, and State College, Pa.\n\n>>> War Over Women: Colorado Senate Candidates Fight for Female Vote\n\nThe ads also can be found on popular social media and digital sites such as Hulu, YouTube, Facebook, Pandora and Spotify.\n\nFlorida, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have competitive gubernatorial races, while races for U.S. Senate in Michigan and North Carolina are relatively close.\n\nRock the Vote puts a sarcastic spin on traditional campaign ads and focuses on five issues: voting rights, the environment, student loans, war and women\u2019s rights.\n\nThe campaign also encourages millennials to take a \u201cselfie\u201d photo or shoot a video and \u201ctell us \u2014 What do you #CareLikeCrazy about?\u201d The spokeswoman said:\n\nWe wanted to tap into a value millennials hold at their core: self expression. Young people have grown up as digital natives \u2014 sharing their opinions on social media platforms constantly.\n\nRock the Vote bills itself as nonpartisan but is part of the progressive network called the Democracy Alliance. Backed by billionaire George Soros, the Democracy Alliance funnels money to more than 180 organizations on the political left through \u201cdark money\u201d practices.\n\nThe first group of ads in a series of five to be released by the College Republican National Committee are based on the TLC show \u201cSay Yes to the Dress,\u201d and feature a young bride modeling a wedding dress named after a Republican and a dress named after a Democrat.\n\nWhile wearing the gowns, the women lists benefits that young people can expect should they choose the Republican candidate. If they pick a Democrat, though, they can expect to be saddled with increased tuition, taxes and debt.\n\nAlex Smith, national chairwoman of the CRNC, told The Daily Signal:\n\nThe message we wanted to communicate is that [Democrats] are a bad bargain with unforeseen costs and that young people are going to make an important decision about their future. It\u2019s meant to be a conversation starter.\n\n>>> Kentucky Senate Candidates Want You to Know They Care\n\nThe GOP ads with the \u201cSay Yes\u201d theme support gubernatorial candidates across six states: Rick Scott of Florida, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Bob Beauprez of Colorado, Bruce Rauner of Illinois, Rick Snyder of Michigan and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe CRNC\u2019s \u201cSay Yes\u201d ads were tested before four focus groups nationwide and received an overwhelmingly positive responses from millennials, the group says.\n\nAnother series of ads to be released in Florida, Michigan and Wisconsin will feature a student texting various questions to a Democratic politician. The response is \u201cK,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\u201cThis midterm election, the youth vote can be powerful,\u201d said Smith, who is CRNC\u2019s first female chief.\n\nWe know young people are looking for an alternative. They\u2019re not inherently liberal. They agree with us. They\u2019re just not connecting those ideas with the party.\n\nMillennials today, she said, are not paying attention to conventional radio and television ads, and don\u2019t connect with direct mail pieces.\n\nInstead, young people turn to digital spaces such as Pandora, YouTube, Spotify and Hulu \u2014 where both Rock the Vote! and the CRNC focus their outreach.\n\nVoter turnout among millennials is typically low during midterm elections. In 2010, 18- to 29-year-olds made up 11 percent of those who went to the polls. By comparison, millennials made up 18 percent of the electorate in 2008.\n\n>>> 9 Senate Races That Could Tip the Balance of Power\n\n[This post has been updated to include comment from Rock the Vote.]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two divergent groups--Rock the Vote! and the College Republicans--release campaign ads designed to push 18- to 29-year-old voters to the polls in November.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Two divergent groups--Rock the Vote! and the College Republicans--release campaign ads designed to push 18- to 29-year-old voters to the polls in November.", "title": "Campaign Ads From These Groups Go Where Millennials Go", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141003_ScreenShot_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-24T11:36:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1CKJl66"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Two divergent groups--Rock the Vote! and the College Republicans--release campaign ads designed to push 18- to 29-year-old voters to the polls in November.", "title": "Campaign Ads From These Groups Go Where Millennials Go", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141003_ScreenShot_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "elections,media", "published_time": "2014-10-04T18:37:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-24T11:36:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Rock the Vote!
