Business development companies–vehicles organized under the Investment Company Act of 1940 to issue loans to midmarket companies—historically kept a relatively low profile in the public equity markets.

Over the last two months, however, activist investors have shined a spotlight on several BDCs, including American Capital Ltd., Fifth Street Finance Corp., and KCAP Financial Inc., calling for them to re-elect board members, lower management fees, and explore sales of their companies or assets, among other changes.

Regardless of whether the activists are successful in their campaigns, “the floodgates have opened” for BDC shareholder activism, investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald said in a report this week. Analysts and BDC managers predict more companies could come under pressure, and that those who don’t may initiate voluntary changes before they are forced to do so.

“The BDC industry is suffering from a crisis of confidence,” said David Golub, president of lender Golub Capital, whose BDC hasn’t been a target for activists.

Valuations in the industry have bifurcated, said Mr. Golub, with a few BDCs producing solid results and trading well, and many others trading not as well.

A combination of low valuations and “disenchanted shareholder bases” present ideal ingredients for activist involvement, said Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. analyst Greg Mason.

“If stocks are stuck at big discounts for a long time, things can change,” said Mr. Mason. “If the activists are successful, we may get voluntary changes from others.”

The bifurcation in the industry, along with the new activism, “will cause the good players in the industry to grow and the bad players to shrink,” said Mr. Golub. “That’s a good thing for the industry.”
