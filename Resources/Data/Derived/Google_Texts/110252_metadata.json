Nitkowski had nothing to lose in spring 2011. The rotator cuff in his left shoulder that he\u2019d relied on during his decade as a major league pitcher was in tatters. He was 38 and his fastball traveled a Little League-worthy 50 mph.\n\nSurgery and the ensuing lengthy rehab would have killed his career. So Nitkowski paid $3,000 to have stem cells extracted from his waist, separated then injected back into his shoulder.\n\n\u201cI look at it as a last shot,\u201d Nitkowski said.\n\nThe ensuing \u201cboost\u201d he felt helped him sign a minor-league deal with the New York Mets in 2012. Though he never made it back to the majors before retiring in 2013, Nitkowski is confident he\u2019d wrung out every last ounce of talent. While not an advocate for stem cell therapy, as one of the few athletes who have gone public on the treatment he understands why active players approach him about it.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give a recommendation,\u201d Nitkowski said. \u201cI can only tell my story. I feel like, based on what I believe, that (stem cell therapy) would almost become like maintenance \u2026 if they generate tissue.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cif\u201d remains problematic for professional athletes and teams that pay them millions. Several years after Nitkowski\u2019s procedure, debate on stem cell therapy for helping rehab injuries is no closer to resolution.\n\nBlame it on a lack of study and still-evolving knowledge about what stem cells can and can\u2019t do. Blame hype that typically accompanies every new method that attempts to quicken recovery from serious injury.\n\nPlayers and agents are paying attention.\n\n\u201cThey want the cutting edge, anything that is cutting edge that can get their guys a couple more years in the league,\u201d said Dr. Jim Bradley, orthopedic surgeon for the NFL\u2019s Pittsburgh Steelers. \u201cIf I was an agent, I\u2019d want the same thing.\u201d\n\nYet while Bradley is bullish on its potential, he spends a fair amount of time explaining what exactly stem cell therapy does, ostensibly. Adult stem cells are undifferentiated cells found throughout the body that can divide rapidly and help repair tissue. The belief is that stem cells can serve as reinforcements to an injured muscle or joint.\n\nBut nearly all evidence is anecdotal \u2014 no definitive lab results show it works. That has done little to damper interest.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants answers right now and you can\u2019t have them right now,\u201d Bradley said.\n\nAt least not in the United States, where medical regulation is more restrictive than elsewhere. To avoid scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration, stem cell doctors generally perform same-day procedures similar to what Nitkowski received. That\u2019s not the case overseas.\n\nClinics in various countries in Europe, Australia and Asia offer far more aggressive therapies. Patients can have stem cells taken out then grown in a laboratory for weeks, producing millions more cells.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stem cells still uncharted territory in sports", "title": "Stem cells still uncharted territory in sports", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Stem cells still uncharted territory in sports", "title": "Stem cells still uncharted territory in sports", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/18/stem_cells_still_uncharted_territory_in_sports/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/stem-cells-sports.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stem cells still uncharted territory in sports", "title": "Stem cells still uncharted territory in sports", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/stem-cells-sports.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Will Graves", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00b8\"", "article_summary": "Adult stem cells are undifferentiated cells found throughout the body that can divide rapidly and help repair tissue.\nPatients can have stem cells taken out then grown in a laboratory for weeks, producing millions more cells.\nThe belief is that stem cells can serve as reinforcements to an injured muscle or joint.\nSo Nitkowski paid $3,000 to have stem cells extracted from his waist, separated then injected back into his shoulder.\nBlame it on a lack of study and still-evolving knowledge about what stem cells can and can\u2019t do."}
