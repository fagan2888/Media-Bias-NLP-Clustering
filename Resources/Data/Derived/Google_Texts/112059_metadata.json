The lottery would be considered a \"voluntary tax\" that people don't have to pay. Proceeds would be steered to the cash-strapped Medicaid program. But Gov. Robert Bentley says it won't be enough to fill the hole that's needed for the state.\n\n\"That's not going to do us any good for 2016. I'm not opposed to people voting on a lottery. But it does not make enough money to make any difference,\" Gov. Bentley says.\n\nIt's been 15 years since legislators voted down the idea. State agencies are facing large cuts unless lawmakers find more revenue for the budget.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Alabama's governor is giving his opinion on a statewide lottery.", "language": "english", "og": {"description": "Alabama's governor is giving his opinion on a statewide lottery.", "title": "Gov.
