The lawmakers also pointed to some legislation that will likely not become law anytime soon, such as a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement.\n\nThough Republicans contended the new GOP majority helped the Senate function again, Democrats argue that they are a much more cooperative minority than Republicans were in the past.\n\nThe video is also notable as lawmakers head into an election year. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., the chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, said in the video that breaking gridlock \"wasn't just a campaign slogan.\" But having pieces of legislation to point to on the campaign trail, as McConnell recently pointed ou t, will help those GOP senators running for reelection.\n\nThe video featured some of those senators who are among the most vulnerable incumbents , including Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Richard M. Burr of North Carolina and John McCain of Arizona.\n\nRelated: Heading Into Endgame, McConnell Declares \u2018Dysfunction is Over\u2019\n\nSee photos, follies, HOH Hits and Misses and more at Roll Call's new video site.
