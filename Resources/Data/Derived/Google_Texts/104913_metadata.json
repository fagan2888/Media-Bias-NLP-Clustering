John Boehner. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\n\n\nSpeaker John Boehner (R-OH) has caved to the right flank of his party and decided to tie funding for the entire government to an effort to defund the Affordable Care Act. This latest gambit will have one of two results. Republicans will back down, after the Democrat-held Senate puts forward a budget with full Obamacare funding, and Boehner will be forced to allow a minority of Republican members to join House Democrats in securing a fully funded government with Obamacare included (some conservatives hope that, in this moment of negotiation, a deal could be struck that delays or partially weakens Obamacare). The second scenario is that Republicans refuse to come to the table, the government will lose funding, and with it, Obamacare will be partially defunded for the time being. Ad Policy\n\nThe vast majority of healthcare reform is funded through what is known as mandatory spending that is not necessarily affected by the continuing budget resolution now at issue in Congress. If the government shuts down, the only aspect of Obamacare that will be defunded is the portion that is covered through discretionary spending. Affordable Care Act discretionary spending includes funding for community health centers, preventative health programs, school-based health clinics for children, rural and Indian health centers, doctor and nurse training grants, among other programs\u2014spending that overwhelmingly benefit rural Republican districts in many states.\n\nThe discretionary healthcare reform programs, like much of Obamacare, help save lives every day by providing care to low-income Americans. How do we know this, beyond the numerous studies and reports that say so? Ask Republicans, who have embraced and deceitfully promoted Obamacare discretionary spending programs\u2014including the Obamacare-funded health centers and clinics that they are now attempting to shut down:", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/boehner_angle_ap_fb_1-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Lee Fang", "description": "Republicans have acknowledged that the health reform programs they intend to defund help save lives.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Republicans have acknowledged that the health reform programs they intend to defund help save lives.", "title": "Republican Lawmakers Are Playing Politics With Human Lives, in Four Pictures", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/republican-lawmakers-are-playing-politics-human-lives-four-pictures/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/boehner_angle_ap_fb_1.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 225}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T05:51:48+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans have acknowledged that the health reform programs they intend to defund help save lives.", "title": "Republican Lawmakers Are Playing Politics With Human Lives, in Four Pictures", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/republican-lawmakers-are-playing-politics-human-lives-four-pictures/", "image": {"height": 225, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/boehner_angle_ap_fb_1.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/boehner_angle_ap_fb_1.jpg", "width": 300}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "September 20th, 2013", "sailthru.title": "Republican Lawmakers Are Playing Politics With Human Lives, in Four Pictures", "keywords": "Republicans, Boehner, GOP, Obamacare, Liberal, Right, Eric Cantor, Affordable Care Act, Congress, Congressional, USA", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 108364, "sailthru.tags": "Politics,Science and Health,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "USA", "published_time": "2013-09-20T21:14:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T05:51:48+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/LeeFang/"}, "sailthru.description": "Republicans have acknowledged that the health reform programs they intend to defund help save lives.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/boehner_angle_ap_fb_1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f6a\"", "article_summary": "Ask Republicans, who have embraced and deceitfully promoted Obamacare discretionary spending programs\u2014including the Obamacare-funded health centers and clinics that they are now attempting to shut down:\nIf the government shuts down, the only aspect of Obamacare that will be defunded is the portion that is covered through discretionary spending.\nThe discretionary healthcare reform programs, like much of Obamacare, help save lives every day by providing care to low-income Americans.\nAffordable Care Act discretionary spending includes funding for community health centers, preventative health programs, school-based health clinics for children, rural and Indian health centers, doctor and nurse training grants, among other programs\u2014spending that overwhelmingly benefit rural Republican districts in many states.\nHow do we know this, beyond the numerous studies and reports that say so?"}
