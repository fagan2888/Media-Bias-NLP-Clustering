You\u2019re starting to see the effects of what all the genetically altered foods are causing,\u201d Asher says.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nAustin, Texas-based Whole Foods is riding a national wave of enthusiasm for premium, natural foods and has made significant inroads in Florida with 31 stores, including two in Tampa and the newest location at Westfield Countryside Mall on U.S. 19 that opened to big crowds Wednesday.\n\nThe company saw substantial demand in Clearwater with many North Pinellas residents driving to the Tampa store on North Dale Mabry Highway, and it is scouting for other locations around St. Petersburg and in Hillsborough County, says Juan Nunez, Whole Foods regional president in Florida.\n\nThe 31,000-square-foot grocery store occupies the bottom floor of a former Sears in the mall, offering tens of thousands of natural and organic meats, produce, cheeses and snacks, a food court and a machine that makes fresh doughnuts.\n\nWhile Whole Foods clearly strives to be the biggest and most comprehensive in the marketplace, the grocer also actively courts local farmers, brewers and other suppliers to stock its shelves, even offering small loans to entrepreneurs who are successful selling in their stores, Nunez says.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things we do before we open a store, we get into a community and find out a lot about the local community,\u201d he says.\n\nLocal health food grocers with a long history in the community such as Nature\u2019s Food Patch in Clearwater aren\u2019t too worried about getting crowded out.\n\n\u201cThere would have to be a lot more players in Pinellas for it to be competitive,\u201d says Sean Balsley, general manager at Nature\u2019s Food Patch. \u201cOur prices, honestly, are much better than Whole Foods anyway.\u201d\n\nLocated just east of downtown on Cleveland Street, Nature\u2019s Food Patch has gained a loyal customer base since opening in 1987, catering to both the occasional shopper and those devoted to an all-natural diet.\n\nIt recently has taken a strong stand on GMOs, foods with genetically modi\u00adfied organisms, hiring a full-time employee to vet each product to ensure they\u2019re truly natural and don\u2019t contain harmful lab-created elements.\n\nWhile many stores rely on third-party organizations to investigate products, few go as far as Nature\u2019s Food Patch, Balsley says.\n\n\u201cOur customers are very educated and they are ahead of the curve. From that perspective, we have to be on our game because our customers wouldn\u2019t let us not be,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s surprising about the health food market today is how relatively inexpensive products have become as demand has made them more widely available, says Asher of Rollin\u2019 Oats.\n\n\u201cThe demand that\u2019s come in has driven prices down to where it\u2019s actually affordable now. The stigma for so long was, \u2018I can\u2019t afford to eat organic; I can\u2019t afford to eat natural,\u2019 and, us in particular, we\u2019ve tried to get rid of that stigma,\u201d he says, noting the store frequently posts prices lower than Publix for comparable products.\n\nPart of that demand may be attributed to the fact that the foods taste better than what used to be available, and there are more choices.\n\n\u201cYou look at health food stores 30 years ago and it was like, \u2018Oh, you don\u2019t like tofu \u2014 too bad, that\u2019s what we do,\u2019\u201d says Danielle Dunn, manager for supplements and personal care items at Earth Origins Market, which has locations in St. Petersburg, Palm Harbor and elsewhere around the state.\n\nToday there are natural variants of nearly everything: popcorn, ice cream \u2014 even a premium alternative to the Oscar Mayer Lunchable snack pack.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I wish I was a kid now because all we had back then was fruit leather,\u201d Dunn says.\n\njboatwright@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-1277", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 27 Sep 2014 21:45:43 -0400", "Description": "ST.
