Cuccinelli had made his defense of the law an issue in his campaign for governor.\n\nVirginia\u2019s archaic Crimes Against Nature law made oral and anal sex a felony \u2014 even between consenting adults in the privacy of their bedroom. In 2003, the Supreme Court held in Lawrence v. Texas that sodomy bans like Virginia\u2019s violated the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nIn 2004, a bipartisan group in the Virginia General Assembly proposed updating the law to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, by eliminating provisions dealing with consenting adults in private and leaving in place provisions relating to prostitution, public sex, and those other than consenting adults. Cuccinelli, then a state senator, opposed the bill in committee and helped kill it on the Senate floor. In 2009, he told a newspaper that he supported keeping restrictions on the sexual behavior of consenting adults: \u201cMy view is that homosexual acts, not homosexuality, but homosexual acts are wrong. They\u2019re intrinsically wrong. And I think in a natural law based country it\u2019s appropriate to have policies that reflect that. \u2026 They don\u2019t comport with natural law.\u201d As a result, the law\u2019s text remained unchanged a decade after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling.\n\nIn May, a federal appeals court overturned the conviction of William Scott MacDonald, who had been charged under the Crimes Against Nature law with demanding oral sex from a 17-year-old girl. Cuccinelli argued in his appeal \u2014 and on a campaign website \u2014 that the law no longer applies to consenting adults but was still valid for \u201csex offenses attempted or committed against minors, against non-consenting adults, or in public.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Cuccinelli noted that the appeal had been \u201cto save a tool Virginia law enforcers use regularly to prosecute child predators,\u201d and that it \u201ccouldn\u2019t be used against consenting adults acting in private.\u201d But, because he and his allies refused to update the bill, now it cannot be used to prosecute anyone. As a result, Cuccinelli notes, 90 sex offenders may now be dropped from Virginia\u2019s sex offender registry.\n\nThis is not Cuccinelli\u2019s first high-profile legal defeat as attorney general. His legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act, his attempt to block EPA regulation of greenhouse gases, and his fishing expedition into a former University of Virginia climate scientist have all been defeated by the courts.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "In his campaign for governor, Ken Cuccinelli (R) has made his support for Virginia's unconstitutional sodomy law a campaign issue.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "In his campaign for governor, Ken Cuccinelli (R) has made his support for Virginia's unconstitutional sodomy law a campaign issue.", "title": "Supreme Court Smacks Down Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s Sodomy Law Appeal", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2013/10/07/2742221/cuccinelli-sodomy-supreme-court-loss/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/CuccinelliConstitution.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In his campaign for governor, Ken Cuccinelli (R) has made his support for Virginia's unconstitutional sodomy law a campaign issue.", "creator": "@jeisrael", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/CuccinelliConstitution-321x214.jpg", "title": "Supreme Court Smacks Down Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s Sodomy Law Appeal", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-lgbt", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/CuccinelliConstitution.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/CuccinelliConstitution.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-07T12:10:14+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joshisraelinvestigates"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3fee\"", "article_summary": "LGBT Supreme Court Smacks Down Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s Sodomy Law Appeal CREDIT:The U.S. Supreme Court announced Monday that it would not hear Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II\u2019s (R) appeal of a lower court ruling that held that the state\u2019s sodomy ban is wholly unconstitutional.\nIn 2003, the Supreme Court held in Lawrence v.
