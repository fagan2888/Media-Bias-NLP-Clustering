Another $150 million in development is currently under consideration, he said.\n\n\u201cThat shows that people look to Portland as a good place to do businesses and development,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Brennan acknowledged the growing pains of that development.\n\nResidents have filled council chambers to protest the sale of Congress Square Plaza to a developer and to oppose increasing heights for a high-rise development in Bayside. Others have criticized the recent flood of market rate housing, saying affordable housing is needed instead.\n\nA group of residents recently submitted petition papers for a June ballot initiative to increase protections for 60 public open spaces, including Congress Square Plaza.\n\nBrennan vowed to form a committee to inventory the city\u2019s land holdings and have \u201cproactive\u201d and \u201cthoughtful\u201d discussion about which properties to protect and which properties could be developed.\n\nBrennan said the $100 million state transportation bond that was passed by voters last year will help strengthen the economic vitality of the waterfront by dredging the harbor to open up new vessel berthing, connecting rail lines to the International Marine Terminal and improving the Ocean Gateway terminal for the resumption of ferry service to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.\n\nHe also noted that over half of the city-owned Maine State Pier is leased to seafood processors, which is bringing in $500,000 a year.\n\n\u201cThis is a tremendous benefit not only to the business community and Portland but the entire state of Maine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a vision. We have a plan and the waterfront in Portland will be a central part of the city. And more importantly, it will continue to be a working waterfront.\u201d\n\nBrennan reaffirmed his commitment to public education, saying he will ask the council to follow Bangor\u2019s lead and pass a moratorium on publicly funded charter schools.\n\nBrennan also called on residents throughout the state to contact their state legislators to oppose state budget proposals that would shift tax burdens from the state to local level. Atop that list is a proposal to cut $40 million in revenue sharing.\n\nIf that cut goes through, Portland would lose $3 million from its local budget, for a total of $5 million over the last five years, leaving Portland with only $1 million, he said.\n\n\u201cWithout that (revenue) we will struggle with our budgeting process\u201d to fund education and services and keep taxes at a reasonable rate, he said. \u201cPlease respond to this issue and talk to your legislators and make sure this does not happen.\u201d\n\nBrennan also highlighted the work of several city departments. Firefighters saved 20 lives through advanced CPR techniques and the fire chief is looking to train 1,000 residents in basic CPR in the coming year, he said.\n\nMost of the accolades went to the city\u2019s Health and Human Services Department.\n\nWith new case management services, 659 people who were homeless found permanent housing \u2013 a 45 percent increase over the previous year, he said. Meanwhile, the city helped 309 homeless and unemployed people find jobs, 60 percent of which were full time.\n\nIn the coming months, the city will offer $50,000 to developers to plan a new \u201chousing first\u201d complex, which offers chronically homeless people stable housing with in-house counselors.\n\nHe also celebrated the city\u2019s restaurant inspection program, saying the city exceeded state standards by 82 percent and became the first community in the state to post inspections online.\n\nThose changes were made after a series of articles by the Portland Press Herald.\n\n\u201cThis is a very important improvement for us,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nWhile voters overwhelmingly voted in support of legalizing marijuana in November, Brennan said the city needs to do more to address alcoholism and drug addiction, which drives up crime rates in the city.\n\nHe said he plans to form a committee to find ways to address these issues, while also finding ways for people to become insured through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe council will also be asked to seek a national designation for being a \u201cCompassionate City\u201d and adopt a \u201cstar rating program\u201d where the city can quantify its performance in areas such as its economy, civil rights and education.\n\nHe also called on the city to \u201cdouble or triple\u201d arts events, such as the closing of Congress Street for the First Friday Art Walk, which featured a circus performance.\n\nAfter Brennan\u2019s address, things got heated between City Manager Mark Rees and Congress Street resident Janet Daigle, who has been dogging city officials for about a year over property damage she claims was done by a city snowplow.\n\nDaigle has been showing up to council meetings with a damaged fence post and photographs trying to get the city to pay for the damage. Recently she\u2019s called Rees a liar and accused other officials of a cover-up and stealing her money.\n\nCouncilors and staff have ignored Daigle for the most part, but on Wednesday Rees had had enough.\n\nHe said Daigle was libeling and slandering him and other city officials, and said he may seek his own attorney to put an end to it. \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of being libeled and slandered by you every week,\u201d Rees said.\n\nDaigle responded by saying she was only citing \u201cfacts.\u201d\n\nRandy Billings can be contacted at 791-6346 or at:\n\nr[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @randybillings\n\nCORRECTION: This story was updated at 5:50 p.m. on Monday, Feb. 3, 2014 to reflect that Janet Daigle accused city officials of stealing her money.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michael Brennan unveils several new priorities at his State of the City address on Wednesday.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Michael Brennan unveils several new priorities at his State of the City address on Wednesday.", "title": "Portland mayor: Raise city\u2019s minimum wage - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/20140123_481200.xml-20140122_Brennan1.jpg", "height": 805}, "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/01/22/portland_mayor__raise_city_s_minimum_wage_/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Michael Brennan unveils several new priorities at his State of the City address on Wednesday.", "title": "Portland mayor: Raise city\u2019s minimum wage - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/20140123_481200.xml-20140122_Brennan1.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2014-01-22T19:58:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd172d\"", "article_summary": "Others have criticized the recent flood of market rate housing, saying affordable housing is needed instead.\nAdditional Photos Portland Mayor Michael Brennan delivers the 2nd annual State of the City address Wednesday.\n\u201cThis is a tremendous benefit not only to the business community and Portland but the entire state of Maine,\u201d he said.\nThose changes were made after a series of articles by the Portland Press Herald.\n\u201cThat shows that people look to Portland as a good place to do businesses and development,\u201d he said."}
