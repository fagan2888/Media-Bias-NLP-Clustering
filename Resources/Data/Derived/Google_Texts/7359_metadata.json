Instead of working together to find a direction that could unite the party and help the country, they double down on bickering and back stabbing to keep their positions within the party.\n\nThe \u201cI\u2019m entitled to incumbency\u201d bullet is in the cylinder, waiting to be spun, and the trigger finger is twitching with anticipation.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times last week Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said, \u201cI think we are going to crush them everywhere.\u201d He was referring to conservative groups who are hoping to unseat several entrenched Republicans this year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country,\u201d McConnell added.\n\nMr. McConnell should be aware that Americans are so very tired of career politicians, and there is a groundswell of support for someone, anyone who can change the status quo. It\u2019s time to let the pompous, arrogant slackers go and find some honest people who actually care about the country.\n\nLater in the interview McConnell said, \u201cI know this: Politics doesn\u2019t like losers,\u201d meaning that if challenging candidates don\u2019t win in the primaries, they will have a hard time recovering from their losses. That statement could come back to haunt him and the party.\n\nNow that Republican David Jolly has won his race by campaigning against Obamacare, establishment Republicans are trying to spin the reason for Jolly\u2019s victory. In an attempt to hijack the narrative by suggesting that Jolly actually ran on \u201cfixing\u201d Obamacare, they caution other conservative candidates to avoid referencing repeal or replacement of Obamacare.\n\nIf the voters decide that geriatric, vindictive and lying establishment Republicans don\u2019t deserve to return to Congress, then those politicians can take all the blame, having loaded the gun and pulled the trigger on themselves.\n\nPithanthropy the Human Conditioner by Jim Bozeman\n\nYou can order Pithanthropy, The Human Conditioner, in print and on Kindle from Amazon.com\n\nREAD MORE: Pithanthropy the Human Conditioner by Jim Bozeman here", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans are so very tired of career politicians, and there is a groundswell of support for someone, anyone who can change the status quo.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Jim Bozeman", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "MILLINOCKET, Maine, March 16, 2014 \u2014 It\u2019s as if they have a death wish; establishment Republican leaders are poised to self-destruct.
