Baby Underwood’s musical training is starting early.

For his Dec. 8 “Tonight Show,” comedian Jimmy Fallon congratulated country star Carrie Underwood on her “little baby on its way.” At Fallon’s prompting, the mom-to-be revealed that she sings for her baby because “he’s listening” and “always in there.”

The “American Idol” singer, 31, and husband hockey player Mike Fisher, 34, announced the pregnancy in September – and expect their first baby’s arrival in the spring.

During his show, Fallon commented, “Now you said that you and your husband sing during the holidays.” He asked Underwood, “Are you singing for the baby?”

“Yes,” she responded. “I feel like he hears me singing whether he would like that or not. I mean, that’s what I do. He doesn’t have a choice.”

“If I’m just in my car, driving, I feel like I have to make it good because,” she continued in a hushed voice, “he’s listening. He’s always in there.”

She explained, “I just want to do a good job for him.”

Surprisingly, the (often abortion-sympathetic) media reported on the news. Outlets including E! Online, Bustle, Access Hollywood and Perez Hilton.

Underwood spoke more about her baby to “Today” hosts Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb on Dec. 9. “Definitely my body’s not mine right now!” she said.

The star made big headlines last year after mocking Obamacare at the Country Music Association Awards show.
