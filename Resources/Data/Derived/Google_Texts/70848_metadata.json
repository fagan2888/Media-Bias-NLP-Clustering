Ted Cruz said Monday that Republicans should take advantage of their control of Congress to abolish the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n\u201cWe need to pass fundamental tax reform making our tax code simpler, flatter, fairer,\u201d he said Monday at Heritage Action\u2019s 2015 conservative policy summit. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you, the single most important tax reform, we should abolish the IRS.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last two years have fundamentally changed the dynamics of this debate [on the tax code],\u201d he said. \u201cAs we have seen the weaponization of the IRS, as we have seen the Obama administration using the IRS in a partisan manner to punish its political enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my view there is a powerful populist instinct to take the 110,000 employees at the IRS, to padlock the building, and to put all 110,000 of them down on our southern border.\u201d\n\nCruz quickly clarified that that remark was somewhat tongue in cheek, but joked that anyone who had traveled thousands of miles to cross the border and saw thousands of IRS agents in their way would definitely turn around and go home.\n\nHe acknowledged it\u2019s not really possible to abolish the IRS or adopt a flat tax while Obama is in office, but said Republicans should take steps in that direction by doing whatever they can to simplify the tax code and make its burden lighter and reduce the power of Washington.\n\nRepublicans will get \u201cwalloped\u201d in 2016 if they return to business as usual while controlling Congress, he said, and urged leadership to take on a bold agenda.\n\nThe election was not an embrace of a particular party but a rejection of the path the country is on, he said. \u201cIt was the voters saying, \u2018the Obama economy, it ain\u2019t working. We want something different. We want real leadership.'\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we simply settle into business as usual in this town and keep growing and growing and growing the leviathan and keep shrinking and shrinking and shrinking that sphere of individual liberty, we will demoralize the men and women who came out in November,\u201d he added.\n\nHe outlined an agenda that includes repealing and replacing Obamacare, securing the border, passing the Keystone XL pipeline, auditing the Federal Reserve and taking a hard line against ISIS and Iran.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s lead with a big, bold, positive agenda that says to the American people you had a referendum and you rejected the Obama agenda \u2014 there is a better way,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s our opportunity.\u201d\n\nFollow Rachel on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
