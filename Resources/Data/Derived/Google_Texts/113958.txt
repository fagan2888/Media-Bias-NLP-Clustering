EDITOR: I’m sure you’ve noticed all the signs posted around town encouraging us to vote on Feb. 16. I’d like to call your attention to one sign in particular — the sign for the candidate with the long last name, Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg, running for Wisconsin Supreme Court.

In December I attended an event here in Stevens Point and met Kloppenburg. I was quite impressed with her background, experience, and expertise. Kloppenburg has a long, impressive record of serving the citizens of Wisconsin, first for 23 years as assistant attorney general for the Wisconsin Department of Justice and, for the past five years, as presiding judge in Wisconsin Court of Appeals District 4.

If you want to know more about her, you can visit her website at kloppenburgforjustice.com. There you can “meet” this soft-spoken, clear thinking, nonpartisan candidate by viewing a short, one-minute video where she introduces herself.
