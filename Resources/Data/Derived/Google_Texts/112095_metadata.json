If granted, the work stoppage would have been the second in two months.\n\n\u201cSierra Nevada Corporation is disappointed that the court did not reinstate the GAO\u2019s stay of work proceeding under the CCtCap contract award. Nevertheless, SNC looks forward to the GAO\u2019s ongoing evaluation of the critical protest issues identified in the filing and demonstrating the capability and value of our Dream Chaser for the benefit of our nation,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nAt the center of the dispute is Space Systems\u2019 allegation that its Dream Chaser spacecraft was unfairly passed over for the award. The contract instead was split between Chicago-based Boeing Co.\u2019s CST-100, which received $4.2 billion, and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, which received $2.6 billion.\n\nSpace Systems filed formal protest with the U.S. Government Accountability Office on Sept. 26, which triggered an automatic work stoppage.\n\nOn Oct. 9, NASA \u201cunder statutory authority available to it,\u201d ordered Boeing and SpaceX to resume work.\n\nThat override was \u201carbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion and is contrary to law,\u201d according Space Systems, in documents filed with the in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims on Oct. 15.\n\nHorn disagreed, allowing the work to continue while the GAO continues its investigation.\n\nHorn first heard the case Friday, however, the hearing was continued after Boeing and SpaceX filed motions to intervene in the case.\n\nA motion to intervene is filed when a third party claims interest in the outcome of the case.\n\nSpace Systems is leaving the majority of the case with the GAO and was seeking only the work stoppage through the federal court.\n\nThe majority of the court documents filed last week, and the documents filed with the GAO, remain sealed.\n\nLaura Keeney: 303-954-1337, lkeeney@denverpost.com or twitter.com/LauraKeeney", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Court says space taxi work can go on as Sierra Nevada disputes contract", "title": "Court says space taxi work can go on as Sierra Nevada disputes contract", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/21/court-says-space-taxi-work-can-go-on-as-sierra-nevada-disputes-contract/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141003__dreamchaser-2p1-1.jpg", "height": 398}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141003__dreamchaser-2p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-21T16:55:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:56:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c06\"", "article_summary": "The majority of the court documents filed last week, and the documents filed with the GAO, remain sealed.\nSpace Systems filed formal protest with the U.S. Government Accountability Office on Sept. 26, which triggered an automatic work stoppage.\nAt the center of the dispute is Space Systems\u2019 allegation that its Dream Chaser spacecraft was unfairly passed over for the award.\n\u201cSierra Nevada Corporation is disappointed that the court did not reinstate the GAO\u2019s stay of work proceeding under the CCtCap contract award.\nSpace Systems is leaving the majority of the case with the GAO and was seeking only the work stoppage through the federal court."}
