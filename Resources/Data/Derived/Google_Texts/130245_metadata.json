(AP) \u2014 Kurt Busch\u2019s ex-girlfriend believed the NASCAR driver was in emotional distress when she drove to a Delaware race track to visit him, even though they had broken up earlier that week, an attorney for Patricia Driscoll said Saturday.\n\nDriscoll has accused Busch of domestic assault, and police in Delaware said Friday they are investigating the incident that allegedly occurred inside Busch\u2019s motorhome at Dover International Speedway on Sept. 26. Driscoll has filed court documents asking a judge to order Busch to stay away from her and not contact her, and she claims Busch verbally and physically abused her and smashed her head against a wall three times.\n\n\u201cHe was verbally abusive to her and said he wished he had a gun so that he could kill himself,\u201d the documents say.\n\nMark Dycio, Driscoll\u2019s Virginia-based attorney, said Saturday that Driscoll traveled to Dover because she was worried about Busch\u2019s well-being after receiving concerning text messages from the driver.\n\n\u201cThere had been communication and she believed it was a cry for help, so she responded,\u201d Dycio told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\nDriscoll had her son, Houston, with her when she arrived at Busch\u2019s motorhome. Dycio said his presence, coupled with an ongoing custody battle with her ex-husband, led Driscoll to wait nearly six weeks to file the domestic assault claim.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to go to police from beginning, but there were several factors that she had to first thoroughly consider,\u201d Dycio said. \u201cHer custody battle has claims that Kurt Busch referred to her son as his \u2018adopted son\u2019 and as his \u2018surrogate stepson\u2019 and this was a critical issue in the custody battle. Now this central figure in her custody case has committed an act against her when her son was present.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Busch ex-girlfriend thought driver was in distress", "author": "Jenna Fryer", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Busch ex-girlfriend thought driver was in distress", "title": "Busch ex-girlfriend thought driver was in distress", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/09/busch_ex_girlfriend_thought_driver_was_in_distress/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/nascar-kurt-busch-investigation-auto-racing.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Busch ex-girlfriend thought driver was in distress", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/nascar-kurt-busch-investigation-auto-racing.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Busch ex-girlfriend thought driver was in distress", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Busch ex-girlfriend thought driver was in distress", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ab8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHer custody battle has claims that Kurt Busch referred to her son as his \u2018adopted son\u2019 and as his \u2018surrogate stepson\u2019 and this was a critical issue in the custody battle.\nDriscoll has accused Busch of domestic assault, and police in Delaware said Friday they are investigating the incident that allegedly occurred inside Busch\u2019s motorhome at Dover International Speedway on Sept. 26.\nDriscoll has filed court documents asking a judge to order Busch to stay away from her and not contact her, and she claims Busch verbally and physically abused her and smashed her head against a wall three times.\nDriscoll had her son, Houston, with her when she arrived at Busch\u2019s motorhome.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsAVONDALE, Ariz.
