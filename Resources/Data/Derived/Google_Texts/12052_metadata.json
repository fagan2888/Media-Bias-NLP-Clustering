Just for a little bit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about 95 percent. I\u2019m not at 100 yet,\u201d he said with a grin, hoping his statement was believable after Thursday\u2019s practice. \u201cI say that because I have a brain (mistake) on the field sometimes.\u201d\n\nThomas didn\u2019t want to mislead you. He didn\u2019t want you to watch the Broncos\u2019 third preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday and believe all the kinks in the offense would magically disappear.\n\nWATCH: Broncos\u2019 offense far from a finely tuned machine\n\nHe was, however, hoping to correct them, and hoping that with more time and more snaps, he and Peyton Manning could eliminate that pesky 5 percent.\n\nBut his second preseason showing probably didn\u2019t close the gap.\n\nThomas and Manning played the first half, the most they have thus far in the preseason. But their timing \u2014 under center and in shotgun \u2014 was off once again.\n\nOn Denver\u2019s first drive, Manning underthrew a pass to Thomas in the near left corner of the end zone. Another attempt intended for Thomas in the end zone was intercepted. And by the end of the half, Thomas had only three receptions for 30 yards.\n\nIn their preseason debut at Houston last weekend, Thomas and Manning looked like the duo from the last few seasons in the Broncos\u2019 pass-friendly offense. Thomas was targeted six times, catching three for 24 yards as Manning often worked in the shotgun. But the first-team offense struggled in the win, gaining 67 net yards in four drives, all of which ended in punts. After reviewing the film, Thomas came up with his own points of emphasis for Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe can do better on third-down conversions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a couple third-and-2, third-and-3 that we couldn\u2019t get. When you get in the red area, you\u2019ve got to score touchdowns.\u201d\n\nThe last time he faced the 49ers at home, Thomas had no problem doing just that. Manning connected with Thomas for his record 509th career touchdown pass in the second quarter, and then again for No. 510 in the third quarter.\n\nBut on Saturday, the Broncos again struggled in the red zone, going 0-for-3 in the first half. Their third-down efficiency improved, going 5-for-9 (56 percent).\n\nWhile preseason games carry no meaning for the Broncos\u2019 record or for their starters, it\u2019s still viewed as valuable playing time to test the new offense before the games count.\n\nBut after two tests, Thomas may be sticking with that 95 percent.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Demaryius Thomas looking to be 100 percent ready for regular season", "title": "Demaryius Thomas looking to be 100 percent ready for regular season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/29/demaryius-thomas-looking-to-be-100-percent-ready-for-regular-season/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150829__Demaryius-Thomasp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150829__Demaryius-Thomasp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-29T16:56:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T08:23:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And by the end of the half, Thomas had only three receptions for 30 yards.\nOn Denver\u2019s first drive, Manning underthrew a pass to Thomas in the near left corner of the end zone.\nAnother attempt intended for Thomas in the end zone was intercepted.\nThomas and Manning played the first half, the most they have thus far in the preseason.\nManning connected with Thomas for his record 509th career touchdown pass in the second quarter, and then again for No."}
