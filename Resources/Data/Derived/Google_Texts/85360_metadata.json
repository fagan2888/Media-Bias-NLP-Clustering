The agency wants to be proactive, DHHR Deputy Secretary Jeremiah Samples said Tuesday on MetroNews \u201cTalkline.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure they\u2019re aware of the situation in case they would have a hardship created by receiving a payment a couple of weeks late,\u201d Samples said.\n\nFor example, a hospital traditionally receives payments after they submit a Medicaid claim within 20 days. In the current situation that would pushed out to 28 to 35 days, Samples said.\n\n\u201cSome providers are in the cash business and they need funds to make payroll and things like that. They need to plan accordingly as the state agency is to ensure that they have the necessary resources to continue to provide these critical services,\u201d Samples said.\n\nThe DHHR maintains the cash flow problem is in no way connected to the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The state will begin allocating approximately $15 million to the expansion next fiscal year, Samples said.\n\nMedicaid provides medical coverage for more than 600,000 state residents. Samples said he hopes they won\u2019t be severely impacted by the payment extensions.\n\n\u201cThis is a difficult situation for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, we would prefer to not be in a circumstance where we have to extend payments but unfortunately we are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Letters warn of delayed payments.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Letters warn of delayed payments.", "title": "DHHR hopes \u2018proactive\u2019 approach will help providers", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2016/04/26/dhhr-hopes-proactive-approach-will-help-providers/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Doctor-Generic.jpg", "height": 350}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Doctor-Generic.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-26T20:25:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T20:26:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The DHHR sent 24,000 providers letters this week.\n\u201cSome providers are in the cash business and they need funds to make payroll and things like that.\nThe DHHR maintains the cash flow problem is in no way connected to the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cCertainly, we would prefer to not be in a circumstance where we have to extend payments but unfortunately we are.\u201d\nSamples said he hopes they won\u2019t be severely impacted by the payment extensions."}
