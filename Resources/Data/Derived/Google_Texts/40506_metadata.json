Unions get taxpayer dollars from federal agencies for job training, recruitment drives and even to support Obamacare. As The Washington Times reports, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the AFL-CIO alone have received at least $53 million under Obama, compared to just $29 million when George W. Bush was in office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly an insight into how this president and his administration have used taxpayer funds to accomplish political purposes,\u201d Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, told The Washington Times. \u201cCongress needs to look at this, and dig out these grants specifically given to unions and eliminate them.\u201d\n\nThe increased grants to unions follows a greater trend under Obama. The administration has fundamentally changed labor policy in ways critics claim unfairly benefit unions. The policy changes include new union election rules and employer classifications of contractors and franchisers.\n\n\u201cWe still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice,\u201d the president said during his State of the Union address in January.\n\nMost of the changes have come from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Department of Labor (DOL). Republicans Sen. Lamar Alexander and Rep. John Kline have led much of the effort to stop the rule changes. Thus far, their efforts have been unsuccessful in large part to the president using his veto powers. Lawsuits filed against the NLRB by the business community have also been unable to stop the policy changes.\n\nThroughout his career, Obama has not been shy of his support for organized labor. He noted in his book, \u201cThe Audacity of Hope,\u201d while a presidential candidate, \u201cI owe those unions. When their leaders call, I do my best to call them back right away. I don\u2019t consider this corrupting in any way.\u201d\n\nFollow Connor on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
