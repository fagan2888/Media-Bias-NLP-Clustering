Looking at factors including financial safety, security of roads, and crime rates, WalletHub has polled which states are the safest to live in, and Washington DC fell in the bottom half of the list.

From the report:

By safety, we’re not referring exclusively to protection from violence and crime. This WalletHub study encompasses various forms of safety, including workplace safety, emergency preparedness, home and community stability, road safety and, of course, financial security. With so many elements to consider, it’s no wonder many people find the process of choosing a new place to call home somewhat challenging. To help ease that process, WalletHub identified which of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia offer the safest and most budget-friendly environments. We used 20 key metrics to analyze each state according to different safety standards, taking into account the rates of crime and traffic accidents, for instance, as well as data related to employer insurance coverage, climate disasters and more. Our findings, as well as expert commentary and a detailed methodology, can be found below.

Washington DC ranked 26th overall for safety in the poll, getting good marks for road safety and likelihood of natural disasters, but poor marks in financial safety weighed the city down. DC also got hurt by having one of the higher unemployment rates in the nation, and had a rate of work-related fatalities. DC did have the fewest fatalities on the road for every 100 million miles driven, though, as well as the highest concentration of law-enforcement officials.
