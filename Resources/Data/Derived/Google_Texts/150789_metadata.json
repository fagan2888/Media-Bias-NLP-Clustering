In recent months, \u201cCrossfire\u201d host S. E. Cupp as well as daughters of Republican politicians Meghan McCain and Abby Huntsman had appeared as guest co-hosts in the absence of a full-time right-winger.\n\nElisabeth Hasselbeck departed \u201cThe View\u201d for Fox News last year, while the roughly centrist Sherri Shepherd lost her job along with co-host Jenny McCarthy this year. Post-Hasselbeck, the show settled into a year of annoyingly substanceless chat; the show had, at its best, been a clearinghouse for political opinions of all sorts, but was for a year just kind of about nothing. One halfway hoped McCarthy would air an offensive opinion about her beliefs about vaccines, just so that something would happen.\n\nWallace will at least provide contrast to the show\u2019s returning star, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, who quit after an on-air argument about Iraq with Hasselbeck in 2007 turned personal. But although only time will tell, Wallace seems unlikely to provide real fireworks; she\u2019s best known for her role in the events depicted in the book and movie \u201cGame Change\u201d as an aide who doubted Sarah Palin.\n\nWhat \u201cThe View\u201d needs \u2014 and what it\u2019s unlikely O\u2019Donnell would be interested in experiencing again \u2014 is full-throated debate between equally entrenched worldviews and equally potent stars. O\u2019Donnell is both a once-in-a-generation talk show star and quite liberal. It\u2019s hard to imagine Wallace providing much opposition based on her TV appearances, in which she discusses her and other Republicans\u2019 support for gay marriage and criticizes Liz Cheney\u2018s Senate campaign and Sarah Palin\u2018s intellect, all in flat tones. It\u2019s probably healthy for the Republican Party that one of its most prominent faces on network TV, now, will be someone with a fairly reasoned, centrist take, but that would seem to be toxic for a show that has thrived, and has generated genuine policy discussion, on the basis of blunt-force opinions colliding. Going into the midterm elections, \u201cThe View\u201d deserves a host who represents the nihilism and vitriol of the contemporary Republican Party, not someone who\u2019s spent the years since 2008 staking out ground as a pragmatist. ABC should have raided Fox News\u2019 bench.
