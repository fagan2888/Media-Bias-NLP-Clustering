Fortunately, the more healthily paranoid Fox News audience have received early warning to don their protective anti-skull-sex helmets from Fox Health News senior managing editor Dr. Manny Alvarez, whose years of experience as an OB-GYN has made him expertly qualified to handle babies.\n\n\u201cHate me all you want, or call me paranoid and misinformed,\u201d says \u201cDr. Manny,\u201d instantly predicting and therefore negating all criticism, \u201cbut there is one common theme that is pervasive in American pop culture today: violence. Even more specifically, zombie violence. The idea of a zombie-infested world inspires fantasies of monsters possessed by an uncontrollable rage to kill, and viewers get a thrill imagining what it would be like to participate in this new world order.\u201d And, he argues, those daydreams of an ominous, monster-filled \u201cnew world order\u201d only serve as distractions from the other, slightly less monstrous new world order Fox News would prefer you focus on.\n\n\u201cWith this country heading towards a socialized system of government, in which officials don\u2019t want you to think or focus on what is important for your own personal growth, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re more than happy to let you obsess over something as stupid as zombies. And in turn you ultimately become the zombie,\u201d said Alvarez of this nefarious attempt to cloud a dulled and impressionable public\u2019s thinking with nightmares of imaginary bogeymen coming for their very lives, which only draws attention away from worrying about how Obamacare will end freedom.\n\nAlvarez implicates everything from zombie video games to \"Zombie Runs\" to the National Institute of Health\u2019s \u201chow-to guide on dealing with a zombie outbreak\u201d\u2014a guide that was actually created by the Center for Disease Control, as a successfully publicity-grabbing way of getting otherwise-disinterested Americans to learn about disaster preparedness\u2014as part of this system shamelessly indoctrinating the public with imagination and useful information.\n\n\u201cGive me a break. As a doctor and scientist, I know one thing for sure: When you\u2019re dead, you\u2019re dead,\u201d writes Dr. Manny, providing the kind of blunt, tell-it-like-it-is truth Fox is known for, and which can only be achieved after a career of studying vaginas, then correctly identifying which one belongs to a dead person. \u201cOur brains should be less focused on imaginary zombie hordes and more focused on harnessing the tools that we need in order to enhance our lives, whether it be music, education, science or the classics. Entertainment should help us soothe our brains so that we can ease our minds of some of the stress from our daily lives,\u201d he concludes.\n\nAlvarez then returned to work at the one channel entirely devoted to stoking panic about faceless groups of enemies, in between spreading fear and disaste for culture, education, and science.", "article_metadata": {"description": "&nbsp;Its fantasies about imaginary monsters are distracting from worrying endlessly about socialism.", "og": {"url": "http://www.avclub.com/article/fox-news-says-emthe-walking-deadem-is-brainwashing-104517", "image": "http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/4406/78/16x9/1200.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "&nbsp;Its fantasies about imaginary monsters are distracting from worrying endlessly about socialism.", "title": "Fox News says The Walking Dead is brainwashing Americans, without irony"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/4406/78/16x9/1200.jpg", "title": "Fox News says The Walking Dead is brainwashing Americans, without irony", "site": "@TheAVClub", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "&nbsp;Its fantasies about imaginary monsters are distracting from worrying endlessly about socialism."}, "fb": {"app_id": 130164583741660, "pages": 39581755672}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theavclub", "published_time": "2013-10-21T13:52:00.008695-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80d6\"", "article_summary": "As a doctor and scientist, I know one thing for sure: When you\u2019re dead, you\u2019re dead,\u201d writes Dr. Manny, providing the kind of blunt, tell-it-like-it-is truth Fox is known for, and which can only be achieved after a career of studying vaginas, then correctly identifying which one belongs to a dead person.\nManny,\u201d instantly predicting and therefore negating all criticism, \u201cbut there is one common theme that is pervasive in American pop culture today: violence.\nThe idea of a zombie-infested world inspires fantasies of monsters possessed by an uncontrollable rage to kill, and viewers get a thrill imagining what it would be like to participate in this new world order.\u201d And, he argues, those daydreams of an ominous, monster-filled \u201cnew world order\u201d only serve as distractions from the other, slightly less monstrous new world order Fox News would prefer you focus on.\nFortunately, the more healthily paranoid Fox News audience have received early warning to don their protective anti-skull-sex helmets from Fox Health News senior managing editor Dr. Manny Alvarez, whose years of experience as an OB-GYN has made him expertly qualified to handle babies.\nEntertainment should help us soothe our brains so that we can ease our minds of some of the stress from our daily lives,\u201d he concludes."}
