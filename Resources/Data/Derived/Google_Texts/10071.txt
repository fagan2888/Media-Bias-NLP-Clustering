If it’s Sunday morning, it must be time for dueling, anonymous tales of discord from Redskins Park.

On one side, you have Adam Schefter of ESPN reporting Mike Shanahan wants to return to Washington next season. Good luck with that, Shanny. Schefter also tweets that Redskins owner Daniel Snyder won’t fire Shanahan for cause since the coach’s contract is “ironclad.”

On the other side, you have Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports quoting Redskins Park sources eviscerating the current coaching staff, mainly offensive coordinator and Mike Shanahan offspring Kyle Shanahan. It’s the equivalent of verbal grenades lobbed from behind cover. Among the very, very anonymous contentions:

1. A current member of the Redskins organization says Kyle complains about everything, including the food in the cafeteria, the field and the equipment. (In his defense, have you seen that field?) The same anonymous source says Kyle isn’t well-liked, probably like the majority of offensive coordinators of 3-10 teams.

2. Kyle treats Robert Griffin III “like a [junior varsity] quarterback” and reveled too much in last season’s win over the Dallas Cowboys, as did every single person in America who doesn’t root for the Dallas Cowboys.

3. He also has “entitlement syndrome” but “it’s his father’s fault for pacifying his son.”

The biggest surprise is that the sources didn’t blame Kyle for the Obamacare website debacle.

All the chaos in Washington promises to grow exponentially in the coming weeks, as the world turns. These are the days of ours, and Dan Snyder’s, lives.
