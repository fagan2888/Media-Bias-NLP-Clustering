Democrats have insisted that they will not accept government funding that is loaded with unrelated riders, such as measures that would defund Planned Parenthood or attack Obamacare.\n\nRyan declined to rule out such steps, saying it would be entirely up to his members, all of whom would get a say in writing the six appropriations bills that have not yet come to the House floor out of the 12 that fund the government. (Six have already passed.)\n\n\"Every member will have a chance to review each bill and give their input on their priorities. We've never done this before, but that's how we should work,\" Ryan told reporters in his first solo news conference as House speaker.\n\nWhile he refused to commit to blocking a Planned Parenthood measure that Democrats would see as a poison pill, he also laid out other ways his members might target the health care provider, such as through a new select committee looking into heavily edited sting videos, or through a separate piece of legislation that aims to defund the group.\n\n\"I'm not going to predetermine the outcome of negotiations that have not even taken place yet,\" Ryan said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nancy Pelosi called the new speaker's approach \"challenging,\" \"interesting\" and \"curious.\"", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-11-06 14:41:38 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Nancy Pelosi called the new speaker's approach \"challenging,\" \"interesting\" and \"curious.\"", "title": "Paul Ryan's Plan For A Budget: Let Every Republican Decide", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-budget-republican_us_563b968de4b0b24aee494363", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/563baaa82900002f004dc495.jpeg?cache=n1on7s96ad", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nancy Pelosi called the new speaker's approach \"challenging,\" \"interesting\" and \"curious.\"", "creator": "@mmcauliff", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/563baaa82900002f004dc495.jpeg?cache=n1on7s96ad", "height": 1000}, "title": "Paul Ryan's Plan For A Budget: Let Every Republican Decide", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-05 14:41:38 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_563b968de4b0b24aee494363", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Paul Ryan,Harry Reid ,Nancy Pelosi,budget,Government Shutdown", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Paul Ryan,Harry Reid ,Nancy Pelosi,budget,Government Shutdown", "published_time": "2015-11-05 14:41:38 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-11-05 16:15:17 -0500", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/MichaelGMcAuliff"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON -- New House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has a plan to avoid a damaging fight over government spending, but it was not clear Thursday that it extended beyond his own party.\nCongress must pass a spending bill by Dec. 11 to avoid a government shutdown.\nWe've never done this before, but that's how we should work,\" Ryan told reporters in his first solo news conference as House speaker.\nDemocrats have insisted that they will not accept government funding that is loaded with unrelated riders, such as measures that would defund Planned Parenthood or attack Obamacare.\n\"I'm not going to predetermine the outcome of negotiations that have not even taken place yet,\" Ryan said."}
