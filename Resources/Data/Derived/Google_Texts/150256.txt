A Beauregard Parish man was arrested Friday on a DWI fourth offense after his blood-alcohol concentration tested at nearly five times the legal limit, according to State Police Troop D.

The suspect, Colby K. Hebert, 27, of Dry Creek, caused a two-vehicle wreck on U.S. Highway 171 in Moss Bluff in Calcasieu Parish, police reported.

The accident occurred before 11 a.m. Friday. The preliminary investigation showed that an Infiniti SUV was traveling on U.S. 171 when a collision occurred with a Ford F-350 driven by Hebert, who pulled out from the parking lot of a bar into the path of the Infiniti, police said in a news release.

Hebert was not injured, and two adults and a 5-day-old baby in the SUV were not injured.

Hebert performed poorly on sobriety tests at the crash scene and was transported to Troop D in order to obtain a breath sample, police said. He had a blood-alcohol level of .397 which is nearly five times the legal limit of.08 for individuals 21 and older, State Police Troop D said.

Hebert was transported to a local hospital for examination, and upon release he was charged with DWI fourth offense and failure to yield from a private drive. He was booked into the Calcasieu Parish Correctional Center.
