Cost averaged US$10,779 per employee in 2013. This includes employer and employee contributions for medical, dental and other health coverage.\n\nBut companies expect that the rate of growth in the per-employee cost of coverage will jump next year to 5.2%. This increase reflects changes they will make to reduce costs. If no changes were made to current plans, companies estimate that cost would rise by an average of 8%.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that employers have already taken decisive action to slow cost growth so they will be in a better position to handle the challenges ahead,\u201d says Julio A. Portalatin, president and CEO of Mercer. \u201cBut the impact of the [Affordable Care Act (ACA)] on enrollment levels remains a huge question mark.\u201d\n\nMany employers anticipate spending more to cover more employees in 2014. The ACA mandate that requires all individuals to obtain coverage or face a tax penalty goes into effect in 2014.\n\nCurrently, 22% of an employer\u2019s eligible employees, on average, waive coverage for themselves, either because they are covered under another plan or because they choose to go without. Among employees who do enroll, on average, 53% elect dependent coverage.\n\nBut next year, because of the individual mandate, it\u2019s likely that fewer employees will waive coverage for themselves and more will elect dependent coverage\u2014although the extent of the change is difficult to predict.\n\nSome large companies say they will take steps to control growth in enrollment, mainly by increasing the employee contribution for dependent coverage (18%) or employee-only coverage (10%). Some already impose a surcharge on premium contributions for spouses who have other coverage available (9% of large employers) or even make them ineligible for coverage (7% of large employers). These provisions will become more common next year, according to Mercer.\n\nMost large employers believe that higher enrollments and new fees will increase their benefit spending in 2014. The median amount of the increase predicted is 3.5%, although some employers expect their spending on health benefits to increase by more than 10%.\n\nThe study also shows that while most employers believe that health management programs are making a difference, proving return on investment (ROI) remains difficult for many. The largest employers are the most likely to have formally measured the ROI of their health management programs (46% of employers with 20,000 or more employees).\n\nThe survey covers public and private organizations with 10 or more employees. It polled 2,842 employers.\n\nRelated articles:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.benefitscanada.com/benefits/health-benefits/growth-of-health-benefit-costs-slows-46408", "image": "http://www.benefitscanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/new-media21.jpg", "description": "Health benefit costs in the United States continued to slow in 2013 as employers took action in anticipation of new expenditures that will arise over the next few years from healthcare reform provisions.", "title": "Growth of health benefits costs slows"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=505545954", "description": "Health benefit costs in the United States continued to slow in 2013 as employers took action in anticipation of new expenditures that will arise over the next few years from healthcare reform provisions.", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.7"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcfeb\"", "article_summary": "According to Mercer\u2019s National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans, growth in the average total health benefit cost per employee slowed to just 2.1% in 2013 from 4.1% in 2012.\nThis includes employer and employee contributions for medical, dental and other health coverage.\nSome already impose a surcharge on premium contributions for spouses who have other coverage available (9% of large employers) or even make them ineligible for coverage (7% of large employers).\nBut companies expect that the rate of growth in the per-employee cost of coverage will jump next year to 5.2%.\nThe median amount of the increase predicted is 3.5%, although some employers expect their spending on health benefits to increase by more than 10%."}
