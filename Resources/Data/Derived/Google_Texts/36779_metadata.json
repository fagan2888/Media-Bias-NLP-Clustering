He couldn\u2019t cook, do laundry, prepare taxes, pay the bills or even write out checks.\n\nHis wife of more than 40 years did all of those things.\n\nNow Faye Molnau has developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease and can no longer perform those household tasks. When they wash dishes together \u2014 he washes; she dries \u2014 Faye doesn\u2019t remember where they go, so Jim puts them away. The Molnaus go grocery shopping together, Jim making sure he\u2019s at the checkout to stop her from moving items from the conveyor belt back to the cart. Faye once stashed ice cream in the freezer and accidentally left the door open, letting all the contents thaw, so now Jim double-checks.\n\n\u201cShe wants to do a lot of things and she just can\u2019t,\u201d said Jim Molnau, who lives in Lakeville. \u201cI do everything nowadays, almost everything \u2014 things I\u2019d never done before. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of things I\u2019m going to be doing soon that I\u2019m not looking forward to.\u201d\n\nCaregiving, as the Molnaus have discovered, can mean changing traditional roles \u2014 husbands taking on wives\u2019 jobs and vice versa; children watching over a parent the way the parent once watched over the child. It means learning new skills, handling unfamiliar tasks and cultivating the ability to be patient.\n\nAnd those are hardly the only challenges facing the estimated 34.2 million Americans \u2014 including 670,000 in Minnesota \u2014 who provide unpaid care for people with dementia, mobility limitations or other health problems.\n\nFaye Molnau with her caregiver husband Jim, at home in Lakeville with their dog Shadow.\n\nThe majority of care that older Americans receive comes from adult children, spouses, friends and other unpaid people. Sixty percent of caregivers are women. On average, family caregivers provide 24 hours a week of services, according to a 2015 AARP report. If those services were paid, they\u2019d be worth about $470 billion a year \u2014 or about half as much as the federal government spent last year on Medicare, Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act combined.\n\nSaving taxpayers money\n\nMore than 80 percent of older adults rely on an unpaid caregiver for help, said Joseph Gaugler, a professor in the University of Minnesota\u2019s School of Nursing and its Center on Aging.\n\n\u201cFamilies are at the core of the long-term care system, which saves taxpayers money,\u201d said Gaugler, co-editor of \u201cFamily Caregiving in the New Normal,\u201d published last year. \u201cIf you took caregivers away, it would annihilate the long-term-care system, and probably the economy.\u201d\n\nFamily caregivers shop, cook, clean house and provide transportation. They dress, bathe and help with toilet use or diapering. They handle finances and insurance. They meet with providers, agencies and professionals. They schedule and attend appointments. They interpret health symptoms, dispense medication and perform nursing tasks.\n\nPeople who prefer to remain in their own homes are able to do so thanks to caregivers\u2019 assistance. Even people in residential care often rely on caregivers to monitor their circumstances, interact with staff and be the squeaky wheel, if needed, demanding better services.\n\nAdult day programs can provide caregivers with some respite, but they cost on average $67 per day, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Administration on Aging, generally out of families\u2019 pockets. Home care services, which provide paid caregivers to perform household tasks, transportation and other services, average $19 an hour; $21 is the hourly average for home health care.\n\nPersonal challenges\n\nCaregivers face challenges of their own. They\u2019re often thrust into their roles involuntarily \u2014 perhaps unexpectedly \u2014 with little preparation, training or knowledge of available services. They struggle to balance their caregiving duties with other responsibilities, such as jobs and families. Often, they wind up setting aside their own needs to make time for those of others. They may experience stress, depression, grief, isolation or a feeling of being overwhelmed \u2014 an emotional toll sometimes referred to as \u201ccaregiver burden.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are three significant challenges of caring for somebody with dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d said Heidi Haley-Franklin, vice president of clinical services for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association Minnesota-North Dakota Chapter. \u201cThere\u2019s a high degree of stress. \u2026 There are health challenges \u2014 it gets really difficult to take care of yourself as a caregiver. And there are financial challenges; it is quite expensive, considering the additional health care costs and lost time at work.\u201d\n\nFinancial strain affects 17 percent of caregivers, according to the AARP study. Most caregivers work, averaging nearly 35 hours a week. But their jobs aren\u2019t always flexible enough to accommodate caregiving duties, so they take time off, work late or early, take leaves of absence, quit altogether or take early retirement.\n\nNearly 20 percent of those surveyed said their own health is fair or poor, or has worsened as a result of their caring responsibilities. Eighty percent said they could use more help and support.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s stress \u2014 reported by 40 percent of caregivers in the AARP survey and as high as 60 percent among caregivers of people with dementia, Haley-Franklin said.\n\n\u201cI definitely can get down,\u201d said Mary Margaret Lehman of Edina, whose husband, Ken, has Alzheimer\u2019s. She keeps a gratitude journal to offset negative emotions. \u201cI have to monitor myself to make sure I don\u2019t get down for too long. I can give myself time to feel sad, I have to honor that, but I have to limit it, if we\u2019re going to keep going.\u201d\n\nFewer than half of caregivers say they have made plans for their own care, should they eventually need it. But if they do, they may have a harder time finding someone to provide it.\n\nShortages ahead\n\nJoey McLeister \u2022 Special to the Star Tribune Meg Clemens, left, got medication for her husband, Jim, who has Parkinson\u2019s disease, Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Jim Molnau, top right, is the caregiver for his wife, Faye Molnau, who has Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Bottom right: Kathleen Stuck and her mother, Mary Sommers, who suffers mild cognitive problems.\n\n\u201cA major threat to the sustainability of caregiving is that fewer caregivers are available for assistance,\u201d Gaugler said.\n\nAging baby boomers will depend, in increasingly greater numbers, on care provided by members of much smaller subsequent generations. Also, today\u2019s adult children are more likely to live far from their parents.\n\nIn 2010, the ratio between people age 45 to 64 (the typical age of caregivers) and people age 80 and up (those at highest risk of needing care) was 7 to 1. That ratio is projected to plunge to 4 to 1 by 2030 and to less than 3 to 1 by 2050.\n\nTechnology \u2014 robots, home monitoring equipment and other devices \u2014 can help fill some caregiving needs, Gaugler said, but not all.\n\n\u201cTo me, technology will act more as a supplement, not as a substitute,\u201d Gaugler said. \u201cThere\u2019s always an important human element to the caregiving dynamic. Relatives want family members.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Until just a few years ago, Jim Molnau, 69, didn&rsquo;t know how to run the dishwasher.", "title": "The Good Life: Who cares?
