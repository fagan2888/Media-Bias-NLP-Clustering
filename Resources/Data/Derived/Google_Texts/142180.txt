New fundraiser very successful

The Fort Morgan Young Farmers came up with a new activity this year that reflects the productivity and hard work of local agricultural producers.

They competed to see who had the best yields from their corn fields, and other Young Farmers tried to guess who would have the best results, said a release from the organization.

The Fort Morgan Young Farmers will be hosting the annual state institute this year, and wanted to find a new fundraiser for the occasion, the release says.

They looked at the success the Morgan County Cattlemen’s Association had with its Calcutta contest and decided to put their own spin on something that has been done in multiple things golf, beef cattle, etc.

The contest measured who had the best yields from a list of farmers who agreed to take part. Conrad Bostron won for the best yield, Bart Ginther took second place, Charlie Lauck took third, Keith Bath took fourth and Mike Kosman took fifth.

Others bought in on whose field would have the best yield, and Martin Christensen, Dennis Bostron, Chuck Miller and Dwight Miller picked Conrad Bostron.

Young Farmers gave away $5,300 in awards, along with a traveling trophy called “the corn cup,” which was awarded to Conrad Bostron as the highest yield grower.

Local farmers entered 16 fields in the contest this year.

The project had support from sponsors Simplot and DeKalb Seed, Pioneer Seed and CPS, the release says.

“We felt that because of all the support we got from local growers and sponsors that this year was a success, and based on the feedback we received, we only see this contest growing,” the release says. “We also see this as a huge learning opportunity for members and participants.“
