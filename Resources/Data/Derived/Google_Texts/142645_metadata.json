Researchers aren\u2019t sure why, but overweight patients with type 2 diabetes live longer than those who are underweight, normal weight, or obese. They\u2019re calling it the \u201cobesity paradox\u201d and have some theories as to why a little extra weight helps diabetics survive longer.\n\nThe study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed over 10,500 type 2 diabetes patients for more than 10 years and found an unusual trend: The overweight and obese patients were at greater risk for cardiovascular events, such as a heart attack or stroke, but the overweight group had a better chance at survival. And not just compared to the obese patients, but those who were overweight had better odds than those who were underweight or of normal weight with type 2 diabetes.\n\nWhen a person has type 2 diabetes, they have rising blood glucose levels, also known as sugar levels, according to the American Diabetes Association. Their bodies aren\u2019t able to process insulin properly because their pancreas isn\u2019t able to keep up with how much sugar they\u2019re ingesting or because their body is unable to use the insulin properly. It\u2019s the most common form of diabetes, affecting 90 to 95 percent out of the 26 million Americans who are diagnosed with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\nOverweight and obese people are at a heightened risk for developing type 2 diabetes, especially if they\u2019re over 45 years old, have a family member with it, live a sedentary lifestyle, have high blood pressure, or are of several minority groups.\n\nTen years ago researchers observed overweight and obese patients with coronary heart disease had better surgery outcomes than normal weight patients. They published their findings and described it as the \u201cobesity paradox,\u201d which is an umbrella term for overweight and obese people more likely to survive renal failure, heart failure, diabetes, and coronary heart disease, than their normal weight counterparts. Generally, if you\u2019re obese you have a 50 to 100 percent increased risk of premature rate compared to someone of normal weight, but when it comes to the obesity paradox, the opposite seems to be true.\n\nResearchers suspect the obesity paradox for type 2 diabetes may be because obesity\u2019s metabolic stress causes a different type of type 2 diabetes than the type non-obese people suffer. Another theory is patients with type 2 diabetes who have lower body mass indexes might smoke more cigarettes and drink more alcohol than overweight people. The researchers caution not to gain weight if you\u2019re diabetic and of normal weight. They\u2019re still trying to figure out why overweight people have a seeming advantage over every other weight group. Until then, they encourage diabetics to stay as healthy as they can.\n\nSource: Annals of Internal Medicine. 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "people, type, 2, diabetes, live, longer, if, theyre, overweight, what, obesity, paradox", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition, and overweight people survive with it the longest, according to a new study.", "title": "Overweight Type 2 Diabetics Live The Longest", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/people-type-2-diabetes-live-longer-if-theyre-overweight-what-obesity-paradox-331926", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/04/overweight-diabetics.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition, and overweight people survive with it the longest, according to a new study.", "title": "Overweight Type 2 Diabetics Live The Longest", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/people-type-2-diabetes-live-longer-if-theyre-overweight-what-obesity-paradox-331926", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/04/overweight-diabetics.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/04/overweight-diabetics.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-04T17:06:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-04T17:06:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition, and overweight people survive with it the longest, according to a new study."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9780\"", "article_summary": "Researchers suspect the obesity paradox for type 2 diabetes may be because obesity\u2019s metabolic stress causes a different type of type 2 diabetes than the type non-obese people suffer.\nResearchers aren\u2019t sure why, but overweight patients with type 2 diabetes live longer than those who are underweight, normal weight, or obese.\nTen years ago researchers observed overweight and obese patients with coronary heart disease had better surgery outcomes than normal weight patients.\nThey\u2019re calling it the \u201cobesity paradox\u201d and have some theories as to why a little extra weight helps diabetics survive longer.\nIt\u2019s the most common form of diabetes, affecting 90 to 95 percent out of the 26 million Americans who are diagnosed with type 1 and type 2 diabetes."}
