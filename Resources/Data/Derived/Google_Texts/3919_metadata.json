However, Stockpile could have trouble getting the buy-in from one key group of investors \u2014 young millennials.\n\nAccording to a study by Bankrate.com, only 26 percent of adults under 30 are investing in stocks. Dan Schawbel, partner and research director at Future Workplace, said that's because millennials have a lack of trust and confidence in the market.\n\nRead MoreMillennials are just saying no to stocks, sticking with cash\n\n\n\n\"Many are dealing with student loans and focusing more on achieving financial independence from their families right now,\" Schawbel told CNBC. \"People who are older have more money to invest in stocks and millennials weren't taught about the long- term implications of investing early rather than later in life.\"\n\n\n\nStill, some analysts say if marketed correctly, stock gift cards could give the traditional savings bond a run for its money.\n\n\"I think there is a great market for this, actually. They now have the grandparent market locked up,\" said Monica Mehta, a principal at Seventh Capital.\n\n\n\nRead More Retail stocks are not big performers on Cyber Monday\n\n\n\nMehta said this could be a natural substitute for people who want to give something special, as long as the receiver does not forget about the gift card. \"This offers the potential to get people to be more active with equities and be educational,\" she said.\n\nCNBC retail analyst Stacey Widlitz believes this has potential to be a great teaching tool, and may be the next category to eat into retail sales.\n\n\"As long as the stock market keeps going in the right direction, fueled by global monetary policy, a piece of the stock market might be a more enticing gift as opposed to the ugly Christmas sweater,\" said Widlitz.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "How about putting some stock in that stocking this year?
