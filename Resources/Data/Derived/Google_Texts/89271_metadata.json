Many stores and small businesses are already using tablets or mobile phones that swipe debit or credit card, of course. \u201cPurchases can now take place anywhere in the store thanks to payment technologies through mobile devices,\u201d said Scott Lachut of PSFK\u2019s Labs, which provides insights on retail trends.\n\nBut other changes are coming, fueled in part by new methods of mobile payment that are just starting to gain traction. Apple, of course, launched its Apple Pay mobile payment platform in the fall, and Square has been popular with small businesses and with the quick-service restaurant industry.\n\nRelated: 5 Innovations That Are Changing the Way We Shop\n\nStill, retailers and customers alike are looking ahead to the day when there won\u2019t be a checkout line at all and swiping a card \u2014 or even flashing your mobile phone \u2014 is a thing of the past. The promise is an even more efficient shopping experience for customers, while stores want to be able to process payments faster in order to increase sales.\n\n\u201cAre we at a point where customers can pick up an item and walk out? It\u2019s a little early to say,\u201d said Lachut.\n\nYet companies are moving in that direction. At the National Retail Federation\u2019s Big Show in New York City this week, Toshiba presented a new self-checkout concept called Touchless Commerce. It uses 3D and facial recognition technologies to quickly scan your face and the content of your basket at checkout, then immediately charges your credit card. As presented, the scanning would be limited to eight to 10 items in a supermarket basket, and perfecting the technology so that it can differentiate between multiple varieties of apples, for example, might take a while.\n\nJust imagine, though, what the shopping experience would be like: The moment you enter a store, facial recognition tech will identify you, a clerk will instantly know your purchase history, and you\u2019ll be presented with specific and personalized shopping items.\n\nThe upside? Transaction time can be reduced to less than two seconds. The downside? You potentially lose a bit more privacy, since you need to be registered ahead of time with your picture and credit card information at the ready.\n\nWhile the thought may be scary to some, this is only one step beyond where we are now: Stores, for example, already have data on what customers who use loyalty programs have bought, and retailers are already using that information to offer coupons or suggest other purchases. Amazon\u2019s recommendation engine may not be able to recognize your face, but it sure knows what you\u2019ve bought and like.\n\nRelated: Your Must-Read Guide to Mobile Payments\n\nTechnology isn\u2019t the only obstacle to getting systems like Toshiba\u2019s into stores. This concept, and others that will define the future of retail, are being teased at a time when the industry is struggling mightily. Retail sales in the U.S. fell in December by 0.9 percent, the biggest decline since last January, according to the Commerce Department on Wednesday. For any innovations to be widely adopted by retailers, they\u2019ll have to really be shown to increase sales or reduce costs.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "How we pay at stores and restaurants is changing: The traditional checkout counter slowly disappearing and being replaced by new technologies.", "title": "The Future of Retail: Hassle-Free Checkout", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/14/Future-Retail-Hassle-Free-Checkout", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11192012_shopping_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/14/Future-Retail-Hassle-Free-Checkout", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11192012_shopping_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "How we pay at stores and restaurants is changing: The traditional checkout counter slowly disappearing and being replaced by new technologies.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb268\"", "article_summary": "But other changes are coming, fueled in part by new methods of mobile payment that are just starting to gain traction.\nApple, of course, launched its Apple Pay mobile payment platform in the fall, and Square has been popular with small businesses and with the quick-service restaurant industry.\n\u201cPurchases can now take place anywhere in the store thanks to payment technologies through mobile devices,\u201d said Scott Lachut of PSFK\u2019s Labs, which provides insights on retail trends.\nThis concept, and others that will define the future of retail, are being teased at a time when the industry is struggling mightily.\nThe way we pay for goods and services at stores and restaurants is changing as the traditional checkout counter gets replaced by new technologies."}
