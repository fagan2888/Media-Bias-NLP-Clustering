Bernie Sanders is taking some of the boldest and potentially riskiest steps of his campaign ahead of the crucial New York primary, hoping to raise his profile and undercut Hillary Clinton\u2019s support among voters who are a key part of the Democratic electorate. After his debate with the Democratic presidential front-runner on Thursday, Mr. Sanders will leave the U.S. to appear at an academic conference at the Vatican devoted to themes of economic and social justice. Both issues are at the core of Mr. Sanders\u2019s message. But some Democrats are baffled as to why he would drop off the campaign trail for two days before the April 19 primary, where more delegates are at stake than in any other state save California.\n\nNancy Kaszerman/Zuma Press\n\n\u201cMy advice to Bernie would be: \u2018Don\u2019t go to the other side of the Hudson River. Stay here where you belong,\u2019 \u201csaid Hank Sheinkopf, a New York-based Democratic strategist not aligned with either candidate. Leading up to the primary, Mr. Sanders has also escalated criticism of both Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who remains a popular figure in the party. Only 9% of Democrats said they viewed Mr. Clinton negatively in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in February. Peter Nicholas reports.\n\nPlus: Seeking to press her case to Latino voters, Mrs. Clinton said Wednesday she would create a national Office of Immigrant Affairs that would coordinate government policy on the issue if she reaches the White House \u2026 Mrs. Clinton vowed Wednesday not to forget the African-American voters who are giving huge support to her campaign \u2026 Campaigning in New York City in advance of the Empire State\u2019s April 19 primary, Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton greeted striking Verizon Communications workers and rolled out key union endorsements, hoping to mobilize supporters in the organized labor movement.\n\nLAURA MECKLER: RACIAL ISSUES TAKE CENTER STAGE IN DEMOCRATIC CONTEST\n\nNEW YORK\u2014The Democratic presidential contest is once again all about race, as Bernie Sanders tries anew to make inroads with African-American voters who have propelled rival Hillary Clinton to a strong lead in the delegate count.

Louise Slaughter, one of the lions of the New York congressional delegation, in the closest race she has faced since her first election to the House three decades ago. This year, the same GOP challenger, Mark Assini, thinks he may be able to win, even though Democratic turnout tends to be higher in a presidential-election year. His weapon, he believes, is Donald Trump, who has been drawing thousands of supporters across western New York, an economically distressed area that finds the GOP presidential front-runner\u2019s brand of populism appealing. Some Republican leaders have been anxious, and some Democrats gleeful, about the down-ballot effects of a Trump nomination, given the real-estate developer\u2019s high unfavorability ratings among many groups of voters. But in the white, working-class districts such as those that are typical in western New York, there is a different story, which even some Democrats acknowledge. Siobhan Hughes reports.\n\nPlus: Mr. Trump hired Republican strategist Rick Wiley as national political director, signaling a continued effort by his presidential campaign to beef up a lean staff with more seasoned GOP operatives \u2026 Ted Cruz is ramping up his attacks against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ahead of next week\u2019s New York primary.\n\nREGULATORS PROPOSE BANNING THERANOS FOUNDER FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS: Federal health regulators have proposed banning Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes from the blood-testing business for at least two years after concluding that the company failed to fix what regulators have called major problems at its laboratory in California. In a letter dated March 18, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it plans to revoke the California lab\u2019s federal license and prohibit its owners, including Ms. Holmes and Theranos\u2019s president, Sunny Balwani, from owning or running any other lab for at least two years. That would include the company\u2019s only other lab, located in Arizona. The two labs generate most of Theranos\u2019s revenue and are at the core of its strategy to revolutionize the blood-testing industry with new technology, user-friendliness and quick results. John Carreyrou and Christopher Weaver report.\n\nSENATORS PROPOSE ENCRYPTION RULES: Two key lawmakers Wednesday circulated a proposal that would require companies to unlock encrypted technology when served with a court order, a notable change in the law that could escalate the clash between Silicon Valley and Washington. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R., N.C.) and the panel\u2019s vice chairman, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), are seeking input on proposed legislation that attempts to address one of the thorniest security issues vexing policy makers\u2014how to deal with the use of technology that cannot be read for law enforcement or national security purposes. The 10-page \u201cdiscussion draft\u201d would require firms, when served with a court order, to provide \u201csuch information or data\u201d or \u201cprovide technical assistance as is necessary to obtain such information or data\u201d when the government is seeking to obtain encrypted material.

A lot of voters, including a lot of Democratic voters, are not satisfied with the status quo.
