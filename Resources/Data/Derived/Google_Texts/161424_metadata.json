Officials say they\u2019re committed to keeping the HIV clinic open at its current location on North Fair Oaks Avenue \u2014 if they can find another operator, whether a private company or a nonprofit.\n\n\u201cThe city was the safety net when there was nobody else out there to provide these important services,\u201d said Steve Mermell, assistant city manager and acting public health director. \u201cThere\u2019s now people who are better placed \u2014 and financially incentivized by the federal government \u2014 to provide these services and do it much more cost-effectively than we can.\u201d\n\nPasadena is one of three cities in California, including Long Beach and Berkeley, that maintain its own public health department.\n\nLike those, Pasadena wants to focus more on education, disease detection and community wellness, with less money and time spent on providing medical treatments, according to Mermell.\n\nAt its meeting Monday, the council approved slashing the health department\u2019s budget \u2014 including the elimination of 27 employees, some of whom have been moved to other departments. The city hopes to secure jobs for the others with whoever takes over the clinic.\n\nPasadena has formed an ad hoc committee of council members to determine who that operator may be. Roughly $1.3 million in savings will come from closing the HIV and prenatal clinics, officials said.\n\n\u201cOur responsibility is to the clientele, who currently rely on these services, and assuring them that they have some level of assurance that these services will continue to be provided by someone,\u201d said Councilman Victor Gordo.\n\nA decision on the clinic\u2019s operator could be more than a month away. The health department\u2019s next-door neighbor, ChapCare Medical and Dental Health Center, has committed to taking over the prenatal clinic, but its board has yet to sign off on managing the HIV/AIDS side.\n\nThe city gave the center until July 15 to submit a proposal, though in the interim the council committee is investigating other federally qualified health centers as contenders.\n\n\u201cWe would just like to be given a chance, we think we can do it,\u201d said Margaret Martinez, CEO of ChapCare, who noted the health center sees more than 15,000 patients annually.\n\nOne problem is that ChapCare, which receives free rent to operate out of a city-owned building, does not have enough experience in operating an HIV clinic. That lack of history disqualifies them from receiving Ryan White grants, federal dollars given out by county health departments to support HIV services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPasadena opened the health department\u2019s Andrew Escajeda Clinic in 1991 because of a growing need for HIV services in the San Gabriel Valley. The clinic provides HIV and AIDS outpatient services, mental health treatment and HIV education free of charge to low-income and uninsured patients throughout Los Angeles County, largely thanks to the grants from the Los Angeles County Department of Health.\n\nFor some, the facility meant a difference between living and dying.\n\n\u201cTwenty-five years ago, I was diagnosed with HIV. I was told I only have six months to live,\u201d said Eduardo Martinez, hoping his plea will persuade the Pasadena City Council to maintain the clinic. \u201cToday, I am a living example that early diagnosis, staying on treatment and access to HIV medication saves lives \u2014 it saved my life.\u201d\n\nLike the prenatal care center, the HIV clinic benefited patients but could never make back its costs. For years, the health department lost money on the endeavor, with more than $2 million needed to get ahead of 2016\u2019s predicted shortfall.\n\nAs more people became insured through the Affordable Care Act, the clinics served fewer and fewer people, according to Mermell. The health department cannot receive insurance reimbursements because it is not a federally qualified health center.\n\nWhile the city does not have the resources to become one, the expansion of health care has made it so an increasing number of agencies can receive reimbursements, officials said.\n\nStill, some worry that any change in providers hurts patients. Victor Wu began receiving treatment for HIV at the health department clinic 15 years ago, and he is worried the city may choose a less experienced provider.\n\n\u201cIt just isn\u2019t easy if you\u2019re disabled and need services,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIf you\u2019re living with HIV and poor, it\u2019s even more challenging.\u201d\n\nMichael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, criticized the city for giving patients little warning and for not reaching out to organizations like AHF prior to Monday\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThe implications are not just for patients but the spread of the disease,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s been dozens of studies that say people who go to unqualified or less qualified providers do worse.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think that based upon what is happening, that the AIDS crisis was over in Pasadena and Los Angeles \u2014 which it is most definitely not.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pasadena\u2019s Public Health Department will stop offering HIV/AIDS and prenatal clinical services by the end of the year to reduce a projected $2 million deficit.The decision made Monday leaves more than 100 HIV patients uncertain of who wi", "title": "Pasadena Public Health Department moving away from HIV, prenatal clinics", "og": {"url": "http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/health/20150623/pasadena-public-health-department-moving-away-from-hiv-prenatal-clinics", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.pasadenastarnews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/pasadenastarnews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Pasadena Public Health Department moving away from HIV, prenatal clinics"}, "twitter": {"domain": "pasadenastarnews.com", "description": "Pasadena\u2019s Public Health Department will stop offering HIV/AIDS and prenatal clinical services by the end of the year to reduce a projected $2 million deficit.The decision made Monday leaves more than 100 HIV patients uncertain of who wi", "title": "Pasadena Public Health Department moving away from HIV, prenatal clinics", "url": "http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/health/20150623/pasadena-public-health-department-moving-away-from-hiv-prenatal-clinics", "image": {"src": "http://local.pasadenastarnews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/pasadenastarnews.png?052016"}, "site": "@PasStarNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563965297", "iphone": "id503656700", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.pasadenastarnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Public health, Public health news, Pasadena Public health news, CA Public health news, US Public health news, world Public health news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Public health, Public health news, Pasadena Public health news, CA Public health news, US Public health news, world Public health news."}, "article_summary": "The health department cannot receive insurance reimbursements because it is not a federally qualified health center.\nPasadena\u2019s Public Health Department will stop offering HIV/AIDS and prenatal clinical services by the end of the year to reduce a projected $2 million deficit.\nFor years, the health department lost money on the endeavor, with more than $2 million needed to get ahead of 2016\u2019s predicted shortfall.\nThat lack of history disqualifies them from receiving Ryan White grants, federal dollars given out by county health departments to support HIV services.\nThe decision made Monday leaves more than 100 HIV patients uncertain of who will provide their care after the final service date of September 30."}
