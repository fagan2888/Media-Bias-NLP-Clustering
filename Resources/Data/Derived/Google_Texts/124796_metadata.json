Changes made during the open enrollment period take effect Jan. 1, 2016. \u2022 People who have questions about Medicare and its offerings can visit the Senior Health Insurance Benefits Assistance Program\u2019s website at www.oregonshiba.org or set up an appointment to speak with one of its volunteer counselors by calling 541-678-5483. \u2022 The \u201cABCDs of Medicare\u201d is a workshop where a local expert will walk people through the program\u2019s basics. These workshops are offered at the Bend Senior Center, 1600 Reed Market Road, at 4:30 p.m. on the first Thursday of each month.\n\nFor the vast majority of Oregonians buying their own 2016 health insurance on HealthCare.gov, there\u2019s no way around it: You\u2019re going to pay more. In some cases, significantly more.\n\nAll the more reason to scrutinize the policies you\u2019re considering on a number of factors: not just the ballooning monthly premiums, but the out-of-pocket maximums, prescription drug coverage and networks, too.\n\nThe Oregon Insurance Division focuses a lot on carriers\u2019 average individual market rate increases between this year and next, but in reality, most people \u2014 especially those in Central Oregon \u2014 are going to see bigger increases than those averages. Moda, for example, got an average rate increase across its individual policies of 25.6 percent. If you live in Bend and have Moda\u2019s bronze plans, however, you\u2019re going to see a rate hike of about 42 percent.\n\nPacificSource Health Plans\u2019 average increase in individual plans is about 37 percent. Bendites with the carrier\u2019s bronze, silver or gold plans, however, will see increases of 48 and 49 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Patrick O\u2019Keefe, the owner and managing partner of the Cascade Insurance Center in Bend. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a fun year.\u201d\n\nA study released this month on premium increases in major cities in each state found that Portland had the second-highest rate increases in its silver plans between 2015 and 2016 \u2014 22.8 percent \u2014 beneath Minneapolis, which saw increases of 28.7 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAlthough people in Bend tend to be active and healthy compared to the rest of the state, there is a limited number of providers and only one hospital provider for carriers to contract with \u2014 St. Charles Health System, which means rates tend to be higher here, said Maile Austen, president of the Oregon Association of Health Underwriters.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t cost an individual any money \u2014 either up front or in the form of pricier insurance \u2014 to visit with a health insurance agent, and many agents say with plans being so complex and constantly changing, it\u2019s more important than ever to have experts help people pore over the options. Agents make their money off of commissions from health insurance companies, and the companies build those expenses into the overall cost of their policies.\n\nImportant points of policies everyone should focus on when choosing one, agents say, is networks, out-of-pocket maximums and formularies.\n\nMind your network\n\nSince provisions of the Affordable Care Act kicked in, insurance carriers can no longer ask people about their medical histories or pre-existing conditions. Because of that, they\u2019re taking on many more people who need lots of medical care.\n\nThat leaves carriers exposed to all kinds of risk they were able to avoid before, said Lisa Lettenmaier, a health insurance agent with Health Source Northwest in Portland. They\u2019ve mitigated that risk by forming contracts with smaller groups of providers, such as one hospital system or group of doctors.\n\nThese days, carriers often sell plans that are labeled as a preferred provider organization, which traditionally give customers a range of providers to choose from but act more as a health maintenance organization \u2014 a plan that requires you to see one physician for most of your care and get other care through referrals from that physician, Lettenmaier said. Today\u2019s narrow network plans often give people only a few options for doctors.\n\nAny providers not considered in-network, meaning the insurer has not negotiated specific rates with that provider, will be much more expensive, and they will not contribute to reaching a person\u2019s out-of-pocket maximum, the highest amount someone has to pay before the insurance plan covers 100 percent of their services.\n\nIn fact, a recent study by HealthPocket.com, a website that ranks health insurance plans, found that nearly 20 percent of plans sold to Oregonians via HealthCare.gov offer no coverage for out-of-network providers.\n\nAnd since there\u2019s no contract with the insurer, out-of-network providers can charge whatever they want for the services, Lettenmaier said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their choice,\u201d she said.\n\nOut-of-pocket max: The new deductible\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, none of a person\u2019s co-payments for medical expenses counted toward their out-of-pocket maximums. For that reason, many people never reached those maximums, said Don Klippenes, the founder of Health Insurance Strategies, Inc., in Bend. The ACA, however, made it so that all out-of-pocket medical expenses (to in-network providers, at least) are applied toward peoples\u2019 out-of-pocket maximums.\n\nFor that reason, although there\u2019s a lot of talk about the importance of deductibles, ultimately, the out-of-pocket maximum is the truly important number, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the key number going forward: that max out-of-pocket,\u201d Klippenes said.\n\nEach year, the federal government sets a new out-of-pocket maximum. This year? $6,850.\n\nMake no mistake: The deductible is important, too. That\u2019s the amount a person has to pay before your plan\u2019s benefits kick in. In a cheaper plan, it\u2019ll be higher. In an expensive plan, lower.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the drugs\n\nSeveral agents warned that carriers have revamped their formularies, the lists of drugs they cover, for 2016. If you need to take certain medications, it\u2019s important that you determine how much they\u2019ll cost under certain policies.\n\nFor 2016 open enrollment, the federal government is requiring insurers to post their drug formularies on their websites, and the lists must be updated when any changes are made.\n\nAlthough people will be able to find the drug lists online, it\u2019s never a bad idea to call the carriers directly and ask about specific drugs you know you\u2019ll need, Lettenmaier said.\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-383-0304,\n\ntbannow@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the vast majority of Oregonians buying their own 2016 health insurance on HealthCare.gov, there\u2019s no way around it: You\u2019re going to pay more.
