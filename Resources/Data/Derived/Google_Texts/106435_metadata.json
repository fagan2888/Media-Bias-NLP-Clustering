But a third example of Gruber saying much the same thing has, so far, received very little attention.\n\nRich Weinsten, the financial adviser who found the video of Gruber last year, has identified a published interview dated March 2013 in which Gruber seems to recapitulate, at least in part, his comments about states posing a threat to the law\u2019s success. While Gruber doesn\u2019t clearly state the relationship between state exchanges and subsidies as he did in the previous clips, he does allude to a \u201ccost\u201d to state residents that will be imposed in those states not setting up an exchange. Here is what Gruber said in a March 2013 interview with Employee Benefit Adviser magazine:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nI think the piece that isn\u2019t going so well is the next step with states. A number of states have done a great job and are getting ready to go for 2014. But a lot of states are uncertain and there are other states that are, unfortunately, playing a terrible political game at the cost of their state residents in not developing exchanges. Which states, specifically?\n\nIn terms of moving the legislative process forward, California, Maryland and Connecticut come to mind. Massachusetts was already there, of course. There are probably 10 states total that are ready for opening exchanges. Then there are the ones that are part of the large middle group that are sort of tip-toeing around legislation and preparedness for the law. The last group is the one that\u2019s the most worrisome to me. They\u2019re the states that are those stick-it-to-the-man conservative states that are trying to make political hay out of doing nothing.\n\nNow compare that to his statement from January 10, 2012, about the need for states to set up exchanges lest they cost their residents access to subsidies:\n\nThrough a political compromise, the decision was made that states should play a critical role in running these health insurance exchanges. And the health insurance exchanges are the centerpiece of this reform, because they are the place that individuals can go to shop for their new, securely priced health insurance. But if they\u2019re not set up in a way which is transparent, and which is convenient for shoppers, and which allows people to take their tax credits, and use them to effectively buy health insurance, it will undercut the whole purpose of the bill. Now a number of states have expressed no instance in doing so. A number of states like California has been a real leader. I think it was the first state to set up an exchange bill. It\u2019s been a leader in setting up its exchange. It\u2019s a great example. But California is rare. Only about 10 states have moved forward aggressively in setting up their exchanges. A number of states have even turned down millions of dollars in federal government grants as a statement of some sort, that they don\u2019t support health reform. I guess I\u2019m enough of a believer in democracy to think that\u2014when the voters in states see that by not setting up an exchange, the politicians of the state are costing state residents hundreds and millions and billions of dollars\u2014that they\u2019ll eventually throw the guys out, but I don\u2019t know that for sure. And that is really the ultimate threat is will people understand that, gee, if your governor doesn\u2019t set up an exchange, you\u2019re losing hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits to be delivered to your citizens. So that\u2019s the other threat is will states do what they need to to set it up.\n\nThere are a number of clear similarities in these two statements. In both cases, Gruber is talking about states which have or have not embraced Obamacare\u2019s exchanges. In both, he notes that \u201c10 states\u201d including California have moved forward aggressively. He also notes that some states are \u201cdoing nothing.\u201d Those are the states he describes as \u201cworrisome\u201d in the 2013 statement and as a \u201cthreat\u201d in the 2012 statement.\n\nGruber does not spell out what will happen in those states which fail to set up an exchange in the 2013 interview. Nevertheless, he does say these states are \u201cplaying a terrible political game at the cost of their state residents in not developing exchanges.\u201d What cost to residents is he describing?\n\nOne possible explanation is the same one that he gave in January 2012 (i.e. residents of states without exchanges would not receive subsidies). Given how similar the rest of his 2012 and 2013 statements are, that seems like a plausible reading.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A third example of Jonathan Gruber saying only states which set up an exchange will receive subsidies has received very little attention.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "A third example of Jonathan Gruber saying only states which set up an exchange will receive subsidies has received very little attention.", "title": "Jonathan Gruber in 2013: States Without Exchanges Will Cost Residents - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/jonathan-gruber-testimony-afp.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/02/jonathan-gruber-in-2013-states-without-exchanges-will-cost-residents/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A third example of Jonathan Gruber saying only states which set up an exchange will receive subsidies has received very little attention.", "creator": "@verumserum", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/jonathan-gruber-testimony-afp.jpg", "title": "Jonathan Gruber in 2013: States Without Exchanges Will Cost Residents - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jonathan Gruber, king v. burwell, subsidies,Big Government, Obamacare,jonathan gruber", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "subsidies", "published_time": "2015-03-02T18:58:25-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Nevertheless, he does say these states are \u201cplaying a terrible political game at the cost of their state residents in not developing exchanges.\u201d What cost to residents is he describing?\nBut a lot of states are uncertain and there are other states that are, unfortunately, playing a terrible political game at the cost of their state residents in not developing exchanges.\nWhile Gruber doesn\u2019t clearly state the relationship between state exchanges and subsidies as he did in the previous clips, he does allude to a \u201ccost\u201d to state residents that will be imposed in those states not setting up an exchange.\nresidents of states without exchanges would not receive subsidies).\nIn both cases, Gruber is talking about states which have or have not embraced Obamacare\u2019s exchanges."}
