It is an ideology acutely aware of its own limits and the limits of others. As a result of this humility, conservatism in the United States preaches decentralization, checks on authority, and constraints on power lest the public be subject to the tyranny of good intentions.\n\nThis definition of conservatism would be utterly alien to a regular reader of the New York Times\u2019 opinion pages. With the possible exception of Ross Douthat, each of the Times\u2019 \u201cconservative\u201d writers can only be described as conservative in its most Rooseveltian sense. The Times\u2019 conservative is a progressive Republican who subscribes to an ideology which is convinced of its own intellectual superiority and beneficence. Further, he appears to perceive himself to have a mandate to remake the world for the good of the many, insofar as he understands the many.\n\nThe Times provides its readers with nearly daily examples of their preferred vision of conservatism. Today\u2019s comes from conservative columnist David Brooks who, in an effort to tackle the problem of congressional gridlock during periods of divided government, has identified a solution to America\u2019s many woes: Grant even more unchecked authority to the executive branch.\n\nAfter taking a stroll through the Congressional Budget Office with a verity of moribund economists, Brooks drops a dime of knowledge on his audience: Government dysfunction and an out-of-control executive is, counter-intuitively, even more reason to augment presidential authority.\n\n\u201cThis is a good moment to advocate greater executive branch power because we\u2019ve just seen a monumental example of executive branch incompetence: the botched Obamacare rollout,\u201d Brooks pitches in a Slate-like fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s important to advocate greater executive branch power in a chastened mood. It\u2019s not that the executive branch is trustworthy; it\u2019s just that we\u2019re better off when the presidency is strong than we are when the rentier groups are strong, or when Congress, which is now completely captured by the rentier groups, is strong.\u201d\n\nBrooks rattles off a series of reasons why, in his opinion, Congress is hopelessly beholden to interest groups at the expense of members\u2019 constituents, and how the institution of the legislature itself has sprawled so much that it is perhaps irrevocably unwieldy and unresponsive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to be tolerant of executive branch power grabs and to give agencies flexibility,\u201d Brooks suggests. \u201cWe don\u2019t need bigger government. We need more unified authority. Take power away from the rentier groups who dominate the process. Allow people in those authorities to exercise discretion. Find a president who can both rally a majority, and execute a policy process.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 2013 Exposes Media\u2019s Love of Activist Government Over Effective Government\n\nThis window into a confounding mindset proves a point made in an earlier post: the press, by and large, is less biased towards the agenda of any individual political group than it is towards activist government. Brooks doesn\u2019t care who is in charge, so long as the wheels are turning at maximum efficiency. And if it takes something just shy of a monarch to accomplish this noble goal, so be it.\n\n[Photo via AP/White House]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n> >Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "This window into a confounding mindset proves a point made in an earlier post: the press, by and large, is less biased towards the agenda of any individual", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Time-WH.jpg", "title": "NY Times Conservative\u2019s Solution to America\u2019s Problems: Give President More Power"}, "twitter": {"description": "This window into a confounding mindset proves a point made in an earlier post: the press, by and large, is less biased towards the agenda of any individual political group than it is towards activist government.
