Bush has gone from being a political pariah in Republican ranks to once again being part of the in-crowd.\n\nMr. Bush\u2019s name was rarely mentioned by the candidates in the 2012 GOP presidential race, but on Tuesday Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina thundered away about how he longed for the nation\u2019s 43rd president of the United States.\n\n\u201cI blame Obama for [the Islamic State], not Bush,\u201d Mr. Graham said in the Republican undercard debate Tuesday in Las Vegas. \u201cI am tired of beating on Bush, I miss George W. Bush. I wish he were president right now. We wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham has been campaigning on the message that he is best prepared to protect the nation from international terrorism.\n\nHe appeared alongside former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, and former New York Gov. George Pataki in the opening GOP debate Tuesday.\n\nMr. Graham repeatedly said in the debate that the next president must be ready to send combat troops into Iraq and Syira to defeat the Islamic State, and said that he is sick of world leaders getting the better of President Obama \u2014 taking particular aim at Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cI am not afraid of a guy riding around on a horse without a shirt,\u201d Mr. Graham said, alluding to an infamous Putin photo. \u201cThe guy has a pair of twos, and acting like he has a full house and walking all over Obama.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are signs that former President George W.
