He declined to say how much the health-system is spending on the initiative. The funds are being diverted from the businesses\u2019 existing training budget.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating a tailored M.B.A. to Spectrum Health\u2019s needs,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cWe will be helping tailor the coursework, the experiences, the projects they\u2019re involved with, and the only people in the courses will be other Spectrum Health people.\u201d\n\nThe program is expected to take 22 months to complete. Classes likely will be held two days per-week every other week, and will include an online component, said John Reifel, interim dean of GVSU\u2019s business school.\n\n\u201cGrand Valley\u2019s history is serving community needs in the educational field,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just another opportunity for us to create and deliver programs that will be beneficial to, in this case, the area\u2019s largest employer.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmail Brian McVicar and follow him on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "GVSU", "title": "Why GVSU is creating a custom MBA program for Spectrum Health employees", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Why GVSU is creating a custom MBA program for Spectrum Health employees\", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/10/why_gvsu_is_creating_a_custom.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/grpress/news_impact/photo/gvsubiz100913jpg-6e2b7927f9f25b7e.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11399834\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-09T22:25:55Z\", \"author\": \"Brian McVicar | bmcvicar@mlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@gr-news\",\"@gr-river\",\"@mlive-business\",\"@mlive-news\",\"@wm-business\",\"GVSU\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.mlive.com/grpress/news_impact/photo/13552782-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@GRMcVicar", "site": "@mlive", "card": "summary", "description": "When Roger Jansen ponders the future of the health care industry, he sees plenty of obstacles on the horizon."}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, October 09, 2013,  8:28 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.mlive.com/grpress/news_impact/photo/gvsubiz100913jpg-6e2b7927f9f25b7e.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"brianmcvicar\", \"author_nickname\": \"Brian McVicar | bmcvicar@mlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"8206984\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Grand Rapids News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "When Roger Jansen ponders the future of the health care industry, he sees plenty of obstacles on the horizon.", "title": "Why GVSU is creating a custom MBA program for Spectrum Health employees", "url": "http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/10/why_gvsu_is_creating_a_custom.html", "image": "http://media.mlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_mlive.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "MLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, October 09, 2013,  6:24 PM", "article_author": "Brian McVicar | bmcvicar@mlive.com", "Description": "When Roger Jansen ponders the future of the health care industry, he sees plenty of obstacles on the horizon."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa42\"", "article_summary": "With that in mind, Spectrum is partnering with Grand Valley State University to create its own, customized M.B.A program, which aims to give Spectrum employees the skills needed to lead the West Michigan health care system.\nGRAND RAPIDS, MI - When Roger Jansen ponders the future of the health care industry, he sees plenty of obstacles on the horizon.\nThe training will aim to help Spectrum employees \u2013 doctors moving into leadership roles and employees currently focused on business operations \u2013 develop leadership skills and think critically about business decisions, he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating a tailored M.B.A. to Spectrum Health\u2019s needs,\u201d Jansen said.\n\u201cWe will be helping tailor the coursework, the experiences, the projects they\u2019re involved with, and the only people in the courses will be other Spectrum Health people.\u201dThe program is expected to take 22 months to complete."}
