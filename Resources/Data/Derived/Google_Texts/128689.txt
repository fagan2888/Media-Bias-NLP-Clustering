Kim Bimestefer, College of Business and Economics (CBE) alumna and president of health insurer Cigna’s Mountain States Region, has been recognized by the Denver Business Journal (DBJ) for helping the insurance giant adapt to the federal Affordable Care Act. As a result, the DBJ presented Bimestefer with an Outstanding Women in Business award for health care.

Through her work, Bimestefer is helping both employers and their employees manage health costs, and is working with care providers to deliver top-quality, affordable care. Bimestefer developed Cigna’s “The Three Pillars of Well-Being” program and has teamed up with the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center to take its innovative treatment of overweight and obese people to employers offering Cigna insurance.

Bimestefer has been with Cigna since 2001, when she became president of the company’s Taft-Hartley & Federal Business segment, which provides health benefit options to federal and multi-employer plans.

When Bimestefer was promoted to head of Cigna’s mountain region — including Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico — in 2012, the insurer’s Western region president, Christopher De Rosa, praised her “proven track record of developing benefits solutions for diverse groups of clients and customers.”
