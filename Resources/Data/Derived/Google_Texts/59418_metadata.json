The company serves 10 different market segments, including diagnostic products, surgical aspirators, shunts, orthopedic implants and cardiovascular syringes.\n\nFaig said the focus on medical is important: \u201cEverything we do is about health care. We get up in the morning and we think about health care. We go to sleep at night, we think about health care.\u201d\n\nBuilding MedPlast was not easy, said Faig and Andrew Brickman, partner in Baird\n\nCapital Partners, who relived the formation of the medical supplier May 8 at the conference, held in the new Cleveland Convention Center. Moderating the session was Andrew Petryk, managing director of Brown Gibbons Lang & Co., which represented the sellers when MedPlast bought part of Allied Tech Products Corp. and Orthoplastics Ltd.\n\n\u201cThis deal will go down as the toughest transaction I\u2019ve ever worked on,\u201d Brickman said, \u201cbut it\u2019s going to be fruitful.\u201d\n\nBaird Capital bought ATP\u2019s engineered rubber and plastics group and K&W Medical Specialties, bringing together five plants. Baird compiled a management team, led by Faig, to run Medplast. Faig has decades of plastics experience, as CEO of Tech Group Inc. and before that, a longtime executive of machinery builder Milacron LLC. He had retired from both companies.\n\n\u201cWe got in there thinking we\u2019ll just go buy a medical company and call it a day, and scale it [up],\u201d Brickman said. In 2008, the market was \u201cfrothy\u201d and selling prices were high.\n\n\u201cWe fought it out and formed MedPlast,\u201d he said.\n\nThen the Great Recession hit.\n\n\u201cIt was very painful right out of the gate,\u201d Brickman said.\n\nBrickman called plastics \u201ca tough business,\u201d even in good times. And medical is one of most challenging markets, as customers want to remove costs and demand perfect quality from the molder.\n\nBrickman and Faig said the immediate hard times proved the axiom that people are critical. Faig had brought over some key plastics people from Tech Group.\n\n\u201cI had a very loyal team of people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a seasoned team, and that, in my mind, was the difference between winning and losing in 2008.\u201d\n\nFaig also said a plastics supplier must have employees with medical-sector experience and a disciplined corporate culture, since mistakes can carry very severe consequences \u2014 or even fatal ones.\n\nThe owners steadily invested in expansion and clean rooms. Then in 2012, MedPlast bought United Plastics Group Inc. That deal brought contract manufacturing and operations in China and Mexico. A year later, MedPlast bought U.K.-based Orthoplastics and its device implants expertise.\n\nFaig said the result is a broad medical plastics company that is more of a one-stop shop than traditional medical molders. Having plants in different locations also is important, because health care customers would rather not travel to far-flung locations as they develop highly complex products, he said.\n\nLooking ahead, Faig said single-use devices will continue to grow, and regulations are getting tighter. The Affordable Care Act is bringing millions of new health care consumers. And demand is increasing for medical devices for use at home, outside of the hospital.\n\nFaig said MedPlast is getting into blow, fill and seal technology. The company also is looking at 3-D printing, although he did not give details.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very, very bullish on the medical markets,\u201d Faig said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20140617/NEWS/140619917/focused-m-a-strategy-creates-a-stronger-medplast"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce353\"", "article_summary": "Then in 2012, MedPlast bought United Plastics Group Inc.
