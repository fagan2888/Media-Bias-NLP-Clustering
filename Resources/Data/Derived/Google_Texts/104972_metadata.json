Prior to 2014, the state also chipped in with funding, but that is not the case now and it\u2019s leaving the dozens of addiction recovery centers around Washington scrambling to cover the gap left in their funding.\n\nThe Seattle-based nonprofit, Recovery Centers of King County spent $21,000 of its own reserve money in January to cover the difference.\n\n\u201cI was horrified and instantly terrified. How are we going to survive this year?\u201d said CEO Dr. Pat Knox.\n\n\u201cI was anticipating a reduction in fees but I didn\u2019t know the magnitude. When we pulled together the numbers for January my heart dropped. I got a sick feeling in my stomach,\u201d said Norm Redberg, Director of Alcohol Drug Dependency Services in Ellensburg.\n\nFor recovering addicts like Emily Scheving of Kent, who is recovering from alcoholism, the outpatient programs at places like the Seattle location of Recovery Centers of King County, where she gets counseling, are very much needed for her recovery.\n\n\u201cThe program is important, especially because (they provide) childcare. For a mother it\u2019s really hard to try to work a job and do outpatient and not have childcare. I don\u2019t know what I would do without it,\u201d said Scheving.\n\nSeveral nonprofits contacted by news outlet KING 5 said if the legislature doesn\u2019t make a budget fix in the next two weeks, outpatient services for thousands of people will be scrapped. It\u2019s so bad that the Recovery Centers of King County is considering selling their Seattle building or closing down one of their two locations altogether.\n\n\u201cIt certainly is (a crisis) and no one seems to care at DSHS and the legislature doesn\u2019t know that this is happening,\u201d said Knox.\n\nTop DSHS managers who oversee chemical dependency programs in the state told KING 5 they do care about the service, but that it is out of the Department\u2019s hands and up to the legislature to authorize DSHS to pay the same rates they were paying in the past.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the legislature\u2019s decision at this point,\u201d said Jane Beyer, Asst. Secretary of Behavioral Health and Service Integration Administration at DSHS. \u201cOur concern needs to be with everyone that needs chemical dependency treatment. We\u2019re doing the best that we can with the resources available to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmaller agencies will go out of business. The patients will not go away,\u201d said Knox. \u201cThey will be on long waiting lists to receive treatment and they will fill the hospitals and jails. More of them will be living on the streets of Seattle and surrounding neighborhoods as their addiction progresses.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A glitch in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is threatening outpatient programs for those who are poor and in recovery for alcohol and drugs in Washington.", "generator": "NGFB 8.29.7-1/G", "og": {"site_name": "Testing It Up", "description": "A glitch in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is threatening outpatient programs for those who are poor and in recovery for alcohol and drugs in Washington.
