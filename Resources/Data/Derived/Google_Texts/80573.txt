South Korea said in a recent white paper that not only has the North made dramatic progress in the development of its nuclear program, but that it has also more than likely developed missiles that are capable of reaching — and striking — the United States.

“[The North is] presumed to have (missiles) capabilities that could threaten the U.S. mainland, having fired off long-range missiles five times,” the white paper from South Korea’s defense ministry said, BBC reported.

And on nuclear — Pyongyang has conducted three nuclear-related tests, the latest of which was known to have taken place in February 2013, BBC reported.

“North Korea’s capabilities of miniaturizing nuclear weapons appear to have reached a significant level,” the white paper said, BBC reported.

Miniaturizing a nuclear device basically allows it to be affixed to the tip of a long-range missile — one that’s capable of reaching South Korea, or even the United States.

At the same time, a ministry official told Yonhap News that analysts haven’t found intelligence to confirm the white paper’s assessments.
