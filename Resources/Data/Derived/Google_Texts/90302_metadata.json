It was an underwhelming address from the Leader of the Free World who finds the crown so heavy and bothersome that he puts it down aside the putting green.\n\nIn his address, Obama did well in the \u201csympathy-in-chief\u201d role. I do believe that Obama is horrified and saddened, as all Americans are, about the tragic fate of James Foley. But Obama failed in his actual job \u2014 that of a leader who must express genuine and righteous anger about this act of barbarism against all people who cherish liberty.\n\nObama has displayed more passion and employed sharper rhetoric when talking about Republicans in Congress \u2014 who, last I heard, are not in the business of sawing off heads to make their point clear. Maybe we\u2019ll get a better performance from our president if ISIS makes fun of the Obamacare website.\n\nRead the whole transcript of Obama\u2019s remarks here, but this is the excerpt that matters to me:\n\nPeople like this ultimately fail. They fail because the future is won by those who build and not destroy. The world is shaped by people like Jim Foley and the overwhelming majority of humanity who are appalled by those who killed him.\n\nObama\u2019s phrasing \u2014 \u201cpeople like this ultimately fail\u201d \u2014 is passive and weak. It\u2019s akin to Obama\u2019s frequent rhetorical tic about anyone in America who opposes his agenda being on the \u201cwrong side of history.\u201d It\u2019s a throw-away line. It\u2019s meaningless, especially from him. Our semi-retired president just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nAn ideology, a movement, or a nation ultimately fails because someone put them on the wrong side of history. The history-writers are the ideological victors \u2014 almost always via war. The people of those nations sacrificed many lives and much treasure to present the \u201cright side of history,\u201d to ensure that \u201cpeople like this ultimately fail.\u201d At the end of the 20th Century, a history in favor of liberty was written by the West, the inheritors of the Enlightenment. Despite Obama\u2019s rhetoric, such results did not, and will not, happen passively \u2014 and certainly not because The One merely states it.\n\nIt took the West\u2019s leadership and action to ensure the Nazis would \u201cultimately fail.\u201d It took the West\u2019s leadership and action to ensure Soviet Communism would \u201cultimately fail.\u201d It was the West\u2019s reluctance for total victory in Korea allowed the Kim clan to write their own \u201cright side of history,\u201d which has starved and enslaved millions of innocents. The Democrats\u2019 betrayal of its South Vietnamese allies allowed the murderous communists to write its own \u201cright side of history.\u201d So far, at least, many oppressors and murderers in the world \u2014 for decades \u2014 are not counted among those who will \u201cultimately fail.\u201d\n\nAnd if the West doesn\u2019t fully rise to the challenge of Islamic Fascism, centuries of Enlightenment progress for the betterment of liberty will be wiped away in a new history written by these Islamist Fascist monsters.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/08/obama-isis-and-being-on-the-right-side-of-history-between-tee-times/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/obama-vacation-1.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "Obama, ISIS, and Being on the Right Side of History Between Tee Times"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0861\"", "article_summary": "President Obama on Wednesday slightly delayed his afternoon tee time to speak about the monstrous beheading of American journalist James Foley by ISIS.\nRead the whole transcript of Obama\u2019s remarks here, but this is the excerpt that matters to me:People like this ultimately fail.\nI do believe that Obama is horrified and saddened, as all Americans are, about the tragic fate of James Foley.\nObama\u2019s phrasing \u2014 \u201cpeople like this ultimately fail\u201d \u2014 is passive and weak.\nAn ideology, a movement, or a nation ultimately fails because someone put them on the wrong side of history."}
