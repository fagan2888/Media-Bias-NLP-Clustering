NBC 7's Liberty Zabala explains how the agency is reaching out to ethnic minorities to make sure they're covered.

Over 600,000 of those are Latino,\u201d said 80th District Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez.\n\nDoctor: Covered California Patients May Be Denied Care\n\nThe health insurance website for the Affordable Care Act is set to reopen Saturday, but a local doctor tells NBC 7's Omari Fleming patients with insurance through that program should call their potential doctor or use a broker to make sure they will be covered. (Published Friday, Nov. 14, 2014)\n\n\u201cNot only because there's language barriers, but because there's cultural barriers to having insurance and what it does and how it works and the necessity to have it,\" said Bergstrom, a specialist with Covered California.\n\nMany minorities are concerned health care costs too much and signing up may get their family members who don't have legal status in trouble with immigration.\n\n\u201cThe agencies don\u2019t interact with Covered California, but there is still concern about it,\" Bergstrom clarified.\n\nCovered California hired 200 call center employees who speak other languages and launched easy to understand ads, hoping to reduce cultural concerns and increase health care for those who may need it most.\n\n\u201cIt has a positive feeling at the end of the day to say that these people are covered and they can have care that is affordable for them,\u201d Bergstrom said.\n\nEnrollment ends Feb. 15.
