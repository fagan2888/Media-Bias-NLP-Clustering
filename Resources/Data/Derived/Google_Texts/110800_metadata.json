To be more specific, Tobergta has been written up having sexual relations with pool rafts and, on one occasion, a pumpkin \u2014 and that's just the times he\u2019s been caught.\n\nThe 32-year-old Ohio native just can\u2019t seem to help himself when in the presence of a pool raft. Earlier this week, drivers spotted him on the side of a rode having what appeared to be sex with a pink life raft, WFLA reported. Tobergta is a somewhat repeat offender for this sort of crime, having been arrested a multiple other times for similar reasons, Deadspin reported.\n\nIn 2013, he was found having illicit relations with a pool raft in the view of a child. The judge who proceeded over Tobergta\u2019s trial called the sex act \u201clewd\u201d and \u201csomething society\u2019s not going to tolerate,\u201d as reported by Gawker. Tobergta, whose family claims is suffering from mental problems, has acknowledged that his actions are not acceptable. \"I do want to apologize for my actions. I'm sorry,\" Tobergta told the court at his sentencing. \"I'm ready to get my life together and quit all this nonsense.\"\n\nTobergta is not alone in his sexual preference for inanimate objects. Object sexuality is a psychological condition referring to individuals who develop deep emotional and/or romantic attachments to (and have sexual relationships with) inanimate objects or structures. It is not considered a fetish because these individuals consider themselves as an equal to the object and are not solely using it to enhance or facilitate their sexual behavior, Psychology Today reported. Tobergta\u2019s family insists the 32-year-old meant no harm by his crimes. \"He has a lot of mental problems and he's always had a fascination for plastic,\" Linda Tobergta explained, according to Gawker. \"That's just it. That's all of it. We never could get the proper care for Edwin. It's like nobody cares.\" Tobergta is currently being held on $18,000 bond.\n\nGerman sexologist Volkmar Sigusch has done extensive research into those who enjoy relations with objects and structures. According to him, today\u2019s society makes it difficult for many to form intimate or trusting relations with another person. \"Cities are populated by an entire army of socially isolated individuals. Singles, isolated people, cultural sodomites, many perverts and sex addicts,\u201d Sigusch told Psychology Today. Although strange, Sigusch doesn\u2019t feel those who have relations with objects are harmful to society \u201cThey're not abusing or traumatizing other people. Who else can you say that about?\" he said. So, it seems as long as Tobergta keeps his sexual conduct behind closed doors and away from the eyes of children, there\u2019s really no harm done.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sex, public, plastic, pool, raft, has, landed, guy, jail, five, times, family, say, he, just, loves", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Edwin Charles Tobergta of Ohio has been arrested for having sex with a pink inflatable pool raft in public \u2014 the sixth time the 32-year-old has been arrested on such charges.", "title": "Ohio Man Caught Having Sex With Plastic Pool Raft In Public\u2026 Again", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sex-public-plastic-pool-raft-has-landed-guy-jail-five-times-family-say-he-just-loves-plastic-288030", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/12/shutterstock14579665.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Edwin Charles Tobergta of Ohio has been arrested for having sex with a pink inflatable pool raft in public \u2014 the sixth time the 32-year-old has been arrested on such charges.", "title": "Ohio Man Caught Having Sex With Plastic Pool Raft In Public\u2026 Again", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sex-public-plastic-pool-raft-has-landed-guy-jail-five-times-family-say-he-just-loves-plastic-288030", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/12/shutterstock14579665.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/12/shutterstock14579665.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-06-12T15:55:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-12T15:55:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Edwin Charles Tobergta of Ohio has been arrested for having sex with a pink inflatable pool raft in public \u2014 the sixth time the 32-year-old has been arrested on such charges."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29c2\"", "article_summary": "Edwin Charles Tobergta has been arrested for the sixth time for public indecency for having sex with an inanimate object.\nTo be more specific, Tobergta has been written up having sexual relations with pool rafts and, on one occasion, a pumpkin \u2014 and that's just the times he\u2019s been caught.\nIn 2013, he was found having illicit relations with a pool raft in the view of a child.\nEarlier this week, drivers spotted him on the side of a rode having what appeared to be sex with a pink life raft, WFLA reported.\nThe 32-year-old Ohio native just can\u2019t seem to help himself when in the presence of a pool raft."}
