CONCORD, N.C. — NASCAR’s most popular driver is now one of the most popular people on Twitter.

Dale Earnhardt Jr. reached 1 million followers Saturday on the social networking site. The announcement came Saturday from @TwitterSports. Earnhardt responded on Twitter with “A million thanks.”

Earnhardt won NASCAR’s most popular driver voting for 12 straight seasons, from 2003-14. He’s closing in Bill Elliott’s mark of 16, which included a run of 10 straight from 1991-2000.

Earnhardt is starting 15th in Sunday night’s Coca-Cola 600, NASCAR’s longest race of the year. He is fifth in Sprint Cup points and won at Talladega Speedway this month.
