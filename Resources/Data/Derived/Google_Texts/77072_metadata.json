Council of Churches, a \"statewide ecumenical organization promoting Christian unity and working toward a more just society.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting focused on the cost of not expanding Medicaid, especially in Pitt County, organizers said.\n\n\"As a spiritual leader, a pastor that often goes to the hospital, gets the call to minister to people in the emergency room ... it amazes me how well they do operate given the number of people they serve,\" the Rev. Bob Hudak said. \"What the public doesn't know is the strain on the system.\"\n\nPoliticians and the general public do not understand that the United States already has universal health care, Hudak said \u2014 it's the emergency departments of the nation's hospitals. However, much of the care delivered there is never paid for because the people seeking treatment do not have health insurance, he said.\n\nThe group discussed a public hearing the state Department of Health and Human Services is holding from 2-4 p.m. today on a proposed plan for reforming Medicaid in North Carolina. The hearing is being held in the Emerald Ballroom of the Greenville Convention Center.\n\nAdvocates of Medicaid expansion, which the Republican-led General Assembly has repeatedly rejected, say the public hearings are a good opportunity to ask for Medicaid expansion.\n\nStates that have implemented Medicaid expansion and requested waivers from the standard Medicaid program have had their application reviews fast-tracked, said Liz Millar, Medicaid Expansion Project coordinator for the N.C. Council of Churches. Including expansion will ensure North Carolina's plan is expedited, Millar said.\n\nRepublican leaders have opposed expansion because the state's Medicaid system often faces cost overruns. Republican leaders say they did not want to expand Medicaid until overruns were controlled and the system is reformed.\n\nRepublican leaders also cited the fact that states that accept expansion will eventually cover up to 10 percent of the costs.\n\n\"I like the analogy that for every $1 North Carolina invests we'll get $9 back,\" Millar said. \"It will be economically beneficial for North Carolina to expand even with the added cost we have to pay.\"\n\nOne million North Carolinians did not have health insurance in 2013, Millar said. With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, that number has been cut in half, she said. If the state accepted expansion, another 300,000 people would have been covered, she said.\n\nA 2015 reported by the Greensboro-based Cone Health Foundation shows that this year 6,577 Pitt County residents did not qualify for Medicaid but did not earn enough money to afford insurance through Obamacare's insurance exchange program.\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act was implemented, it was thought all states would accept expansion, and individuals who did not meet Medicaid requirements would be covered.\n\nUnder Medicaid, individuals have to meet two requirements to qualify: They have to be low-income, and they have to be either pregnant, a parent with children, blind or disabled, Millar said.\n\nThe federal poverty level for qualifying for Medicaid is a salary of $11,970 for a single person and $24,250 for a family of four. Expansion would allow individuals and families with higher incomes to receive Medicaid, she said.\n\nSome working families qualify for a subsidy to pay for insurance on the exchange. However, families whose incomes fall near the federal poverty level do not because they are supposed to be covered by the expansion, she said.\n\nTreating patients without insurance will produce $12.8 million in uncompensated costs this year, Millar said. Statewide, uncompensated costs will reach $433 million this year.\n\nThe foundation estimates that if the state had accepted expansion dollars, 300 additional jobs would have been generated in Pitt County by health care providers and the businesses they work with, Millar said.\n\nDuring the first two years of expansion, which began in 2014, states received 100 percent funding from the federal government. Starting this year, states will begin sharing a percentage of the costs, Millar said. By 2020, states accepting expansion funding will pay 10 percent of the costs.\n\nJerry Lotterhos, an audience member, said his personal faith compels him to support efforts to enact Medicaid expansion. But along with his faith, Lotterhos said it makes financial sense to support expansion so hospitals such as Vidant Medical Center are compensated for the care they receive.\n\nThe reform plan being discussed today will create six Medicaid regions across North Carolina. Beneficiaries will choose a Medicaid health care plan offered in the region. Each region will have a minimum of four plans, at least three plans that cover Medicaid services anywhere in the state and one or more plans that cover services anywhere in the region.\n\nToday's meeting is the 10th in 12 public hearings. The remaining hearings will be 10 a.m.-noon Saturday at College of The Albemarle, Room AE 208, 1208 N. Road St., Elizabeth City and 3:30-5:30 p.m. Monday at UNC Pembroke, Moore Hall Auditorium, 1 University Drive, Pembroke.\n\nTo learn more about the Medicaid Reform proposal visit http://www.ncdhhs.gov/nc-medicaid-reform.\n\nContact Ginger Livingston at glivingston@reflector.com or 252-329-9570.
