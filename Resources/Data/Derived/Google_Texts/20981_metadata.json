The driver was not identified.\n\nAlbanese\u2019s mother, Marion Harper, said Saturday that she wasn\u2019t sure who Albanese was talking to on the phone at the time of the crash. She used the phone frequently to stay in touch with clients, her mother said.\n\n\u201cShe was very dependent on it because of the nature of her business,\u201d Harper said.\n\nAlbanese held a degree in physiology and sports nutrition from Texas A&M University, according to her Facebook page.\n\nShe was one of the most popular fitness trainers at Park Cities Personal Training, where she\u2019d worked for 16 years, said Michael Callahan, a co-worker.\n\nShe enjoyed horseback riding, fishing and scuba diving.\n\n\u201cShe had a very firecracker-type personality,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t easily pushed around.\u201d\n\nHe said he noticed police cars outside the gym around noon Friday but didn\u2019t pay much attention to the commotion because he didn\u2019t expect someone he knew to have been involved in the crash.\n\nAlbanese was on her lunch break at the time, but \u201cnone of us would have expected it was one of our trainers in any peril,\u201d Callahan said.\n\nAlbanese was pronounced dead about 12:45 p.m. at Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas.\n\nCo-workers realized what had happened after a client called the gym and said she didn\u2019t show up to his wife\u2019s appointment in the afternoon.\n\nDallas chef Stephan Pyles said he was devastated by the death of his longtime trainer and \u201cwild sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cThings will move on eventually \u2014 as they do in life, but they will never be the same as they were,\u201d he wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cNo one could ever compare to her professional drive, which was laced and balanced by hysterical sarcasm.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA3L3BvbGljZS1wZWRlc3RyaWFuLXN0cnVjay1raWxsZWQtd2hpbGUtY3Jvc3NpbmctdGhlLXN0cmVldC13YXMtb24taGVyLXBob25lLWFuZC1kaWRudC1sb29rLWJvdGgtd2F5cy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Naheed Rajwani", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "A Park Cities personal trainer died Friday afternoon after she was hit by a car while crossing an Oak Lawn street near the gym where she worked.
