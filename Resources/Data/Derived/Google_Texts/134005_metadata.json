(Nikki Boertman/The Commercial Appeal via AP) (Photo: AP)\n\nIn Pete Heck\u2019s column, \u201cCarson strikes fear on the left,\u201d it appears that Carson\u2019s views are the opposite of the conservative views his party favors:\n\nCarson stated in 2013 that semiautomatic firearms should be better regulated in large cities and high-crime areas.\n\nIn an October 2015 interview, Carson stated: \u201cI actually have something I would use the Department of Education for, to monitor our institutions of higher education for extreme political bias and deny federal funding on that basis.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2015 presidential campaign, Carson has said that the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 should \u201cpossibly\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d be higher. He supports a two-tiered minimum wage system, with a lower \u201cstarter\u201d minimum wage for young workers. He also supports indexing the minimum wage to inflation, \u201cso that we never have to have this conversation again in the history of America.\u201d\n\nAs an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, Carson says: \u201cHere\u2019s my solution. When a person is born, give him a birth certificate, an electronic medical record and a health savings account.\u201d In a December 2014 op-ed, Carson elaborated: \u201cWe need to remove health care from the political arena and recognize that any government proposals affecting the health of all citizens should be free market-based and should be so appealing that it would not be necessary to force citizens into the program.\u201d\n\nIn October 2015, Carson said that if someone preferred the current Medicare or Medicaid programs to the health-savings-account approach, \u201cI\u2019m not going to deny you the privilege of doing that.\u201d\n\nSo the Carson campaign\u2019s demise will most likely come from within his own party.\n\nEd Dunston\n\nIndianapolis\n\nRead or Share this story: http://indy.st/1NjGqZr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Ben Carson\u2019s views are the opposite of the conservative views his party favors.", "og": {"site_name": "Indianapolis Star", "description": "Ben Carson\u2019s views are the opposite of the conservative views his party favors.", "title": "Ben Carson\u2019s views aren\u2019t conservative", "url": "http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/11/01/ben-carsons-views-conservative/75021966/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/indystar.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ben Carson\u2019s views are the opposite of the conservative views his party favors.", "title": "Ben Carson\u2019s views aren\u2019t conservative", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce2d7f1d175678512cf79e4053a12f2bf04b9e58/c=816-0-4080-3264&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/01/Indianapolis/B9319522292Z.1_20151101213016_000_GU7CE2P0B.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@indystar", "site": "@indystar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=559965350", "fb": {"app_id": 108716282521686}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/Ben Carson 2016 Presidential Campaign", "gci-categories": "Events/Ben Carson 2016 Presidential Campaign", "gci-asset-type": "data", "title": "Ben Carson\u2019s views aren\u2019t conservative", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eec95b51304e746bcb5bbd5d4848bba87b5950fa/c=1224-0-3672-3264/local/-/media/2015/11/01/Indianapolis/B9319522292Z.1_20151101213016_000_GU7CE2P0B.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/326f7eb2019422a6859dd15bf42c2b8faee9997b/c=816-0-4080-3264/local/-/media/2015/11/01/Indianapolis/B9319522292Z.1_20151101213016_000_GU7CE2P0B.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a7d04ba0b9ffe015983c6f43128987514ef3b0a0/c=272-0-4624-3264/local/-/media/2015/11/01/Indianapolis/B9319522292Z.1_20151101213016_000_GU7CE2P0B.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a850aef4fcef27b654f1f6066cd6a85bf1ba6cbd/c=0-255-4896-3009&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/11/01/Indianapolis/B9319522292Z.1_20151101213016_000_GU7CE2P0B.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-11-01T21:44:57.787000-05:00", "shorthed": "Ben Carson\u2019s views aren\u2019t conservative", "articleid": 75021966, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4c04e1f05f3ce3c71fe2015bd223778ae372279e/c=0-255-4896-3009/local/-/media/2015/11/01/Indianapolis/B9319522292Z.1_20151101213016_000_GU7CE2P0B.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e3e7341ec5e7268c8e1083975de4bc939f9a5b57/c=1530-0-3366-3264/local/-/media/2015/11/01/Indianapolis/B9319522292Z.1_20151101213016_000_GU7CE2P0B.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "He supports a two-tiered minimum wage system, with a lower \u201cstarter\u201d minimum wage for young workers.\nRepublican presidential candidate Ben Carson speaks during a rally Friday, Oct. 30, 2015, at West Memphis High School in West Memphis, Ark.\n(Nikki Boertman/The Commercial Appeal via AP) (Photo: AP)In Pete Heck\u2019s column, \u201cCarson strikes fear on the left,\u201d it appears that Carson\u2019s views are the opposite of the conservative views his party favors:Carson stated in 2013 that semiautomatic firearms should be better regulated in large cities and high-crime areas.\nHe also supports indexing the minimum wage to inflation, \u201cso that we never have to have this conversation again in the history of America.\u201dAs an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, Carson says: \u201cHere\u2019s my solution.\nEd DunstonIndianapolisRead or Share this story: http://indy.st/1NjGqZr"}
