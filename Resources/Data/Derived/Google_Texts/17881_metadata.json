(Photo: John Sommers II, Getty Images)\n\nWhen I was growing up just across the border from Hammond, Indiana, I never imagined that the fate of the U.S. and its Constitution would one day be in the hands of Indiana voters. Yet, tomorrow a relative handful of Hoosier Republicans can determine the future of the country while millions like me sit and watch what they do.\n\nIndiana matters so much because we have a \u201crepublican\u201d rather than a \u201cdemocratic\u201d Constitution. A democratic constitution views \"We the People\" as a group, so a \u201cdemocratic constitution\u201d is needed to create a government that allows the \u201cwill of the people\u201d to prevail. And the \u201cpeople\u2019s will\u201d must be the desires of the majority, not everyone.\n\nIn contrast, a \u201crepublican\u201d constitution views \"We the People\" as individuals, each of whom has the inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and it is \u201cto secure these rights (that) governments are instituted among men.\u201d Governments, then, are not \u201cus.\u201d Those who work for the government are our servants, not our voice. A republican Constitution is needed to empower our servants to protect our rights without themselves violating them. A republican Constitution, then, provides the law that governs those who govern us.\n\nAfter the American revolution, the Founders soured on the democratic governments in their 13 states, so they replaced the Articles of Confederation with a new \u201crepublican\u201d form of government, which would better secure the individual rights of the people. To prevent our servants from violating our rights, power was divided in various ways so democratic majorities could be blocked from oppressing the rights of the individual.\n\nIn our federal system, each state establishes its own \u201crepublican\u201d government, allowing Americans to move to whichever mix of economic and social policies appeal to them (while the 14th Amendment empowers federal courts to ensure that states do not abuse the rights of their own citizens). When the Democratic and Republican political parties arose in the 19th Century, they too were organized state by state, each with its own rules. To get the nomination of their party, candidates must run a gauntlet of 50 separate states, who select delegates to a national convention that then selects its nominee according to the rules of their party\u2019s convention.\n\nIt\u2019s because of this \u201crepublican\u201d system that Indiana matters so much. A democratic constitution would simply hold a national primary on a single day, and whoever gained a majority of the national vote would be the candidate of the party. The votes of Indiana\u2019s Republicans would be swamped by candidates running up huge totals in states like New York, Texas and California. Further, by staggering the delegate selection decisions in the 50 states over many months, and moving from one state to another, our republican Constitution gives Republican voters time to see how candidates perform under pressure and to winnow the field.\n\nNow it\u2019s Indiana\u2019s turn. Those who vote in the primary tomorrow are not the \u201cvoice of the people.\u201d They don\u2019t speak for me. Rather, they are individual electors offering their input into a complex selection system.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nBut Indiana matters for another reason too. With the death of Justice Antonin Scalia \u2014 and likely retirement of more justices over the next four years \u2014 the future of our republican Constitution now hangs in the balance. The next president will determine whether its original constitutional limits on federal and state power are followed, or are further weakened by deferring to expansions of federal power \u2014 like the five justices did who upheld Obamacare.\n\nOnly one of the remaining top two Republican candidates, Ted Cruz, loves and understands the limits on government power imposed by our Republican Constitution, which he memorized and recited as a teen. So too does Carly Fiorina, whose father was a conservative federal judge. If Indiana supports them, then other states like California will matter too. If Indiana fails to support them, however, then it\u2019s game over, and either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton will appoint justices who will stand aside and let them flout the constitutional limits on their powers.\n\nThanks to what\u2019s left of our republican Constitution, then, Indiana really matters. And tomorrow its voters will decide if the Constitution will continue to matter, too.
