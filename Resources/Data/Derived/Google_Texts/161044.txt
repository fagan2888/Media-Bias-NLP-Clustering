During a 20-batter stretch in Sunday’s victory at Detroit, every hitter for the Houston Astros either reached base or struck out.

Business as usual for the surprising leaders of the AL West.

The Astros beat the Tigers 10-8 in that game, striking out 15 times but also hitting a pair of home runs and rallying from a four-run deficit in the sixth inning. Houston now leads its division by 6 1/2 games and has the second-best record in the American League — but to say the Astros have an unusual offense would be an understatement.

Houston leads the major leagues in home runs, while ranking 29th in batting average. The Astros have struck out more than any other American League team, yet they’re third in the AL in runs.

“I think we actually expected a little bit of that, just given the back of the baseball cards of the guys that we have,” manager A.J. Hinch said during the series in Detroit. “We have a lot of guys that have home runs on their resumes. We’ve got guys that have some strikeouts, maybe some low batting averages. So it’s played out that way — it’s gone a little bit extreme I think.”

No kidding. Evan Gattis hit his ninth homer of the year Sunday, but his three-hit day only raised his average to .201. Luis Valbuena is hitting .199 with 10 homers. Chris Carter is hitting .170 but has gone deep seven times.

This formula is working so far, and it’s quite a stylistic contrast to the one AL team with a better record than Houston: the Kansas City Royals.

Kansas City has hit the second-fewest homers in the AL. That’s not a huge change from last season, but the Royals have improved offensively.

They may not hit many home runs, but they’ve hit plenty of doubles and triples — and the Royals remain the most strikeout-averse offensive team in baseball. Kansas City has scored even more runs than Houston this year, and the Royals lead the AL Central by three games.
