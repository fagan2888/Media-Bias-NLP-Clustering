It also has a division that specifically deals with helping car dealers with management and marketing.\n\nWell, the dealer services segment is going to be a company all by itself. ADP announced that in April.\n\nAbout 100 of the 990 people that work in Augusta\u2019s ADP facility are in this division.\n\nDave Brendza, vice president and general manager at Augusta, said the company is working with the Augusta Economic Development Authority on finding a spot in Richmond County for that division once it becomes it own publicly-traded company. (The name of it hasn\u2019t been picked yet.)\n\nBrendza said the EDA was helpful to ADP locating in Augusta in 2007 and found it temporary quarters while the main campus was being built in west Augusta.\n\nDealer services is about 16 percent of ADP\u2019s quarterly revenue. The company said it expects to gain $700 million from the spinoff, which it will use to buy back some of its owns stock. The new company is supposed to be formed by the end of the year.\n\nHaving two companies allows ADP to concentrate on payroll and HR outsourcing.\n\nWhile 100 people will be leaving the Augusta ADP campus, about 70 more will be looking for desks, Brendza said. That\u2019s going to be from a pilot project concentrating on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThere\u2019s still a little bit of room in Augusta. It has 990 workers, but the building can accommodate 1,250.\n\nBrendza was talking about the personnel moves Thursday during a state High Demand Career Initiative meeting at Georgia Regents University that concentrated on technology jobs. State development officials were in Augusta to \u201clisten\u201d to Augusta tech companies describe what they need for their workforce.\n\nAN EXTRA DOSE OF TWEETS: @Scuttlebiz.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken", "og": {"url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/content/blog-post/tim-rausch/2014-07-10/adp-looking-augusta-home-dealer-services-spinoff-personnel", "type": "article", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "title": "ADP looking for Augusta home for dealer services spinoff personnel"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ecf\"", "article_summary": "While 100 people will be leaving the Augusta ADP campus, about 70 more will be looking for desks, Brendza said.\nState development officials were in Augusta to \u201clisten\u201d to Augusta tech companies describe what they need for their workforce.\nWell, the dealer services segment is going to be a company all by itself.\nAutomatic Data Processing, one of Augusta\u2019s largest private employers, is trying to find a place for about 100 of its employees that will become part of a spinoff company.\nBrendza said the EDA was helpful to ADP locating in Augusta in 2007 and found it temporary quarters while the main campus was being built in west Augusta."}
