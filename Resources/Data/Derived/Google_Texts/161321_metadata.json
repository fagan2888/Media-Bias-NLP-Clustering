The board also allocated roughly $11.1 million from reserves to help pay the deficit. The changes will take effect Jan. 1.\n\nSome board members expressed concern that the increases were coming at a time when state employees have gone years without a pay increase, but also said they had felt they had no other choice considering their financial situation.\n\nSEIB Chief Executive Officer William Ashmore has said the deficit was caused by a combination of rising costs, fewer state employees to pay into the program and fees and benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nActive state employees pay $15 a month for single coverage and $205 for family coverage, including discounts for not using tobacco and participating in a wellness program.\n\nThe changes approved by the board include that:\n\n- Smokers will end up paying an additional $5 per month. Premiums are being raised across-the-board by $5, but the monthly non-smoking discount is being from $45 to $50.\n\n\n\n-- Members will begin to pay for dental coverage. The fee would be $3 a month for single coverage and $8 a month for family coverage. There is no separate premium for dental coverage under the current plan.\n\n-- Members will pay an additional $50 a month to cover spouses who have access to their own employer insurance plans.\n\n-- Surviving spouses will pay $15 more per month for single coverage and $20 more for family coverage.\n\n-- The copay for urgent care will increase from $35 to $100.\n\n-- The emergency room and outpatient surgery copay will increase to $150.\n\n-- The monthly premiums for non-Medicare retirees will increase to $10 a month for single coverage and $20 a month for family coverage.\n\n-- The copay for lab work will drop from $10 to $7.50.\n\nActing Finance Director Bill Newton said the board had three options to address the shortfall -- increasing premiums, cutting benefits or tapping reserves. He said today's action involved all three.\n\nThe plan was approved after a month of debate.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter careful consideration, the board made some tough decisions,\u201d Board Chairman Joe Dickson said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, I am confident that we stayed true to our goal of providing the best health care coverage possible at an affordable rate for our members.\u201d\n\nThe head of a group representing retired state, county, and municipal employees criticized the change and said the board should have taken more from reserves. \u201cWe begged for a life preserver and the SEIB threw us an anchor,\u201d said Liane Kelly, executive director of ARSEA/APEAL.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, state employees, news", "title": "State employees will pay more health insurance in 2014", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"State employees will pay more health insurance in 2014\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/09/state_employees_will_pay_more.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/spotnews/photo/alabama-state-house-toojpg-439390a625fc4967.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11270039\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-19T00:25:54Z\", \"author\": \"Kim Chandler\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"state employees\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/spotnews/photo/alabama-state-house-toojpg-439390a625fc4967.jpg", "creator": "@statehousekim", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "MONTGOMERY, Alabama -- State employees will pay more for health insurance under changes approved today by the State Employees&#8217; Insurance Board to help address a projected $36 million deficit.The board raised some premiums, increased co-pays for urgent care, emergency..."}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, September 23, 2013,  3:38 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.al.com/spotnews/photo/alabama-state-house-toojpg-439390a625fc4967.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"montgomery555\", \"author_nickname\": \"Kim Chandler\", \"author_id\": \"8055569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Retired: Real-Time News from AL.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "MONTGOMERY, Alabama -- State employees will pay more for health insurance under changes approved today by the State Employees&#8217; Insurance Board to help address a projected $36 million deficit.The board raised some premiums, increased co-pays for urgent care, emergency...", "title": "State employees will pay more health insurance in 2014", "url": "http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/09/state_employees_will_pay_more.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/spotnews/photo/alabama-state-house-toojpg-439390a625fc4967.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, September 18, 2013,  7:23 PM", "article_author": "Kim Chandler", "Description": "MONTGOMERY, Alabama -- State employees will pay more for health insurance under changes approved today by the State Employees&#8217; Insurance Board to help address a projected $36 million deficit.
