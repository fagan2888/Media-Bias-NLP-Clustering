Even if you haven't heard of music supervisor Brian Reitzell, it's still very possible that you've heard his work. He's teamed up with Sofia Coppola to score most of her films, including "Lost in Translation" and "The Bling Ring," he recently scored the hit video game "Watch Dogs" and he's responsible for the haunting compositions in NBC's show "Hannibal." The second season is out on Blu-Ray this week.

He recently joined A Martinez in studio to talk about how he became a music supervisor, what it's like scoring a horror show and how the key to good horror music is that "...it should be kind of unfamiliar. So, if your brain isn't saying 'oh it's an electric guitar'... it's like this new experience. And I think the scariest things in life are these things that happen to you that you're not prepared for. You don't know what's going on."

Reitzell also recently released a solo album that's meant to score your drive through Los Angeles. It's called "Auto Music."

After years of putting together random tracks, Reitzell started listening to them in his car, and he realized that they perfectly scored his commute around LA. So, they're now available to the public.
