In the five years since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) became law, many multiemployer health plan sponsors have implemented cost-containment strategies.

A study of multiemployer health plan clients by Segal Consulting revealed the most popular cost-management strategies that plans have implemented are soliciting competitive bids from carriers/vendors (40%), implementing more intensive pharmacy management programs (34%) and increasing copayments (32%). Twenty-seven percent have increased deductibles and 18% have implemented more intensive medical-management programs (e.g., prior authorization and/or disease management).

“The study suggests plan sponsors have additional options and opportunities for managing the high cost of health care beyond increasing participant cost sharing, because relatively few plans have implemented strategies such as including financial incentives tied to wellness, moving to a narrower network or establishing an on-site clinic,” says Andrew Sherman, senior vice president at Segal. “The Supreme Court affirmed with its King v. Burwell decision that the Affordable Care Act is here to stay, which means it is also time for trustees to take a look at how their plans are impacted by the 2018 excise tax.”

A large majority of plans in the study have not changed coverage for spouses, and most plans in the study have maintained coverage for retirees. According to the survey, 77% of multiemployer plan sponsors are not considering changes in an effort to avoid the excise tax on high-cost plans.
