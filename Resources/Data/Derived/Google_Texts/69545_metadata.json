According to her, the answer to \u2018What would Jesus do?\u2019 is \u2018everybody.'\u201d\n\nMaher then turned to Cliven Bundy, the antigovernment Nevada rancher who nearly caused another Branch Davidian incident in a standoff between a well armed militia and federal agents, all because he wouldn\u2019t pay his grazing fees. He turned out to be so racist, even Fox News started to back away.\n\n\u201cSorry, Mr. Bundy, if you\u2019re getting your grass from the government for free, then I should get my grass from the government for free,\u201d Maher, a known marijuana user joked. \u201cAnd, predictably predictably Cliven went off script at a rally and said \u2018I want to tell you one more thing about the Negro.\u2019 And that sentence never ends well. As it didn\u2019t this time when he went on \u2018They abort their children and put their young men in jail because they never learned to pick cotton.\u2019 And that was the end of Open Mic Night at the OK Corral.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When right-wing heroes turnout not to be, what is a neocon to do?
