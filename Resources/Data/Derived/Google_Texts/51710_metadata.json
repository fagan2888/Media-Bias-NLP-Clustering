This sacrifice, however, may come at the expense of caring for those patients, as a cohort of 600 nurses who filled out questionnaires on personal- and work-related data, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, sleep quantity, clinical-decision self-efficacy, and decision regret couldn\u2019t recall whether they had performed their job to the best of their ability.\n\nSleep deprivation actually begins to erode the body\u2019s various processes alarmingly quickly. After only a week of insufficient sleep, the body\u2019s genes begin to activate in different ways, altering the state of a person\u2019s immune system, stress hormone response, and ability to attack inflammation. The natural circadian rhythms we develop \u2014 the sleep patterns that tell us to rise, more or less, with the sun and to sleep when it\u2019s dark out \u2014 become disjointed. As a result, our white blood cell function diminishes, our worsening lethargy turning to sickness.\n\nWe also lose our ability to think, an aspect of the present study that gave researchers alarm because in order to assess patient health, professionals must be capable of catching the subtle fluctuations they\u2019ve been trained to spot \u2014 a spike here, a low cell count there. The briefest of missteps may mean the difference between one treatment route and another.\n\n\u201cRegistered nurses play a pivotal role as members of the healthcare team, but fatigued and sleep deprived critical care nurses put their patients and themselves at serious risk,\u201d lead author and RN, Dr. Linda Scott, said in the study. \u201cProactive intervention is required to ensure that critical care nurses are fit for duty and can make decisions that are critical for patients\u2019 safety.\u201d\n\nThe team suggests a three-pronged approach. First and foremost, nurses must be scheduled according to a strategically designed plan, one that maximizes fatigue management. In other words, it has to minimize the number of sleepy nurses on-duty. Next, hospitals must ensure these nurses aren\u2019t working alone. While a nurse may have worked a long shift, yet claims to feel alert, the sheer number of hours he\u2019s put in necessitates a second set of eyes. And if an otherwise routine shift overwhelms him, researchers argue hospitals should offer strategically planned nap times and relief staff to assist him.\n\n\u201cBy working together to manage fatigue, critical care nurses and employers can ensure patients receive care from alert, vigilant, and safe employees,\u201d Scott said.\n\nNurses comprising the study were largely male and worked shifts in excess of 12 hours, and to the surprise of the researchers, seldom made up the lost sleep during non-working hours. This signaled not only a work/life imbalance, but a larger systemic illness plaguing the specific hospitals. As the authors write, coming to a workable solution regarding nurse fatigue may be in part a simple awareness issue.\n\n\u201cIn addition,\u201d they concluded, \u201ceducation on how to manage fatigue and incorporation of fatigue countermeasures should be routine practices in healthcare organizations.\u201d\n\nSource: Scott L, Arslanian-Engoren C, Engoren M.
