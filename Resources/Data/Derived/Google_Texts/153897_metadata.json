It will gut millions of jobs for minorities; increase energy costs for fixed-income seniors (possibly pushing them into poverty), and places a disproportionate amount of the burden on red states. In fact, most Americans agree that their electrical bills will go up, West Virginia is bracing for a 20 percent surge in their prices. So, it should come to no one\u2019s surprise that over half the states are suing the Obama administration over their environmental agenda. States have until September 6, 2016 to submit their blueprints that will accommodate CPP\u2019s goals. Failure to do so results in the imposition of a federal plan that could be replaced if the state in question submits an appropriate strategy for cutting their emissions:\n\nMore than half the states are suing the Obama administration over the centerpiece of President Obama's climate change agenda, with the number of business trade associations and other groups joining the states rising daily. Twenty-six states' attorneys general and utility regulators, as of Monday, are suing the administration, with 15 trade groups, labor unions and a host of individual utilities and companies. Oklahoma and North Dakota are the latest states to file lawsuits after a 24-state coalition on Friday sued the Environmental Protection Agency over its Clean Power Plan, which seeks to cut greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. The rules were published in the Federal Register on Friday, making them challengeable in federal appeals court.\n\nThis is also a bipartisan effort. Coal is still one of the main sources for U.S. energy, and this plan would gut the construction of future coal plants. Moreover, it\u2019s going to force the closures of current power plants, which will spike electrical costs. In Texas, they\u2019re projected to see a 16 percent increase in energy costs by 2030. Twenty-five coal power plants are set to close in Michigan by 2020, where 50 percent of its power is derived from coal.\n\nGreen warriors have long said that market forces were killing off coal, which isn\u2019t true. The industry has adapted and restructured. Why? Because the country still needs coal, in which we have enough to power the country for centuries, hence why many describe the U.S. as the Saudi Arabia of coal. It should also be noted that while we\u2019re at the most industrialized we\u2019ve ever been, our air quality has never been better, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Growing discontent.05/26/2016 19:59:39PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Growing discontent", "title": "Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan Is So Good That Over Half The States Oppose It", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/10/27/obamas-clean-power-plan-is-so-good-that-over-half-the-states-oppose-it-n2071910", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/215/859b7e66-52f4-4261-acb3-3647de30ddfd.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Growing discontent", "title": "Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan Is So Good That Over Half The States Oppose It", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/10/27/obamas-clean-power-plan-is-so-good-that-over-half-the-states-oppose-it-n2071910", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/215/859b7e66-52f4-4261-acb3-3647de30ddfd.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan Is So Good That Over Half The States Oppose It  , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "So, we all know that Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan aims to cut greenhouse gas emission by 32 percent from 2005 level by 2030.\nTwenty-five coal power plants are set to close in Michigan by 2020, where 50 percent of its power is derived from coal.\nMoreover, it\u2019s going to force the closures of current power plants, which will spike electrical costs.\nIn Texas, they\u2019re projected to see a 16 percent increase in energy costs by 2030.\nCoal is still one of the main sources for U.S. energy, and this plan would gut the construction of future coal plants."}
