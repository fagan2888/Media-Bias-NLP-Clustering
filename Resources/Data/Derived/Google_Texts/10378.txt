PAL hosts first all girl slumber party - Women with the Police Athletic League hosted its first all girl slumber party, designed to help local girls bond with female police officers.

The All Girl Overnight Slumber Party started at 6 p.m. Friday and ends 9 a.m. Saturday.

The party brought together 200 girls in grades 5th through 8th together with female law enforcement officers. Lt. Lakesha Burton with JSO said PAL's goal is for women officers to encourage the young girls to love who they are and fulfill their dreams.

"Tonight is about uniqueness, because we know that 99.9 percent of all of us have the same DNA," Burton said. "0.1 percent that's unique. So we're just going to tap into that and get these young girls to know what's unique about them."

PAL said young girls are becoming increasingly involved in criminal activities. The event was designed to help girls appreciate their differences and tackle life's challenges.
