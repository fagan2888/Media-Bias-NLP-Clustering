French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande didn\u2019t hesitate to term the attacks an act of war, and he\u2019s sadly right: The terrorists\u2019 war we\u2019re accustomed to watching on television is out our windows now.\n\nLast week The New York Times published a distressing account of life in northeast Syria, where everyone\u2019s vulnerable all the time. As of Friday, aren\u2019t the vulnerabilities of those dwelling in the seats of Western power\u2014Paris, Washington, New York, London\u2014merely a matter of degree?\n\n\u201cWhat you are doing in Syria, you are going to pay for it now,\u201d witnesses quoted one terrorist gunman as shouting as he opened fire on Parisian concertgoers. While I\u2019ve long found excessive fear mongering destructive, Americans, especially, need to think hard about this.\n\n\n\nRelated: Terror Attacks in Paris Kill 129, Leaving France in Shock\n\nLet\u2019s assume the Friday assault was in retaliation for French bombing sorties over Syria, which the Hollande government began on September 27, three days before Russia began its air campaign. Where does this land the U.S., which has been bombing in Syria for nearly 18 months, on the Islamic State\u2019s list of targets?\n\nThere\u2019s a legal dimension to Hollande\u2019s \u201cact of war\u201d that couldn\u2019t be clearer-cut on the face of it. The NATO treaty stipulates that an attack on one member is an attack on all. The implication here is plain: There are grounds now for the war against ISIS to escalate dramatically. And maybe it should. Post-Paris, let\u2019s get this done.\n\nIt\u2019s almost perverse to say so amid all the tragedy and sadness, but the weekend brought positive news from Vienna, where Secretary of State Kerry and foreign ministers from more than a dozen other nations held their second round of talks aimed at a settlement in Syria. Those in attendance left no doubt that their negotiations, which began with a moment\u2019s silence in honor of Friday\u2019s victims in Paris, now assume a new sense of urgency.\n\nRelated: Paris Attacks May Reshape U.S. Presidential Race\n\n\u201cWe all recognize the urgency of the moment,\u201d Kerry announced after intensive talks Saturday. Those in attendance do not agree on all the issues when it comes to Syria, he added, \u201cbut we do agree on this: It is time for the bleeding in Syria to stop. It is time to deprive the terrorists of any single kilometer in which to hide. It is time that we come together to help the Syrian people embark on the difficult but extraordinarily high imperative of rebuilding their country.\u201d\n\nThat seems to have captured the session\u2019s mood, and there are two important implications here. One, a united front against the Islamic State, urged by some and rejected by others, may now be possible.\n\nTwo, to say the Paris tragedy added purpose and urgency to the talks is to acknowledge that all parties to Syria\u2019s many-sided war share responsibility for terror\u2019s spread to Western capitals. This recognition opens the way to the kind of partnerships and holistic thinking necessary to forge a durable solution. Neither has so far proven possible.\n\nThe first Vienna session, two weekends ago, delivered a very broad-brush outline of a settlement: an internationally enforced ceasefire, a U.N.-supervised constitutional revision intended to accommodate Syria\u2019s divisive ethnic and religious differences, and nationwide elections, also U.N.-organized and closely monitored by international powers.\n\nRelated: Paris Attacks Will Put More Pressure on Canada Over IS Mission\n\nThis weekend\u2019s gathering went much further and set a far faster pace:\n\n\u2022 All nations with influence among combatants are to contribute to enforcing a nationwide ceasefire.\n\n\u2022 Jordan, a frontline state, is to head a working group that will determine which opposition formations fighting the Assad government can participate in talks intended to produce an interim, unity government and which will be excluded as terrorist organizations.\n\n\u2022 Agreeing to find \u201cas rapid a path as possible,\u201d the ministers propose to begin formal negotiations between the Assad government in Damascus and its opposition\u2014political and armed\u2014by January 1.\n\n\u2022 U.N.-sponsored elections, which are to include the vast population of Syrians now in exile, will be held within 18 months\u2014as things now stand, by June 2017.\n\nRelated: After Paris, Republicans Hit Refugee Plan and Clinton Stance\n\nYes, there\u2019s not yet agreement on numerous outstanding questions. Chief among these, as is well known, is the fate of President Assad: Does he stay until Syrians can choose their future leaders (the Russian position) or go as an impediment to a settlement (the U.S. demand).\n\nAdditionally, Kerry and others acknowledged that the schedule set this weekend is \u201cpushing it,\u201d as Kerry put it.\n\nBut these issues appear at least marginally more negotiable than they did even a week ago. \u201cIt was further momentum,\u201d Staffan de Mistura, the U.N. envoy who is to oversee unity talks, said of Saturday\u2019s session.\n\nIf the tragedy in Paris stiffened spines in Vienna, good. But there\u2019s one other connection between the savagery in France and the talks in Austria, which are scheduled to reconvene in a month: The French must build all the memorials they want around their capital, but the best would be to defeat the Islamic State decisively and end the war in Syria.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Buried in all the moving, hard-to-fathom accounts of", "title": "In a Single Weekend, Tragedy in Paris, a Sign of Hope in Vienna", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/11/16/Single-Weekend-Tragedy-Paris-Sign-Hope-Vienna", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/paris_attacks_5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/11/16/Single-Weekend-Tragedy-Paris-Sign-Hope-Vienna", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/paris_attacks_5.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Buried in all the moving, hard-to-fathom accounts of", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Paris Attacks May Reshape U.S. Presidential Race\u201cWe all recognize the urgency of the moment,\u201d Kerry announced after intensive talks Saturday.\nIf the tragedy in Paris stiffened spines in Vienna, good.\nTwo, to say the Paris tragedy added purpose and urgency to the talks is to acknowledge that all parties to Syria\u2019s many-sided war share responsibility for terror\u2019s spread to Western capitals.\nBuried in all the moving, hard-to-fathom accounts of the savage assaults in Paris Friday are a few home truths.\nRelated: Paris Attacks Will Put More Pressure on Canada Over IS MissionThis weekend\u2019s gathering went much further and set a far faster pace:\u2022 All nations with influence among combatants are to contribute to enforcing a nationwide ceasefire."}
