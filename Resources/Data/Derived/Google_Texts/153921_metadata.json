His economic populism is bringing in millions in contributions that will carry him into next year\u2019s opening caucuses and primaries. In short, Bernie has been campaigning in a way that has served him well for years\u2014as a blunt retail politician whose calls for economic fairness and a people-centered uprising have endeared him to working people across the political spectrum.\n\nThere are many surprising facets to Sanders\u2019 appeal that are not widely known outside of Vermont that account for his campaign\u2019s better-than-expected opening and likely staying power. But while some longtime Vermont Sanders watchers are not surprised by his success\u2014they know his emphatic, intense, almost-explosive demeanor and his reputation as a resilient campaigner, they\u2019re also acutely aware of the challenges he faces as the race transitions from its heady start-up phase to a very competitive contest.\n\n\u201cI think Bernie can do well,\u201d said Eric Davis, Middlebury College political science professor specializing in Vermont politics. \u201cI told someone, half-jokingly, if the presidential election were held in Vermont, Massachusetts, northern California and New York City, Bernie could win. But there are 46 other states that vote too\u2026 That\u2019s Bernie\u2019s challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of Bernie\u2019s appeal is his unvarnished language and his willingness to just come across as a straight shooter taking on the big guys,\u201d said David Moats, the Rutland Herald\u2019s editorial writer, who won a 2001 Pulitzer Prize for backing civil unions for same-sex couples. \u201cIf pickup-driving guys in the South heard that language recalibrated a bit, they might respond\u2026 It is anti-big guy rhetoric that rural people can respond to.\u201d\n\nSanders has created a career of championing people and causes that confound political boundaries. In 1972, he started running for state office as a candidate for the fringe Liberty Union Party. He railed against big business much like he does today, but never got more than a small protest vote. That changed in 1981 when he became mayor of Burlington, the state\u2019s largest city and home to many colleges and universities, winning by a mere 10 votes.\n\nDuring his four terms as mayor, he became the politician that he is today\u2014taking on entrenched interests and helping to elect others to the city council to support his reforms. He ran for governor and the House as mayor, but lost. He was elected to the House in 1990, in the same election that a conservative Republican became governor in a fiscal crisis. That voters wanted a businessman at home while sending a socialist populist to Congress is consistent with Vermont\u2019s self-reliant, anti-establishment political character.\n\nSanders has drawn on these twin themes for years to craft a populist message that is attractive across party lines. Today, he hits these notes when calling for expanding Social Security\u2014emphasizing that this is what decent people need to live independently, while slamming GOP opponents who don\u2019t want wealthy people paying more fairly into the system.\n\nDuring his successful House run in 1990, Sanders won the support of Vermont\u2019s rural Republicans, whose family roots can go back centuries. One reason was he opposed gun control, which Vermont Democrats still do. Another is Vermonters knew where he was coming from. But mostly, like today, he was an economic populist who understood and championed the plight of cash-poor people.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons he won that 1990 race was among lower-income rural Vermonters\u2026 Bernie was seen as speaking more effectively to the concerns of rural people that the traditional Vermont Republican [incumbent Rep. Peter] Smith,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThe rural Republicans who looked at a candidate before their political party have mostly \u201cpassed out of the electorate,\u201d Davis said, saying that era is over. What has not changed in Vermont, however, but worsened like the rest of the country, are its economic divides. As Sanders has long noted, \u201cthe rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn past ten to 15 years in Vermont, there\u2019s been a real disconnect between the more prosperous parts of the state and the more struggling parts,\u201d Davis said. \u201cA lot of low-income people see Bernie as speaking to issues that concern them and standing up for their interest in ways that others have not.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, he\u2019s always made a point of championing the interests of veterans,\u201d Moats said, identifying another slice of his base and oratory. \u201cThat always has a kind of working class appeal, because a lot of people in the armed services are working-class people\u2026 He\u2019s also protected himself by not being anti-gun, which most Vermont politicians do.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 electoral success in Vermont also has been because he has not held true levers of power affecting people\u2019s lives, apart from being Burlington mayor in the 1980s. Indeed, many Vermont voters were happy to sent him to Congress\u2014instead of the state capital\u2014where his outspokenness is seen as more appropriate.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Moats said. \u201cIn Washington, he can go down there and raise hell and that\u2019s fine. As governor in Montpelier, I\u2019m not sure they\u2019 would have taken so well to that.\u201d\n\nBernie Then and Now\n\nThe factors that have made Bernie attractive to Vermonters\u2014only one-third of the state is urban or suburban\u2014will translate in Iowa, where presidential caucus goers typically vote for people who are outside the party mainstream, and New Hampshire, where mavericks have done well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Vermont senator is riding a wave of popularity, but key challenges await after Iowa and New Hampshire", "title": "Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t going away: What his surprising poll numbers really mean", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Vermont senator is riding a wave of popularity, but key challenges await after Iowa and New Hampshire", "title": "Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t going away: What his surprising poll numbers really mean", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/12/bernie_sanders_isnt_going_away_what_his_surprising_poll_numbers_really_mean_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/bernie_sanders7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Vermont senator is riding a wave of popularity, but key challenges await after Iowa and New Hampshire", "title": "Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t going away: What his surprising poll numbers really mean", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/bernie_sanders7.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steven Rosenfeld", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Middlebury College, pulitzer prize", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Middlebury College, pulitzer prize, Politics NewsHow long will the Bernie bubble last?\nRight now, Bernie Sanders is drawing bigger crowds than any other presidential candidate.\n\u201cI think Bernie can do well,\u201d said Eric Davis, Middlebury College political science professor specializing in Vermont politics.\n\u201cI told someone, half-jokingly, if the presidential election were held in Vermont, Massachusetts, northern California and New York City, Bernie could win.\nSanders has drawn on these twin themes for years to craft a populist message that is attractive across party lines."}
