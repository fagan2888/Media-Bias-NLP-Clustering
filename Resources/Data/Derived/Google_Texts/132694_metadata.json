This poses a big problem for companies that operate globally.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, Butters also noted there was little concern over Greece.\n\n\"It is interesting to note that only one company (Walgreens Boots Alliance) in the index has commented on the crisis in Greece during an earnings call to date,\" he said.\n\nThe lack of interest does make sense; very little trade flows to Greece from the US, and companies have been uninterested in Greece for weeks.\n\nThe improving labor market leading to higher wage costs was the second-highest concern. No international issue cracked the top five.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Bob Bryan", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "The strong dollar keeps S&P 500 companies up at night.
