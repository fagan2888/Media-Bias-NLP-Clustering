There is a steady, if not mounting, tension in our nation between the haves and have nots. You sense it in the ongoing tussle over the Affordable Care Act. You hear it in the vociferous minimum-wage debates that crop up every few years.\n\nI feel it every time I ask my billionaire buddies for a few bucks.\n\nMoreover, the Occupy movement \u2014 the global protests against social and economic inequality that hit Wall Street in the fall of 2011 \u2014 hints at the \u201crising tide of hatred of the successful one percent,\u201d as Perkins pointed out in his letter.\n\nYes, there\u2019s something afoot. Call it class warfare, if you will \u2014 a demonization of the rich by the poor and, at times, of the poor by the rich. Coded language \u2014 \u201cwelfare queen,\u201d for instance \u2014 has been polluting political discourse in this country for years.\n\nBut no matter how you size up the Rich Man, Poor Man strife, the class conflict pales in comparison to the Holocaust.\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous \u2014 not to mention downright offensive to Holocaust survivors \u2014 to even try to link the two.\n\n\u201cWe have Holocaust survivors alive today who went through horrible experiences \u2014 enslaved labor, torture, losing some or all of their family,\u201d said Roberta Clark, regional community director for the North Texas and Oklahoma office of the Anti-Defamation League.\n\n\u201cWe believe the persecution of Jews should never be trivialized. These sorts of analogies are of great concern to us.\u201d\n\nAs well they should be.\n\nDr. Sara Abosch, senior director of education for the Dallas Holocaust Museum Center for Education and Tolerance, said such sensational analogies reflect a shallow understanding of history and human suffering.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a cheapening of language, it\u2019s a cheapening of culture,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means we really don\u2019t understand our own society \u2026 if we can make these comparisons.\u201d\n\nAbosch said she was just as taken aback when she heard people likening gun-control laws under the current White House administration \u201cto Nazi-era attempts to deprive Jews of guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no historical context for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just fallacious.\u201d\n\nThe Holocaust may catch the worst of it. Even abortions have been compared to the mass slaughter of Jews; there\u2019s a documentary film advancing the analogy.\n\nBut slavery, that other unspeakable system of brutality, is often invoked for dramatic effect, too.\n\nWho can forget Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, proclaiming back in October that the Affordable Care Act is \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery\u201d?\n\nUnless I\u2019ve missed it, Carson has yet to back down from that remark, unlike Perkins, who fell on his sword for comparing a disdain for the rich to the destruction of Jewish lives and property.\n\nSuch hyperbole, like broken glass, is strewn everywhere, diminishing the unspeakable damage caused by slavery and the Holocaust.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s offensive and shows a lack of depth of knowledge,\u201d said Abosch. \u201cI\u2019m a staunch conservative, but I\u2019m also an academic and an intellectual. \u2026 And you have to consider the consequence of what you say as much as the consequences of what you do.\n\n\u201cWords have consequences. Words matter.\u201d\n\nJames Ragland writes on race and culture, education, social services and public health.
