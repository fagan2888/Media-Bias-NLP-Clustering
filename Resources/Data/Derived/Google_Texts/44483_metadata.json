The school is also changing its pedagogical style.\n\nGone are the days when a professor stood at the front of a cavernous classroom, ticking through slides as students robotically annotated PowerPoint printouts. Students are now expected to memorize facts on their own time and come to class ready to think on their feet and work in groups, rather than listen to a lecture.\n\nHarvard\u2019s updated curriculum is designed for the smartphone generation of students, who take for granted the ability to find information quickly and are less apt to read dense textbooks, professors say.\n\n\u201cMy job, in the time that we\u2019re together, student and teacher, is to teach you what you can\u2019t Google,\u201d said Richard M. Schwartzstein, a Harvard professor who helped develop the new curriculum.\n\nThe steps are similar to those taken by several other top medical schools, including Vanderbilt University, the University of Oregon, and New York University, and are underway at many others, including Georgetown and Drexel universities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe curriculum now features more videos created by professors to help students learn, and classroom time is for problem-solving in groups, interviewing patients, and thinking through complex situations that might arise in the ward.\n\nSchwartzstein developed his own YouTube videos to describe biological processes students need to learn, which they are expected to watch outside the classroom. The videos are between five and eight minutes, he said, because students\u2019 attention spans don\u2019t last much longer.\n\n\u201cWe are getting a sense from some students, anyway, that they don\u2019t like to read, they prefer videos,\u201d said Schwartzstein, who is also vice president for education at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a teaching hospital for Harvard Medical School.\n\nThe batch of first-year students who started on Harvard Medical\u2019s Longwood campus this fall are the first to experience the changes.\n\nToday, when first-year students such as Kirstin Scott arrive in class, they gather in smaller rooms, split into groups, and solve problems that require them to connect subjects and ideas across disciplines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely different from anything I\u2019ve gone through,\u201d said Scott, who, with a doctorate in health policy, has lots of classroom experience.\n\nThe new \u201cflipped classroom\u201d format puts the onus on students to come prepared, but also on professors to run less-scripted classrooms. Teachers must use their time not to spout facts, but to prompt students to reason through problems and scenarios.\n\n\u2018My job, in the time that we\u2019re together, student and teacher, is to teach you what you can\u2019t Google.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK not to know; it\u2019s not OK not to think,\u201d Schwartzstein tells his students.\n\nThe new curriculum does not apply to returning students, like fourth-year Gregory Leya, who will complete his studies in the traditional format. Leya, who is working toward joint MD and MBA degrees, described traditional classes during his first two years as \u201csiloed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lecture style didn\u2019t always work best for all of the students,\u201d he said.\n\nInevitably, by the end of the year, students discovered how to watch videos of the lecture on fast forward at home, and attendance dwindled. Leya thinks the changes will be good.\n\nStudents say YouTube videos are irreplaceable for demonstrating skills like how to tie a surgical knot or draw the brachial plexus, a network of nerves stemming from the spine.\n\nIn addition to pedagogical changes, students will start practical work much sooner. Every Wednesday, even in the first year, will give students hands-on time with patients, and in the second year \u2014 after 14 months of classwork \u2014 students will launch into clinical rotations, where they try many specialty fields, such as pediatrics or anesthesiology. In the past, students only began working with patients in the third year.\n\nWith a year of hospital experience under their belts, students will return to the classroom for the third year, where professors believe the more advanced classes will prove more valuable after students understand the practicalities of being a doctor.\n\nThe changes at medical schools were inspired by a 2010 book by a group of doctors and academics that made waves in the medical school community when it called for a new way to train doctors. At many schools, curriculums had changed little over the past century.\n\nThe book \u201cEducating Physicians: A Call for Reform of Medical School and Residency,\u201d by Molly Cooke, David Irby, and Bridget O\u2019Brien, was an update of the Flexner Report, which was published 100 years earlier and radically changed how medicine was taught.\n\nOne thing is sure \u2014 the changes have not made Harvard a less-demanding medical school. If anything, it\u2019s the opposite, Scott said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic that this is a really effective way to grapple with and struggle through very complex material,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.377148858", "eomportal-id": 130109, "description": "The changes, which began for first-year students this academic year, don\u2019t alter the content of the classes so much as their order and they transform how professors use time with students in the classroom.", "eomportal-instanceid": 17, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "The changes, which began for first-year students this academic year, don\u2019t alter the content of the classes so much as their order and they transform how professors use time with students in the classroom.", "title": "Harvard Medical School revamps curriculum - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/09/19/harvard-medical-school-revamps-curriculum/CAwgolcZZKAMBsQiwBBfEL/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/09/19/BostonGlobe.com/Metro/Images/ryan_busts2_met.jpg", "longitude": "-71.05888010000001", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3600825", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Harvard Medical School,curriculum,Richard M.
