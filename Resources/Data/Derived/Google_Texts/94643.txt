Higher income families who use CHIP medical benefits for their kids no longer face penalties for having coverage that doesn't meet federal minimum essential benefits requirements.

In averting the penalties, the state has also improved CHIP benefits for all 148,000 children using CHIP, the state-run program to provide health benefits for children, Gov. Tom Wolf said Thursday.

The state recently tweaked CHIP by adjusting limits and co-pays on things such as preventive care, dental and orthodontic care, and eyeglasses.

Prior to that, CHIP fell short of minimum benefits requirements of the Affordable Care Act, and some Pennsylvania families faced penalties for having coverage that failed to meet essential benefits requirements.

The penalties would have applied to about 3,600 families with higher incomes who pay the full cost of CHIP coverage, which covers children up to 18.

The changes to CHIP take effect Dec. 1. However, the state has obtained federal waivers and extensions so that the families won't be penalized for having the non-compliant coverage before Dec. 1.

Wolf announced Thursday the improved benefits will extend to all children covered by CHIP.

Most of the 148,000 Pennsylvania children covered by CHIP come from families who qualify for state-subsidized coverage. For example, families earning up to $50,440 for a family of four pay nothing, and families with higher incomes pay from $49 to $77 per child. Families with incomes of more than $76,145 for a family of four can buy into CHIP at the state's cost, which is about $214 per child.
