The committee plans to revisit the recommendation in 2018.\n\nThe 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to cover vaccines recommended by ACIP without asking patients to pay a share. With $3.97 billion in sales last year, the inoculation is New York-based Pfizer\u2019s second-best selling product.\n\nThe advisory panel considered a clinical trial Pfizer conducted on 85,000 patients who received either the company\u2019s vaccine or a placebo. Among those who got Prevnar 13, there were 46 percent fewer first episodes of community-acquired pneumonia than among the placebo group.\n\nPeople 65 and older who haven\u2019t received Pneumovax 23 would get a dose of Prevnar 13, followed by Pneumovax 23. Those who have been immunized with Pneumovax 23 would get a shot of Prevnar 13.\n\nMedicare, the U.S. health program for the elderly and disabled, would immediately cover Prevnar 13. However, it may take more than a year for the program to determine whether to pay for a following dose of Pneumovax 23 in patients who had never been immunized, the panel said.\n\nExpanded Use\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration first approved Prevnar 13 for use in children in 2010, then added adults age 50 and older in 2011. It is already recommended for routine use in children younger than age 5 and people with compromised immune systems caused by conditions such as cancer, AIDS and advanced kidney disease. Merck\u2019s related vaccine, Pneumovax 23, was approved more than 30 years ago.\n\nBoth therapies are approved to prevent infections from pneumococcus bacteria that can cause pneumonia, meningitis and blood and ear infections, according to the CDC. About 900,000 Americans get pneumococcal pneumonia each year and as many as 7 percent die, the CDC said. About 90 percent of cases are adults.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Anna Edney", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-14/u-s-panel-says-seniors-should-get-pfizer-s-prevnar-13", "title": "U.S. Panel Says Seniors Should Get Pfizer\u2019s Prevnar 13", "description": "Pfizer Inc. won the backing of a key U.S. advisory panel to recommend its vaccine Prevnar 13 for people ages 65 and older to help prevent infections including pneumonia and meningitis.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Anna Edney", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Pfizer Inc,Markets", "news_keywords": "Pfizer Inc,Markets", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-14/u-s-panel-says-seniors-should-get-pfizer-s-prevnar-13", "parsely-title": "U.S. Panel Says Seniors Should Get Pfizer\u2019s Prevnar 13", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-08-14T04:01:00.009Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Pfizer Inc. won the backing of a key U.S. advisory panel to recommend its vaccine Prevnar 13 for people ages 65 and older to help prevent infections including pneumonia and meningitis.", "parsely-tags": "Pfizer Inc,Markets,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-08-14T04:01:00.009Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-14/u-s-panel-says-seniors-should-get-pfizer-s-prevnar-13", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Pfizer Inc. won the backing of a key U.S. advisory panel to recommend its vaccine Prevnar 13 for people ages 65 and older to help prevent infections including pneumonia and meningitis.", "title": "U.S. Panel Says Seniors Should Get Pfizer\u2019s Prevnar 13"}, "fb": {"status": "Pfizer Inc. won the backing of a key U.S. advisory panel to recommend its vaccine Prevnar 13 for people ages 65 and older to help prevent infections including pneumonia and meningitis."}, "parsely-post-id": "NA92H66JIJUP01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "People 65 and older who haven\u2019t received Pneumovax 23 would get a dose of Prevnar 13, followed by Pneumovax 23.\nMedicare, the U.S. health program for the elderly and disabled, would immediately cover Prevnar 13.\nThose who have been immunized with Pneumovax 23 would get a shot of Prevnar 13.\nAmong those who got Prevnar 13, there were 46 percent fewer first episodes of community-acquired pneumonia than among the placebo group.\nPfizer Inc. won the backing of a key U.S. advisory panel to recommend its vaccine Prevnar 13 for people ages 65 and older to help prevent infections including pneumonia and meningitis."}
