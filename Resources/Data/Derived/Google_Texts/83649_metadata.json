Many illegal immigrants make such a low salary, that they will not pay income taxes. Rather, many these individuals will start collecting government checks, in the form of \u201cEarned Income Tax Credits\u201d (EITC), and could be eligible for other transfer payments such as ObamaCare.\n\nAlthough tracking the incomes of illegal immigrants is no easy task, the Century Foundation released a study which found that \u201cwe can be virtually certain that illegal immigrants earned less than $24,000 per year, on average, probably much less.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) released a report with similar findings \u2014 according to that study, almost 50 percent of illegal immigrant families live in or near poverty.\n\nAmerican workers who make under $30,000 per year pay very little in federal taxes. In fact, they are eligible to collect anywhere from $9,000 to $15,000 per year in EITC payments, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nTheoretically speaking, if all 5 million of Obama\u2019s newly legalized migrants made such a low income, American taxpayers could be on the hook for up to $5 billion per year in EITC payments alone.\n\nBut Obama would have Americans believe that his amnesty will do just the opposite. During his Thursday night announcement, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to pay your fair share of taxes, you\u2019ll be able to apply to stay in this country.\u201d\n\nAccording to a recent report by Forbes, many of the immigrants that Obama\u2019s action targets are likely of an older age since they are parents of U.S. citizens. \u201cIf so, they will gain access not only to Obamacare, but also to Social Security and especially Medicare,\u201d Forbes columnist Avik Roy wrote.\n\nAt this time it is unclear whether or not legalized migrants will receive ObamaCare benefits \u2014 or how their medical needs will be met at all. Assuming that many of the newly legalized make little income, however, the burden of such healthcare costs is likely to fall on taxpayers in some form.\n\nFollow Kristin Tate on Twitter @KristinBTate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Great Burden of Obama's Amnesty on US Taxpayers", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The Great Burden of Obama's Amnesty on US Taxpayers", "title": "The Great Burden of Obama's Amnesty on US Taxpayers - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/11/21/money_reuters.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2014/11/21/the-great-burden-of-obamas-amnesty-on-us-taxpayers/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Great Burden of Obama's Amnesty on US Taxpayers", "title": "The Great Burden of Obama's Amnesty on US Taxpayers - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/11/21/money_reuters.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Illegal Aliens, Illegal Immigrants,Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "tag": "Illegal Immigrants", "published_time": "2014-11-21T10:51:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Many illegal immigrants make such a low salary, that they will not pay income taxes.\nAssuming that many of the newly legalized make little income, however, the burden of such healthcare costs is likely to fall on taxpayers in some form.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPresident Obama\u2019s unilateral action on immigration, which is expected to give legal status to some 5 million illegal aliens, will likely be a significant burden to American taxpayers.\nTheoretically speaking, if all 5 million of Obama\u2019s newly legalized migrants made such a low income, American taxpayers could be on the hook for up to $5 billion per year in EITC payments alone.\nBut Obama would have Americans believe that his amnesty will do just the opposite."}
