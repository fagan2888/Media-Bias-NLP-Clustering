The New York Times offers some fact checks, Mother Jones highlights some key moments, and some ridiculous ones. John Nichols writes at The Nation: \u201cThe 11th Republican presidential \u2018debate\u2019 was not a debate. It was \u2018The Donald Trump Show,\u2019 with also-ran candidates and Fox News personalities playing bit parts. It was a long, drab waste of time that did nothing to weaken Trump.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s back \u2013> Yesterday morning, Mitt Romney took center stage to denounce Donald Trump. But commentators were quick to note that Romney once sought the same voters whose anger, resentment and feelings of marginalization Trump now harnesses. The New York Times editorial board wrote that Trump\u2019s \u201cforced a Republican Party reckoning overdue for years, all in a few days. It took the Trump-dominated Super Tuesday contests to awaken Republican leaders to the fact that the darkest elements of the party\u2019s base, which many of them have embraced or exploited, are now threatening their party.\u201d\n\nAND: There\u2019s a way that Romney could actually become the nominee this year through a contested convention. Andrew Prokop explains for Vox.\n\nPretty boring \u2013> Trump unveiled his healthcare plan yesterday. Despite his big talk, his plan is to repeal Obamacare and replace it with \u201cpretty standard, if vague, Republican proposals,\u201d reports Noam N. Levey for the LA Times. \u201cNotably missing from Trump\u2019s plan \u2014 titled \u2018Healthcare Reform to Make America Great Again\u2019 \u2014 are promises that \u2018everybody\u2019s got to be covered,\u2019 or that he would \u2018not allow people to die on the sidewalks,\u2019 as he claimed earlier.\u201d\n\nObamacare announces 20 million insured \u2013> Jonathan Chait at New York magazine: \u201cIn addition to surprisingly and historically low rates of health-care cost inflation, today the Department of Health & Human Services announces that a net 20 million people have now gained access to health insurance. The uninsured rate among non-elderly Americans has fallen nearly in half just two years into the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe book club where no one reads the books \u2013> Robert Schmidt at Bloomberg reports on a unique DC \u201cbook club\u201d: \u201cThe private event, which is run by the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, is a little-known fundraising vehicle where lobbyists for Wall Street banks, insurance companies and accounting firms gather monthly to discuss literature with a Republican panel member. The designated lawmaker picks the book and pulls in the day\u2019s haul, which attendees estimate is often in the $60,000 to $80,000 range.\u201d\n\nTragic murder \u2013> Jonathan Watts at The Guardian. \u201cBerta C\u00e1ceres, the Honduran indigenous and environmental rights campaigner, has been murdered, barely a week after she was threatened for opposing a hydroelectric project. Her death prompted international outrage at the murderous treatment of campaigners in Honduras, as well as a flood of tributes to a prominent and courageous defender of the natural world.\u201d C\u00e1ceres was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize last year. Democracy Now! points out that Honduras \u201chas become the deadliest country in the world for environmentalists. Between 2010 and 2014, 101 environmental campaigners were killed in the country.\u201d\n\nTaking a spin through the revolving door \u2013> \u201cAs it moves ahead with its $130 billion merger with fellow chemical giant Dow, DuPont has made quite a hire. To lead the company\u2019s \u2018public policy and government affairs strategies,\u2019 DuPont has tapped Krysta Harden, who just ended a six-plus-year stint at the US Department of Agriculture, where she served as chief of staff to Secretary Tom Vilsack and, most recently, as deputy secretary, the department\u2019s No. 2 position.\u201d Tom Philpott reports for Mother Jones.\n\nRaking it in \u2013> \u201cFossil fuel millionaires collectively pumped more than $100m into Republican presidential contenders\u2019 efforts last year \u2013 in an unprecedented investment by the oil and gas industry in the party\u2019s future. About one in three dollars donated to Republican hopefuls from mega-rich individuals came from people who owe their fortunes to fossil fuels \u2013 and who stand to lose the most in the fight against climate change.\u201d Ted Cruz is the largest beneficiary, report Suzanne Goldenberg and Helena Bengtsson for The Guardian.\n\nWin some, lose some \u2013> In contrast to the recent Supreme Court action putting the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan on hold, \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court denied a request Thursday to block the EPA\u2019s mercury-emissions rule while legal challenges proceed, handing a temporary victory to the the Obama administration and environmental groups.\u201d Matt Ford reports for The Atlantic.\n\nWho will be in charge of all the people? \u2013> Cartoonist Edward Steed designed some campaign posters to help you decide.\n\nMorning Reads was written by John Light and edited by Theresa Riley.
