DAVID BAUMAN, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article \u00bb\n\nThis is the third year for a health fair in Riverside providing free dental care and medical and vision checkups, and the first held since people began signing up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAlthough thousands of Inland residents may have new health insurance under Obamacare, health fair organizer Gilberto Esquivel said he still expects to see long lines of people at Saturday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event at the C\u00c3\u00a9sar Ch\u00c3\u00a1vez Community Center, 2060 University Ave.\n\nThe event will run from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., with registration beginning at 7 a.m. Services are first-come, first-served.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt this point, the number of people actually enrolled (under the Affordable Care Act) who have functioning insurance is very low,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Esquivel, president of the Riverside chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens, a sponsor of the fair. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe vast majority of people in the Inland Empire are not registered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUndocumented immigrants are not eligible for care under the law, and dental and vision care are not part of Obamacare coverage.\n\nAt last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health fair, more than 1,000 people received care, checkups, tests, free glasses or some other type of service.\n\nYet many had to be turned away. The 174 spots for dental care were snatched up by 10 a.m. last year, two hours after the doors opened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere must have been 600 people looking for dental care who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Esquivel said.\n\nThis year, there will be at least 26 dentists, compared with 17 last year, and eight doctors, compared with four last year.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ultimate goal is to try to serve more people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Esquivel said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe might have to turn people down. We hope not as many as last year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNew this year are mammograms, hearing exams and free hearing amplifiers.\n\nThe league is organizing the event with Chicanos/Latinos for Community Medicine at Riverside City College. There were similar clinics in 2011 and February 2013.\n\nSome of the dentists are flying in from Northern California with Auburn-based Flying Doctors, an organization that was founded to provide care in rural Latin America but later expanded to the impoverished eastern Coachella Valley and in 2011 to Riverside. Individual local dentists are also scheduled to volunteer, along with dentists affiliated with Loma Linda University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s School of Dentistry, Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona and San Dimas-based Buddhist Tzu-Chi Foundation.\n\nRiverside County Regional Medical Center is providing primary-care physicians. Other organizations are providing nurses, equipment, dental and physician assistants, optometrists, ophthalmologists and audiologists.\n\nContact David Olson at 951-368-9462 or dolson@pe.com\n\nHEALTH FAIR\n\nWhat: Free dental care, medical checkups, mammograms, vision tests and hearing exams are among the services offered.\n\nWhen: 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 22; registration begins at 7 a.m. Services are first-come, first-served.\n\nWhere: C\u00c3\u00a9sar Ch\u00c3\u00a1vez Community Center, 2060 University Ave., Riverside\n\nInformation: 951-236-3171 or 714-944-5937", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "DAVID OLSON", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/n2ae9i-10011341healthbinary1450288.jpg", "content_section": "traffic", "content_title": "RIVERSIDE: Health fair to provide free care, checkups", "author": "DAVID OLSON", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "News: RIVERSIDE: Health fair to provide free care, checkups | care, people, year, health, dental, riverside, last, first, fair, free", "title": "RIVERSIDE: Health fair to provide free care, checkups", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/n2ae9i-10011341healthbinary1450288.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/care-684446-people-year.html", "type": "article"}, "section": "traffic", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-19 17:39:58", "content_author": "DAVID OLSON", "sailthru.title": "RIVERSIDE: Health fair to provide free care, checkups", "sailthru.tags": "traffic, care, people, year, health, dental, riverside, last, first, fair, free", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/n2ae9i-10011341healthbinary1450288.jpg", "content_type": "article", "Keywords": "care, people, year, health, dental, riverside, last, first, fair, free", "publication_date": "2014-02-19", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/n2ae9i-10011341healthbinary1450288.jpg", "Description": "News: RIVERSIDE: Health fair to provide free care, checkups | care, people, year, health, dental, riverside, last, first, fair, free"}, "article_summary": "RIVERSIDE: Health fair to provide free care, checkups Share Pin It More Galleries Lana Renfroe, a volunteer dental hygienist, performs a teeth cleaning on Ruben Lopez, 20, of Riverside, during the 2013 health fair.\nAt last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health fair, more than 1,000 people received care, checkups, tests, free glasses or some other type of service.\nDAVID BAUMAN, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article \u00bbThis is the third year for a health fair in Riverside providing free dental care and medical and vision checkups, and the first held since people began signing up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\nContact David Olson at 951-368-9462 or dolson@pe.comHEALTH FAIRWhat: Free dental care, medical checkups, mammograms, vision tests and hearing exams are among the services offered.\nThe 174 spots for dental care were snatched up by 10 a.m. last year, two hours after the doors opened."}
