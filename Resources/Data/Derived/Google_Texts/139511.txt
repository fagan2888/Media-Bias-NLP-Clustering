An ideal combination for the well-informed gamer? ABC News announced Thursday that it has launched an app for Xbox One. “Debuting as the first U.S. news application on the gaming console, the ABC News app will offer immediate access to multiple simultaneous streams of live video as well as on-demand content, entertainment news, original programming and highlights from ABC News programs,” the broadcast company says.

There’s pertinent Hollywood timing, though. During Oscars weekend, the app will offer video clips and live footage of nominees, red carpet interviews, fashion parades and historical moment.

Colby Smith, ABC vice president of digital operations, calls it a “major step in developing new creative forms of storytelling.” That storytelling includes user-controlled split screens which can include a game, live TV or Skype. The network has also make available added material from curated videos, Marvel Entertainment and Fusion, plus content from ABC affiliates in eight major cities.

“The ability to choose from multiple live streams, especially during breaking news and special events, will provide an unparalleled viewing experience for the audience,” notes Mr. Smith.
