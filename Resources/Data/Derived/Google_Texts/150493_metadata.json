And the weather\u2019s been pretty nice, too. Film and fashion continue to dazzle at the movie world\u2019s annual celebration of cinema on the Cote d\u2019Azur. Associated Press journalists are on the ground, too, and here\u2019s a look at what they\u2019re reporting:\n\n___\n\nA-LISTER IN AN A-LINE\n\nNatalie Portman is at home on the Cannes red carpet, but her appearance Saturday was her first as director as well as star.\n\nPortman wrote, directed and stars in the Hebrew-language festival entry \u201cA Tale of Love and Darkness.\u201d\n\nShe wore an elegant dress from Dior Couture\u2019s spring-summer 2015 collection with an A-line skirt in black-patterned pale blue silk and a black strapless bodice. The look was topped by sleek, pulled-back hair and white diamond De Grisogono earrings.\n\nPortman has received lukewarm reviews for the film, a handsomely mounted tale of a young boy coming of age in the newly formed Israeli state in the late 1940s. Portman plays the boy\u2019s sensitive, imaginative mother in the film, adapted from a novel by Amos Oz.\n\n\u2014 Jill Lawless, http://Twitter.com/JillLawless\n\n___\n\nDARK SIDE OF FAME\n\nCelebrity-worshipping Cannes got a sobering reminder of fame\u2019s dark side Saturday with \u201cAmy,\u201d a powerful documentary about the late singer Amy Winehouse.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be at all famous,\u201d a teenage Winehouse says at one point in the film by British director Asif Kapadia. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could handle it.\u201d\n\nWinehouse was a global celebrity when she died in July 2011 of accidental alcohol poisoning at age 27.\n\nThe sense that the singer foresaw her fate lends extra poignancy to the film, which is getting its world premiere at a Cannes midnight screening.\n\nMusician Yasmin Bey, formerly known as Mos Def, performed at a party before the premiere, along with jazz singer Gregory Porter and new artist Cosmina.\n\nBey called Winehouse a \u201cdear friend\u201d and \u201cone of the realest\u201d people he had ever met.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing the songs that Amy never heard but I know she would like,\u201d said Bey, who sprinkled rose petals on the floor in her honor. \u201cThis one\u2019s for you baby girl.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jill Lawless, http://Twitter.com/JillLawless\n\n___\n\nHARSH GREETING\n\nMatthew McConaughey\u2019s remarkable comeback streak in recent years \u2014 the so called \u201cMcConaissance\u201d \u2014 hit a bump at the Cannes Film Festival premiere of Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cThe Sea of Trees.\u201d\n\nThe film, about two men (McConaughey, Ken Watanabe) who find each other in a Japanese \u201csuicide forest,\u201d was greeted harshly by critics and was loudly booed in its initial screenings to Cannes media. Ahead of the film\u2019s official premiere, McConaughey was sanguine about the reaction.\n\n\u201cAnyone has as much right to boo as they do to ovate,\u201d McConaughey told reporters Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe Sea of Trees,\u201d which was picked up for U.S. distribution by Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions ahead of the festival, is about a man who wrestles with guilt over a bitter marriage (Naomi Watts plays his wife) and travels to Japan to kill himself.\n\nVariety called the film \u201ca risibly long-winded drama.\u201d The Hollywood Reporter slammed it as \u201cwoefully sentimental and maudlin.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "CANNES WATCH: DIVINE IN DIOR; MAD AT McCONAUGHEY", "title": "CANNES WATCH: DIVINE IN DIOR; MAD AT McCONAUGHEY", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "CANNES WATCH: DIVINE IN DIOR; MAD AT McCONAUGHEY", "title": "CANNES WATCH: DIVINE IN DIOR; MAD AT McCONAUGHEY", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/16/cannes_watch_divine_in_dior_mad_at_mcconaughey/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-cannes-my-mother-red-carpet.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CANNES WATCH: DIVINE IN DIOR; MAD AT McCONAUGHEY", "title": "CANNES WATCH: DIVINE IN DIOR; MAD AT McCONAUGHEY", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-cannes-my-mother-red-carpet.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6cdd\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsCANNES, France (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s been a gorgeous weekend at the Cannes Film Festival.\nAhead of the film\u2019s official premiere, McConaughey was sanguine about the reaction.\nBey called Winehouse a \u201cdear friend\u201d and \u201cone of the realest\u201d people he had ever met.\n\u2014 Jill Lawless, http://Twitter.com/JillLawless___DARK SIDE OF FAMECelebrity-worshipping Cannes got a sobering reminder of fame\u2019s dark side Saturday with \u201cAmy,\u201d a powerful documentary about the late singer Amy Winehouse.\nVariety called the film \u201ca risibly long-winded drama.\u201d The Hollywood Reporter slammed it as \u201cwoefully sentimental and maudlin.\u201d"}
