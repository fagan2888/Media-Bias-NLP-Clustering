And they are encouraged by the 2014 victory of John Ratcliffe over longtime incumbent Ralph Hall in a Rockwall-based district and the downing of former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia in a primary last year.\n\nEmanuelson is supporting Dallas businessman Russ Ramsland\u2019s challenge to Republican Rep. Pete Sessions in the 32nd District in Dallas and Garland.\n\nSessions, chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, will also have to fend off Iraq war veteran Paul Brown, Jeff Tokar and Cheri Myint Roughneen.\n\nIn 2014, Sessions easily beat tea party activist Katrina Pierson, now a spokeswoman for presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of good fortune that has to come in order to win,\u201d Emanuelson said. \u201cIn order to benefit from good fortune, you have to be on the field.\u201d\n\nIncumbents\u2019 advantages\n\nSeveral candidates hope for such luck in the March 1 primary.\n\nIn North Texas, five incumbents face challengers. Among them is Ratcliffe, who has little time to enjoy his 2014 upset of Hall.\n\nNone of those races, at this point, has worried much of the political establishment. But Republican incumbents who have watched their colleagues in the Legislature lose to upstarts are not taking chances.\n\nThey have clear advantages.\n\nStrict limits on federal campaign contributions favor incumbents, who have much more fundraising experience and typically start with sturdy campaign funds.\n\nA rookie grass-roots candidate often has difficulty raising money. Self-financing is an option, but only for the wealthy.\n\nAnother problem is that the grass-roots movement is spread thin. Just as activists push hard in legislative races, it becomes difficult to pivot to federal races with different issues and large districts.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, at the state level, groups like Empower Texans, largely financed by Midland oilman Tim Dunn, can form a strong coalition with activists. Few such groups play on the federal level.\n\n\u201cIt may [only] be harder to take down a sitting president than a sitting member of Congress,\u201d said Mark Davis, a conservative radio talk show host for KSKY-AM (660).\n\nDavis said that doesn\u2019t mean conservatives are happy with the entire GOP delegation, but it indicates the differences between state and federal politics.\n\nConservative activists have hard feelings about Congress\u2019 failure to overhaul immigration policy or repeal the Affordable Care Act, but they don\u2019t make incumbents pay at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cIn the North Texas congressional delegation, there are feelings of acceptance and frustration,\u201d Davis said.\n\nMany congressional voters, however, understand the nuance of politics, and establishment Republicans, particularly the chamber of commerce types, rely on experienced incumbents to push legislation that helps their business-friendly agenda.\n\nGetting to the runoff\n\nBut grass-roots activists are implementing different strategies to help challengers score upsets in congressional races.\n\nOne tactic is to flood a race with several candidates, hoping to push the contest into a runoff. In a second round, voter turnout is smaller and operatives can get more hard-core conservatives to the polls. And with fewer runoffs, the grass-roots can focus on specific races.\n\nSuch was the case in 2012, when the once-unknown Ted Cruz took David Dewhurst, who had won three statewide races, into the runoff to replace U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. Dewhurst, the former lieutenant governor, got 47 percent of the vote against multiple challengers, including former Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert.\n\nBut in the runoff, staged July 31, Cruz\u2019s grass-roots support overwhelmed Dewhurst. Cruz is now a GOP presidential front-runner, and Dewhurst is out of office, having lost again in 2014 to another conservative challenger \u2014 Dan Patrick.\n\nIt\u2019s similar to a scenario that unfolded in a major 2014 North Texas state Senate race, when incumbent Bob Deuell won the first round against multiple candidates but lost a low-turnout runoff in to Bob Hall.\n\nActivists now call the practice of running several candidates against a sitting officeholder \u201cDeuelling\u201d the incumbent.\n\nAll of the North Texas Republican incumbents facing opposition in the coming primary \u2014 Joe Barton, Michael Burgess, Sam Johnson, Ratcliffe and Sessions \u2014 have multiple challengers.\n\nAnd while Ratcliffe beat Ralph Hall in 2014, such victories are rare. The ever-changing core of the Republican Party, which is increasingly more conservative, could make Congress the next frontier in numerous political upsets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard fight, but it\u2019s important for us to keep trying,\u201d Emanuelson said.\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@gromerjeffers", "article_metadata": {"description": "Grass-roots activists are trying to repeat their state-level wins, but Texas incumbents have the cash advantage.", "og": {"description": "Grass-roots activists are trying to repeat their state-level wins, but Texas incumbents have the cash advantage.", "title": "Tea party aims for establishment GOP\u2019s seats in Congress", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20160101-tea-party-aims-for-establishment-gops-seats-in-congress.ece", "image": {"width": 3377, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20160101-newcruz.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/newcruz.jpg", "height": 2251}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-01-02T05:46:24Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-01-02T04:57:47Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Tea party aims for establishment GOP\\u2019s seats in Congress\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20160101-tea-party-aims-for-establishment-gops-seats-in-congress.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20160101-newcruz.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/newcruz.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2599373\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-01-02T04:57:47Z\", \"section\": \"General News\", \"author\": \"GROMER JEFFERS JR.\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20160101-newcruz.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/newcruz.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-02T04:57:47Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s a steeper climb,\u201d said North Texas tea party leader Ken Emanuelson.\nIn 2014, Sessions easily beat tea party activist Katrina Pierson, now a spokeswoman for presidential candidate Donald Trump.\nThe ever-changing core of the Republican Party, which is increasingly more conservative, could make Congress the next frontier in numerous political upsets.\nAll of the North Texas Republican incumbents facing opposition in the coming primary \u2014 Joe Barton, Michael Burgess, Sam Johnson, Ratcliffe and Sessions \u2014 have multiple challengers.\n\u201cIn the North Texas congressional delegation, there are feelings of acceptance and frustration,\u201d Davis said."}
