Kum & Go is applying for more than $8.5 million in state tax incentives to move its headquarters from West Des Moines to downtown, according to a Des Moines City Council document.

The memo provides the look at the size and price tag of the development. The 120,000-square-foot building would cost an estimated $92 million.

The convenience store chain announced in March that it planned to buy a block at 14th Street and Grand Avenue in the Western Gateway for its new corporate office. The company has applied for state enterprise zone incentives, including $6.7 million in investment tax credits and a $1.86 million sales tax rebate, according to the city memo.

The City Council is set to vote this evening on the application. If approved, the application could be reviewed by the Iowa Economic Development Authority at its June 20 meeting.

Kum & Go is expected to seek additional incentives from the city.
