We are here to stay.\u201d\n\nAbout 200 people attended the program that served as a rededication of the YMCA as the Sampson Family YMCA after the late Myles D. Sampson, a real estate developer known for community and philanthropic endeavors. Sampson of Murrysville died in March 2007 at 62.\n\nThe $12 million project provided a 30,000-square-foot addition and will include remodeling the existing facility. The new Y includes a double gymnasium, six-lane lap pool, wellness center, warm-water therapy pool, teaching kitchen, expanded summer and day camp, free weights and cardiovascular equipment, spinning studio and child-watch service area for parents while they exercise.\n\nFundraising kicked off a few years ago with a $1 million donation from the Sampson Foundation, established in 1993.\n\nThe new fitness area opened Saturday afternoon. The pool is expected to open within a couple of weeks, said Kelli McIntyre, Sampson Family YMCA executive director.\n\n\u201cThe YMCA has been serving the communities of Plum, Murrysville, Delmont, Oakmont, Harrison City and Monroeville for more than 40 years,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cAs these communities have grown in size, we must also grow to meet the changing needs of families, seniors, teens and individuals. Our new facility can serve three times the people we serve today.\u201d\n\nKaren Zapf is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
