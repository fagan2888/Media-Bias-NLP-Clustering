Charleston County deputies are investigating a fatal shooting Saturday night at the Big Rock Club located in an unincorporated part of North Charleston.Authorities say deputies were called out to reports of a shooting at the Big Rock Club on Kimbell Avenue around 10:30 p.m. Saturday night.Deputies say an altercation happened in the parking lot and several shots were fired and struck one male victim multiple times.Authorities say the victim was transported to MUSC where he was pronounced dead.The Charleston County Coroner's Office said the victim, Barrett Kinlock of North Charleston, died of gunshot wounds.

According to an incident report, a search of the victim's pockets recovered a small bag containing a white powdery substance, a small bag containing an off-white rock-like substance, a small scale, an empty ziploc bag, and a credit card that was not in the victim's name.

A witness told deputies a male suspect arrived in a 2001-2006 gray Lincoln Town Car, walked to the back of the club and shot the victim, then left in his vehicle.



Some neighbors said they heard as many as 13 shots and worried about being hit inside their own homes.

"I was looking at Star Trek just doing my routine evening," Timothy Washington, who lives on Kimbell Road said. "I curled up into a ball because I live in a mobile home and the walls are thin and the stray round can penetrate anything."

Officials say they have not identified a motive or any suspects in this incident.

The suspect was described as a black male, skinny and approximately 5'5" in height. He was wearing a white tank top, dark jeans, with dreadlocks past his shoulders.



Charleston County Sheriff's Office is still investigating the shooting. If you have any information, call Crime Stoppers at 843-554-1111.
