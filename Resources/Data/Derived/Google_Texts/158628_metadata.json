The Federal Trade Commission brought a major anti-competition case on the matter. The high court did not settle the case, but rejected the state dental board\u2019s claim that its actions were immune from FTC scrutiny.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the North Carolina dental board\u2019s members, primarily dentists, were drawn from the very occupation they regulate. They barred non-dentists [in this specific case, dental hygienists] from offering competing teeth-whitening services to consumers,\u201d said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez in a press release.\n\nThe American Nurses Association says the dental board case may have \u201cfar-reaching implications beyond dentistry.\u201d\n\nIn Georgia, the experts are divided on how, or if, the case could affect professional practice laws.\n\nWhat doctors and nurses say\n\nDebbie Bartlett, CEO of the Georgia Nurses Association, says her organization \u201cwill utilize the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling to help inform Georgia legislators about the need to support federal antitrust laws [as well as] avoid unduly suppressing pro-consumer competition.\u201d\n\nGeorgia state practice and licensure law restrict the ability of nurse practitioners \u2014 nurses trained to perform many tasks often left up to doctors \u2014 to engage in at least one element of practice. Georgia nurse practitioners, also known as advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), cannot write prescriptions for Schedule II medications. And their ability to order specific diagnostic tests is also limited.\n\nThe state requires supervision, delegation or team management by licensed physicians in Georgia in order for any nurse practitioner to provide patient care.\n\nDonald J. Palmisano Jr., executive director of the Medical Association of Georgia, sees little reason for concern about the high court ruling, because the kind of situation cited in North Carolina does not exist here.\n\n\u201cThe North Carolina case is drastically different than the way the licensing boards work in Georgia.\u201d says Palmisano. Here, a board\u2019s proposed actions are reviewed by the state attorney general\u2019s office and released for public comment, he notes.\n\n\u201cThe ruling in North Carolina never rose to the level where the Medical Association needed to contact the Georgia Nurses Association,\u201d Palmisano says.\n\n\u201cThe two organizations [in Georgia] have a fairly strong relationship. I don\u2019t foresee [a big impact from the Supreme Court ruling] here,\u201d he adds.\n\nAtlanta nurse practitioner Mary Perloe agrees. \u201cI actually think nurse practitioner collaborative agreements with physicians and using evidenced-based protocols make sense,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI also believe that the nurse practitioners should bear responsibility for their practice. As NPs gain more authority, accountability needs to follow, and physicians need to be relieved of this liability,\u201d says Perloe.\n\nRebecca Wheeler, the GNA past president, suggests the ruling may be a mixed blessing for those in the nursing profession.\n\n\u201cI think the decision is great for APRNs, but I am a little worried about what this means in order to protect our own RN scope of practice from medical technician or nursing assistant roles,\u201d Wheeler says. \u201cI feel like this is a bit of a double-edged sword for nursing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s necessarily a bad thing [referring to the Supreme Court decision]. We probably need to be prepared to \u2018give a little\u2019 if we want APRNs to be able to practice to the full extent of their training in Georgia.\u201d\n\nThe issue of dentistry\n\nThe American Dental Association (ADA) said it was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d at the U.S. Supreme Court decision.\n\nThe group said the decision \u201cconstitutes a dramatic departure from the Supreme Court\u2019s established law, and throws into question the regulatory, licensing and disciplinary authority of thousands of professional boards across the county.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ruling creates a quandary for professional boards . . . with no explanation as to what level of \u2018active supervision\u2019 is necessary to invoke immunity for each board,\u201d ADA stated.\n\nThe association said it is planning to work with other organizations to provide some kind of guidance in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nBut among Georgia dentists, as among physicians in general, there seems to be less alarm about the ruling. Frank J. Capaldo, the Georgia Dental Association\u2019s executive director, says there are a number of important distinctions between the dental licensing boards in Georgia and North Carolina.\n\n\u201cIn Georgia, members are appointed to the Board of Dentistry by the governor, but in North Carolina they are elected to the board by other licensed dentists,\u201d Capaldo says. \u201cThis difference in and of itself shows significant state oversight in Georgia.\u201d\n\nSome see more opportunities\n\nScope of practice limitations for nurses exist alongside a shortage of health care providers in Georgia, especially in rural areas.\n\nThe consumer group Georgia Watch recently reported that the number of licensed APRNs in Georgia has reached more than 9,500. With the physician shortage in the state, which is expected to get worse, APRNs could help fill this primary care gap, the group\u2019s report says.\n\nNP Photo with manA total of 129 of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties have a shortage of health care professionals. In fact, about 80 percent of Georgia\u2019s counties contain substantial populations without a consistent source for primary care, according to the Georgia Watch report.\n\nGeorgia Watch and others continue to urge state policymakers to consider using more advanced practice nurses and physician assistants in health care shortage areas.\n\nMany Georgia physicians, however, traditionally support the restrictions on the duties of nurse practitioners. They\u2019re concerned about whether people who are not doctors \u2014 working on their own \u2014 have the training to safely diagnose and treat patients, refer them to specialists, admit them to hospitals and prescribe medications for them. These doctors think the NPs should continue to work under the oversight of physicians.\n\nThe right of Georgia nurse practitioners to prescribe medications didn\u2019t come until 2006. Georgia was the 50th state to grant NPs prescribing ability.\n\nMany health care experts say that with the influx of thousands of Georgians into the health care system under the Affordable Care Act, the time may be right for the state to review its scope of practice laws, especially in rural areas.\n\n\u201cThere are, after all, cost realities here. We just need to be prepared,\u201d says Wheeler, referring to NP restrictions.\n\n\u201cThis [Supreme Court] ruling seems to open up the door for everyone, including medical technicians or nursing assistants, as much as it does for APRNs,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Northwest Georgia News", "description": "A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling about teeth-whitening services may have long-term implications for health care professionals and their practices across the country.", "title": "Will a Supreme Court ruling about teeth whitening send ripples through the health care industry?", "url": "http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/news/local/will-a-supreme-court-ruling-about-teeth-whitening-send-ripples/article_5c5502b8-de1a-11e4-95ed-6369799795f7.html", "image": {"width": 302, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/northwestgeorgianews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/46/646c8366-2f68-11e3-a44e-001a4bcf6878/5252d8b72ad9b.preview-300.jpg?resize=302%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling about teeth-whitening services may have long-term implications for health care professionals and their practices across the country.", "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,710194472,654195704", "app_id": 551345941562032}, "keywords": "local,local,local,local", "news_keywords": "local,local,local,local"}, "article_summary": "The high court did not settle the case, but rejected the state dental board\u2019s claim that its actions were immune from FTC scrutiny.\nA recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling about teeth-whitening services may have long-term implications for health care professionals and their practices across the country.\nGeorgia nurse practitioners, also known as advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), cannot write prescriptions for Schedule II medications.\nThe right of Georgia nurse practitioners to prescribe medications didn\u2019t come until 2006.\n\u201cThe ruling in North Carolina never rose to the level where the Medical Association needed to contact the Georgia Nurses Association,\u201d Palmisano says."}
