Because the Obamacare subsidy system requires customers to estimate their income for the upcoming year, those who end up earning more than expected will end up getting more subsidies than appropriate.\n\nThat will leave them owing $794 to the IRS on average, according to KFF. Another 45 percent are expected to have overestimated their income and should get extra money back from the government, for an average refund of $773.

And KFF notes that it could be a complete surprise, as in the first year of Obamacare, some people were unaware they were even receiving subsidies.\n\n\u201cAn unanticipated repayment \u2014 which may require tax households to actually write a check to the IRS or get a lower-than-expected tax refund \u2014 may be difficult for these households to handle financially, even though it would only happen if their income is higher than originally estimated.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s quite a range, however. Americans who earn between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level qualify for the premium subsidies \u2014 earning around $45,960 annually for an individual and $94,200 for a family of four. Those who believed they\u2019d fall into that window and and end up earning more than the limit could end up owing thousands.\n\nFor those who underestimated how much they\u2019d earn but remain under 400 percent of the poverty level, however, Obamacare caps the amount customers are required to repay. Those with the lowest incomes won\u2019t have to pay back the full amount of subsidies they owe.\n\nAt the top level, those between 300 and 400 percent of the poverty level that owe the feds will have to pay $1,380 on average. Those in the group whose incomes broached the 400 percent maximum for eligibility will owe the IRS a check for $2,306.\n\n\u201cTo the extent people are uncertain about how much of a subsidy they will ultimately qualify for, they may be more hesitant to sign up for insurance,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Half of Obamacare customers that took premium subsidies will end up owing the IRS big come tax season -- almost $800 on average.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Half the Obamacare customers who received premium subsidies will end up owing the IRS big come tax season -- almost $800 on average, according to a new study.
