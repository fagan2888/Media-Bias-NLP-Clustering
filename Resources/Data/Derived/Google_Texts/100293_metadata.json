But beneath his well-meaning fa\u00e7ade is a man with dark intentions and even darker secrets. Disillusioned by the apocalypse, the Governor refuses to let go of his turned daughter, Penny. To hide his darkest secret, The Governor escapes to a concealed lair, where he relishes in the death and destruction of this dismal new world.\n\nBuildability: Geared for the mature, 12-year-old and older fan of the show, this hybrid kit offers 292 pieces of small bricks and flooring planks along with pieces of furniture and body appendages to construct an 8-inch-long by 5-inch-wide room with walls on two sides and recreate one of the more shocking scenes of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d series.\n\nExpect about 90 minutes of effort to assemble by following some occasionally misleading instructions (reference building the aquariums).\n\nHere are a couple of tips while working with some of the miniscule pieces.\n\n\u2022 Assembling the figures of a slumping Governor and Penny Blake (with bag over head) will truly tax the might of one\u2019s fingers and patience due to the tiny size. Take a deep breath, adults with big hands. The fine detail, down to the textured sack over Penny\u2019s head, makes the effort worth it.\n\nIt reminded me of painting miniature metal figures as a kid, except instead of painting, I am carefully attaching a torso to a pelvis peg that is way too tight (tearing a bit of finger skin in the process) or spindly, pegged arms into shoulder holes that feel like they could snap in half if too much force gets applied. Suffice to report, the process does not work well for those with large hands or any vision problems.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t panic when you see the 292 pieces. Once you assemble a couple rows of the hard wood floors (I felt like an Empire Carpet guy) and a few lines of the walls, it becomes a very quick assembly.\n\nAlso, Mr. McFarlane could have easily cut out 100 or so pieces by making the wall bricks longer like Lego often does. However, he obviously wanted to torture owners as they methodically assembled this masterpiece of the macabre.\n\nAccessories: Once the Governor\u2019s Room is assembled, look to appreciate some of the following cool items and features.\n\n\u2022 The signature piece is a set of nine aquariums positioned against the back wall housing the heads of the Governor\u2019s favorite victims. Now, here\u2019s the cool part. Pop in the included batteries to the bases and flick a switch to see the aquariums glow. Yes, the lights cast an eerie yellow illumination upward to highlight some of the grotesque trophies.\n\n\u2022 The Governor\u2019s recliner, textured to look like a comfy red leather chair, actually reclines.\n\n\u2022 Additionally, owners get a bloodied metallic door that Penny can hide behind, a lamp (requiring as much assembly work that one might find from an Ikea purchase), a bucket of dripping body parts (Penny needs feeding), gorgeously painted faux-hard wood planking and a pair of woven baskets to help with the Feng Shui vibe of the layout.\n\nSome of the floor planks have small pegs that are used to position set pieces as well as other figures, but repositioning the floor pieces can be a challenge.\n\nWhile on the topic of figures, of course, other humans and ghouls are available and sold in the intriguing and wallet-busting Blind Bag ($2.99 each).\n\nEach bag is labeled with an \u201cH\u201d for human or \u201cW\u201d for walker, and each contains one, unassembled figure and translucent base to attach to the c-clamp on a foot. Of course, buyers have no idea what they are getting from each bag, and fondling the bag does not really help, so it could be a costly adventure.\n\nHighlights include Michonne with blade drawn to strike (a must have for the Governor\u2019s Room), Carl (Rick Grime\u2019s son) in 10-gallon hat, Daryl Dixon pointing his bow to fire, one of Michonne\u2019s pet walkers (with chain around head) and a disturbing representation of Carol\u2019s daughter Sophia (complete with a half-eaten torso accessory).\n\nBy the way, once assembled, the tiny figures offer just a hint of articulation for those daring enough to twist an arm, torso or head on the slightly delicate pieces.\n\nPrice: $29.99.\n\nRead all about it: Those looking to explore the heinous crimes of the Governor should purchase the massive, comic-book compiling, omnibus edition (measuring almost 13-inches by 9-inches) called \u201cThe Walking Dead: Volume 2 Deluxe Hardcover\u201d (averaging $62).\n\nIt collects the 24 black-and-white issues (No. 25 to 48) of the monthly sequential-art series concocted by Robert Kirkman and offers the introduction and subsequent story arc involving the infamous leader of Woodbury.\n\nWatch it: Appreciate the third season of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d (available on Blu-ray from Starz Home Entertainment, $79.99 reduced to $29 through some online vendors). Watch specific episodes \u201cSay the Word,\u201d \u201cWalk With Me\u201d and \u201cMade to Suffer\u201d to view the infamous room as well as learn the fate of Penny.\n\nWhat\u2019s it worth: McFarlane Toys successfully dabbles with building blocks but does not step upon the sacred grounds of Lego and Mega Bloks with the Governor\u2019s Room, as well as other pieces from \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d collection.\n\nThis frighteningly defined and gruesome diorama would do well to sit on a desk, shelf or in a display case. It\u2019s the perfect piece to generate much discussion from fans or innocent onlookers pulled into the aura of the shocking zombie show.\n\nI also can\u2019t gush enough about the meticulous detail and head sculpts found in figures roughly the height of a business card.\n\nHardcore collectors wanting to truly build a massive attack of the undead need to look to building the Prison Tower ($64.99, 620 pieces) complete with a breakable fence area to unleash miniaturized horror upon Rick Grime\u2019s faithful crew.", "article_metadata": {"description": "McFarlane Toys dare collectors to create their own zombie apocalypse with building sets and mini-figures featuring Rick Grimes, Carl Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Glen Rhee, Michonne, and the evil Governor.", "Author": "Joseph Szadkowski", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "McFarlane Toys dare collectors to create their own zombie apocalypse with building sets and mini-figures featuring Rick Grimes, Carl Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Glen Rhee, Michonne, and the evil Governor.", "title": "Zadzooks: The Walking Dead - The Governor\u2019s Room", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/24/zadzooks-walking-dead-governors-room/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/24/gov-room-socialnet.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/24/gov-room-socialnet.jpg", "title": "Zadzooks: The Walking Dead - The Governor\u2019s Room", "description": "McFarlane Toys dare collectors to create their own zombie apocalypse with building sets and mini-figures featuring Rick Grimes, Carl Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Glen Rhee, Michonne, and the evil Governor.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Penny Blake, The Walking Dead, Daryl Dixon, Woodbury, Todd Mcfarlane"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0132\"", "article_summary": "Watch it: Appreciate the third season of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d (available on Blu-ray from Starz Home Entertainment, $79.99 reduced to $29 through some online vendors).\nTodd McFarlane and his team of twisted designers dare collectors to create their own zombie apocalypse with \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d building sets and mini-figures collection.\nPHOTOS: McFarlane Toys' The Walking Dead: The Governor's RoomFigure profile: (paraphrased from McFarlane Toys website) The charismatic leader of the seemingly utopian town of Woodbury, the Governor appears stern, but just.\nAccessories: Once the Governor\u2019s Room is assembled, look to appreciate some of the following cool items and features.\nWhat\u2019s it worth: McFarlane Toys successfully dabbles with building blocks but does not step upon the sacred grounds of Lego and Mega Bloks with the Governor\u2019s Room, as well as other pieces from \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d collection."}
