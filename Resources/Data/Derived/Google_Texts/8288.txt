Across the U.S., filing one claim means a homeowner’s premium will increase an average of 9%, according to a new insuranceQuotes.com report. The state with the highest increase is Wyoming, which raises premiums by 32%, and the lowest is Texas, where home insurers are not allowed to increase premiums after one claim.

The increases depend on where you live and what type of claim is being filed. Connecticut is not far behind and raises premiums by 21%, followed by Arizona at 20%, New Mexico at 19% and California at 18%.

Filing a second claim is even worse and brings the national average increase up to 20%, with the highest amount occurring in Michigan at a whopping 71%. In Texas, a second claim increase is only 5%. The next lowest increases were observed in New York at 2%, Massachusetts at 2%, Florida at 3% and Vermont at 4%.

“Homeowners need to be really careful when filing claims,” said Laura Adams, insuranceQuotes.com’s senior analyst. “Even a denied claim can cause your premium to go up. Make sure to know your policy’s specific guidelines and only file a claim when absolutely necessary. Winning a small claim could actually cost you money in the long run.”
