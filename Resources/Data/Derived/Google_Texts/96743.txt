PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) — An effort to preserve the historic BX Ranch east of Pueblo has been completed.

The Palmer Land Trust partnered with Great Outdoors Colorado, the Nature Conservancy, the Gates Family Foundation and private funding to purchase a conservation easement on the 25,000-acre ranch.

The easement means the property will continue as a working ranch.

According to the Pueblo Chieftain (http://tinyurl.com/pkmra7z), the BX Ranch, located south of Boone, was homesteaded by James Ellison England in 1867. It’s located near State Land Board land and connects with other privately held conservation easements to the south to form a corridor of open space.

The ranch site was under consideration for a nuclear plant about five years ago, but that plant was withdrawn in the face of public protests.
