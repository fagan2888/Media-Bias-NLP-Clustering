I mean, it\u2019s absolutely[.] \u2026\n\n\u201cI wonder if the two Muslim members of Congress, my buddy Keith Ellison Andre Carson would they be in that database with Mohammed Ali, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, funniest guy in America, Dave Chappelle? You know, we talked about special IDs for Muslims. Would that be similar to the yellow Stars of David that many Jewish people had to wear in Nazi Germany? Would it be a yellow crescent this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the tactic of \u201cprayer shaming\u201d is catching on in the pages of the mainstream media.\n\n\u201cAs Clinton and fellow Democrats try to downplay the possible religious motivations behind Muslim suspect Syed Farook\u2019s rampage, instead focusing on gun control, the liberal media scrambled to mock and disparage Christians for offering their prayers on social media and in public statements.\n\n\u201cWhile the Huffington Post blasted a headline calling prayer \u201can ineffective strategy,\u201d anti-gun journalists tweeted out their militantly atheistic bile. NBC News even reported on the \u201cThoughts and prayers backlash,\u201d crediting ThinkProgress editor Igor Volsky with leading the charge.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur beloved elite media loves to fabricate a major freak-out over \u201crhetoric\u201d whenever a Republican says something they don\u2019t approve of (like the truth). But when it comes to actual hate rhetoric and the kind of fear-mongering that could get someone hurt, no one is worse than the elite media. Case in point: Friday, on the front page of the New York Daily News, the NRA\u2019s Wayne LaPierre is attacked in big red letters as a \u201cTERRORIST.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaPierre\u2019s mug shot resides right next to actual terrorists Syed Farook, Robert Dear, Adam Lanza, James Holmes, and Dylann Roof.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hate-message Cillizza is sending out to the world is that the next president of the United States could be dangerous \u2014 a \u201creal danger.\u201d We\u2019re a big country, and as we have seen in the Obama era, there are a lot of nuts out there of all stripes eager to do violence \u2014 eager for the national publicity the DC Media awards certain killers, eager to be heroes to a certain cause.\n\n\u201cStopping \u2014 I want to be careful with my language \u2014 a \u201creal danger\u201d from becoming president is the stuff of movies, where the person who does so is seen as the hero. This thinking is part of our popular culture and was recently resurrected with the Baby Hitler meme that Cillizza himself helped spread \u2014 and did so within the context of the current presidential campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarly Monday morning, Chris Cuomo, co-anchor of \u201cNew Day,\u201d the failing morning show on the left-wing CNN, compared a majority of Americans concerned with domestic security to Americans who, in a 1938 poll, wanted the United States government to refuse Jewish refugees fleeing the hell of Nazi Germany. In one fell swoop, Cuomo not only smeared the American people, he downplayed a deeply shameful period in our history.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the recent Paris terror attacks, to have a major network news anchor openly compare a majority of present-day Americans, worried over national security, to American anti-Semitism from nearly 80 years ago, shows a serious ramping up of the hateful and divisive rhetoric the DC media is willing to use in order to protect Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nMedia Blames Pro-Lifers for Planned Parenthood Attack\n\n\u201cAccording to CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin, conservative \u201crhetoric\u201d \u201ctossed fuel\u201d onto the fire that is the abortion debate. The journalist appeared on The View, Monday, and demanded Republicans be held accountable in the wake of a Colorado Planned Parenthood shooting last week. Hostin blamed, \u201cI don\u2019t think we can ignore the rhetoric that has been out there from the Republican Party, from the right.\u201d \u2014 Source\n\n\u201cRuth Marcus has come close to blaming Republicans for the Colorado Springs shootings. Appearing on Jose Diaz-Balart\u2019s MSNBC show today, Washington Post columnist Marcus said that \u2018the Republican candidates . . . have been part of the inflamed and inflammatory rhetoric about Planned Parenthood, about the sale of baby parts, about dismembering live babies . . . I think it\u2019s a fair conclusion, especially based on his . . . alleged mentioning of \u2018no more baby parts,\u2019 that this kind of rhetoric helped create this environment.\u2019\u201d \u2014 Source\n\n\u201cFollowing the November 27 attack on a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood that killed three people and injured several more, right-wing media pundits immediately denied that violent anti-choice rhetoric may have motivated the shooter. However, anti-choice groups have a history of promoting violence to support their cause. After it was reported that the alleged shooter made comments about \u201cno more baby parts\u201d during questioning, right-wing media echoed the repeatedly debunked anti-choice claim that Planned Parenthood illegally sells fetal tissue, arguing that Planned Parenthood \u2018deserves much of the harsh criticism directed toward it.'\u201d \u2014 Source\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nazis, Bigots & Terrorists: Two Weeks of Hate From Our Frustrated DC Media", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Nazis, Bigots & Terrorists: Two Weeks of Hate From Our Frustrated DC Media", "title": "Nazis, Bigots & Terrorists: Two Weeks of Hate From Our Frustrated DC Media - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 642, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/GettyImages-496561990.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-12-04T07:50:32-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/12/04/nazis-bigots-terrorists-two-weeks-of-hate-from-our-frustrated-dc-media/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nazis, Bigots & Terrorists: Two Weeks of Hate From Our Frustrated DC Media", "title": "Nazis, Bigots & Terrorists: Two Weeks of Hate From Our Frustrated DC Media - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/GettyImages-496561990.jpg", "creator": "@noltenc", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Chuck Todd, CNN, Donald Trump, Meet The Press,Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-12-04T07:49:31-07:00", "section": "Big Journalism", "modified_time": "2015-12-04T07:50:32-07:00", "tag": "Meet The Press", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "have been part of the inflamed and inflammatory rhetoric about Planned Parenthood, about the sale of baby parts, about dismembering live babies .\nThe journalist appeared on The View, Monday, and demanded Republicans be held accountable in the wake of a Colorado Planned Parenthood shooting last week.\nBut when it comes to actual hate rhetoric and the kind of fear-mongering that could get someone hurt, no one is worse than the elite media.\nWould it be a yellow crescent this time?\u201d\u201cAnd the tactic of \u201cprayer shaming\u201d is catching on in the pages of the mainstream media.\nWould that be similar to the yellow Stars of David that many Jewish people had to wear in Nazi Germany?"}
