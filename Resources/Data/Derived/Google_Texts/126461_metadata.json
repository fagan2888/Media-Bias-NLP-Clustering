The students were also upset because they had been guaranteed teaching assistant positions, but halfway through the 2014-15 school year they were told to submit applications with writing samples and references, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn a joint letter the students posted on the website website Art & Education, they wrote, \u201cWe were told that we would have to apply for, and compete with a larger pool of students for the same TA-ships promised to us during recruitment.\u201d\n\nThe students also complained about entire semesters occurring without studio visits.\n\nThe letter began, \u201cWe are a group of seven artists who made the decision to attend USC Roski School of Art & Design\u2019s MFA program based on faculty, curriculum, program structure and funding packages\u2026.We are a group of seven artists who have been forced by the school\u2019s dismantling of each of these elements, to dissolve our MFA candidacies\u2026..We were presented with a different curriculum, one in which entire semesters would occur without studio visits, a bizarre choice for a studio art MFA.\u201d\n\nRoski School dean Erica Muhl responded to the letter by emailing the Los Angeles Times, \u201cI regret that several of our MFA students have stated they will leave the program over issues that were presented to us, and that we considered to have been resolved, specifically having to do with financial aid and curriculum. The school honored all the terms in the students\u2019 offer letters.\u201d\n\nThe visual arts MFA program at Roski boasts alumni such as Paul McCarthy, installationist Amanda Ross-Ho, and multimedia artist Elad Lassry.\n\nMuhl became the dean of the school in 2013, but also runs USC\u2019s Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy, which debuted last fall, funded by Interscope Records co-founder Iovine and Young (better known as rapper Dr. Dre).\n\nDeWitt Godfrey, president of the College Art Assn., tried to explain USC\u2019s change in the Roski program, telling the Times, \u201cIn the case of USC, they\u2019re making a big push into an interdisciplinary arts school that has a lot to do with technology and uses a lot of Silicon Valley buzzwords like \u2018disruption.'\u201d\n\nStark responded to an email from the Times by saying, \u201cThe students are correct in terms of funding, curriculum, and faculty structure. All changed in relation to the program they agreed to enter.\u201d Moser echoed that he exited to \u201cgain some distance from institutional politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Entire 2016 Class of USC Art and Design School Drops Out", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Entire 2016 Class of USC Art and Design School Drops Out", "title": "Entire 2016 Class of USC Art and Design School Drops Out - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1601, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/USC-Trojan-Protest-Neon-Tommy-Flickr-CC-Cropped.jpg", "height": 1200}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/05/17/entire-2016-class-of-usc-art-and-design-school-drops-out/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Entire 2016 Class of USC Art and Design School Drops Out", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/USC-Trojan-Protest-Neon-Tommy-Flickr-CC-Cropped.jpg", "title": "Entire 2016 Class of USC Art and Design School Drops Out - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016, Art and Design, Drop Out, USC,Breitbart California, Education,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "USC", "published_time": "2015-05-17T05:10:12-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California,Education"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Friday, all seven members of the graduate class of 2016 at USC\u2019s Roski School of Art and Design withdrew from the program to protest changes the administration made in the faculty, curriculum and funding.\nThe school honored all the terms in the students\u2019 offer letters.\u201dThe visual arts MFA program at Roski boasts alumni such as Paul McCarthy, installationist Amanda Ross-Ho, and multimedia artist Elad Lassry.\n'\u201dStark responded to an email from the Times by saying, \u201cThe students are correct in terms of funding, curriculum, and faculty structure.\nAll changed in relation to the program they agreed to enter.\u201d Moser echoed that he exited to \u201cgain some distance from institutional politics.\u201d\nThe students were also upset because they had been guaranteed teaching assistant positions, but halfway through the 2014-15 school year they were told to submit applications with writing samples and references, the Los Angeles Times reports."}
