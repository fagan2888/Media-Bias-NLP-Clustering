Instead it cost just $600 in cash that day. He says that\u2019s because he paid for it without going through his insurance provider. This is part of what gave him the idea for Collective Health, a new Founders Fund-backed employer health program launching today. It promises to take the paperwork and runaround out of health insurance.\n\nDiab and co-cofounder Dr. Rajaie Batniji, a physician and political economist at Stanford University, paint Collective Health as a way to cut out the middleman (health insurance) and instead offer employers a less expensive, cloud-based, a la cart version of health care coverage for their workers. Employers can pick and choose which things they want covered for their employees. \u201cWe\u2019re not building another health app or gadget. We\u2019re building a complete solution to replace your employer provided health insurance,\u201d says Diab.\n\nFounders Fund led an undisclosed Series A to back the idea. Formation 8, the Social+Capital Partnership, and prominent angel investors including Scott Banister, Max Levchin, Jeremy Stoppelman and Amr Awadallah also added money in support.\n\nThe other part for the idea for Collective Health was first planted when Diab\u2019s intestine suddenly twisted up on itself, cutting off the blood supply to about 10 feet of his intestine. \u201cNothing could have prevented or predicted this. It was just bad luck,\u201d says Diab.\n\nTo have that happen is a scary and life threatening experience. And then, just as he was struggling to regain his strength, his health insurer didn\u2019t want to pay his fees. Diab says he\u2019d been paying for premium coverage for years in the event of something like this happening. Instead of the help he needed, he was left with papers up to his gut in legalese and medical insurance loop-de-loops he didn\u2019t understand. It was either pay up or face legal action, ruined credit and further unnecessary hardship.\n\nDiab\u2019s story is not unique. Dr. Batniji has seen it over and over again while working in the medical field. \u201cPatients are often left to advocate for themselves and trying to get a clear answer from your health insurance company about what\u2019s driving costs is impossible,\u201d says Dr. Batniji. According to NerdWallet, one in every 5 American adults are struggling to pay their medical bills, and three in five bankruptcies will be due to medical bills. And to add more insult to any possible injuries, over the last 10 years, the average premium for family coverage has increased 80 percent, according to ACA International. It was a 90 percent increase from 2008 to 2009, according to data provided from Wellpoint, Cigna and United Health (see chart below).\n\nThe problem, according to Diab and Dr. Batniji, is that even with Obamacare or employee sponsored health insurance, annual premiums are increasing. They say the costs are growing at an unsustainable rate for most small and midsize companies to handle. This, according to Diab, makes it hard to offer a good plan for employees. \u201cWhile insurance is supposed to be a risk\u00ad-sharing business, health insurance has increasingly become a middleman business devised to generate profit for the health insurers above all else. As a result, there is a fundamental disconnect between the incentives of traditional health insurance companies and people\u2019s and organizations\u2019 health insurance needs,\u201d says Diab.\n\nDiab and Dr. Batniji started asking questions like \u201cWhy have insurance premiums and deductibles risen so much faster than underlying health care costs over the past twenty years?\u201d and \u201cWhy do we receive something in the mail after seeing the doctor that looks like a bill, but says \u2018THIS IS NOT A BILL\u2019 at the top?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like entering a time warp back to 1980,\u201d Diab says. Several long bike rides and early morning coffees later, Dr. Batniji and Diab decided it was up to them to figure out a better way to fixing how Americans pay for health care.\n\nThe startup now employs 25 people in a San Mateo office and Collective Health is currently \u201crenting\u201d insurance services off of a certain network that it is not at liberty to name at this time. Payments processing is also in the works and Diab says it will eventually be like a square or pay pall software. Collective Health also adds in cost comparisons and which doctors are in your network. It also includes a data visualization element not currently offered by any health insurance provider. The data shows you how much you can expect to pay, above your premium. This, says Diab, better prepares someone for what it should cost than just mailing something that says \u201cThis is not a bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccessing and paying for healthcare ought to be simple, transparent and feel good. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working towards at Collective Health,\u201d says Diab.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/sarah-buhr/\" title=\"Posts by Sarah Buhr\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Sarah Buhr</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahbuhr\" rel=\"external\">@sarahbuhr</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "p": {"domain_verify": "6189ff68ce30e30f12b40b3b40873027"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cDid you know you can actually negotiate and get a better deal at the doctor\u2019s office if you offer to pay up front?\u201d co-founder and CEO of Collective Health Ali Diab asks.
