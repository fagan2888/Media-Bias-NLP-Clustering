Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys represent a Christian college and four Christian universities in Geneva College v. Burwell and Southern Nazarene University v. Burwell, two of seven cases that the Supreme Court agreed in November of last year to take up.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services mandate forces employers, regardless of their religious or moral convictions, to provide abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception through their health plans under threat of heavy penalties. Geneva College in Pennsylvania and the four universities in Oklahoma \u2013 Southern Nazarene University, Oklahoma Wesleyan University, Oklahoma Baptist University, and Mid-America Christian University \u2013 specifically object to providing abortifacients.\n\n\u201cThe administration continues to impose the same unacceptable choice: obey and abandon your freedom, or resist and be punished,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel David Cortman. \u201cThe Obama administration has offered no option to religious non-profits that allows them to act consistent with their faith. As the briefs filed today urge, the Supreme Court should rule in accord with its Hobby Lobby/Conestoga decision and ensure that people of faith are not punished for making choices consistent with that faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe administration is forcing the schools to choose between following their faith and following the government\u2019s rule,\u201d added ADF Senior Counsel Gregory S. Baylor. \u201cThat is utterly inconsistent with legal protections for religious liberty, just as the briefs filed today rightly argue.\u201d\n\nADF attorneys and allied attorneys represented Conestoga Wood Specialties and its owners in their victory against the abortion-pill mandate at the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014. While that case addressed the mandate as it applies to for-profit family-run businesses, these cases pertain to the mandate as applied to non-profit organizations. Although the administration argues that executing and submitting a so-called \u201caccommodation\u201d form insulates religious nonprofits from providing abortifacients, ADF attorneys and the briefs filed today explain that is not the case because the form still directly involves the Christian colleges in providing abortifacients in multiple ways.\n\nAmong the parties submitting briefs in support of the Christian colleges and other non-profits are more than 200 members of Congress, 20 states, numerous legal experts and theologians, and a broad spectrum of religious groups and denominations.\n\nADF attorneys and allied attorneys are also litigating numerous other lawsuits against the mandate.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"url": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/coalition-grows-against-abortion-pill-mandate-in-obamacare-96155/", "image": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jeff-Bridges-RIPD-stop-obamacare-meme.jpg", "type": "website", "title": "Coalition grows against abortion pill mandate in Obamacare"}, "google-translate-customization": "7236b401605984b1-3bcbee0db8307092-g6f41da462829b1d2-19", "keywords": "Christian News, Religion News, 2016 Election, Outbreak News, Weird News, Movie News, US News, Breaking News, Internet News, Google News", "msvalidate.01": "F9A11A184D618AB8623122584A1DAB2D", "google-site-verification": "iI9n62s9s0Z-wJUY9p3-wGZp6AQYcH-Z1tDba2QiaT0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Geneva College in Pennsylvania and the four universities in Oklahoma \u2013 Southern Nazarene University, Oklahoma Wesleyan University, Oklahoma Baptist University, and Mid-America Christian University \u2013 specifically object to providing abortifacients.\nWhile that case addressed the mandate as it applies to for-profit family-run businesses, these cases pertain to the mandate as applied to non-profit organizations.\nADF attorneys and allied attorneys are also litigating numerous other lawsuits against the mandate.\n\u201cThe Obama administration has offered no option to religious non-profits that allows them to act consistent with their faith.\n\u201cThe administration continues to impose the same unacceptable choice: obey and abandon your freedom, or resist and be punished,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel David Cortman."}
