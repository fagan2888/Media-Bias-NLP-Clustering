He was 83.\n\nBack when professional bowling was scored with a pencil and paper and balls were made of hard rubber, Brighton\u2019s Schissler dominated the golden age of Colorado lanes \u2014 and really the Denver sports scene.\n\nBefore even the Broncos and Nuggets started taking up space in The Denver Post sports section, Schissler was a mainstay in ink. He won the 1967 U.S. Open in Miami (then called the All-Star Tournament) and, the same year, he bowled a 300 game at the USBC Classic team tournament \u2014 the first perfect game in a pro bowling team event.\n\n\u201cI could make adjustments to how and where I\u2019d throw the ball,\u201d Schissler told The Denver Post in 2010. \u201cI heard from a lot of people that I was the most accurate bowler they had seen.\u201d\n\nSchissler was inducted into the USBC Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\nFellow hall of famer Carmen Salvino said of Schissler:\n\n\u201cIf the (lane) condition ever called for bowling from the corner of the lane, he was unbeatable. He had one of the classic styles in the sport and was very accurate.\u201d\n\nSchissler, who served in the U.S. Navy, was born in Brighton and graduated from Brighton High. A cause of death was not immediately known.
