Jewish Community Center\u2019s 27th \u201cD25\u201d service day, providing people from a variety of faiths a chance to give back during the holiday.\n\nDavid Sacks and his wife and two children led a group of about 15 volunteers in song during a Christmas party at St. Elizabeths Hospital, the District\u2019s public psychiatric facility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very personally meaningful for me,\u201d said Mr. Sacks, of Chevy Chase, who works as a psychologist.\n\nOver the last five years, Mr. Sacks said, the hospital party has become a Christmas tradition the entire family looks forward to \u2014 with the group belting out classics like the \u201c12 Days of Christmas\u201d and \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Jewish people who like to sing Christmas songs \u2014 and I\u2019m one of them \u2014 this is a great opportunity,\u201d said Mr. Sacks, 58, who donned a bright green sweater and a red Santa Claus hat.\n\nAt the D.C. Central Union Mission, church groups also volunteered on Christmas to serve meals to the homeless at the charity\u2019s new kitchen and housing facility near Union Station.\n\nIn his Christmas address, President Obama touched on the variety of ways that Americans can give back to their communities, including organizing food or clothing drives and buying gifts for needy children.\n\n\u201cFor families like ours, that service is a chance to celebrate the birth of Christ and live out what He taught us \u2014 to love our neighbors as we would ourselves; to feed the hungry and look after the sick; to be our brother\u2019s keeper and our sister\u2019s keeper,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the radio address. \u201cAnd for all of us as Americans, regardless of our faith, those are values that can drive us to be better parents and friends, better neighbors and better citizens.\u201d\n\nFor longtime friends Meredith Lair and Liz Marshall, who volunteered through the Jewish Community Center to visit a local nursing home and women\u2019s shelter, it also was just downright fun. Decked out in green-and-red attire and jingle bell earrings, the pair volunteered as elves to accompany Santa Claus as he handed out gifts to children and seniors along his route.\n\n\u201cI got a lot more out of it than I put into it today,\u201d said Ms. Lair, a 41-year-old from Alexandria. \u201cIt was a great way to spend a day with my best friend.\u201d\n\nWith more than 60 different service projects spread across the city and into Maryland and Virginia, JCC Director of Community Engagement Erica Steen said there is an opportunity for everyone.\n\nProjects included painting the interior of a health center in Silver Spring, assembling safe sex kits to be provided to sex workers, and cooking meals for the homeless. Children also could get involved with projects such as card-making, with the finished products distributed by workers at events throughout the day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hundreds of people in the District spent Christmas helping those in need \u2014 embodying President Obama's call to community service and spreading holiday cheer throughout the area.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hundreds of people in the District spent Christmas helping those in need \u2014 embodying President Obama\u2019s call to community service and spreading holiday cheer throughout the area.", "title": "D.C.-area residents answer call to service by helping needy on Christmas", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/25/dc-area-residents-answer-call-to-service-by-helpin/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/25/12252013_homeless-0001-122518201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/25/12252013_homeless-0001-122518201.jpg", "description": "Hundreds of people in the District spent Christmas helping those in need \u2014 embodying President Obama's call to community service and spreading holiday cheer throughout the area.", "card": "summary", "title": "D.C.-area residents answer call to service by helping needy on Christm"}, "Author": "Andrea Noble", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Jewish Community Center, Christmas, David Sacks"}, "article_summary": "Hundreds of people in the District spent Christmas helping those in need \u2014 embodying President Obama\u2019s call to community service and spreading holiday cheer throughout the area.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very personally meaningful for me,\u201d said Mr. Sacks, of Chevy Chase, who works as a psychologist.\nAbout 1,000 people volunteered for service projects through the D.C.
