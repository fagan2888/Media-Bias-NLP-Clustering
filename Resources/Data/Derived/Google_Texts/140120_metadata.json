His campaign went so far as to offer amnesty from prosecution for individuals whose wealth was gained illegally \u2013 something true of a significant segment of Russia\u2019s richest citizens.\n\nAt the time, the plea was aimed at exploiting the patriotic feeling of wealthy Russians \u2013 it was time to bring Russian money back home to strengthen the economy. Apparently, though, appealing to the patriotism of oligarchs and members of organized criminal groups didn\u2019t work, because on Thursday, Putin had to renew his request. This time, he appealed to naked self-interest.\n\nRelated: Putin Takes His Wacky War Games One Step Further\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of representatives of Russia\u2019s largest businesses, Putin warned that unless wealthy Russians with overseas holdings repatriate their money now, they face the risk of having their funds frozen. He pointed out that the United States and its allies have been applying increasingly harsh financial sanctions on Russia as a result of its invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula last year and its continued military support of an armed rebellion in the eastern part of Ukraine.\n\nTo be fair, Putin has a point. The West has increasingly cracked down on the ability of many wealthy Russians to move money around the globe, and even on their ability to travel personally.\n\nHowever, the call for repatriation of Russian wealth likely has little to do with Putin\u2019s concern for the finances of his richest constituents and a whole lot to do with the fact that Russia has experienced massive capital flight in the past year. Some $150 billion in capital was transferred out of the Russian economy in 2014, as the ruble lost its value, interest rates soared, and international investors began treating the country as a de facto pariah state.\n\nUntil now, Russia\u2019s wealthiest have decided that keeping their money abroad at the risk of it being frozen there was a more acceptable gamble than bringing it back home and having it locked into an economy that is likely to tumble into severe recession, if not outright depression, in the next year.\n\nRelated: Putin Comes Out of the Shadows \u2013 With a Bang\n\nGiven the current state of affairs in Russia, it\u2019s hard to see how that calculus could have changed, even for the most legally endangered of Russia\u2019s wealthy.\n\nIt is actually hard to overstate how explicit Putin was late last year in urging criminals to repatriate their funds. At the time, he said, \u201cI propose a full amnesty for capital returning to Russia. I stress -- full amnesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat if a person legalizes his holdings and property in Russia, he will receive firm legal guarantees that he will not be summoned to various agencies, including law enforcement agencies that they will not \u2018put the squeeze\u2019 on him. That he will not be asked about the sources of his capital and methods of its acquisition. That he will not be prosecuted or face administrative liability, and that he will not be questioned by the tax service or law enforcement agencies.\n\nRelated: With Putin Still Missing, Things Get Weird in Russia\n\n\u201cWe all understand that the sources of assets are different, that they were earned or acquired in various ways. However, I am confident that we should finally close, turn the \u2018offshore page\u2019 in the history of our economy and our country. It is very important and necessary to do this.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, according to the Associated Press, he added a caveat to his call for capital repatriation, saying that money returning to Russia would have to be transferred in compliance with international money laundering rules to avoid the movement of \u201ccapital earned in an illegal manner.\u201d\n\nThat said, much of the money in question has already been laundered, so for many wealthy Russians with assets of dubious origin, worries about criminal prosecution aren\u2019t a big concern. Worries about the future of the Russian economy, however, are. And for that reason, it\u2019s not likely that Putin\u2019s pleas will result in an influx of capital to his struggling economy.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin renewed his call for Russia\u2019s oligarchs \u2013 those who became millionaires and billionaires after Russia\u2019s state-owned industries were privatized \u2013 to bring their money home.
