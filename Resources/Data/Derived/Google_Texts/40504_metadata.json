The interior minister of Saxony, Markus Ulbig, condemned the \"cowardly and cold-blooded attack,\" the German news agency dpa reported.\n\nIn Sehnde near Hannover, a 43-year-old man was detained for allegedly committing an arson attack on a home of a refugee family early Sunday.

Late Wednesday, a wooden sailboat sank off the coast of Skala, killing at least 30 people. Dozens of others from the boat were believed to be still missing.\n\nThe number of smuggling boats crossing over to Greece from the nearby Turkish coast fell Sunday as strong winds raked the eastern Aegean Sea, but fishermen in Skala towed two stranded dinghies to safety.\n\n___\n\n2:05 p.m.\n\nGermany's governing coalition has not been able to agree on how to process migrants near the country's border who have no realistic chance of gaining asylum.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman said Merkel's meeting Sunday on the migrant surge with, Horst Seehofer, the head of Bavaria's Christian Social Union, part of Merkel's Union bloc, and Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, a center-left Social Democrat, ended without finding a solution for the \"transit zones.\"\n\nSeehofer wants border \"transit zones\" to weed out applicants who have little chance of winning asylum in Germany. But Gabriel has said his Social Democrats won't agree to a plan that could keep large numbers of people in custody at the border while their applications are processed.\n\nMerkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said the talks would resume Thursday.\n\n___\n\n1:20 p.m.\n\nPolice say two Syrian asylum seekers were beaten with baseball bats by several masked attackers in the eastern German town of Wismar on the Baltic Sea.\n\nPolice in nearby Rostock said Sunday that the Syrian men, who were not identified, were standing outside their shelter on Saturday night when the group started harassing and beating them. The attackers then fled and the two asylum seekers had to be taken to the hospital and treated for their injuries.\n\nPolice have not been able to track down or identify the attackers yet and did not say how many people were involved in the attack.\n\nAttacks against asylum-seekers and migrant shelters have increased sharply in Germany in recent months as refugees surge into Europe.\n\n___\n\n12:55 p.m.\n\nGreek authorities say 11 more people have drown on the dangerous crossing from Turkey to Greece after a boat carrying nearly 30 refugees sank in heavy seas near the eastern island of Samos.\n\nA Greek Coast Guard spokeswoman says the victims Sunday include five women, four babies and two children.
