Two people were shot and wounded, one critically, early Saturday in Bend, Oregon, police said.

The region’s SWAT stream was called out to hunt for three suspects, two of whom were in custody. The lengthy operation has prompted the closure of Newport and Milwaukie avenues.

Officers responded at 2:41 a.m. to a report of several gunshots in the area, said Lt. Clint Burleigh. Two people were found wounded by gunfire.

Police “quickly assessed the situation and found the suspects were related to the address at 1473 NW Newport,” Burleigh said in a news release.

Bend Fire and Rescue medics responded to attend to the injured people and take them to St. Charles Bend for treatment, he said. At the time of a news release, shortly before 9 a.m., one was in critical condition.

Oregon State Police and the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Offices responded initially to assist in the incident.

Burleigh said three suspects have been contacted, and the Central Oregon Emergency Response Team responded “and are handling the tactical situation involving locating and arresting the suspects.”

“The Central Oregon Major Incident Team has been activated and will be investigating this for a substantial period of time,” Burleigh wrote.

Due to the ongoing police activity, Northwest Newport Avenue was closed between College Way and 14th Street, and Milwaukie Avenue between 14th and 15th streets. Police urged people to stay out of the area until the operation is completed.

Even with two of three suspects arrested, Burleigh said police were unsure all involved have been identified and contacted. As a result, Burleigh said the “anticipation is this incident will last for several hours and there is no time frame when the blocked streets will be reopened. Please take this information into consideration when you plan your routes today.”

The Major Incident Team includes all federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in the region.
