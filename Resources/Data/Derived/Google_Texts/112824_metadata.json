The GOP has its own designs for 2014, hoping to paint Democrats as a party whose promises of jobs, effective government and affordable health care have all fallen flat.\n\nNone of those critiques were on display Friday evening, as Obama rallied the party faithful at a Democratic National Committee summit. Instead, Obama rattled off a list of issues where he said Republicans were stuck in the past: gay rights, women\u2019s equality, wages and health care, to name a few.\n\n\u201cWhat they are offering is not a new theory,\u201d Obama said, asserting that Republicans had advocated the same policies in the run-up to the Great Depression, the recent recession and the 2012 election. \u201cAnd the American people said, \u201cNo, thanks.'\u201d\n\nIn a boisterous and decidedly partisan speech, Obama seized the opportunity to mock Republicans \u2014 to the delight of the Democratic officials, donors and activists who packed a hotel ballroom near the White House. While acknowledging early setbacks in rolling out his health care law, Obama ridiculed his political foes for trying time and again to repeal the law.\n\n\u201cYou know what they say: Fiftieth time is the charm,\u201d Obama said to laughter. \u201cMaybe when you hit your 50th repeal vote you will win a prize.\u201d\n\nRiffing on women\u2019s rights and the GOP, Obama quipped: \u201cThis isn\u2019t 1954. It\u2019s 2014.\u201d\n\nSuch partisan rhetoric from the president had the desired effect of revving up members of his party, some of whom are openly fretting that the unpopular health law, Obama\u2019s low approval ratings and historical trends could all work in Republicans\u2019 favor this year.\n\nBut it also served as a clear reminder that the encroaching election, with all the political posturing it will bring, augers poorly for anything Obama wants to accomplish with Congress this year. After all, 2014 offers Obama potentially the last opportunity to secure legislative achievements before attention turns to the 2016 presidential election and Obama\u2019s successor.\n\n\u201cObviously, this is an election year. But an election that\u2019s eight months away shouldn\u2019t stop us from making progress right now,\u201d Obama said, echoing his State of the Union refrain that he\u2019ll work with Congress whenever possible but will act unilaterally to expand economic opportunity however he can.\n\nRepublican National Committee Reince Priebus said Americans are still waiting for the opportunity and jobs that Obama keeps talking about. He pointed to Obama\u2019s proposed minimum wage hike and health care law as examples of policies that do nothing to help Americans who are out of work.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to give up on the speeches that include a lot of promises but not a lot of action,\u201d Priebus said.\n\nObama has committed to holding nearly three dozen fundraisers for Democratic political committees by the middle of 2014 \u2014 including an eye-popping 18 events for the DNC, whose millions of dollars of lingering debt more than a year after the last presidential election has Democrats fretting.\n\nIn a twist from previous midterms, Obama will even headline fundraisers for super PACs, which he once disparaged but has more recently embraced, arguing Democrats mustn\u2019t be steamrolled by GOP outside groups even if the flood of largely unregulated donations leaves a bitter taste for those who hunger for cleaner American elections.\n\nAnd as Democratic incumbents seek to position themselves for the election, Obama\u2019s aides are working with Democratic leaders in the Senate and House to coordinate votes that will bolster the themes they\u2019ll be pressing during the campaign, said a White House official, who would speak only on condition of anonymity to discuss internal Democratic deliberations. Obama also plans to do what he can to boost Democratic turnout, while his campaign\u2019s vaunted voter data and technology will be made available to all 2014 candidates, the official said.\n\nAt the DNC\u2019s winter meeting, Obama said that numerically, if Democrats show up at the polls in full force, their candidates will succeed. \u201cWhen Democrats vote, we win,\u201d he said. But he warned that Republicans are counting on traditionally low turnout by Democrats in midterm years.\n\nUrging Democrats not to cede the argument on issues where they believe Americans are on their side, Obama pointed to recent legislation in Arizona that was trumpeted as promoting religious freedom but criticized by others as discriminating against gays. He said Democrats know that freedom means being able to shop in a store or restaurant without facing discrimination over who you are or who you love.\n\n\u201cAs Democrats, we\u2019ve let the other side define the word \u2018freedom\u2019 for too long,\u201d Obama said.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.
