Mike Pence plans to talk with Barack Obama about the state\u2019s low-income health care plan while the president is in Indiana on Friday for a speech about the economy.\n\nPence sent a request for a private meeting to the White House on Thursday morning, just a day before Obama is schedule to fly into Evansville and then travel to Princeton for an event at Millennium Steel Services.\n\nA White House official said the \u201cpresident looks forward to seeing Gov. Pence tomorrow when he arrives in Evansville.\u201d But the official did not confirm a private meeting.\n\nPence, a Republican, said he wants to tell the Democratic president the state is ready to expand health care to more low-income Hoosiers but can\u2019t move forward without permission from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Pence said negotiations with the federal agency have been ongoing.\n\n\u201cWe have been increasingly frustrated with a lack of progress in those discussions,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to take the opportunity I have tomorrow to call that to the president\u2019s personal attention.\u201d\n\nPence had already announced he intended to greet Obama when Air Force One arrives in Evansville. But he also requested a private meeting to talk about HIP 2.0, the name Pence has given to his proposed expansion of the existing Healthy Indiana Plan, which could cover as many as 350,000 uninsured Hoosiers.\n\nThe plan would replace a traditional Medicaid expansion called for by the federal Affordable Care Act. All non-disabled adults ages 19-64 who earn between 23 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty level would be eligible. In 2014, that means a maximum income of $16,105 annually for an individual and $32,913 for a family of four.\n\nBut federal officials have questions about the proposal, which calls for participants to pay some of the cost of the coverage or the care.\n\n\u201cIssues have arisen and I intend to call those to the president\u2019s attention and ask for his help in giving the state of Indiana the flexibility to build on the Healthy Indiana Plan,\u201d Pence said. \u201cI want to make a very respectful case to the president that we\u2019d like to expand coverage in Indiana but we want to do it the Indiana way.\u201d\n\nThe White House official said federal leaders will continue talking with Indiana and other states and that \u201cexpanding Medicaid is critically important.\u201d More than two dozen states and the District of Columbus have expanded Medicaid.\n\nPence already had plans next week to meet with CMS Secretary Sylvia Burwell to discuss what he called \u201cdisagreement over principle and policy.\u201d The plan requires participants to make contributions \u2013 matched by the state \u2013 to an account that is used to pay for care. The contributions, which are essentially premiums, vary depending on income. Once the account runs dry, a more traditional insurance plan kicks in.\n\nMedicaid doesn\u2019t require participants to make co-pays or pay premiums and federal officials have been reluctant to approve a plan that includes those elements. But Pence said the Obama administration has twice OK\u2019d the state\u2019s use of the Healthy Indiana Plan on a more limited basis.\n\n\u201cMy message is that HIP 2.0 is not an idea, it\u2019s a program,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been working with great success for Hoosiers.\u201d\n\nLesley Weidenbener is executive editor of TheStatehouseFile.com, a news website powered by Franklin College journalism students.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2"}, "article_summary": "Mike Pence plans to talk with Barack Obama about the state\u2019s low-income health care plan while the president is in Indiana on Friday for a speech about the economy.\nBut Pence said the Obama administration has twice OK\u2019d the state\u2019s use of the Healthy Indiana Plan on a more limited basis.\n\u201cIssues have arisen and I intend to call those to the president\u2019s attention and ask for his help in giving the state of Indiana the flexibility to build on the Healthy Indiana Plan,\u201d Pence said.\nPence tomorrow when he arrives in Evansville.\u201d But the official did not confirm a private meeting.\nThe plan would replace a traditional Medicaid expansion called for by the federal Affordable Care Act."}
