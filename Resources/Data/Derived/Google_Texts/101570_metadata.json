The law now requires that prescription drug coverage be included with the plans offered in the individual- and small-group markets under the ACA. But out-of-pocket fees for these prescriptions are higher than previously.\n\n\n\nClare Krusing, spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said Thursday the reform adds new benefits and new costs to coverage, and the plans must cover a mandated number of services.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs all those benefits and costs are added to coverage,\u201d Krusing said. \u201cThat does make coverage more expensive. It\u2019s more comprehensive and more expensive than what some people may have been purchasing previously.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe study found that of the people who enrolled in the online health care exchanges, those who use multiple prescription drugs will be most noticeably affected by the fee increases, compared to individuals who do not take medications frequently.\n\n\n\nJosie Martin, executive vice president of public affairs for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said Thursday she fears the rising costs for patients who rely on prescriptions could diminish advancements in health care. As examples, she cited reductions in heart attacks, expensive hospitalizations, expensive bills, loss of work and trauma to families.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn chronic conditions like heart [disease] or diabetes, where there are medications to manage conditions, we\u2019re really concerned that all of the progress that\u2019s been made in the last 10 years could be lost,\u201d Martin said. \u201cPeople are going to have trouble adhering to their medications if they are out of reach financially.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen patients are confronted with higher copays and coinsurance fees, they might not fill their prescriptions. According to Martin, people who are prescribed drugs that could \u201ckeep them out of expensive hospitalization situations, and keep them at work, and with their families, and keep them alive\u201d might be deterred by the higher costs.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t afford it, it makes it very difficult for them to know what they are supposed to do,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about people not taking their medications.\u201d\n\nHealth care costs have jumped partially because prescription drug prices are rising, Krusing said, which is \u201cputting a burden on patients.\u201d\n\n\n\nHealth plans have focused on providing access to medications, and the rise of generic drugs has saved millions of dollars for consumers, Krusing said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole package of promoting prevention and wellness, and making sure that patients have access to medication that they need\u2026 [and] that they can stick with a routine that is safe, effective and affordable for them,\u201d Krusing said.\n\n\n\nHowever, the pharmaceutical industry views the hikes in out-of-pocket fees as a conceivable threat to a patient\u2019s access to \u201ccutting edge medicine,\u201d according to Martin.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our big concern,\u201d Martin said, \u201cpeople\u2019s access to the medication that they\u2019re currently taking, and access to what they might need down the road, because you never know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe true impact of higher copays and coinsurance fees \u2013 on the health care industry, the pharmaceutical industry and patients \u2013 remains unknown. But as people fill prescriptions and switch to new plans, anecdotal information and data will become available over time, Martin said.\n\n\n\nThe open enrollment period to register for plans in the online marketplaces continues until the March 31 deadline.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe031e\"", "article_summary": "Copayments and coinsurance fees have increased 34 percent under the ACA, according to a recent study from HealthPocket, an unaffiliated research company that provides health-plan comparisons.\n\u201cPeople are going to have trouble adhering to their medications if they are out of reach financially.\u201dWhen patients are confronted with higher copays and coinsurance fees, they might not fill their prescriptions.\nBut out-of-pocket fees for these prescriptions are higher than previously.\nHowever, the pharmaceutical industry views the hikes in out-of-pocket fees as a conceivable threat to a patient\u2019s access to \u201ccutting edge medicine,\u201d according to Martin.\nAs examples, she cited reductions in heart attacks, expensive hospitalizations, expensive bills, loss of work and trauma to families."}
