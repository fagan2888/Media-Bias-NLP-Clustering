The FBI was notified of the robbery in case there was evidence of crimes across state lines, but the agency isn't investigating the case.\n\nAround 6:30 p.m. Saturday, an officer patrolling the area at 1202 N. Berkley Blvd. saw two men run out of the store pushing a shopping cart full of merchandise. They emptied the cart into a vehicle's trunk and drove away, police said.\n\nThe officer followed the vehicle, and the men were arrested after trying to escape, police said.\n\nYudesh Ruplal, 21, Shane Ali, 22, Benjamin Curtis, 18, and Alexandre Michel Regis, 20, are accused of stealing 565 plumbing supplies worth more than $5,000, according to court records.\n\nAuthorities said they believe the men planned to resell the items. Investigators are looking into the possiblity that the men have hit other Lowe's stores as well.\n\nBond was set at $500,000 for each man due to flight risk concerns, according to Wayne County District Judge David Brantley.\n\nAnyone with information about the case is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 919-735-2255 or text at 919-222-4230. Callers will remain anonymous. Crime Stoppers gives cash rewards of up to $1,000 for information leading to felony arrests.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-12-13 07:49:00", "description": "Goldsboro police arrested four men from New York on Saturday and charged them with felony larceny after an officer spotted them leaving a Lowe's Home Improvement store with hundreds of plumbing supplies, police said.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-12-14 18:50:34", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=15174669|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Goldsboro police arrested four men from New York on Saturday and charged them with felony larceny after an officer spotted them leaving a Lowe's Home Improvement store with hundreds of plumbing supplies, police said.", "title": "Four NY men accused of stealing plumbing supplies from Goldsboro Lowe's :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/four-ny-men-accused-of-larceny-at-goldsboro-lowe-s-fbi-investigating/15174669/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2015/12/13/15175059/15175059-1450031128-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-13T07:49:00-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Goldsboro police arrested four men from New York on Saturday and charged them with felony larceny after an officer spotted them leaving a Lowe's Home Improvement store with hundreds of plumbing supplies, police said.", "title": "Four NY men accused of stealing plumbing supplies from Goldsboro Lowe's :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/four-ny-men-accused-of-larceny-at-goldsboro-lowe-s-fbi-investigating/15174669/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2015/12/13/15175059/15175059-1450031128-646x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "Yudesh Ruplal, 21, Shane Ali, 22, Benjamin Curtis, 18, and Alexandre Michel Regis, 20, are accused of stealing 565 plumbing supplies worth more than $5,000, according to court records.\nInvestigators are looking into the possiblity that the men have hit other Lowe's stores as well.\nThe officer followed the vehicle, and the men were arrested after trying to escape, police said.\nsaw two men run out of the store pushing a shopping cart full of merchandise.\nAnyone with information about the case is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 919-735-2255 or text at 919-222-4230."}
