And it\u2019s why a new homeless center announced last week is very good news indeed.\n\nSurveys count roughly 350 unsheltered homeless people on the 16th Street Mall every night, according to Denver\u2019s Road Home director Bennie Milliner.\n\nIn a recent meeting with The Denver Post\u2019s editorial board, Milliner also said shelters had seen more occupants than ever before during the summer.\n\nThe problem reflects the continuing reverberation of the Great Recession. Some believe it is also due to the number of transients flowing into Colorado because of its lax marijuana laws, though no one knows for sure.\n\nNine years ago, John Hickenlooper, then Denver\u2019s mayor, set a bold yet unattainable goal of ending homelessness in Denver by 2015. Clearly, that is not going to happen, but the city has made advances. In 2005, there were 942 chronically homeless people counted in Denver. This year, there are 577.\n\nIt is one of the city\u2019s toughest problems. Faced with the tightest and most expensive housing market in its history, the city is trying to figure out how to find services and housing options for people who are struggling.\n\nFor two years, Mayor Michael Hancock has promised a 24-hour, rest and resource center for the homeless but was blocked by communities that didn\u2019t want such a facility in their backyards.\n\nLast week, the city announced a modified facility, calling it a \u201csolutions center.\u201d It is based on a successful model from Seattle and will be a place where homeless people can get referrals for services. It will provide behavioral health services for people in crisis and can serve as an alternative to jail or allow people to detox overnight.\n\nIt is a good solution to a vexing problem. But in the uptick of homelessness, it is just one more piece.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "A step forward on Denver\u2019s homeless problem", "title": "A step forward on Denver\u2019s homeless problem", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/07/a-step-forward-on-denvers-homeless-problem/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141107__homelessp1.jpg", "height": 509}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141107__homelessp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-07T17:22:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:58:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6cbc\"", "article_summary": "Denver\u2019s homeless problem is increasing, there is no doubt about that.\nAnd it\u2019s why a new homeless center announced last week is very good news indeed.\nSurveys count roughly 350 unsheltered homeless people on the 16th Street Mall every night, according to Denver\u2019s Road Home director Bennie Milliner.\nNine years ago, John Hickenlooper, then Denver\u2019s mayor, set a bold yet unattainable goal of ending homelessness in Denver by 2015.\nIt is seen in the booming occupancy in shelters, in the motels filled with families and people on the streets."}
