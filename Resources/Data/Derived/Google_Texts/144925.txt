UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. -- The Student Health Insurance Task Force has posted information regarding student health insurance, the Affordable Care Act and rich benchmarking data to a new website. The site, found at http://sites.psu.edu/tfonshi/ online, also includes a form for submission of ideas, comments and questions to the task force.



A new FAQ posted to the site includes detailed information about the reasons the plan cost and benefits are changing; how the Aetna contract compares to other student health plans; what the University has done so far to mitigate the impact of the changes; and other topics.



Updates will be posted to the site as new information becomes available.



The Student Health Insurance Task Force was charged on April 29 by Nick Jones, executive vice president and provost, and is chaired by Dennis Shea, professor of health policy and administration and associate dean for undergraduate studies and outreach in the College of Health and Human Development.



Premium rates and benefits for the student health insurance plan for 2014-15 were finalized on May 13. For details, visit http://news.psu.edu/story/316395/2014/05/20/student-health-insurance-con... online.
