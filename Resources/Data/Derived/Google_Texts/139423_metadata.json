It\u2019s amazing. And yet we are fighting what? ISIS and al Qaeda.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting these wars against these organizations and their carbon footprint has got to be like 1 percent of our huge Army and our Navy and all of this stuff that have with all our big machines,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re doing more damage to the earth with our wars. And you try to find out? Hey, freedom! No freedom. You don\u2019t get it. You can\u2019t find out what that carbon footprint is of the military. It\u2019s not available for us.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: These pro-gun celebrities may shock you\n\nMr. Stern asked the famed musician if he is upset about what\u2019s going on in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t like war and I, you know, I think it\u2019s all about energy. In the end, it\u2019s all about energy. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. And it\u2019s going to be about water, because we\u2019re using it all up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ought to just start getting smart and use what we have: renewable energy. There\u2019s energy from the sun. Hello? It\u2019s right there. You go outside and if you don\u2019t wear a hat, you can burn a hole in your head. There\u2019s something there.
