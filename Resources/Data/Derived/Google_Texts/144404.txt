PERFORMING ARTS

"I Hate Hamlet" A rising Hollywood star accepts the role of Hamlet at New York's Shakespeare in the Park and his agent thinks he's gone daft. Why would he trade a fluffy, big-money TV role for dusty old Shakespeare? Leave it to the ghost of actor John Barrymore, the quintessential Hamlet of the 20th century, to hilariously haunt Andy in a play that seeks to answer that question, 7:30 p.m., University Theatre, 261 Ucb, Boulder, tickets start at $23; 303-492-8008.

"The Merry Wives of Windsor" Falstaff, one of Shakespeare's most enduring comic characters, is at the heart of one of the Bard's greatest laugh-out-loud farces. Pursuing the amorous attentions of two married English ladies, the pompous, rotund knight doesn't let their mischievous pranking swerve him from his quest. Sure, he's been punk'd, but surely it's a sign of affection, 8 p.m., Mary Rippon Outdoor Theatre, University of Colorado, Boulder, tickets start at $18; 303-492-0554.
