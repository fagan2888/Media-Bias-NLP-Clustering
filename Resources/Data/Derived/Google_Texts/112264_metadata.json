That means the plan will not actually be voted on by the House and won't be as specific as a bill would be, making it harder to assess factors like the cost of the plan or how it will affect the number of people with coverage.\n\nThe document of ideas is expected to be released \"in the next couple weeks,\" House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said Wednesday at an event hosted by The Hill.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Hey, guess what guys!
