The ordinance also details an inspection schedule, required maintenance including landscaping, pool upkeep, door and window repair, among other items.\n\nThe city joined neighboring cities which have adopted ordinances establishing a registration and maintenance program for properties in foreclosure prior to them becoming abandoned. The database will also include properties already sitting empty.\n\nBarbara Geach, neighborhood relations manager for Henderson, said the registry will \u201cimprove and stabilize our neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nThe ordinance establishing the registry was approved by the City Council on Tuesday.\n\nThe registry will provide the city with contact information for the homeowner, bank, mortgage company or management company. The city currently does not have a clear number of how many homes sit vacant, or where they all are located.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times code enforcement waste a lot of their time running around trying to figure out who is responsible,\u201d Geach told the council Tuesday. \u201cThis would require real-time contact information so we know who to deal with.\u201d\n\nGeach said city officials won\u2019t have to wait for a citizen\u2019s complaint that a house is falling into disarray or a pool is turning green before acting. Without the registry, code enforcement is tasked with securing the home or cleaning up a yard of an abandoned home if an owner or lender cannot be located. The city will send a bill to the lender or owner if they are located.\n\nThe registry will enable the city to work with whoever owns the home in foreclosure before it falls into disrepair.\n\nBy improving the overall appearance of abandoned homes, the value of the homes and surrounding property values will be preserved and public safety will be improved, according to city officials.\n\n\u201cHomes have to be secure,\u201d Geach said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have abandoned homes that have broken windows and doors that don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nWhoever holds the mortgage to a vacant house in foreclosure, whether a bank or a private lender, must register the property with the city\u2019s Community Development Services Department.\n\nThe fee will be $200 for initial property registration and $50 to change the contact information. A Nevada-based licensed property manager must be hired by the lender to inspect the property monthly. A $200 fee will be collected annually while the property remains on the registry.\n\nFailure to comply could result in a $150-per-day fine and a misdemeanor citation issued by city Code Enforcement. The registry website will be operated by a third party that will bid for the contract, city spokesman Keith Paul said. The registry should be operational in 90 days.\n\nMayor Andy Hafen said the city has received 90 percent voluntary compliance from banks and private lenders when contacted by the city so he doesn\u2019t anticipate a lot of fines through the registry.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing we get from this ordinance is that at least we have a responsible person now that we can go to with real-time issues then,\u201d Hafen said.\n\nGeach said Las Vegas and North Las Vegas have not had to issue fines to gain compliance.\n\nLas Vegas started a foreclosure registry in December 2011, and 5,113 properties have been registered, generating $741,800 in fees for the city. North Las Vegas, which adopted its ordinance in December 2012, did not return a request for its numbers.\n\nNearly 2,130 properties, or one in 644 homes, in Henderson are currently in various stages of foreclosure including default, auction or bank owned, according to Realty Trac Inc. By comparison, one in every 628 homes in Las Vegas and one in every 343 homes in North Las Vegas are in foreclosure.\n\nJoe Locatelli, spokesman for the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors, asked the Henderson City Council not to hold property managers liable for fines.\n\n\u201cWe believe that property managers, by virtue of having no ownership interest to the property they are managing, should not be held liable in this ordinance,\u201d he said.\n\nCity Attorney Josh Reid said the purpose of the ordinance is not to go after property managers but to have a local contact who can be reached if there is a blighted home.\n\n\u201cThe point is not to get a hammer,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a homeowners association that issues fines by the week and then sends a collection agency. That\u2019s not the history of our enforcement.\u201d\n\nHafen said the property manager would probably \u201ctake care of business and come in compliance\u201d or remove itself from working for the property owner if the owner doesn\u2019t cooperate.\n\nThe mayor directed city officials to give the City Council a status update on the registry in a year.\n\nContact reporter Arnold M.
