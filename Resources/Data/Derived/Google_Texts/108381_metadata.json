Peterson* Foundation\u2019s 2015 Fiscal Summit, Bloomberg said that in terms of budgeting and spending, \u201cWashington has consistently given us the worst of both worlds. No reform of entitlements that fuel our debt, and precious little investment that fuels our economy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why A New Age of Nuclear Energy Is About to Dawn\n\nNo issue better exemplifies that lack of investment, he said, than transportation infrastructure.\n\nReferring to a recent train crash outside Philadelphia that killed eight people and injured hundreds, Bloomberg said, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a tragic Amtrak accident to put infrastructure at the top of the agenda and yet, even that didn\u2019t do it. This week, the big debate in Congress is whether to patch the highway trust fund for 2 months or 6 months. Talk about setting the bar low.\u201d\n\nInfrastructure development in the U.S\\ has historically been a bipartisan issue on which the federal government took a long view about the utility of investment, Bloomberg said. From the Transcontinental Railroad to the Hoover Dam to the interstate highway system, he said, leaders from both parties have been willing to support the expansion and improvement of infrastructure.\n\nNo longer, Bloomberg said.\n\nRelated: How $5.3 Trillion in Energy Subsidies Damage Economies, Environment\n\n\u201cThe federal government has abdicated the leadership role it long played on infrastructure, and as a result, we\u2019re losing a crucial part of our competitive edge in the global economy and losing out on economic growth that would generate the tax revenue we need to pay for everything else,\u201d he said.\n\nOne need only travel overseas, Bloomberg said, to see that the U.S. is being left behind.\n\n\u201cOther countries are making these investments because they know that businesses will go to the cities that have the best and most extensive transit networks, the deepest, biggest ports, and the most modern and efficient airports,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard anyone disagree with that idea.\u201d\n\nThe plainest example of Washington\u2019s failure to address the issue of funding infrastructure is the gasoline tax, Bloomberg said. \u201cThe case for increasing the tax could not be any clearer. It has been 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993.\u201d\n\nRelated: Restoring the Public\u2019s Trust in Economists\n\nThat\u2019s the longest period in its history that the tax has remained static, and the combination of inflation, more fuel efficient cars, and a plateau in the number of miles driven means that in real terms the tax takes in far less than it used to.\n\nMeanwhile, he said, \u201cOur roads and bridges and transit networks have gotten 22 years older.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cNo CEO in America, and certainly no economist, would look at this investment model without cringing.\u201d\n\nBloomberg was not optimistic about lawmakers at the federal level making the decisions necessary to bring U.S. infrastructure spending up to needed levels, but he did offer an alternative.\n\nRelated: McConnell Says TPA Will Counter Chinese Dominance\n\nPointing out that a number of states, faced with reduced federal funding, have found the political courage to increase their own gas taxes to fund infrastructure, he suggested repurposing the federal Highway Trust Fund by turning it into a matching program that would deliver money to the individual states based on the amount they themselves raise from a gasoline tax, with the condition that the money all be used to fund transportation infrastructure.\n\nIt\u2019s not an ideal solution, he said, because transportation really needs to be coordinated at the federal level \u2013 one key state neglecting its own infrastructure can negate improvements made in a neighboring state, at least when it comes to travel by road.\n\nHowever, he stressed, something needs to be done, and quickly.\n\n\u201cWhile we argue about \u2018American exceptionalism,\u2019 the rest of the world is passing us by,\u201d he said.\n\n*Pete Peterson also funds The Fiscal Times.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When it comes to funding transportation infrastructure, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said, \u201cCongress is doing the bare minimum: Kicking the can down a pothole-filled road.\u201d", "title": "Bloomberg Bashes Congress Over Infrastructure Spending", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/19/Bloomberg-Bashes-Congress-Over-Infrastructure-Spending", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09282011_Bloomberg_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/19/Bloomberg-Bashes-Congress-Over-Infrastructure-Spending", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09282011_Bloomberg_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When it comes to funding transportation infrastructure, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said, \u201cCongress is doing the bare minimum: Kicking the can down a pothole-filled road.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2588\"", "article_summary": "This week, the big debate in Congress is whether to patch the highway trust fund for 2 months or 6 months.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard anyone disagree with that idea.\u201dThe plainest example of Washington\u2019s failure to address the issue of funding infrastructure is the gasoline tax, Bloomberg said.\nTalk about setting the bar low.\u201dInfrastructure development in the U.S\\ has historically been a bipartisan issue on which the federal government took a long view about the utility of investment, Bloomberg said.\nOne need only travel overseas, Bloomberg said, to see that the U.S. is being left behind.\nNo reform of entitlements that fuel our debt, and precious little investment that fuels our economy.\u201dRelated: Why A New Age of Nuclear Energy Is About to DawnNo issue better exemplifies that lack of investment, he said, than transportation infrastructure."}
