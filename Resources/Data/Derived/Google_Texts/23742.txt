GLENDALE, Ariz. — New England running back Jonas Gray was inactive for Sunday’s Super Bowl, the second time in three playoff games he hasn’t played for the Patriots.

Gray was the most notable of the Patriots inactives. He was active for the AFC championship game and had four carries late in the blowout win over the Colts.

The rest of New England inactives were: James White, Jordan Devey, Joe Vellano, Josh Boyce, Brian Tyms and Zach Moore.

Seattle strong safety Kam Chancellor was active and starting after testing out his left knee in pregame. Chancellor fell in practice late in the week, but was listed as probable for the game.

Also inactive for Seattle was backup offensive tackle Garry Gilliam, who caught a 19-yard touchdown on a fake field goal in the NFC championship game.

Other inactives for the Seahawks were: B.J. Daniels, Marcus Burley, Patrick Lewis, Keavon Milton, David King and Kevin Norwood.
