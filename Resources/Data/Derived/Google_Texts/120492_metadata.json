It probably happened case by case, but we encourage local governments to strengthen supervision.\"\n\n\"In 2015, there were 40 cases processed by law enforcement. It is better now. Before farmers were complaining about fertilizer scarcity, now not as much.\"\n\nHasil Sembiring, the ministry's director general of food crops, also said he had not heard of any problems in distribution this year.\n\n\"If it happens, please report it as soon as possible and if possible please report where it happened and when,\" said Sembiring, who is in charge of monitoring crop production and in contact with farmers on issues such as fertilizer distribution.\n\nSome farmers, however, say the situation this year remains pretty much the same as in 2015.\n\n\"We are only getting about half of our subsidized fertilizer,\" farmer Setyarman told Reuters via a translator at his home in Sukoharjo, Central Java - a rice-producing region.\n\n\"Distributors and retailers hold on to their stock and when there is a scarcity they sell it at higher prices that most small farmers can't afford.\"\n\nIn Sukoharjo alone, at least $1.58 million of subsidized fertilizers did not make it to their intended beneficiaries in 2015, according to the report.\n\nLIMITED SUCCESS\n\nThe subsidized fertilizer scheme is Indonesia's biggest farm support program at 30.1 trillion rupiah, accounting for around half of this year's agriculture budget. It allows only small farmers with 2 hectares or less of land to buy government-supported fertilizer at below-market prices.\n\nBut its success has so far been limited as evident from the fact that annual rice crop output has held at around 36 million tonnes since 2011 despite a 60 percent jump in subsidies.\n\nIn fact, last year local rice prices rose 13 percent, versus a 16 percent drop in the Asian benchmark, partly due to the misallocation of subsidized fertilizers. Around 74 percent of Indonesia's 14.14 million rice farming households own less than 1 hectare of farmland, statistics bureau data shows.\n\nState-owned fertilizer company, PT Pupuk, has tried to resolve distribution problems by making subsidized products pink so they are easy to identify, but experts say retailers can easily wash or mix the products to make them the normal white.\n\n\"We work hard to prevent the subsidized fertilizer from going into the wrong hands,\" said company spokesman Wijaya Laksana. \"But ... we simply can't work alone to prevent this from happening again. We need help from local authorities.\"\n\nSubsidized fertilizers are produced by state-owned firms in volumes that are determined by parliament with inputs from farm groups. This is sent to 2,485 distributors and 274 farm cooperatives, who with the help of government officials then decide how much is to be distributed to the 44,000 retailers.\n\nIn Sukoharjo, an employee at government-approved distributor Subur Makmur said retailers were hiking prices of subsidized fertilizers to cover \"operational costs\".\n\nFor rice farmer Setyarman, the increasing cost of fertilizer means fending for himself to ensure a good harvest. \"Our only alternative now is to use organic fertilizer that we make ourselves.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Michael Taylor and Fergus Jensen, reporting by Randy Fabi in Sukoharjo and Bernadette Christina Munthe in Jakarta; Editing by Himani Sarkar)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SUKOHARJO/JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Millions of dollars worth of subsidized ferti", "title": "Subsidy sham: Fertilizers reach Indonesia plantations, not small farmers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/14/Subsidy-sham-Fertilizers-reach-Indonesia-plantations-not-small-farmers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/indonesia-fertilizers_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/14/Subsidy-sham-Fertilizers-reach-Indonesia-plantations-not-small-farmers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/indonesia-fertilizers_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SUKOHARJO/JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Millions of dollars worth of subsidized ferti", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0798\"", "article_summary": "It allows only small farmers with 2 hectares or less of land to buy government-supported fertilizer at below-market prices.\n\"We work hard to prevent the subsidized fertilizer from going into the wrong hands,\" said company spokesman Wijaya Laksana.\nSubsidized fertilizers are produced by state-owned firms in volumes that are determined by parliament with inputs from farm groups.\nIn Sukoharjo, an employee at government-approved distributor Subur Makmur said retailers were hiking prices of subsidized fertilizers to cover \"operational costs\".\n\"Distributors and retailers hold on to their stock and when there is a scarcity they sell it at higher prices that most small farmers can't afford.\""}
