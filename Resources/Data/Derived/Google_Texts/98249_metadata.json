So maybe it\u2019s not surprising she has a disturbing Bill Cosby story to tell.\n\nIn a powerful new essay in Vanity Fair, model Beverly Johnson says that in the mid-\u201980s, she was contacted by Bill Cosby\u2019s people about doing a small role on his sitcom. She says he was charming and supportive when she met him \u2013 until a meeting in his home set off her alarm bells. \u201cCosby said he wanted to see how I handled various scenes,\u201d she writes, \u201cso he suggested that I pretend to be drunk. (When did a pregnant woman ever appear drunk on \u2018The Cosby Show\u2019? Probably never, but I went with it.)\u201d Then, she says, he made her a cappuccino and \u201cwouldn\u2019t let it go\u201d when she initially refused \u2014 so she obliged. Here\u2019s where she says it gets really bad. Johnson admits that as a disco-era model, she knew her way around recreational substances. A few sips, and she says she could tell: \u201cI\u2019d been drugged \u2014 and drugged good.\u201d\n\nJohnson goes on to describe feeling woozy and her speech becoming slurred, while the comic meanwhile \u201cput his hands around my waist.\u201d That\u2019s when she says she went into \u201d automatic-survival mode\u201d and cursed him out. The rest, she says, is a blur, but as she recalls it, Cosby \u201cyanked all 110 pounds of me down a bunch of stairs,\u201d took her outside and put her in a taxi. She says she doesn\u2019t remember how she got home, and that the effects of the experience took a few days to wear off.\n\nJohnson confesses that though she considered confronting Cosby about the incident, she didn\u2019t. \u201cHow could I fight someone that boldly arrogant and out of touch?\u201d she says, \u201cIn the end, just like the other women, I had too much to lose to go after Bill Cosby.\u201d But now she says, \u201cas so many women have shared similar stories,\u201d she\u2019s been emboldened to do likewise.\n\nJohnson\u2019s anecdote is not as dramatic as many of the others that have thus far been heard \u2013 and continue to emerge. She does not claim to have been sexually assaulted or even really harassed. (Not that a claim that he drugged her is a small thing.) Her instincts and her memory about what happened to her with Cosby 30 years ago may be incorrect \u2013 that could, after all, have been an innocent, untainted beverage he handed her, and her reaction may have been unrelated. And by her own admission, she made a choice to stay silent for decades. Yet Johnson brings to the conversation yet another element \u2014 because she may be its most reliable source yet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former supermodel reveals a now familiar encounter", "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former supermodel reveals a now familiar encounter", "title": "Beverly Johnson says Cosby drugged her", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/12/beverly_johnson_says_cosby_drugged_her/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/beverly_johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former supermodel reveals a now familiar encounter", "creator": "@embeedub", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/beverly_johnson.jpg", "title": "Beverly Johnson says Cosby drugged her", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Beverly Johnson says Cosby drugged her", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, beverly johnson, bill cosby, Rape, Sexual assault, Vanity Fair", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1411\"", "article_summary": "Topics: beverly johnson, bill cosby, Rape, Sexual assault, Vanity Fair, Life NewsShe was a young, beautiful model who moved in glamorous circles in the \u201970s and \u201980s.\nSo maybe it\u2019s not surprising she has a disturbing Bill Cosby story to tell.\nIn a powerful new essay in Vanity Fair, model Beverly Johnson says that in the mid-\u201980s, she was contacted by Bill Cosby\u2019s people about doing a small role on his sitcom.\nJohnson confesses that though she considered confronting Cosby about the incident, she didn\u2019t.\nYet Johnson brings to the conversation yet another element \u2014 because she may be its most reliable source yet."}
