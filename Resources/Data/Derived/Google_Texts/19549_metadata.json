It\u2019s rich in antioxidants and it\u2019s known to have cancer-fighting features; it can also lower cholesterol when steamed. The same goes for other cruciferous vegetables, such as kale, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts \u2014 unless you\u2019re eating far too much of them, health and nutrition experts say.\n\nKale in particular has become a remarkably popular health \u201csuper food,\u201d with a lengthy list of benefits like antioxidants, cardiovascular support, as well as anti-inflammatory and cancer-fighting benefits. But too much kale can be a bad thing. It can lead to hypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn\u2019t make enough thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism is also referred to as an \u201cunderactive thyroid.\u201d\n\nJennifer Berman of The New York Times writes that she used to be a major health foods enthusiast, drinking fresh vegetable juices and eating plenty of greens daily. \u201cImagine my shock, then, at my last physical, when my doctor told me I had hypothyroidism, common in women over 40,\u201d Berman wrote for The New York Times. \u201cWhen I got home I looked up the condition on the Internet and found a list of foods to avoid. Kale, which I juiced every morning, tops the list, followed by broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and collard greens \u2014 the cruciferous vegetables I consumed in large quantities because they are thought to prevent cancer, which runs in my family.\u201d\n\nBut these fresh vegetables and fruits had an effect on her dental health, too. Berman went to the dentist, who told her she\u2019d \u201cbe better off with chocolate and cola\u201d than fresh vegetable juices and filtered lemon water. \u201cApparently the natural sugars in fruit and vegetable juices can cause decay, and lemon, though high in vitamin C and bioflavonoids which may prevent cancer, had eroded the enamel that protected my teeth,\u201d Berman wrote.\n\nBefore You Eat Kale, Cook It\n\nCruciferous vegetables, also known as brassicas, can include kale, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, bok choi, arugula, turnips, and watercress. If you want the health benefits of kale without the aspects that could lead to an enlarged thyroid, simply cooking it can mitigate this risk. The goitrogenic properties of kale (the aspects that contribute to an enlarged thyroid) tend to dissipate when kale or other veggies are cooked.\n\nMaking sure to mix up which vegetables you eat will also ensure that you are receiving all those vegetable nutrients without overdoing it. Some other vegetables that are non-goitrogenic are cucumbers, beets, celery, parsley, zucchini, and carrots.\n\nAnd don\u2019t let all this thyroid talk prevent you from eating your greens. Teresa Fung, an adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health and a professor at Simmons College in Boston, told WBUR that \u201cnormal, reasonable amounts of eating should not be a problem. A regular person [with no thyroid issues] who eats several servings of cruciferous vegetables a week should not have problems.\u201d\n\nHowever, Fung does note that it\u2019s all about moderation. \u201cIt\u2019s the dose that makes a poison,\u201d she told WBUR. \u201cIf people have hypothyroidism or they\u2019re taking thyroid medication, then they should check with their doctor. But even in this case, reasonable amounts shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Now, if people have a tall glass of kale juice every single day, then it gets into the unknown territory.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kale, cruciferous vegetables, underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism, broccoli, cabbage", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Eating over-the-top amounts of kale and other cruciferous vegetables has been linked to hypothyroidism.", "title": "Kale\u2019s Dark Side: Could Cruciferous Vegetables Be Bad For You?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dark-side-broccoli-and-kale-could-cruciferous-vegetables-be-bad-you-267892", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/25/kale-super-food.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eating over-the-top amounts of kale and other cruciferous vegetables has been linked to hypothyroidism.", "title": "Kale\u2019s Dark Side: Could Cruciferous Vegetables Be Bad For You?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dark-side-broccoli-and-kale-could-cruciferous-vegetables-be-bad-you-267892", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/25/kale-super-food.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/25/kale-super-food.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-01-25T15:44:25-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-25T20:18:23-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Eating over-the-top amounts of kale and other cruciferous vegetables has been linked to hypothyroidism."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3616\"", "article_summary": "The same goes for other cruciferous vegetables, such as kale, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts \u2014 unless you\u2019re eating far too much of them, health and nutrition experts say.\nA regular person [with no thyroid issues] who eats several servings of cruciferous vegetables a week should not have problems.\u201dHowever, Fung does note that it\u2019s all about moderation.\nBefore You Eat Kale, Cook ItCruciferous vegetables, also known as brassicas, can include kale, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, bok choi, arugula, turnips, and watercress.\nMaking sure to mix up which vegetables you eat will also ensure that you are receiving all those vegetable nutrients without overdoing it.\nSome other vegetables that are non-goitrogenic are cucumbers, beets, celery, parsley, zucchini, and carrots."}
