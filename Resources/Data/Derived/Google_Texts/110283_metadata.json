However, with no prescription on hand, Caroline was refused the EpiPen she required to save her daughter\u2019s life. According to Caroline, Emma died on a Dublin, Ireland, street corner in front of her 20-year-old sister Amy and 2-year-old sister Mia.\n\n\"My daughter died on a street corner with a crowd around her,\u201d Caroline told the Irish Herald. \u201cI'm so angry I was not given the EpiPen to inject her. I was told to bring Emma to an A&E department. Emma was allergic to nuts and was very careful. How could a peanut kill my child? I want to appeal to parents of children with nut allergies to make sure their child always carries an EpiPen with them.\"\n\nEmma was born with a severe peanut allergy that caused her to go into anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction, whenever she came into contact with any type of nut. Out of all food allergies, a peanut allergy is considered the most common cause of an allergic reaction. While there is no cure for a food allergy, an EpiPen delivers a single dose of epinephrine to alleviate the symptoms of an allergic reaction.\n\nCaroline had taken her three daughters and their aunt Susan to Jimmy Chung\u2019s all-you-can-eat restaurant to enjoy a night out with the family. Things took a fatal turn after Emma confused a peanut-based, satay sauce with a curry sauce. She immediately went into anaphylactic shock telling her mother, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d The family rushed out of the restaurant, in search of the nearest hospital or pharmacy.\n\nPanic-stricken and terrified for her daughter\u2019s life, Caroline informed the pharmacist of her daughter\u2019s situation and requested the EpiPen. Without a prescription for the medication, Caroline was turned away and told to get her daughter to the nearest hospital. Tragedy struck on the family\u2019s way to Temple Street Hospital when Emma took her last breath.\n\n\"He told me I couldn't get it without a prescription. He told me to bring her to an A&E,\u201d Caroline told the Irish Herald. \"I left and I knew we'd have to run all the way to Temple Street Hospital. But she only got as far as the corner of Abbey Street when she collapsed. She died on the footpath. A doctor was passing and tried to help and put her into the recovery position. Ambulance and fire brigade men worked on her. But she was gone.\u201d\n\nIrish Children\u2019s Minister, Frances Fitzgerald, and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland are launching full investigations into the death of Emma Sloan. Although Caroline does not recall seeing a \u201cnuts contained\u201d sign at Jimmy Chung\u2019s, she did not wish to blame the restaurant.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "emma, sloan, peanut, allergy, epipen", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Fourteen-year-old Emma Sloan, from Dublin, Ireland, died on a street corner surrounded by family and strangers after a pharmacist denied her mother the EpiPen needed to save her life.", "title": "Dublin Girl Dies On Street After Pharmacist Refuses Life-Saving EpiPen", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dublin-girl-emma-sloan-14-dies-street-after-pharmacist-refuses-life-saving-epipen-265670", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/23/emma-sloan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fourteen-year-old Emma Sloan, from Dublin, Ireland, died on a street corner surrounded by family and strangers after a pharmacist denied her mother the EpiPen needed to save her life.", "title": "Dublin Girl Dies On Street After Pharmacist Refuses Life-Saving EpiPen", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dublin-girl-emma-sloan-14-dies-street-after-pharmacist-refuses-life-saving-epipen-265670", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/23/emma-sloan.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/23/emma-sloan.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-12-23T13:14:40-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-23T13:20:09-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Fourteen-year-old Emma Sloan, from Dublin, Ireland, died on a street corner surrounded by family and strangers after a pharmacist denied her mother the EpiPen needed to save her life."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd28d3\"", "article_summary": "According to Caroline, Emma died on a Dublin, Ireland, street corner in front of her 20-year-old sister Amy and 2-year-old sister Mia.\nTragedy struck on the family\u2019s way to Temple Street Hospital when Emma took her last breath.\n\"I left and I knew we'd have to run all the way to Temple Street Hospital.\n\"My daughter died on a street corner with a crowd around her,\u201d Caroline told the Irish Herald.\nOut of all food allergies, a peanut allergy is considered the most common cause of an allergic reaction."}
