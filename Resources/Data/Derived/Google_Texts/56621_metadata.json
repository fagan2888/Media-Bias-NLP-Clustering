He is also slated to visit the headquarters of Microsoft.\n\nThe stop comes ahead of a state dinner at the White House and meeting with President Obama, amid tensions about a flood of cyber hacks on U.S. institutions.\n\nU.S. businesses, including the technology industry, see huge growth potential in the Chinese market, even with its policy of limiting access to some parts of the Internet and amid its increasing national security laws in the country.\n\nFollowing the passage of a cybersecurity law, the Chinese government has reportedly been asking U.S. tech firms operating in the country to commit to storing Chinese user data within its borders and potentially forcing companies to build backdoors for the government to access the data in certain situations.\n\n\u201cIt is important to remember that foreign technology companies have considerable leverage over the Chinese government,\u201d Human Rights Watch wrote in the letter. \u201cYour companies develop some of the world\u2019s most cutting-edge technologies that are much needed by a Chinese government with strong desires to propel its economy forward.\u201d\n\nThe Paulson Institute is cohosting the roundtable next week in Seattle, and CEOs from Amazon, Cisco Systems, Apple, Microsoft, IBM and others are slated to attend, according to a cached version of the press release.\n\nThe New York Times previously reported that Facebook, Google and Uber had also been invited to the forum next week with Chinese officials.
