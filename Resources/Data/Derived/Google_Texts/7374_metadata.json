Keselowski was second for the second straight race.\n\nEarnhardt won the Daytona 500 and now has multiple wins in a season for the first time since 2004.\n\nKeselowski had a runner-up finish to go with his 95 laps led. Kurt Busch, Denny Hamlin and rookie Kyle Larson completed the top five.\n\nEarnhardt gave Hendrick Motorsports three straight wins, following back-to-back victories by Jimmie Johnson. Johnson overcame a pit road mishap to finish sixth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much to do tomorrow,\u201d Earnhardt said, grinning. \u201cTonight\u2019s going to be a long one.\u201d\n\nKeselowski had the car to beat in his No. 2 Ford when a piece of trash stuck to his grille. He appeared to yield the lead to Earnhardt in an attempt to clean off the front grille and not lose time. He stalked Earnhardt down the stretch, but could never recover, losing his shot at his second win of the season.\n\n\u201cI was trying to make a move to clean it off,\u201d Keselowski said. \u201cI realized I made a mistake.\u201d\n\nHis misjudgment worked out just fine for Earnhardt.\n\nEarnhardt, long NASCAR\u2019s most popular driver, gave the Pocono crowd plenty of reason to go wild. He pulled away from Keselowski and won for the first time at Pocono. Earnhardt said Keselowski may have had the best car \u2014 but he had the best one at the end.\n\n\u201cHe had me beat. I couldn\u2019t get to him,\u201d Earnhardt said. \u201cI\u2019ve lost in some strange ways, so it feels good to win one like that.\u201d\n\nJunior shook off the red gauges in the No. 88 that could have had him meet a similar fate as Keselowski.\n\n\u201cThey were still within good reason to stand on it and give it hell,\u201d he said.\n\nEarnhardt\u2019s second win means he is guaranteed to make the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship field. He won for the 29th time in 519 career Sprint Cup starts.\n\n\u201cWe were there all day running great,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a fast car just never really got that track position until the end. You\u2019ve got to be there and we were.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s bid for a third straight win took a hit when he connected on pit road with Marcos Ambrose. Coming off wins in the Coca-Cola 600 and at Dover, Johnson was fifth when he pitted under yellow. Johnson hit Ambrose and made a 180-degree spin, forcing him to back into his stall for more repairs. He needed two tires, had right-front damage and dropped to 29th on the restart.\n\nBusch posted his first top 10 since his win at Martinsville nine races ago. He salvaged a rough day for his team that saw fellow Stewart-Haas Racing drivers Tony Stewart and Kevin Harvick drop from contention with various issues. Stewart held the lead and was in great position late to win until he was busted for speeding on pit road and was dropped to 31st. Harvick was running second when had tire trouble.\n\nStewart finished 13th, Harvick 14th, and SHR\u2019s Danica Patrick was 37th after she smacked the wall with 22 laps left.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dale Earnhardt Jr. edges Brad Keselowski to win Pocono 400", "title": "Dale Earnhardt Jr. edges Brad Keselowski to win Pocono 400", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/08/dale-earnhardt-jr-edges-brad-keselowski-to-win-pocono-400/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140608__earnhardtp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140608__earnhardtp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-08T14:39:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:25:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LONG POND, Pa. \u2014 Dale Earnhardt Jr. passed Brad Keselowski down the stretch to win a thriller Sunday at Pocono Raceway.\nEarnhardt\u2019s second win means he is guaranteed to make the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship field.\nHe stalked Earnhardt down the stretch, but could never recover, losing his shot at his second win of the season.\nEarnhardt won the Daytona 500 and now has multiple wins in a season for the first time since 2004.\nKeselowski was second for the second straight race."}
