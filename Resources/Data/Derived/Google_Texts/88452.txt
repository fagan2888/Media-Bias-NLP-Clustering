ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Marvel will be getting a little strange in 2016, but first they'll have to survive a Civil War.

After skipping out on Comic-Con entirely, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige debuted new footage and a trailer from "Captain America: Civil War" and introduced concept art from "Doctor Strange" at Disney's D23 Expo on Saturday.

Captain America himself, Chris Evans, flew in to appear at the fan convention with co-star Anthony Mackie, who plays Falcon. Both had traveled from Germany where the film is in its last week of shooting.

The clip showed a hands-on battle in a crowded square with Evans, as Captain America, Anthony Mackie, as Falcon, and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow taking on Crossbones — a formidable foe with a powerful punch.

The trailer teased the growing ideological rift between Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man and Evans' Captain America that finds the Avengers fighting one another.

"It's culmination of everything that has come before in the cinematic universe," said Feige, of the film which comes out May 6 and kicks off Marvel's "Phase Three."

Feige also presented concept art from "Doctor Strange," set to shoot in November with director Scott Derrickson, and introduced a video greeting from star Benedict Cumberbatch, who was unable to attend the convention.

In the film, Cumberbatch's Doctor Stephen Vincent Strange has his hands badly injured. He goes on a quest to find a healer and gains some otherworldly powers in the process.

Cumberbatch said the film will have "girls, cars, explosions and a bit of astro-projecting into multiple dimensions...the usual fare."

"Doctor Strange" is set to hit theaters on Nov. 4, 2016.

"It's as weird as any movie that's ever been made," said Feige.
