Bob Casey announced Tuesday that he will support the nuclear agreement that U.S. officials negotiated with Iran.\n\nCasey said in a statement that he reviewed the agreement intensely for six weeks, and decided that he believes the deal represents the best approach for preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\n\"This agreement will substantially constrain the Iranian nuclear program for its duration, and compared with all realistic alternatives, it is the best option available to us at this time,\" Casey said.\n\nWith Casey's support and that of Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, 33 Senate Democrats have publicly backed the agreement. That puts the Obama administration is within one vote of the tally needed to prevent the deal from being scuttled. Coons announced shortly after Casey.\n\nCongress will vote on the nuclear agreement after legislators returns to session next week.\n\nThe agreement with Iran was the product of 20 months of negotiations, seeks to curb the country's efforts to produce for a nuclear weapon in exchange for lifting billions of dollars in international sanctions. Republicans have been skeptical of that deal, arguing that the details are too weak and that Iran cannot be trusted to hold up its end of the bargain.\n\nCasey's Republican counterpart, Pat Toomey, said last month that he will vote against the Iran agreement. Toomey believes the deal would not prevent Iran from advancing its work on a nuclear weapon, and says that tougher economic sanctions should be used until the country agrees to abandon those ambitions.\n\nlolson@mcall.com\n\nTwitter @LauraOlson\n\n202-824-8216", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "U.S. Sens.
