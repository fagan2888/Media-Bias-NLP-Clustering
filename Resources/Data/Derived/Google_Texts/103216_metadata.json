There\u2019s the daily drumbeat of property transactions. But there\u2019s also a need for the kind of strategic, long-term thinking that fuels a company\u2019s growth.\n\nHugh O\u2019Beirne has balanced both directions during his tenure as general counsel at Chambers Street Properties, a real estate investment trust that oversees a portfolio of industrial and office properties around the world.\n\nO\u2019Beirne has had a hand in multimillion- dollar real estate deals, and he took a leading role in the initial public offering undertaken by Chambers Street in 2013, as well as other transactions that cemented its place in the stock market. The trust was spun out of real estate company CB Richard Ellis in 2012.\n\n\u201cHugh\u2019s tireless efforts in 2013 as Chambers Street Properties\u2019 lone inside counsel were critical to its successful launch,\u201d says a friend and legal colleague. \u201cHugh handled the pressure with aplomb and professionalism, and made it work.\u201d\n\nFor O\u2019Beirne, the key to bridging the business and legal worlds lies in fully adopting the mindset of the business before translating between the two.\n\nHe\u2019s had plenty of practice. O\u2019Beirne served as general counsel at CB Richard Ellis before moving to Chambers Street. He helped the new trust develop corporate governance and compliance programs, as well as human resource and IT programs.\n\nBut even as he was helping lay the company\u2019s foundation, real estate deals continued to cross his desk. In 2013, O\u2019Beirne handled numerous transactions for Chambers Street, including the nearly $11 million purchase of a warehouse/distribution center in South Carolina, the $55 million acquisition of an office property in Texas and the $30.2 million purchase of a distribution center in Indiana.\n\nOverseas deals also drew O\u2019Beirne\u2019s attention. Chambers Street bought a logistics center in France for $56.4 million and logistics properties in Germany for $49.6 million.\n\nAs befits an attorney with one eye on the future, O\u2019Beirne has clear ideas about where pro bono service could do more long-term good.\n\n\u201cUtilizing our training and resources to foster a widespread growth of entrepreneurship will do more for the growth of civil society and empowerment of citizens than any other activity,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat is the most pressing legal challenge facing businesses in 2014? \u201cThe drain on talent, time and resources caused by the need to effectively comply with the seemingly endless proliferation of foreign, domestic, state and local laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\n\nPublic Company with revenues up to $1 billion \u2014 finalist\n\nJohn Kuntz\n\nTitle: Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel\n\nCompany: The Provident Bank\n\nTown/County: Iselin, Middlesex County\n\nPublic Company with revenues over $1 billion \u2014 winner\n\nMarilyn Wasser\n\nTitle: Executive Vice President and General Counsel\n\nCompany: Realogy Holdings Corp.\n\nTown/County: Madison, Morris County\n\nBio: Realogy Holdings Corp. plunged into the financial crisis of 2008 with an extra weight strapped to its back. A year earlier, the company had undergone a private equity acquisition that saddled it with debt.\n\nMany investors believed Realogy\u2014 which operates high-profile real estate franchises\u2014would not survive.\n\nThey weren\u2019t counting on Marilyn Wasser, who leads the company\u2019s team of legal professionals. The team worked hand-in-hand with Realogy\u2019s finance department to reorganize debt and keep the company going.\n\nWasser proved to be a pragmatic leader who focused on getting the job done, despite pressing deadlines. Under her guidance, the legal team produced complex documents, developed innovative features for inclusion in debt instruments, and ensured that new agreements did not conflict with language in existing documents. The effort culminated in a successful initial public offering in 2012.\n\n\u201cThe series of carefully devised and orchestrated offerings allowed a company that many investors had abandoned to survive and ultimately flourish,\u201d Wasser says. Overall, the company offered more than $4 billion in equity and cut its debt and interest obligations by more than 50 percent.\n\nSurvival was not the legal team\u2019s only goal over the last six years. Wasser and her colleagues worked to reduce legal risk for the company across many fronts, including ethics, franchise agreements, and labor and employment. For example, the company introduced state-of-the-art documents for use with independent real estate agents, franchisees, customers and suppliers.\n\n\u201cThese efforts have won the company recognition from our industry, Ethisphere and various other organizations,\u201d Wasser says.\n\nIndeed, the Ethisphere Institute, which promotes best practices in corporate ethics and compliance, has named Realogy one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies.\n\nAnd the financial work continues. In 2013, Wasser and her team helped the company complete two secondary stock offerings, and transition to full public ownership. The company also added directors to its independent board and adopted corporate governance programs affecting compensation, board leadership, enterprise risk management and strategic planning.\n\nRealogy is the parent company of Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, CENTURY 21, Coldwell Banker, The Corcoran Group and other real estate-related subsidiaries. It employs roughly 11,000 people supporting services around the world.\n\nWhat is the most pressing legal challenge facing businesses in 2014? \u201cIncreased regulatory burdens coupled with ever-expanding class-action litigation are two enormous and pivotal risks facing business. Class actions frequently have become so broad and unwieldy\u2014with such enormous exposures\u2014 that companies feel they must settle rather than risk catastrophic judgments.\u201d\n\nPublic Company with revenues over $1 billion \u2014 finalists\n\nJohn Dauer\n\nTitle: Chief Patent Counsel\n\nCompany: Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. (A Sun Pharma company)\n\nTown/County: Cranbury, Middlesex County\n\nDana Gilbert\n\nTitle: Senior Vice President, Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel\n\nCompany: Cognizant Technology Solutions\n\nTown/County: Teaneck, Bergen County\n\nRobert Ingato\n\nTitle: Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary\n\nCompany: CIT Group Inc.\n\nTown/County: Livingston, Essex County\n\nScott McLester\n\nTitle: Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary\n\nCompany: Wyndham Worldwide\n\nTown/County: Parsippany, Morris County\n\nScott Meece\n\nTitle: General Counsel\n\nCompany: Bayer Healthcare LLC\n\nTown/County: Whippany, Morris County\n\nPrivate Company with revenues up to $1 billion \u2014 winner\n\nBarbara Oif Stack\n\nTitle: General Counsel\n\nCompany: Ironstate Development\n\nTown/County: Hoboken, Hudson County\n\nBio: As general counsel for Ironstate Development, Stack has paved the way for developments that are reshaping New Jersey\u2019s waterfront. Projects on which she has worked include the mixed-use Pier Village waterfront development in Long Branch, the Port Libert\u00e9 and Liberty National Golf Course projects in Jersey City, and development of the former Bethlehem Shipyards site in Hoboken.\n\n\u201cThis multiphase, mixed-use project opened the waterfront to extensive high-end development by Ironstate and other developers,\u201d says Stack, who has proven adept at forging the kinds of partnerships that make complex projects get off the ground.\n\nOver the years, Ironstate has partnered with redevelopment agencies, landowners, large corporations, real estate investment trusts, hotel-management firms and financial institutions. As her company\u2019s work has diversified, Stack has challenged herself to keep pace. She embraces the opportunity to learn new areas of the law.\n\nFor example, as Ironstate ventured into the hospitality business, she brushed up on the management of hotels, bars and restaurants, as well as the agreements that govern their operations. She also is becoming more familiar with taxation and other issues affecting partnerships as Ironstate undertakes more joint ventures.\n\n\u201cAs a young general counsel, it took a while to develop the confidence necessary to teach myself without guidance from more experienced colleagues,\u201d she says. \u201cNow, however, it is the most gratifying aspect of my career.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an approach similar to what she admires in her favorite fictional lawyer: Thomas Cromwell, the protagonist of \u201cWolf Hall,\u201d a historical novel set in England during the reign of King Henry VIII.\n\n\u201cHe is always prepared, always creative, always a step ahead of his colleagues, his adversaries, even his client, who happens to be King Henry VIII,\u201d Stack says. \u201cIn Cromwell\u2019s efforts to secure Henry\u2019s divorce from Catherine of Aragon, we see fascinating antecedents of the work today\u2019s lawyers do outside the courtroom to advance their clients\u2019 interests.\u201d\n\nBefore joining Ironstate, Stack worked as a public-interest housing attorney and in large law firms. In addition to her work for Ironstate, she is secretary of the Mendham Township Educational Foundation.\n\nWhen is it appropriate to text in business? \u201cThe short answer is, \u2018Probably more than we think.\u2019 We lawyers are notoriously late adopters of technology, and we need to overcome our innate conservatism in this regard. Certainly, texting is riskier than other communication channels in terms of privacy and confidentiality. However, anyone who has a teenager knows that nothing compares to a text message for immediacy, urgency and the likelihood of a prompt reply.\u201d\n\nPrivate Company with revenues up to $1 billion \u2014 finalists\n\nSteven Dorry\n\nTitle: Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and General Counsel\n\nCompany: SGS North America Inc.\n\nTown/County: Rutherford, Bergen County\n\nHymie Elhai\n\nTitle: Vice President of Business Affairs and General Counsel\n\nCompany: New York Jets LLC\n\nTown/County: Florham Park, Morris County\n\nMark Goldberg\n\nTitle: General Counsel\n\nCompany: Bluestar Silicones USA Corp.\n\nTown/County: East Brunswick, Middlesex County\n\nRobert Kelly\n\nTitle: Vice President and General Counsel\n\nCompany: Sahara Sam\u2019s Oasis and Diggerland\n\nTown/County: West Berlin, Camden County\n\nDan Reiss\n\nTitle: Senior Vice President and General Counsel\n\nCompany: Caliper\n\nTown/County: Princeton, Mercer County\n\nWilliam Robedee\n\nTitle: Chief Legal Officer\n\nCompany: Lenox Corporation\n\nTown/County: Bristol, Pa.\n\nStephen Santola\n\nTitle: Executive Vice President and General Counsel\n\nCompany: Woodmont Properties, LLC\n\nTown/County: Fairfield, Essex County\n\nPrivate Company with revenues over $1 billion \u2014 winner\n\nSamrat \"Sam\" Khichi\n\nTitle: Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer\n\nCompany: Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc.\n\nTown/County: Somerset, Somerset County\n\nBio: Over the last seven years, Samrat \u201cSam\u201d Khichi has built an impressive legal team that is making a difference at Catalent Pharma Solutions. It also is making a difference in the legal field.\n\nOutside counsel hired by Catalent are expected to provide demographic reports on the gender, race and national origin of the legal professionals assigned to work on the company\u2019s business. Khichi believes that diversity brings tangible benefits to the company by opening the door to multiple perspectives.\n\nOf course, Khichi has been a champion of diversity inside Catalent, as well. The company\u2019s in-house legal team employs professionals from around the world. In addition, he sponsors Catalent\u2019s veterans hiring initiative, and participates in other efforts to find jobs for veterans. Khichi served in the U.S. Army in the early 1990s.\n\nThe search for talent led Khichi and Catalent also to establish internship programs with three universities: Temple University, Rutgers University and Fordham University. The programs offer training in the pharmaceutical industry, as well as career opportunities. In addition, he has engaged in efforts that encourage high school students to pursue education in the so-called STEM disciplines of science, technology, engineering and math.\n\nEvery employee at Catalent, meanwhile, benefits from the global compliance program developed by Khichi. The program delivers targeted training on the company\u2019s code of conduct and related compliance issues.\n\nA White House fellow in the mid- 2000s, Khichi today plays a critical role in Catalent\u2019s government affairs function, as well.\n\nBefore joining Catalent in 2007, Khichi worked for the law firm of O\u2019Melveny & Myers. Khichi recently added a new credential to his resume, one that burnished his business acumen. In 2011, he earned a master\u2019s of business administration from Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management.\n\nIn 2010, he told the Minority Corporate Counsel Association why he chose to work in the pharmaceutical industry. The association profiled him as part of a survey.\n\n\u201cI desired to work in an important industry where I could bring to bear my leadership, government, regulatory and legal skills,\u201d he said then. \u201cI selected pharma not only because the industry improves the lives of millions of people, but also because of the complexity of the regulations and the sophistication of the R&D. I find it all fascinating and very rewarding.\u201d\n\nWho are your legal role models? \u201cThe partners in the M&A group of Shearman & Sterling and the former chairman of O\u2019Melveny & Myers, A.B. Culvahouse. Under A.B., I learned to be a better adviser and strategic counselor, how to take the entire panorama of issues, and to distill advice and provide judgment into a succinct and sound decision that assesses the myriad long- and short-term implications, and the many stakeholders impacted.\u201d\n\nPrivate Company with revenues over $1 billion \u2014 finalists\n\nHoward Harris\n\nTitle: Vice President of Legal Affairs and General Counsel\n\nCompany: U.S. and Canadian BMW Group Companies\n\nTown/County: Woodcliff Lake, Bergen County\n\nAnthony Martino II\n\nTitle: Vice President and General Counsel\n\nCompany: Colas Inc.\n\nTown/County: Morristown, Morris County\n\nRaymer McQuiston\n\nTitle: General Counsel\n\nCompany: Ports America\n\nTown/County: Jersey City, Hudson County\n\nGregory Mulligan\n\nTitle: Vice President and General Counsel\n\nCompany: Evonik Corporation\n\nTown/County: Parsippany, Morris County\n\nAllen Waxman\n\nTitle: Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary\n\nCompany: Eisai Inc.\n\nTown/County: Woodcliff Lake, Bergen County\n\nCorporate Compliance professional \u2014 winner\n\nTom Wyatt\n\nTitle: Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, and Securities Counsel\n\nCompany: American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nTown/County: Voorhees, Camden County\n\nBio: Compliance can be like broccoli. It\u2019s something companies know they have to do, but it\u2019s not the first thing that catches their eye when they scan their busy plates.\n\nTom Wyatt has been finding ways to make the subject both appealing and relevant to employees of American Water Works. He is getting the message across using a range of new tools, including videos, blogs, posters and promotional giveaways.\n\nAn interactive video, for example, trains employees on the company\u2019s code of ethics and engages its audience through the use of real-world situations.\n\n\u201cIt has bolstered our culture to be more inclined to ask questions about our code of ethics before making important decisions,\u201d Wyatt says.\n\nIndeed, thanks to his hard work and dedication, employees at American Water responded in record numbers to the company\u2019s annual code of ethics certification.\n\nAnother effort, dubbed Ethical Leadership Training, shows managers how to create a safe environment for speaking up, and to determine when and how to appropriately warn of emerging issues.\n\nWyatt joined American Water in 2006 as corporate counsel, bringing a background in mergers and acquisitions, along with expertise in regulatory compliance and corporate governance. He quickly demonstrated leadership skills, as well. Within a year, he was named SEC counsel and assistant secretary before being named to his current position, where he continues to serve as a key leader in the company.\n\nWyatt spends his days reinforcing an ethical culture at American Water and reminding employees of their roles in upholding the company\u2019s integrity. In addition, he serves as lead counsel for corporate finance, regulatory filings and disclosure compliance, as well as being the company\u2019s corporate governance expert.\n\nWhile Wyatt\u2019s knowledge of the law is crucial, so is his grasp of the underlying business. Working with the company\u2019s board and management, he has succeeded in creating a corporate governance structure that is well-suited to the business and transparent to its stakeholders.\n\n\u201cAn effective lawyer must understand his or her client\u2019s business strategy before a truly meaningful discussion can occur,\u201d he says. \u201cThe most difficult step is translating advice into the language of strategy execution. For example, a certain legal decision or business action could threaten or bolster a certain long- or short-term strategy.\u201d\n\nWho is your favorite fictional lawyer? \u201cAtticus Finch. I know it is clich\u00e9, but if integrity, guts, intelligence and compassion are clich\u00e9, so be it. I think of his character often, but have never come close to matching his standard.\u201d\n\nCorporate Compliance professional \u2014 finalist\n\nThomas Flynn\n\nTitle: Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer\n\nCompany: Hackensack University Medical Center\n\nTown/County: Hackensack, Bergen County\n\nHealth Care organization \u2014 winner\n\nGary J. Lesneski\n\nTitle: Chief Legal Officer\n\nCompany: Cooper University Health Care\n\nTown/County: Camden, Camden County\n\nBio: Gary J. Lesneski was no stranger to health care law when he joined Cooper University Health Care nearly four years ago.\n\nAfter all, he had specialized in health care during his more than three decades at the law firm of Archer & Greiner. He has likely drawn on every last second of that experience in guiding Cooper through the complex changes that have swept through health care over the last few years, largely due to the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, also known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cHealth care is in the midst of a profound transition to a new paradigm of health care delivery, with a focus on evidence-based population health management and quality-based reimbursement incentives,\u201d Lesneski says.\n\nDoctors, insurers and health systems are all experimenting with new models of care, even as regulations grow more complex. It\u2019s a challenging prescription for in-house counsel, but one that Lesneski has handled with aplomb.\n\nLesneski recently oversaw the legal aspects involved in negotiating and executing an agreement with the MD Anderson Physicians Network to create the MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper. The program offers Anderson\u2019s renowned treatment protocols, extensive clinical trials and cutting- edge research to patients in New Jersey and Delaware, as well as parts of New York and Pennsylvania.\n\nNext on Lesneski\u2019s plate was Cooper\u2019s acquisition of a 20 percent stake in AmeriHealth New Jersey. The two partners aim to develop novel approaches to delivering high-quality, cost-efficient care. Their first collaboration is an insurance product designed for sale on the federal insurance exchange created by the ACA.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the big deals that cross Lesneski\u2019s desk. He is involved in all aspects of Cooper\u2019s legal affairs, including development of policies and procedures, reviewing contracts and other legal documents, and resolving disputes, claims and litigation.\n\nNo matter what the subject, Lesneski is acutely aware of the extra layer of attention that is needed. \u201cFinding solutions to business issues within the limitations of regulatory guidelines can present significant challenges to health care counsel,\u201d he says.\n\nLesneski also has been called on to serve the legal profession. He has twice served as chair of the New Jersey State Bar Association\u2019s health and hospital law section, and on the civil practice committee of the New Jersey Supreme Court.\n\nWhat pro bono work deserves greater support in New Jersey? \u201cCooper is a safety-net hospital operating in a challenging urban environment. Our patients often have basic, unaddressed legal issues that can be an impediment to their accessing health care. Regional legal-services providers are challenged by a lack of resources to handle the potential demand for services. Cooper is exploring initiatives to address these concerns here in Camden.\u201d\n\nHealth Care organization \u2014 finalists\n\nSam Germana\n\nTitle: Vice President and General Counsel\n\nCompany: Trinitas Regional Medical Center\n\nTown/County: Elizabeth, Union County\n\nKevin Kramer\n\nTitle: Vice President of Legal Affairs and General Counsel\n\nCompany: Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Rahway\n\nTown/County: Rahway, Union County\n\nJennifer Schwartz\n\nTitle: Vice President of Legal Affairs and General Counsel\n\nCompany: Lourdes Health System\n\nTown/County: Camden, Camden County\n\nNonprofit or Government organization \u2014 winner\n\nJohn Farmer\n\nTitle: Senior Vice President and General Counsel\n\nCompany: Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey\n\nTown/County: New Brunswick, Middlesex County\n\nBio: Rutgers University needed a steady hand last spring as it weathered an unprecedented crisis originating in its athletics department.\n\nIt found that hand in the leadership of John Farmer, who took over in April 2013 as the university\u2019s general counsel.\n\nWhat he faced was no cut-and-dry academic exercise. As it confronted the crisis, Rutgers faced an imminent deadline for completing the acquisition of numerous units from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. The integration, one of the largest academic integrations in the U.S., involved restructuring more than 4,000 contracts, negotiating 13 clinical affiliation agreements, disentangling components of UMDNJ from the University Hospital of Newark and issuing nearly $1 billion in bonds.\n\nAt the same time, legislators were proposing to disband the Rutgers board of trustees, a move that might have jeopardized the bond issue. Farmer was intimately familiar with the school, having served as dean of the Rutgers School of Law-Newark. And he brought an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to the task.\n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown Law Center, Farmer clerked for the New Jersey Supreme Court and worked later as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Newark. He also served as chief counsel to former N.J. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the state\u2019s attorney general, as well as general counsel and team leader for the 9/11 Commission.\n\nFarmer and his legal team pulled off the integration of UMDNJ and fended off the potentially harmful legislation.\n\nBut challenges remain. Chief among them are the gradual erosion of public funding, along with the need for Rutgers to function more like a private institution without violating the heightened standards expected of public institutions.\n\n\u201cThose standards and regulations have multiplied over the past two decades; at the same time, the level of public support has been diminishing,\u201d Farmer says. \u201cThe legal challenge is to ensure compliance with those standards while finding ways to encourage more entrepreneurial partnerships and activities.\u201d\n\nOne of those activities can be found at Farmer\u2019s old haunt, the Rutgers School of Law-Newark. It recently launched Rutgers Law Associates, a program designed to employ recent graduates entering a difficult job market, while supporting clients in the lower middle class who have trouble affording legal fees.\n\n\u201cI believe that corporations and the larger legal community should support efforts to provide access to justice for this underserved population,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat are the most difficult steps when translating between the legal and academic worlds? \u201cTo persuade the faculty, students and administrators that our function is not to obstruct or frustrate their goals, or to impinge on academic or other freedoms, but to find ways to accomplish the university\u2019s strategic goals within applicable legal and regulatory standards.\u201d\n\nNonprofit or Government organization \u2014 finalists\n\nBette Renaud\n\nTitle: Senior Deputy Attorney General\n\nCompany: New Jersey Economic Development Authority\n\nTown/County: Trenton, Mercer County\n\nHolly Stern\n\nTitle: General Counsel and Secretary to the Board of Trustees\n\nCompany: New Jersey Institute of Technology\n\nTown/County: Newark, Essex County\n\nSteven Weinstein\n\nTitle: General Counsel and Senior Vice President of Governmental Relations\n\nCompany: Rowan University\n\nTown/County: Glassboro, Gloucester County", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "Seven top lawyers in the state of New Jersey received a high honor Friday morning as they were selected as the winners at the NJBIZ General Counsel of the Year event at the Palace in Somerset.", "title": "NJBIZ General Counsel winners: Seven top lawyers bring home big awards | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20140606/NJBIZ01/140609916/njbiz-general-counsel-winners-seven-top-lawyers-bring-home-big-awards", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140606/NJBIZ01/140609916/AR/0/AR-140609916.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "Seven top lawyers in the state of New Jersey received a high honor Friday morning as they were selected as the winners at the NJBIZ General Counsel of the Year event at the Palace in Somerset.", "title": "NJBIZ General Counsel winners: Seven top lawyers bring home big awards | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140606/NJBIZ01/140609916/AR/0/AR-140609916.jpg"}, "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Seven top lawyers in the state of New Jersey received a high honor Friday morning as they were selected as the winners at the NJBIZ General Counsel of the Year event at the Palace in Somerset.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c5c\"", "article_summary": "Christine Todd Whitman, the state\u2019s attorney general, as well as general counsel and team leader for the 9/11 Commission.\nSeven top lawyers in the state of New Jersey received a high honor Friday morning as they were selected as the winners at the NJBIZ General Counsel of the Year event at the Palace in Somerset.\nIt found that hand in the leadership of John Farmer, who took over in April 2013 as the university\u2019s general counsel.\nO\u2019Beirne served as general counsel at CB Richard Ellis before moving to Chambers Street.\n\u201cAs a young general counsel, it took a while to develop the confidence necessary to teach myself without guidance from more experienced colleagues,\u201d she says."}
