NOW TO COMMITMENT 2014 AND OUR LATEST AD-WATCH TRUTH TEST REPORT. THIS TIME OUR ADWATCHERS HAVE BEEN DIGGING INTO THE CLAIMS SURROUNDING PROPOSITION 45 WHICH WOULD CHANGE THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CERTAIN HEALTH INSURANCE RATES. KCRA 3'S DAVID BIENICK JOINS US NOW WITH HOW OUR AD-WATCHERS GRADED A \"NO ON 45\" AD. DAVID? KCRA 3 IS TEAMING UP WITH SACRAMENTO STATE'S PROJECT FOR AN INFORMED ELECTORATE FOR THIS YEAR'S ADWATCH REPORTS. OUR EXPERTS THIS TIME ARE PUBLIC POLICY PROFESSOR CHARLES GOSSETT, PUBLIC POLICY PROFESSOR MARY KIRLIN AND GOVERNMENT STUDIES PROFESSOR KIMBERLY NALDER. THEY ARE GRADING EACH AD FOR TRUTHFULNESS, SUBSTANCE AND USEFUL VOTER INFORMATION, AND RELEVANCE TO THE ISSUES VOTERS CARE ABOUT. TONIGHT, THE GRADES ARE IN FOR THE AD THAT ATTACKS PROPOSITION 45. THE LATEST AD OUR ADWATCHERS EXAMINED FEATURES A MAN AND A WOMAN IN A HARDWARE STORE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO GET AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE. THAT'S WHY WE GOT COVERAGE THROUGH THE NEW INDEPENDENT COMMISSION. SO, WHAT'S THIS NEW INDEPENDENT COMMISSION THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT? IT SEEMED TO ME AN UNUSUAL WAY TO REFER TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OR OBAMACARE. IN OTHER WORDS, THE COMMISSION IS THE GOVERNING BOARD OF COVERED CALIFORNIA WHICH SINCE LAST YEAR APPROVES OR REJECTS HEALTH INSURANCE RATES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. RECENTLY, COVERED CALIFORNIA APPROVED RELATIVELY MODERATE RATE INCREASES AVERAGING 4.2%. IT'S GOOD COVERAGE AND IT SAVED US MONEY. THE AD THEN CLAIMS PROPOSITION 45 COULD CHANGE ALL THAT BY -- GIVING ONE SACRAMENTO POLITICIAN THE POWER TO OVERRIDE THE COMMISSION. SO, WHO'S THAT SACRAMENTO POLITICIAN? IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S THIS MURKY, EVIL POLITICIAN WHO'S GOING TO INCREASE YOUR HEALTH CARE COSTS. WELL, IT'S THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. THE CURRENT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IS DAVE JONES. HE ALREADY HAS THE POWER TO REJECT CAR AND HOMEOWNER INSURANCE RATES. PROP 45 WOULD EXTEND THAT POWER TO HEALTH INSURANCE RATES. THEY AVOIDED USING THE TERM \"INSURANCE COMMISSIONER\" BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, KNOWN FOR MAKING HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AND AUTO INSURANCE COMPANIES LOWER THEIR RATES. 45 LETS THE POLITICIANS TAKE CAMPAIGN MONEY FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS THEN DO THEIR BIDDING INSTEAD OF CONSUMERS. OUR ADWATCHERS SAY YES, THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER DOES TAKE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S AN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO HAS TO CAMPAIGN. HE'S DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE TO VOTERS UNLIKE THE COVERED CALIFORNIA BOARD WHICH IS MADE UP OF FIVE MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERS. IF THEY WANTED TO BE CRITICAL OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION AND SAY A BOARD OF ANONYMOUS BUREAUCRATS. SO, IF I'M A VOTER, WHICH ONE IS EASIER FOR ME IN TERMS OF JUST FLAT-OUT ACCOUNTABILITY? PROBABLY THE ONE PERSON. WHAT'S MORE -- OUR ADWATCHERS SAY IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SPECIAL INTERESTS USUALLY REFERS TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. AND IN THIS CASE, THOSE COMPANIES ARE PAYING FOR MOST OF THE NO ON 45 CAMPAIGN. RIGHT, THE PEOPLE FUNDING THE AD ARE THE SPECIAL INTERESTS YOU'D PROBABLY BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO INSURANCE RATES. AT LEAST 35 OTHER STATES CURRENTLY ALLOW COMMISSIONERS OR DEPARTMENTS TO REGULATE HEALTH INSURANCE RATES. BUT, THE AD SUGGESTS DOING SO IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE DANGEROUS. IT'S JUST TOO MUCH POWER FOR ONE POLITICIAN. THERE ARE CERTAINLY MANY OTHER POLITICIANS WHO HAVE MORE POWER THAN THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. THE GOVERNOR, FOR EXAMPLE. SO, WHAT GRADE TO OUR ADWATCHERS GIVE THIS NO ON 45 AD FOR TRUTHFULNESS? LIKE THE BASICS OF IT WERE PROBABLY CLOSE ENOUGH TO ACCURATE THAT YES, IT WOULD GIVE NOT AUTHORITY TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. BUT, WITH A LOT OF \"BUTS\" BEHIND IT. SO, IS IT COMPLETELY FALSE? NO. BUT, IS IT LACKING CONTEXT? YEAH. SO FOR TRUTHFULNESS, A GRADE OF C. AS FOR SUBSTANCE -- OUR ADWATCHERS DON'T LIKE THE WAY THE AD'S VAGUE REFERENCES TO \"INDEPENDENT COMMISSION\" AND \"SACRAMENTO POLITICIAN.\" I JUST FELT THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING IN THE AD. SO FOR SUBSTANCE, THE AD'S LOWEST GRADE, D+. FINALLY, HOW RELEVANT IS THE AD TO ISSUES VOTERS CARE ABOUT? I THINK VOTERS CARE A LOT ABOUT HEALTH CARE COSTS. HOWEVER, PROP 45 WOULD ONLY APPLY TO PEOPLE WHO GET HEALTH INSURANCE THROUGH THEIR SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYER OR INDIVIDUAL POLICIES. LARGE-EMPLOYER PLANS AND GOVERNMENT PLANS LIKE MEDICARE WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY PROP 45. SO, FOR RELEVANCE, A GRADE OF C+. IT WON'T IMPACT MOST OF US DIRECTLY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR WE'RE NOT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS OR WORKING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. MOST OF US. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE ALL CARE ABOUT VALUES. SO HERE AGAIN ARE OUR ADWATCHERS GRADES FOR THE \"NO ON 45\" AD -- \"C\" FOR TRUTHFULNESS. \"D+\" FOR SUBSTANCE AND USEFUL INFORMATION. AND \"C+\" FOR RELEVANCE TO VOTERS. THE \"YES ON PROP 45\" CAMPAIGN IS NOT CURRENTLY PLANNING TO AIR ANY COMMERCIALS IN OUR AREA. SO COMING UP TOMORROW, WE SWITCH INITIATIVES. WE'LL MOVE UP TO PROP 46 AND LOOK INTO WHETHER IT REALLY CONTAINS A RISK FOR PEOPLE'S", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 13 Oct 2014 20:39:26 PDT", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "David Bienick", "og": {"site_name": "KCRA", "description": "A team of AdWatch experts grade an ad that attacks Proposition 45, leading up to the November election.", "title": "AdWatch: Grading the ad attacking Proposition 45", "url": "http://www.kcra.com/politics/adwatch-grading-the-ad-attacking-proposition-45/29110806", "image": "http://www.kcra.com/image/view/-/29110808/medRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/dihyl0z/-/img-Adwatch-Proposition-45.jpg", "type": "video"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.kcra.com/politics/adwatch-grading-the-ad-attacking-proposition-45/29110806", "player": {"width": 640, "height": 390}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "kcra://content/video/29110806", "iphone": "kcra://content/video/29110806", "googleplay": "kcra://content/video/29110806"}, "name": {"ipad": "kcra", "iphone": "kcra", "googleplay": "kcra"}, "id": {"ipad": 505581274, "iphone": 505581274, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}}, "site": "@kcranews", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "kcra://content/video/29110806", "app_name": "kcra", "package": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}, "ios": {"url": "kcra://content/video/29110806", "app_store_id": 505581274, "app_name": "kcra"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 102798321191}, "keywords": "KCRA,California,Adwatch,ads,Proposition 45,attacks Prop. 45,grades,election,David Bienick, kcra3, kcra 3, kcra news, kcra channel, kcra.com, kcra video, kcra politics", "google-site-verification": "lseesGPufjGiNJ4blx9-qW5A0JKGfgPc9Mw6RTc9Ulo", "news_keywords": "KCRA,California,Adwatch,ads,Proposition 45,attacks Prop. 45,grades,election,David Bienick, kcra3, kcra 3, kcra news, kcra channel, kcra.com, kcra video, kcra politics", "description": "A team of AdWatch experts grade an ad that attacks Proposition 45, leading up to the November election."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc0a9\"", "article_summary": "THEY ARE GRADING EACH AD FOR TRUTHFULNESS, SUBSTANCE AND USEFUL VOTER INFORMATION, AND RELEVANCE TO THE ISSUES VOTERS CARE ABOUT.\nKCRA 3'S DAVID BIENICK JOINS US NOW WITH HOW OUR AD-WATCHERS GRADED A \"NO ON 45\" AD.\nTHEY AVOIDED USING THE TERM \"INSURANCE COMMISSIONER\" BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, KNOWN FOR MAKING HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AND AUTO INSURANCE COMPANIES LOWER THEIR RATES.\nTHIS TIME OUR ADWATCHERS HAVE BEEN DIGGING INTO THE CLAIMS SURROUNDING PROPOSITION 45 WHICH WOULD CHANGE THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CERTAIN HEALTH INSURANCE RATES.\nSO HERE AGAIN ARE OUR ADWATCHERS GRADES FOR THE \"NO ON 45\" AD -- \"C\" FOR TRUTHFULNESS."}
