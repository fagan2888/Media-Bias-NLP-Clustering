What bill? Those immigrants will produce more in taxes than they will consume, according to the very authority cited by the ad\u2019s sponsor.\n\nThe ad was announced April 7 by Californians for Population Stabilization, a group advocating tighter controls on immigration. It is running only in Iowa and on national cable channels, the group said. A spokesman said the cost of the ad buy is in the \u201csix figures\u201d and will run through April 15 \u2014 which is the deadline for filing federal income taxes.\n\nThe ad features images of Republican and Democratic presidential prospects with their mouths zippered shut. The narrator says they \u201cdon\u2019t talk much about the tax implications\u201d of Obama\u2019s action granting eligibility for temporary legal status and work permits to nearly 5 million persons who have been living in the U.S. without permission.\n\nThe narrator goes on to say that \u201camnesty gives illegal aliens the right to take American jobs and apply for $1.7 billion in tax refunds, even though many illegal aliens never paid taxes, and struggling American workers will be stuck with the tax bill.\u201d And it further says \u201cyour tax bill may depend\u201d on rescinding the president\u2019s order.\n\nIn its news release, the sponsor cites \u201cCongressional Budget Office projections\u201d as its authority for the claim about tax refunds. But the CBO\u2019s analysis actually shows that the overall \u201ctax implications\u201d of Obama\u2019s order would cut the federal deficit rather than creating any new \u201cbill\u201d for American taxpayers.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the CBO estimated in a Jan. 29 letter that one of the budgetary effects of Obama\u2019s action (and an earlier order granting temporary legal status to immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children) would be to increase federal payments for Earned Income Tax Credits and per-child tax credits by a total of more than $10 billion spread over 10 years.\n\nSo where does the ad get the $1.7 billion figure? Some newly legal workers may be able to claim EITC refunds for prior years, provided they had worked and file tax returns. Some Republicans have called this an \u201camnesty bonus,\u201d and we covered that in detail in a Feb. 20 item. According to a March 4 report by the McClatchy Washington bureau, the nonpartisan tax experts at the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation found that these retroactive refunds would amount to $1.7 billion over 10 years (nearly all in the first five years). It\u2019s this so-called \u201camnesty bonus\u201d that the CAP\u2019s ad refers to, a CAP spokesman told us.\n\nBut that \u201cbonus\u201d and all the other tax refunds are only part of the overall budget effects.\n\nThe CBO\u2019s Jan. 29 letter also estimated that the president\u2019s order would bring in more than $22 billion in new tax revenue. Most of that would come from increased payments of Social Security taxes levied on newly reported earnings.\n\nAnd the net result \u2014 even figuring in added federal payments for Affordable Care Act subsidies, Medicaid and other federal programs for which the newly legal residents could qualify \u2014 would be a decrease in federal deficits, totaling just under $7.5 billion over 10 years.\n\nWhere would the increased revenue come from? CBO, citing an analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation, said the biggest effect comes from newly legal immigrants openly declaring their income and paying taxes rather than hiding it for fear of discovery and deportation. Also, the JCT experts figure, wages for legal workers tend to be higher than for those in the underground economy. Any increase in reported wages results in higher payroll tax collections.\n\nIn short, CBO says the budgetary pluses of the president\u2019s action will outweigh the minuses. But this ad tries to give viewers the opposite impression.\n\n\u2014 Brooks Jackson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In its news release, the sponsor cites \u201cCongressional Budget Office projections\u201d as its authority for the claim about tax refunds.\nBut that \u201cbonus\u201d and all the other tax refunds are only part of the overall budget effects.\nA new TV spot claims Americans will be \u201cstuck with the tax bill\u201d for President Obama\u2019s order giving legal status to millions of immigrants.\nThe ad was announced April 7 by Californians for Population Stabilization, a group advocating tighter controls on immigration.\nBut the CBO\u2019s analysis actually shows that the overall \u201ctax implications\u201d of Obama\u2019s order would cut the federal deficit rather than creating any new \u201cbill\u201d for American taxpayers."}
