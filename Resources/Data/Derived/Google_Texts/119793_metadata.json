The veterans, ranging from ages 69 to 71, recently got together at the Cinnamon Beach in Florida to recreate a picture from 50 years ago, as Naples Daily News detailed.\n\nThe men have changed from the war, aged, and lost touch for a time. But, Bob Falk, 71; Dennis Puelo, 69; Tom Hanks, 69; and Bob DeVenezia, 70, resumed their positions for the replica on Saturday.\n\nIt had been five decades since they last saw each other. \u201cLife is funny like that,\u201d explained DeVenezia. \u201cI didn\u2019t keep in touch with any of them. There was something about the Vietnam War and the negativity we kept hearing.\u201d\n\nThe four had been stationed together in Camp Pendleton, California, in 1966, before going off to Vietnam. The picture was taken on the beach there during a weekend in May 1966.\n\nAfter going their separate ways, the men didn\u2019t even plan on reuniting, though Falk mentioned he\u2019s \u201chad a lot more time to think back on it\u201d since retiring.\n\nHanks had created an online memorial for a fellow soldier they knew, which Falk found. Hanks then got the idea after he found the picture flipping through an old photo album.\n\nIt took work convincing the other two, especially Puelo, to make the trip, who would get the smallest bed, and how to recreate the outfits exactly.\n\nAfter the photo was taken, the four headed to lunch in matching yellow polos, where they continued to tell stories. Puelo was glad he had come and Hanks called it \u201cone of the best days of my life.\u201d\n\nWith all their interest in technology and selfies, perhaps the millennial generation has found a new way to look up to their elders then in coming together to recreate the photo and memories with it.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Image via screenshot.
