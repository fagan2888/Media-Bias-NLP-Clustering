Thus, the clinic was receiving little to no payment for its services.\n\nThose individuals are now covered, she said.\n\nWithout the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Eisen said, there would have been no groundbreaking ceremony today.\n\nHannah Albarazi, Bay City News", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "description": "A health care center geared toward providing primary medical care, mental health services, substance abuse treatment and re-entry services to San Francisco's most vulnerable residents broke ground in the city's South of Market neighborhood today.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://sfappeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sfappeal_new_button_400x400-300x300.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc91\"", "article_summary": "A health care center geared toward providing primary medical care, mental health services, substance abuse treatment and re-entry services to San Francisco\u2019s most vulnerable residents broke ground in the city\u2019s South of Market neighborhood today.\nSituated in a former garment manufacturing building, HealthRight 360 will transform the five-story, 50,000 square foot space into a healthcare center.\nWithout the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Eisen said, there would have been no groundbreaking ceremony today.\nThe building will enable HealthRight 360 to double its capacity for primary care services in San Francisco.\nEisen said that the role the Affordable Care Act has played in expanding HealthRight 360\u2019s services should not be downplayed."}
