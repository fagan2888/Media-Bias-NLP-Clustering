Cantaloupe or peaches? Alamosa Republican state Sen. Larry Crowder wants both to be Colorado’s official state fruits.

Crowder said Friday that he will attempt to add Rock Ford cantaloupe to a bill introduced in the Legislature to make the Palisade peach Colorado’s official state fruit.

Crowder told the Pueblo Chieftain that both fruits have a comparable history in the state. Palisade peaches are grown on the Western Slope near Grand Junction. Rocky Ford cantaloupes are grown in southeastern Colorado.
