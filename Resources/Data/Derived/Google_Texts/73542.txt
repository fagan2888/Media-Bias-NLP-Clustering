WATSONVILLE -- Community Health Systems Inc., which owns Watsonville Community Hospital, is getting bigger.

Shareholders of Health Management Associates Inc., a hospital operator in Naples, Fla., approved a sale to Community Health Systems Wednesday for $7.6 billion with nearly 98 percent in favor. The deal is expected to close by the end of this month.

CHS, based in Tennessee, operates 125 hospitals in 29 states. HMA operates 71 hospitals in 15 states plus 472 clinics and 1,000 physician offices.

Analysts with Moody's Investors Service say the Affordable Care Act is driving mergers as a strategy to lower administrative costs and diversify revenue in face of a declining admissions.

Tim Thomas, a registered nurse at Watsonville Community Hospital, traveled to Florida to protest the sale with members of National Nurses United, the largest union representing registered nurses.

According to the union's analysis of Medicare claims in 2011 and 2012, six of the nine most expensive hospitals are part of either Community Health Systems or Health Management Associates.

Watsonville Community Hospital charged $737 for every $100 in cost, according to the analysis, Dominican Hospital charged $467 and Sutter Maternity & Surgery Center $337. The average charge in California was $450 for every $100 in cost.
