She said seeing her mother\u2019s hard work in the field of nursing has been an inspiration.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been a very strong, confident woman all of her life,\u201d Nicole O\u2019Connor said. \u201cI like following in her footsteps.\u201d\n\nTeena O\u2019Connor said she\u2019s been inspired by her daughter as well.\n\n\u201cI love all my children equally, but looking back, there was a moment when my daughter was little, and I was holding her when I thought, \u2018I have to do something more,\u2019 she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I made the decision to go back to college the first time, so I could be something for my daughter to aspire for.\u201d\n\nNicole O\u2019Connor said it\u2019s only natural that she decided to go into nursing, since her mom, aunts and grandmother have all worked as nurses.\n\nIn 2000, Teena O\u2019Connor earned her associate degree in nursing from Broome County Community College in Binghamton, New York. After getting her degree, she decided to put the rest of her studies on hold so she could spend more time with her family.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to take away from them,\u201d she said, adding that her children were active in school sports, and that she didn\u2019t want to studies to keep her from attending games. \u201cMy priority needed to be them at that time.\u201d\n\nBy 2012, Teena O\u2019Connor decided that her children were mature enough for her to return to school. That year, she enrolled at Misericordia\u2019s RN to BSN program. Having worked as a registered nurse for 14 years, Teena O\u2019Connor saw new graduates coming out of Misericordia\u2019s nursing program.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised in this area, with Misericordia right in my back yard,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew it was the right place to be.\u201d\n\nBalancing her work, academic, and personal lives has been a struggle for Teena O\u2019Connor. Sometimes, she said the pressure can be too much.\n\n\u201cAt least one time a semester I think I\u2019m going to crack, and then I take a couple steps back and say, \u2018Okay, this is manageable, I\u2019ve been through worse things in my life, and this is small stuff,\u2019\u201d Teena O\u2019Connor said.\n\nHer son, Chris, 21, says he\u2019s amazed and proud of the work her mother is doing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how she does it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has papers, projects, even work, but she figures it out somehow.\u201d\n\nTeena O\u2019Connor says the secret to keeping her life together has always been her family.\n\n\u201cI really couldn\u2019t do it without the support of my family \u2014 from them helping out with keeping up with housework, to helping with meals, to being there to calm me down when I feel very stressed,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it gets a little difficult to manage everything.\u201d\n\nEven now that she\u2019s earned her BSN, Teena O\u2019Connor has no intention of taking a break. Her next goal is to graduate with her master\u2019s degree by 2017, the same year that Nicole will receive her bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our next goal together, and she\u2019s excited about sharing in that experience with me,\u201d Teena O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIt will probably be one of the most defining moments of my life.\u201d\n\nShe said first she ran the idea by Nicole, who said the mother-daughter graduation would be unique.\n\n\u201cI ran it by her first because I didn\u2019t want it to be an opportunity where she felt I was stealing her thunder,\u201d Teena O\u2019Connor said.\n\nNicole O\u2019Connor said she\u2019s interested in family medicine, but has not decided on a definitive career path. Teena O\u2019Connor said she\u2019s just happy that she can help provide mentorship for her daughter.\n\n\u201cI want her to be something great, and the only way she\u2019s going to be something great is if I make choices in my life to be a good role model,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could not mean more to me that my daughter has chosen the same profession \u2014 no pushing on my end. She just has seen what I have accomplished in my life and how much joy this profession has brought me.\u201d\n\njheckman@citizensvoice.com\n\n570-821-2061\n\nLuzerne County graduates:\n\nRosalie Allan-Fufaro, Dallas, Professional Studies, BS; Amanda Marie Ankner, Wilkes-Barre, Communications, BA; Wendy Aumick, Kingston, Nursing, BSN; Aimee Balchune, Duryea, Health Care Management, BS & Business Administration, BS; Amanda Jean Barnes, Hazleton, Nursing, BSN; Cheryl Bednar, Swoyersville, Nursing, BSN; Hannah Rose Biskup, Mountain Top, Health Science, BS & Speech Language Pathology, MS; Ashley Blazaskie, Shavertown, Early Childhood Education, BS & Special Education, BS; Maria Lee Brogna, Pittston, Nursing, BSN; Terri Bugelholl, West Pittston, Professional Studies, BS; Jared Michael Butala, Freeland, Nursing, BSN; Andrea Carr, Dallas, Biology, BS; Sara Casterline, Hunlock Creek, Medical Imaging, BS; Callen W.
