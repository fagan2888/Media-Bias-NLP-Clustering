Above, a woman carries baskets at the main railway station in Yangon, Myanmar. Agence France-Presse/Ye Aung Thu\n\nMyanmar is creating buzz among private equity investors looking to catch the first wave of deals in the frontier market as it develops its economy after years as a pariah state.\n\nU.S. private equity firm TPG Capital made its first steps into the Southeast Asian country earlier this year when it injected capital into Apollo Towers and its operating unit Apollo Towers Myanmar, which provide telecommunications tower infrastructure. In a statement, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel to TPG, pegged the value of that transaction at $35 million.\n\nThe country\u2019s appeal lies in its large population, government initiatives to encourage foreign investment and a strategic location close to India, China, Thailand and Vietnam, but the investment landscape can be riddled with challenges.\n\n\u201cMyanmar is not for the faint of heart,\u201d said Tim Dattels, who co-heads TPG\u2019s Asia operations.\n\nSome market participants say a crucial hurdle is that small businesses are less mature there compared with their Asian counter- parts, meaning general partners may need to hold on to companies beyond a fund\u2019s average holding period of roughly five years.\n\nFor this reason, Myanmar Investments International Ltd., an investment company listed on the London Stock Exchange, said a fixed-life private equity fund structure may be less suitable in Myanmar than an evergreen or perpetual structure.\n\n\u201cThere are those companies which you\u2019re likely to hold on for 10 to 15 years, and you don\u2019t want an artificial gun to your head to exit them,\u201d said Mike Dean, a co- founder of Myanmar Investments.\n\nA healthy supply of deals is another benefit to investing in Myanmar, but the question remains: how will firms exit portfolio companies? The country is in the process of opening a stock exchange, which is slated for next October, but in general underdeveloped capital markets could give some private equity firms the jitters.\n\nFor more on the challenges and opportunities in Myanmar, check out this month\u2019s issue of Private Equity Analyst.\n\nWrite to Sonja Cheung at sonja.cheung@wsj.com Follow her on Twitter @SonjaCheung", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Myanmar is creating buzz among private equity investors looking to catch the first wave of deals in the frontier market as it develops its economy after years as a pariah state.", "title": "Myanmar Creates Buzz, But It\u2019s Not For the Faint Hearted", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/10/29/myanmar-creates-buzz-but-its-not-for-the-faint-hearted/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FG702_MYANMA_P_20141029094309.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Myanmar Creates Buzz, But It\u2019s Not For the Faint Hearted", "description": "Myanmar is creating buzz among private equity investors looking to catch the first wave of deals in the frontier market as it develops its economy after years as a pariah state.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Sonja Cheung", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Myanmar is creating buzz among private equity investors looking to catch the first wave of deals in the frontier market as it develops its economy after years as a pariah state.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-29T13:47:23-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/10/29/myanmar-creates-buzz-but-its-not-for-the-faint-hearted/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-17556", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Myanmar is creating buzz among private equity investors looking to catch the first wave of deals in the frontier market as it develops its economy after years as a pariah state.", "title": "Myanmar Creates Buzz, But It\u2019s Not For the Faint Hearted", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/10/29/myanmar-creates-buzz-but-its-not-for-the-faint-hearted/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FG702_MYANMA_P_20141029094309.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-17556", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-29T14:29:27-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Some private equity firms are seeking to get in on the ground level as Myanmar\u2019s economy gets on track.\nFor more on the challenges and opportunities in Myanmar, check out this month\u2019s issue of Private Equity Analyst.\nAgence France-Presse/Ye Aung ThuMyanmar is creating buzz among private equity investors looking to catch the first wave of deals in the frontier market as it develops its economy after years as a pariah state.\n\u201cMyanmar is not for the faint of heart,\u201d said Tim Dattels, who co-heads TPG\u2019s Asia operations.\nA healthy supply of deals is another benefit to investing in Myanmar, but the question remains: how will firms exit portfolio companies?"}
