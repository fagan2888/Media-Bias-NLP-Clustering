He was 3-for-6 in those games, with a home run, a double and three RBIs.\n\nGonzalez, a three-time Gold Glove winner for his defense, was scheduled to start for the Sky Sox on Wednesday night and Thursday, before returning to Denver on Friday, Weiss said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy who can play anywhere,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very talented outfielder. And he\u2019s played all three.\u201d\n\nWith Gonzalez moving to right field, it leaves the Rockies some shuffling to do.\n\nCorey Dickerson has emerged as an above-average hitter, with a .327 average, .392 on-base percentage and .589 slugging percentage. But his defense is better suited for left field than the more demanding right.\n\nAnd Charlie Blackmon, who has rotated outfield spots and was voted into the All-Star Game for the first time in his career, will likely move back to center. That\u2019s where Blackmon started the season.\n\nThe shuffling likely would leave Drew Stubbs as the fourth outfielder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to go back to mixing and matching,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll find at-bats for everybody.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t quite as tough as it was to start the season because we still have one guy down in Cuddy (Michael Cuddyer, broken shoulder). To start the season we had six outfielders, and that was tough at times. But I\u2019m not concerned about it. Those things have a way of working thmselves out.\u201d\n\nGonzalez had a tumor \u2014 described as a \u201cfatty mass with tentacles\u201d by Rockies head athletic trainer Keith Dugger \u2014 removed from his left index finger on June 10 in Cleveland.\n\nIn 52 games this season, Gonzalez has struggled through a finger injury and knee tendinitis to hit .255, well below his career .296 average. But Weiss said that Gonzalez\u2019s lengthy stint on the DL helped rest and repair his knee.\n\n\u201cHis knee feels a lot better. That\u2019s a silver lining,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Carlos Gonzalez likely switching positions when he returns to Rockies on Friday", "title": "Carlos Gonzalez likely switching positions when he returns to Rockies on Friday", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/09/carlos-gonzalez-likely-switching-positions-when-he-returns-to-rockies-on-friday/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140709__cargop1.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140709__cargop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-09T12:40:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:15:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde62e\"", "article_summary": "Gonzalez will shift to right field when he plays his first game back Friday at Coors Field against the Minnesota Twins.\nAnd he\u2019s played all three.\u201dWith Gonzalez moving to right field, it leaves the Rockies some shuffling to do.\nCarlos Gonzalez, his finger nearly healed after a tumor was removed, will return to the Rockies this week \u2014 but not where he left them.\n\u201cHe profiles well as a right fielder \u2014 prototypical, really.\u201dIn his first two rehab games with the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox, Gonzalez played right field in both.\nIn 52 games this season, Gonzalez has struggled through a finger injury and knee tendinitis to hit .255, well below his career .296 average."}
