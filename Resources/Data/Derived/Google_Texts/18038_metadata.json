Upon completion, the partnership proposal will be handed over to the attorney general for final approval, which is anticipated to take three to six months.\n\nAcquisition\n\nThe strategic partnership between CHS and Metro Health would allow for a balanced board, made up of 50 percent of existing Metro Health board members and 50 percent of board members from CHS. However, in terms of equity ownership, CHS would own 70 to 80 percent of Metro Health.\n\nThe balanced board would \u201cgive the community, ongoing, tremendous say so of future direction\u201d and make sure the community will receive benefits from Metro Health, Faas said.\n\nNational resources\n\nWith CHS, Metro Health would be able to scale.\n\nThe deal would allow the \u201cfinancial handcuffs to come off,\u201d and Metro Health would not be limited to $10 to $15 million in capital, but, rather, larger sums of $50 to $60 million, according to Faas.\n\nThe amount of the population assigned to Metro Health and the operations of the hospital would increase as well, in terms of market share and economies of scale.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world, if you are really trying to get ready for how health care is going to go, you have to start now to position yourself,\u201d Faas said.\n\nObamacare\n\nAs the Affordable Care Act is implemented and changes continue to impact the health care industry, the issue of scale is going to take on a new importance.\n\nFaas said the partnership is a \u201cmatter of strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not pressured to do this,\u201d Faas said. \u201cWe\u2019re not in financial distress. We just had our best year Metro Health Hospital has had in its history.\u201d\n\nIn addition to pursuing a partnership with CHS, Metro Health is also looking at entering the process of due diligence for a quality partner, such as Cleveland Clinic.\n\nMetro Health\n\nMetro Health serves more than 250,000 patients annually and has a 208 bed general acute care hospital in Wyoming.\n\nThe health care system also has 12 neighborhood physician offices throughout the region.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The discussion of a strategic alliance between a health care system and a publicly traded operator of hospitals is moving toward a majority-stake acquisition.
