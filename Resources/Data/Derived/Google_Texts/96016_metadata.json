COSTELLO/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)Buy Photo\n\nFour Ocean County school districts that say they are underfunded by the state Department of Education will have their lawsuit heard next week in a Mercer County courtroom.\n\nThe districts \u2014 Lakewood, Lakehurst, Ocean Township and Little Egg Harbor \u2014 are suing alongside 12 other New Jersey school districts for more state funding through the Department of Education. They say more state money is needed to provide their students \u2014 which are on average poorer than those in the rest of the state \u2014 with a \"thorough and efficient\" education required under the state constitution, according to a news release from the Education Law Center.\n\nHowell to redistrict schools in 2015\n\nThe case, known as the \"Bacon\" lawsuit, began in 2006 after the state Board of Education ruled these schools' funding was inadequate and violated the state constitution. After delays from an appeal and subsequent court proceedings, the schools received increased state financial support in 2009, according to the Education Law Center.\n\nThat victory for the districts was short-lived. State budget cuts in the 2010-11 school year eliminated those increases to the 16 districts, according to the Education Law Center.\n\n12 community colleges to share $15M in funding\n\nThe Education Law Center, which is representing the \"Bacon\" districts in court, said the state should provide more money to these poor school districts for K-12 education and universal preschool for their 3- and 4-year-old children.\n\nThe Law Center plans to ask Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson to order state Acting Education Commissioner David Hespe to provide an additional $18.5 million in funding for education and preschool in these districts. Arguments in the case will begin in state Superior Court in Mercer County on Dec. 11.\n\nAmanda Oglesby: 732-557-5701; aoglesby@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1rOo3TK", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Sixteen poor New Jersey schools - including four in Ocean County - are suing the New Jersey Department of Education for more state funding.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Sixteen poor New Jersey schools - including four in Ocean County - are suing the New Jersey Department of Education for more state funding.", "title": "Four local schools sue for more state money", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/education/in-our-schools/2014/12/01/four-ocean-county-schools-sue-nj-department-education-state-money/19747955/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sixteen poor New Jersey schools - including four in Ocean County - are suing the New Jersey Department of Education for more state funding.", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ecd93fa498e7efddb72e387f817f3427bca2681f/c=411-0-1989-1578&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/12/01/B9315328442Z.1_20141201174736_000_GL399OM45.1-0.jpg", "title": "Four Ocean County schools sue NJ Department of Education for more state money", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "www.facebook.com/amanda.oglesby.njpress"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Bacon districts, Department of Education, NJ schools sue Dept. of Education, NJ DOE, bacon lawsuit, poor schools, state funding formula"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd95e\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: THOMAS P.
