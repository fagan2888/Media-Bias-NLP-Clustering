Just in time for Halloween, the group behind that creepy Uncle Sam anti-Obamacare video -- the one where he's lurking over a female patient's legs -- is offering those masks to the masses. They're doling out masks and perhaps some cash to young people willing to participate in a video contest.

The "Creepy Contest" kicks off with the masks being sent out this Friday and the winners announced on Halloween. Interested participants can sign up online. The idea is to create a video that shows how the "government is creeping" into people's lives. The original viral video, for example, featured the tagline, "Don't Let Government Play Doctor," while Uncle Sam lurked in a gynecologist's office.

Generation Opportunity, the conservative group who came up with Creepy Uncle Sam and created the Opt Out of Obamacare campaign, will award $5,000 to the first place video contest finisher and money for other top spoofs too.
