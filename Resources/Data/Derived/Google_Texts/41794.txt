The private equity portfolio of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. reported lower income and revenue from a year ago, according to the New York bank’s third quarter earnings release today.

The portfolio, which consists primarily of the portfolio of One Equity Partners, the direct buyout arm that J.P. Morgan is reducing its stake in, was also being valued below cost.

The private equity portfolio posted net income of $71 million on revenue of $281 million for the third quarter. For the same 2013 period, net income and revenue from the unit were $242 million and $398 million, respectively.

J.P. Morgan as a whole returned to profit during the quarter, posting net income of $5.57 billion, reversing a year-ago loss of $380 million.

Lower investment gains contributed to the private equity portfolio being valued at around $5.39 billion at the end of the quarter, lower than a cost of $6.01 billion.

The below-cost valuation was primarily due to investments in privately held businesses, which were valued at $4.28 billion at the end of the quarter, compared with a $5.05 billion cost.

Publicly held securities and third-party fund investments were both valued above cost, at $617 million and $496 million, respectively. The costs for public securities and fund investments were $479 million and $484 million, respectively.

In August, J.P. Morgan reached a deal to sell roughly half its interest in One Equity’s portfolio companies to secondary private equity firms Lexington Partners and Carlyle Group’s AlpInvest Partners. The deal values the companies the bank is selling at around $2 billion.
