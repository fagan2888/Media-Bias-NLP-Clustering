Gallagher; Jim Henderson of Assured Partners; Powell Brown of Brown & Brown; Marty Hughes of Hub International; David Eslick of Marsh & McLennan Agency; and Mike Sicard of USI.\n\nThe six leaders reported strong acquisition pipelines and collectively projected they hope to acquire more than $1 billion in revenue in the coming year.\n\nKevin Stipe, president of Reagan Consulting, told attendees that his firm has \u201cnever seen valuations as strong as they are today.\u201d\n\nStipe told the gathering that his firm that widespread buyer demand is responsible for pushing acquistion multiples to record levels.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing today to suggest that valuations will be going down any time soon, Stipe said.\n\nStipe said high deal multiples have jumped another 10% during the past 18 months.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of demand among all buyer groups, but private equity buyers are now most active \u2013 43% of all acquisitions in 2014,\u201d Stipe said.\n\nHowever, the bright outlook is not entirely unqualified.\n\nRecruiting and retaining staff remains a top challenge for agencies and brokerage firms \u2013 particularly those hoping to perpetuate internally. Reagan Consulting suggests that 60% of agencies are under-recruiting, which is a \u201clong-term threat to growth, profitability and perpetuation,\u201d Stipe said.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have young, up-and-coming producers in your shop, perpetuation will become impossible,\u201d he warned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The market conditions for brokerage and agency principals who are looking to sell their firms has never been better, according to several industry merger and", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "The market conditions for brokerage and agency principals who are looking to sell their firms has never been better, according to several industry merger and acquisition experts.", "title": "Experts say values paid for insurance agencies have \u2018never been higher\u2019", "url": "http://ifawebnews.com/2015/05/13/experts-say-values-paid-for-insurance-agencies-have-never-been-higher/", "image": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Kevin-Stipe_-reagan-consulting.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-13T14:40:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-18T14:55:55+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "Fve8IDDdj94aX4Ar18+v33qGgAesGnY2YiqbnR5P17I="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ac3\"", "article_summary": "Values being paid for insurance agencies and brokerage firms have \u201cnever been higher,\u201d Bobby Reagan, CEO of Reagan Consulting, told a group of 150 insurance industry leaders who attended a three-day workshop in Atlanta co-sponsored by the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers.\nReagan Consulting suggests that 60% of agencies are under-recruiting, which is a \u201clong-term threat to growth, profitability and perpetuation,\u201d Stipe said.\nRecruiting and retaining staff remains a top challenge for agencies and brokerage firms \u2013 particularly those hoping to perpetuate internally.\nA conference highlight was a panel of the CEOs of six of the most active buyers: Pat Gallagher of Arthur J.
