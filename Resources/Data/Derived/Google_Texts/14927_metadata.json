This is the 79-year-old who likes his constitution \"dead, dead, dead,\" after all. Here are five of his most colorful\u2014and acerbic\u2014dissents.\n\nSee also: Obama will have a hard time replacing Antonin Scalia, to put it mildly\n\nObamacare: King v. Burwell\n\nIn June 2015, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to keep Obamacare intact. With his signature literary flair, Scalia shaped a dissent that satisfied both Harry Potter fans and conservatives alike.\n\nThe Court\u2019s next bit of interpretive jiggery-pokery involves other parts of the Act that purportedly presuppose the availability of tax credits on both federal and state Exchanges. It is curious that the Court is willing to subordinate the express words of the section that grants tax credits to the mere implications of other provisions with only tangential connections to tax credits. One would think that interpretation would work the other way around.\n\nAnd then he added a cherry on top with another colorful term for rubbish:\n\nQualified individuals receive favored treatment on Exchanges, although customers who are not qualified individuals may also shop there. The Court claims that the Act must equate federal and state establishment of Exchanges when it defines a qualified individual as someone who (among other things) lives in the \"State that established the Exchange\". Otherwise, the Court says, there would be no qualified individuals on federal Exchanges, contradicting (for example) the provision requiring every Exchange to take the \"\u2018interests of qualified individuals\u2019\" into account when selecting health plans. Pure applesauce.\n\nGay marriage: Obergefell v. Hodges\n\nCarlos McKnight of Washington, waves a flag in support of gay marriage outside of the Supreme Court in Washington, Friday June 26, 2015.

Hodges, Scalia used a footnote to deliver quite the diss pointed squarely at Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion's opening lines.\n\nIf, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: \"The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that all persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,\" I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.\n\nArizona immigration: Arizona, et al., v. United States\n\nTanya Hernandez, 4, demonstrates at a pro-immigration rally with others with the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights, Tuesday June 26, 2012 at City Hall in Los Angeles. The group was reacting to Monday's Supreme Court decision to overturn three parts of the Arizona law but uphold a section that requires police to check the status of people who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Image: Nick Ut/Associated Press\n\nIn June 2012, the Supreme Court ruled 5-3 to invalidate three provisions of an Arizona immigration law known as S.B. 1070. Scalia's dissent was described as \"blistering\" and at one point he went so far as to say that states would have never joined the Union if they could conceive of such a Supreme Court decision back in the day.\n\nThrough ratification of the fundamental charter that the Convention produced, the States ceded much of their sovereignty to the Federal Government. But much of it remained jealously guarded\u2014as reflected in the innumerable proposals that never left Independence Hall. Now, imagine a provision\u2014perhaps inserted right after Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 4, the Naturalization Clause\u2014which included among the enumerated powers of Congress \u201cTo establish Limitations upon Immigration that will be exclusive and that will be enforced only to the extent the President deems appropriate.\u201d The delegates to the Grand Convention would have rushed to the exits.\n\nIndiana nudity laws: Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.\n\nIn June 1991, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that states have the right to ban public nudity and doing so does not violate the freedom of expression. Scalia imagined quite a sight in the Indianapolis Hoosier Dome in his opinion as he reasoned \"that moral opposition to nudity supplies a rational basis for its prohibition.\"\n\nPerhaps the dissenters believe that \"offense to others\" ought to be the only reason for restricting nudity in public places generally, but there is no basis for thinking that our society has ever shared that Thoreauvian \"you-may-do-what-you-like-so-long-as-it-does-not-injure-someone-else\" beau ideal - much less for thinking that it was written into the Constitution. The purpose of Indiana's nudity law would be violated, I think, if 60,000 fully consenting adults crowded into the Hoosierdome to display their genitals to one another, even if there were not an offended innocent in the crowd.\n\nUpholding the right to abortion: Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey\n\nPeople protest outside of Planned Parenthood on Wednesday, Sept. 23, 2015, in Jackson, Mich. Image: Nick Gonzales/Jackson Citizen Patriot via A/Associated Press\n\nIn June 1992, the Supreme Court upheld Roe v. Wade, 5-4, and with it the right to abortion. In his dissent opinion, Scalia commented on the \"abortion umpiring business.\"\n\nAt the same time, Roe created a vast new class of abortion consumers and abortion proponents by eliminating the moral opprobrium that had attached to the act. (\"If the Constitution guarantees abortion, how can it be bad?\"\u2014not an accurate line of thought, but a natural one.) Many favor all of those developments, and it is not for me to say that they are wrong. But to portray Roe as the statesmanlike \"settlement\" of a divisive issue, a jurisprudential Peace of Westphalia that is worth preserving, is nothing less than Orwellian. Roe fanned into life an issue that has inflamed our national politics in general, and has obscured with its smoke the selection of Justices to this Court in particular, ever since. And by keeping us in the abortion umpiring business, it is the perpetuation of that disruption, rather than of any pax Roeana, that the Court's new majority decrees.\n\nPartial birth abortions: Stenberg v. Carhart\n\nIn this 2000 case, the Supreme Court built off its decisions in Casey and Roe and struck down, 5-4, a Nebraska law criminalizing partial birth abortions. Scalia was forceful in his dissent, decrying: \"Case closed.\"\n\nIt is a value judgment, dependent upon how much one respects (or believes society ought to respect) the life of a partially delivered fetus, and how much one respects (or believes society ought to respect) the freedom of the woman who gave it life to kill it. Evidently, the five Justices in today's majority value the former less, or the latter more, (or both), than the four of us in dissent. Case closed.\n\nAdditional reporting by Katie Dupere.\n\nHave something to add to this story?
