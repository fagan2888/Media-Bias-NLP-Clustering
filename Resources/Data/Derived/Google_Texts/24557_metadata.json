Not that that\u2019s anything new, but sometimes videos are released that ride a wave of popularity and are used by both sides of the \u2018gender war\u2019 to highlight their points of view. This one was no different, enticing cheers of \u2018totally\u2019 and jeers of \u2018absolutely not\u2019 in equal measure. It was titled 48 things women hear in a lifetime (that men just don\u2019t) and it was a video of various women saying 48 various sentences that, supposedly, men just aren\u2019t subjected to. A few weeks later, an equivalent video was released that followed the same format but was called 48 things men hear in a lifetime (that are bad for everyone). The intention was to promote how much we still \u2018need\u2019 feminism, even in 2015 (or 2016 now). Of course, as educational and insightful as both videos intended to be, it also gave us a couple of \u2018dafuq\u2019 moments, particularly as some of the things that men \u2018just don\u2019t hear\u2019 spouted in the women\u2019s video were, confusingly, repeated in the men\u2019s video. I\u2019ll get into the details a bit later but I want to look at the idea of \u2018things that (insert demographic here) hear that (insert equivalent demographic here) simply don\u2019t\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a simple concept: a group of women get together and inform us of sentences, statements, questions and judgments that are directed at women that men seem to escape. Its intention is to tell us how much \u2018everyday sexism\u2019 women have to deal with as they navigate their way through life. The problem, as always, is the lens through which we are told this information. Whether you\u2019re talking about the female or male version of these statements, it\u2019s still presented entirely through a feminist perspective. That will become clear later when we look at some of the statements in question.\n\nThe problem I have with that is the problem I have with a lot of stuff that comes from an ideological point of view \u2013 its focus is incredibly narrow and cannot begin to claim it comes from anything different. A feminist perspective on life is a feminist perspective on life; it comes from a place that is already influenced by a set of beliefs. It\u2019s something that everyone and everything is chained to. You can\u2019t label yourself and then claim your beliefs or statements are anything other than linked back to that ideology or belief system.\n\nI\u2019m staunchly anti-feminist as an ideology, or at the very least I believe in the philosophy of \u2018don\u2019t be a dick\u2019, so I\u2019m well aware that everything I say is up for debate, up for criticism. I don\u2019t mind that. Not at all. In fact, it\u2019s something I welcome, and it\u2019s something that I know I need to be open to lest I want to develop a severe case of tunnel vision. My problem with these videos, and indeed a lot of things feminism throws at us, is the absolutist nature of the stuff they share. These videos show us things that men \u2018simply don\u2019t hear\u2019, presenting it like the gospel truth. Well, what if I disagree with them?\n\nWhat if I, as a man, have heard some of these things directed at me? The sense of absolute truth that feminism works with is also one of its weakest facets. If one man hears one of the sentences put forward in the female version of this video then the whole argument that is being presented crumbles.\n\nPen Jillette, the magician, said about magic that \u2018once one thing is seen to be phony the whole thing crumbles, and it crumbles completely.\u2019 This is what these videos do. By presenting them as absolute truth not up for debate, it actually serves as its own downfall.\n\nThe problem of course is that it doesn\u2019t matter if the argument is negated in any way because no-one actually listens. Any and all criticism of feminism equals misogyny or some other buzzword. It\u2019s impossible to criticise anything feminist, especially as a man, without being told it\u2019s because you\u2019re scared of your privilege being taken away, or you\u2019re scared of not being able to dominate women, or you\u2019re just a misogynist neckbeard virgin scumbag loser anyway. Therein lies the beauty of their tactics \u2013 they can say whatever they want and claim it as absolute because anything else is simply a display of misogyny. Say what you want; that\u2019s genius.\n\nI don\u2019t want to go through all 48 of the statements because that would take forever, but Bustle\u2019s craving to paint women as victims of their own existence is cringe worthy and, to those who truly believe feminism is an all-positive drive for change, unnecessarily divisive.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to posit the idea that not all of these statements are inherently sexist. It would appear that, sometimes, genuine questions are indicative of the \u2018endemic\u2019 nature of misogyny that still permeates the post-millennial age. Things like \u2018are you planning on working after the baby\u2019s born?\u2019 or \u2018stop being such an attention whore\u2019 are not, in my eyes, a question of sexism at all. Why is it an example of misogyny to ask a woman if she\u2019s going back to work after she has a baby? I mean, sure, para-linguistics are pretty important here and I can see the tone of voice used in this video is one of disapproval, but the question itself seems pretty genuine. Of course, tone of voice is important and I\u2019m not doubting some women have faced disapproval for wanting to return to work but the question itself is as valid as any other work-related one. I mean, the fact that stay at home mums exist suggest that it\u2019s a question worth asking. I know a fair few women who have had children and returned to work part time. Simply asking the question isn\u2019t automatically a negative. Of course, that\u2019s not the case if you automatically treat women as victims.\n\nAs for the tagline \u2018that men just don\u2019t\u2019, it\u2019s pretty obvious in some cases why men don\u2019t get asked the same questions. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t sexist attitudes towards men that permeate society, it just means they aren\u2019t always 100% equivalent. Sometimes, an apples to apples comparison just doesn\u2019t work. For example, no-one asks a man if he\u2019s planning on working after the birth of his child because it\u2019s simply assumed that he will do. Men in the UK only get 2 weeks paternity leave; women can have up to a year off. The lack of consideration for a differing, yet equally presumptive and discriminatory, point of view when it comes to child birth and child rearing is part of the reason paternity leave is such a waste in the UK. If it\u2019s sexist to simply ask if women are planning on working then it\u2019s just as sexist to simply assume men will return to work. As before, it all depends on how the question is asked, but with paternity leave being as risible as it is in the UK, it actively forces men to return to work, lest they quit their jobs and take the financial hit. That point of view makes it into the video about men but, as predictably as ever, it focuses on the negative attitude towards stay-at-home dads for doing the \u2018feminine role\u2019 rather than taking on the more appropriate \u2018man as provider\u2019 clich\u00e9.\n\nThere are also questions that serve no purpose other than to drown women in victimhood. This is one of the facets about feminism I despise the most. Not only does the tagline turn out to be blatantly untrue, it broadly brushes every single woman on the planet under its bristles and completely ignores not only the fact men actually do suffer the same indignities but also that they cannot speak for every woman on the planet. Take, for example, the phrase \u2018You don\u2019t want to go out with me? You\u2019re ugly anyway!\u2019 The article posts this as the reasoning for including that statement:\n\nThere are some men who seem to think that women never get rejected. It might just be because society tells women that rejection is something we have to accept and deal with, while it tells men that they are entitled to women\u2019s time and attention. Men never have to deal with a woman lashing out because a guy wasn\u2019t interested, but women deal with that from men all the time.\n\nI\u2019m not going to get on my soapbox about who gets rejected more (hint: it\u2019s probably men), but this insidious idea that women are \u2018taught\u2019 that rejection is something they have to deal with while men are \u2018taught\u2019 they are owed women\u2019s attention is blatantly untrue. First of all, to slightly paraphrase a feminist buzzword, telling a man (me, for example) what it\u2019s like to be a man is womansplaining. I\u2019m not doubting women get rejected; I\u2019ve done it myself. The idea that a) society tells us we are \u2018owed\u2019 women\u2019s time and b) that we never have to deal with women lashing out is such a dismissive statement to make that it serves no purpose other than to tell men that their experiences are nothing to worry about and to tell women that they are nothing, have been nothing and will be nothing but victims for their entire existence.\n\nNot only that, but, to borrow an Americanism, if I had a dime for every time I\u2019d been on the receiving end of abuse after showing even the slightest interest in a woman then I\u2019d be a fairly wealthy man. \u2018Eurgh, why would I want to go out with him?!\u2019 OK, so it\u2019s not the exact same wording as the video uses, but the concept is exactly the same. The perception that women don\u2019t react badly to being rejected appears to be nothing more than an attempt to whitewash any unsavoury behaviour women do display. It\u2019s hard to claim victimhood if you have to admit the victims can also be the perpetrators.\n\nThe point of all this isn\u2019t to say women don\u2019t face sexism or that they don\u2019t experience any uncomfortable or awkward situations due to their gender. I\u2019m absolutely positive they do and me claiming otherwise does nothing than make my own journalistic integrity appear fragile. It\u2019s simply to say that, for me, the whole \u2018feminism is for everyone\u2019 mantra is an absolute lie. Feminism only cares about me when it can view my victim status through its own distorted lens. It only cares about me when it can also include women in male victimhood. It only seems to care about me when it can spin my problems to be a result of being \u2018too feminine\u2019 or \u2018embodying feminine traits\u2019 that we deem as weak or undesirable. It dismisses my experiences to elevate those of women. It\u2019s unwilling, or unable, to see a differing perspective that doesn\u2019t fit into their agenda.\n\nUltimately, I see nothing in modern feminism that is of benefit to me, and even if there was, it\u2019s so lost in a mire of misguided attempts to cure my inherent \u2018toxicity\u2019 that I see no reason to believe the intention behind it is anything other than questionable. I have my own experiences, the sooner feminists actually start listening instead of assuming they already know is the day I\u2019ll start to believe there\u2019s something for me in their movement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Salmon explains why modern feminism victimizes women and does nothing for men.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "John Salmon explains why modern feminism victimizes women and does nothing for men.", "title": "Why Modern Feminism Does Nothing To Benefit Men - The Libertarian Republic", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Absolute-Equality-of-the-Sexes.jpg", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/why-modern-feminism-does-nothing-to-benefit-men/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Salmon explains why modern feminism victimizes women and does nothing for men.", "title": "Why Modern Feminism Does Nothing To Benefit Men", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Absolute-Equality-of-the-Sexes.jpg", "creator": "@johnsalmonworld", "site": "@thelibrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "section": "Free Style", "tag": "masculinity", "published_time": "2016-01-18T15:50:11+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/john.salmon.7906"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As for the tagline \u2018that men just don\u2019t\u2019, it\u2019s pretty obvious in some cases why men don\u2019t get asked the same questions.\nThese videos show us things that men \u2018simply don\u2019t hear\u2019, presenting it like the gospel truth.\nMy problem with these videos, and indeed a lot of things feminism throws at us, is the absolutist nature of the stuff they share.\nThe point of all this isn\u2019t to say women don\u2019t face sexism or that they don\u2019t experience any uncomfortable or awkward situations due to their gender.\nThe perception that women don\u2019t react badly to being rejected appears to be nothing more than an attempt to whitewash any unsavoury behaviour women do display."}
