Earlier this month, U.S. Sen. Mike Lee sent a letter to Bureau of Land Management Director Neil Kornze regarding his concern for the future of the Bonneville Salt Flats in light of \"the last-minute cancellations of several international land-speed race events.\" And on the homefront, Gov. Gary Herbert composed his own letter to Kornze, requesting that the BLM \"engage in an effort to start an immediate restoration program.\"\n\n\"Our alarm is amplified because the Bureau of Land Management, which is responsible for the care and protection of this national historic landmark, has long identified the internationally famous speedway as an area of critical environmental concern,\" Herbert said, \"and yet the Bonneville Salt Flats are not only severely damaged, but are, in fact, approaching ruin.\"\n\nThis movement isn't all talk, either; there's real political action involved, Sullivan said. A special interest group in Washington is working to introduce a bill to Congress that would \"get the BLM\" to make a plan to save the salt flats, he said. Locally, state Rep. Steve Handy, R-Layton, has said he intends to introduce a resolution that would support the restoration of the salt flats.\n\nRacers hope that mining the political complex for support will put pressure on the BLM, which Sullivan said has \"totally ignored\" the racing community and the salt flats.\n\nBut Wendover Mayor Mike Crawford said the racing community might be overstating its own importance \u2014 possibly at the expense of Wendover residents.\n\n\"Racers seem to jump over us, too,\" he said, pointing out that the racing community went straight to the city's representatives to speak on the city's behalf. \"Those aren't your senators, they're ours.\"\n\nRacers, he said, \"can't forget that this is our backyard.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nTop priority \u2022 The BLM is \"committed to responsibly maintaining\" the salt flats, spokeswoman Megan Crandall said in a statement, and is looking forward to \"continued collaboration with our many partners and stakeholders to ensure the salt flats remain protected.\"\n\nThe racing community has more specific plans in mind and hopes the political attention will spur the BLM to implement three projects the racers believe will reverse the decline of the salt flats.\n\nFirst on the list would be revising current mineral leases to require that companies mining salts for the minerals contained within them pump at least a million tons of salt brine back onto the salt flats every year.\n\nBrine-pumping began in the late 1990s as a voluntary experiment conducted by the BLM and several potash mining companies. But follow-up surveys conducted in the 2000s found no discernible increase in the depth of the salt crust, and the experiment was formally abandoned, although Intrepid Potash continues to voluntarily pump salt brine back onto the flats.\n\nSullivan insists brine-pumping does work \u2014 and the supposed failure comes down to a difference in what scientists and racers have in mind when they talk about the flats' \"salt crust.\"\n\nGeologists consider the \"salt crust\" as comprising many different layers of material, including the sticky mud that lies below the topmost layer of hard, consolidated salt. But, to the racers, the only thing that matters is the depth and stability of that upper layer, Sullivan said.\n\nAnd that upper layer did benefit from the pumping, Sullivan said, so much so that some of the best racing in decades took place in the early 2000s.\n\n\"It's proven that [brine-pumping] does make a difference in the salt,\" Sullivan said. \"And that's something that can be done right away, because the infrastructure is already in place.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Growing numbers of Utah politicians have lent their support to a push for immediate federal action to preserve the Bonneville Salt Flats, but Wendover\u2019s mayor isn\u2019t sure the movement reflects his community\u2019s interests or is ...", "copyright": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "author": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "title": "Wendover mayor wary as politicians join campaign for Utah's iconic Bonneville Salt Flats", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.sltrib.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=aR9NihWTABbmuEgy8tEXlM$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYvCWqdiax3zVjPRaVptjYHAWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "url": "http://www.sltrib.com/home/3234578-155/wendover-mayor-wary-as-politicians-join", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Blm,Brine,Community,Crawford,Flats,Racers,Racing,Salt,Sullivan,Wendover,Emma Penrod  |"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Growing numbers of Utah politicians have lent their support to a push for immediate federal action to preserve the Bonneville Salt Flats, but Wendover\u2019s mayor isn\u2019t sure the movement reflects his community\u2019s interests or is ...", "title": "Wendover mayor wary as politicians join campaign for Utah's iconic Bonneville Salt Flats", "url": "http://www.sltrib.com/home/3234578-155/wendover-mayor-wary-as-politicians-join", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "SL Tribune", "iphone": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "googleplay": "The Salt Lake Tribune"}, "id": {"ipad": "id434734447", "iphone": "id396990949", "googleplay": "com.sltrib.news"}}, "site": "@sltrib", "image": "http://www.sltrib.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=74W_TwXnomQdmWBtgwpyuc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYujnZc5YnfRZqZbU8nLou6WWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/saltlaketribune"}, "news_keywords": "Blm,Brine,Community,Crawford,Flats,Racers,Racing,Salt,Sullivan,Wendover,Emma Penrod  |", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "GOOGLEBOT": "index,follow"}, "article_summary": "But Wendover Mayor Mike Crawford said the racing community might be overstating its own importance \u2014 possibly at the expense of Wendover residents.\nLocally, state Rep.
