Envision Healthcare Holdings (EVHC) comes to the rescue on both fronts.\n\nThe Colorado-based company is a leading player in staffing hospital emergency departments through its EmCare division and providing medical transport through American Medical Response, or AMR.\n\nBoth businesses have \u201cbrand recognition,\u201d said Envision Chief Executive William Sanger, who has been overseeing both as CEO since 2005.\n\nEnvision went public last year, for the second time \u2014 two years after a private-equity firm had taken it private again. But the firm\u2019s roots go back much further.\n\nEmCare, the larger business of the two, was founded in 1972, two decades before AMR. At first it provided emergency-department staffing and related services to hospitals in Texas. But acquisitions broadened its reach nationwide.\n\nNow more of EmCare\u2019s growth is organic rather than acquired.\n\nDoctors On Call\n\nHospitals can buy single services or bundled packages to meet their staffing needs. EmCare can provide ER physicians, trauma surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiologists and \u201chospitalists\u201d \u2014 doctors who give care in the hospital after an initial episode is treated.\n\n\u201cThey have really differentiated themselves with their bundled offerings. And that\u2019s led to industry leading organic growth,\u201d said analyst Richard Close of Avondale Partners.\n\nHe says Envision\u2019s new contracts are growing 13% to 15% annually. In contrast, chief rival Team Health Holdings (TMH) is primarily growing through acquisitions, he says.\n\nOn the medical transportation side, competition is fragmented. About 50% of 911 emergency requests are handled by local fire departments, the other half by private ambulance services, Sanger says.\n\nNot only is Envision\u2019s AMR the largest of its kind in the country, it has been \u201cbenefiting from financial woes of some competitors,\u201d says Jason Gurda, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\nFor example, one of its largest rivals, Rural/Metro, declared bankruptcy last year. More recently, a smaller rival \u201cwent out of business overnight,\u201d he said.\n\nSanger says AMR has \u201cseveral hundred 911 contracts and literally thousands of relationships with hospitals,\u201d the latter for transporting patients to facilities such as dialysis centers and nursing homes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified protocols to improve survival rates,\u201d Sanger said of its ambulance service. AMR gets high marks in cardiac survival and is looking to improve stroke survival rates.\n\nBoth of Envision\u2019s core businesses are getting modest boosts from health care reform under the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s translating into more patients, more revenue and more profit,\u201d Sanger said of expanded insurance coverage under ObamaCare.\n\nThe 20% of patients who weren\u2019t able to pay for ambulance services or emergency-room visits is now closer to 18% because of ObamaCare, he says.\n\n\u201cGenerally the positive impact from the Affordable Care Act has been a shift from the uninsured into Medicaid,\u201d Close said.\n\nHealth care reform has also put a sharper focus on integrated health care, which is a positive for Envision. Reimbursement based on outcomes or quality metrics has \u201cpositioned Envision to be a partner to hospital systems,\u201d Gurda said.\n\nThat\u2019s because EmCare provides a more integrated approach to health care than the fragmented care typically delivered by hospital staffs, he says.\n\n\u201cOne of the things EmCare does well is help those partners achieve quality outcomes. Part of it is being focused \u2014 making that a key operational point for employees. And it\u2019s invested quite a bit on the (information technology) side,\u201d Gurda said.\n\nNew Hospital Deals\n\nSuch strategies have led to a growing number of contract wins with hospitals, which in turn is driving much of the company\u2019s revenue growth. Revenue year-over-year has grown in double digits for seven straight quarters.\n\nEmCare has around 750 individual contracts with hospitals or hospital systems, Sanger says. Its largest ones are with Hospital Corporation of America, or HCA Holdings (HCA), and Baylor Health Care System in Texas.\n\nEmCare generated net revenue of $690 million in the second quarter, a 21.2% gain over the prior year. AMR\u2019s revenue rose 16.7% to $385.3 million, its strongest performance in years.\n\nTotal revenue in the second quarter jumped 19.6% from the earlier year to $1.08 billion. Adjusted earnings were 28 cents a share, up from the equivalent of 5 cents in the prior year.\n\nBased on improving financial results this year, Envision raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $1.15 to $1.20 from $1.10 to $1.15 previously. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year revenue to climb 17% over last year to nearly $4.4 billion and per-share earnings to rise 73% to $1.17.\n\nAftercare Opportunity\n\nA third business, called Evolution Health, is in early development. It currently generates just a small amount of revenue, Sanger says.\n\nEvolution embraces a \u201ccontinuum of care\u201d model, he says, which seeks to manage patients\u2019 health care after they are discharged from a hospital.\n\n\u201cWe started an integrated-care model in the hospital so we\u2019re taking it to another level,\u201d Sanger said.\n\nEvolution has been lining up work with health plans to manage their most seriously ill customers and has already hired roughly 1,500 clinicians.\n\nStarting in January, Envision\u2019s Evolution will spearhead six pilot programs in conjunction with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, involving the \u201csickest patients,\u201d Sanger says.\n\nHe thinks Evolution will grow quickly over the next five to seven years.\n\n\u201cIt could be the size of our other two services,\u201d Sanger said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital emergency rooms have their hands full providing care.
