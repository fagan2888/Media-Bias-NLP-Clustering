Stay Work Play to host its second annual community involvement campaign



Stay Work Play will host its second annual Stay Work Play Give on April 20 during which young, professional New Hampshire networks will host six nonprofit fairs throughout the state.



The goal of the campaign is to encourage students and young professionals to become civically engaged in their communities by volunteering with local nonprofits.



While networking with participating nonprofits and learning more about their organization, attendees will also be able to sign up for committee and board member openings, direct service opportunities and event and general volunteer positions.



“Volunteering is a great way to meet a variety of people with similar interests as well as to establish and expand your network and build your resume,” said Kate Luczko, Stay Work Play’s President and CEO.



This year’s events are:



• Catapult, Seacoast from 5 to 7 p.m., at the Community Campus, 100 Campus Drive, Portsmouth.



• Concord Young Professionals Network from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center, 2 Institute Drive, Concord;
