(Isaac Brekken / AP)\n\n\"The disappointment is that you've got 12 players in (the locker room) crying,\" said the third-year CSU coach, who missed out on a $200,000 bonus for not making the field of 68. \"We're certainly one of the best 68 teams in the country. Obviously the committee didn't feel that way.\"\n\nEustachy then stood up, took his microphone off and offered a little bit more explanation about why he didn't take questions.\n\n\"I just don't want to say anything right now, but we can get together (later),\" he said. \"I know you all came here, but again I apologize, but I've got to console, and that's what it's all about. It's not about me or anybody else, it's about this team. They're devastated, and they should be, because they're certainly an NCAA Tournament team. I respect the committee's decision. I didn't see it that way.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCSU has plenty of wins, a program-record 27 (one of which was against a Division II opponent). And it didn't have many losses either, six, and just one against teams outside the top 100.\n\nBut Eustachy's team lacked quality wins, especially on the road, with just two victories against the RPI top 50 \u2014 at home over co-regular season Mountain West champions San Diego State and Boise State, which both made the field. The Broncos snuck in as an 11 seed and will face 11th-seeded Dayton in a play-in game Wednesday; the Aztecs are an 8 seed and will face ninth-seeded St. John's on Friday.\n\nCSU players were unavailable for comment, but some of them did take to Twitter to express their opinions.\n\n\"I don't understand...what did we do wrong\" wrote forward Tiel Daniels from his account, @_Tiel_.\n\nI don't understand...what did we do wrong \u2014 Dantiel Daniels (@_Tiel_) March 15, 2015\n\n\"We deserve more respect,\" guard Gian Clavell wrote from his account, @calvelito04.\n\nWe deserve more respect. \u2014 Gian Louis Clavell (@clavelito04) March 15, 2015\n\nEustachy said after the Rams' loss over SDSU in the semifinals of the MW tournament on Friday that he didn't even think the Rams were on the bubble. It turns out they not only were, but on the wrong side of it.\n\nEustachy was so confident his team would make it, he sat all-conference forward J.J. Avila (sprained ankle) in the semifinal loss, even though the coach said the senior was healthy enough to play.\n\n\"We're not on the bubble,\" Eustachy said then. \"We're 28 RPI. I've been through this a lot, and we're squarely in the NCAA tournament.\"\n\nThe Rams didn't do themselves a ton of favors with a non-conference strength of schedule of 77 that didn't include a single opponent in the top 50. A down season by rival Colorado didn't help. The Buffs are 114 in the RPI but entered the season a spot out of the AP Top 25.\n\nCSU's top RPI win away from Moby was an overtime win at New Mexico State, which has an RPI of 107.\n\nWhile the Rams were the highest-ranked team in the RPI left out of the tournament, they weren't if you look at other ratings like KenPom.com, which has CSU ranked 68, behind 18 other teams that didn't make the field.\n\n\"When you think about Colorado State, their RPI was fairly strong but the other metrics that we use weren't nearly as high in terms of ranking,\" selection committee chair Scott Barnes said on a conference call. \"That and then lack of any true road wins against teams in the top 100 were also a factor.\"\n\nIn addition to KenPom, which rates teams based on points per possession and strength of opponent, Barnes said the committee also compared teams' RPI to other ratings like ESPN's BPI and Jeff Sagarin's ratings, which CSU was 57th in both.\n\n\"We look at RPI really as an organizer in terms of top 50 and 100, but we spent a lot of time, more time than I remember, in comparing that in the swings to metrics such as the Sagarin, Ken Pom, BPI,\" Barnes said. \"Those are used in the room as well and talked about quite extensively. We review those metrics each week, and that carried over to this week.\"\n\nAs one of the last four teams left out of the NCAA Tournament, Colorado State received a No. 1 seed in the NIT and will host South Dakota State at 8 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nTeams that beat out CSU for one of the final 36 at-large bids and are headed for play-in games include Boise State, Dayton, BYU and Mississippi. CSU has an RPI better than all four, but is ranked below each in KenPom.\n\nThe Rams also got passed over by power five conference teams like UCLA, Indiana, Texas and Georgia.\n\nCSU probably has the biggest gripe with UCLA. Like the Rams, the Bruins also have just two wins against teams in the RPI top 50; however, UCLA also has three losses to teams outside the top 100 (compared to one by CSU).\n\nThe Bruins' win at Stanford (RPI 60), though, is better than any road win the Rams had. UCLA also had a strength of schedule of 29, compared to CSU's, which was 118.\n\nSean Star: 970-669-5050, sstar@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/seanvstar", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-03-15T16:49:30-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0315/20150315__16rhsCSUSelectionSundayw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Sean Star \n \n  Reporter-Herald Sports Writer", "description": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Colorado State thought it was a lock for the NCAA Tournament.\nThe selection committee didn't, and when the bracket was released Sunday, the Rams were nowhere to be found.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:27717642:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0315/20150315__16rhsCSUSelectionSundayw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Colorado State thought it was a lock for the NCAA Tournament.\nThe selection committee didn't, and when the bracket was released Sunday, the Rams were nowhere to be found.", "title": "Colorado State misses out on NCAA Tournament"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Colorado State thought it was a lock for the NCAA Tournament.\nThe selection committee didn't, and when the bracket was released Sunday, the Rams were nowhere to be found.", "title": "Colorado State misses out on NCAA Tournament", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0315/20150315__16rhsCSUSelectionSundayw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-15T16:49:30-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Colorado State misses out on NCAA Tournament", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0315/20150315__16rhsCSUSelectionSundayw~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Sean StarReporter-Herald", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "modificationDate": "2015-03-15T21:39:27-0600", "endDate": "2025-03-15T18:29:05-0600", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2015-03-15T16:54:36-0600", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sports news, Loveland Colorado Sports news, Loveland Colorado news, Sports Loveland news, Sports Colorado news, US Sports news, world Sports news."}, "article_summary": "Despite a program-record 27 wins, Colorado State did not make the NCAA Tournament.\nCommittee chair: lack of quality road wins hurt the RamsFORT COLLINS \u2014 Colorado State thought it was a lock for the NCAA Tournament.\nAs one of the last four teams left out of the NCAA Tournament, Colorado State received a No.\nThey're devastated, and they should be, because they're certainly an NCAA Tournament team.\nI've been through this a lot, and we're squarely in the NCAA tournament.\""}
