My husband and I were traveling with our mentally and physically challenged child at 6 a.m on Aug. 9. While going through security at the Des Moines airport, TSA felt the need to pat her down and do an extra search because of an expired and temporary ID.

Reason or common sense is beyond the agents’ or their management’s understanding at this airport. Neither Boston nor Chicago felt the need to do this special search.

They also took the child ahead and began to explain the procedure without waiting for me or my husband. They were totally out of touch with the mentally challenged, as the child had no idea what was happening.

TSA needs to be diligent when it comes to threats, but this was no threat; this was just agents and management that had zero common sense.
