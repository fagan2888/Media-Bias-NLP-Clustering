As Obamacare crumbles under the weight of its own complexity and dwindling popular support, Americans gain the opportunity to make genuine, systemic changes in health care funding, namely a single-payer program of Medicare-for-all. ("Md. weighs options after Obama unveils fix to dropped insurance policies," Nov. 14).

While touted as a dramatic reform measure, the Affordable Care Act merely solidifies an already broken system in which precious health care dollars are squandered on a Byzantine network of administrative costs and insurance industry profits.

A not-for-profit single payer system suffers no such pitfalls as its only purpose is to fund decent, universal health care for all.
