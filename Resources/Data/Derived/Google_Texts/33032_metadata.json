Senate Republicans are getting ready to test their influence in confirmation hearings, and we look at the three finalists to host the Democratic convention in 2016.\n\nThe split-screen coverage on CNN summed up the story. On the left, President Obama was making a personal appeal for calm; on the right, cars and buildings were burning in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nThe limits of presidential power and influence were on vivid display Monday night after a grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Mr. Brown, an unarmed black teenager.\n\nMr. Obama was on the air almost immediately after the decision was announced, speaking for nine minutes from the White House briefing room. Americans, he said, should accept the decision even if they were understandably angry and disappointed. In Ferguson, tear gas canisters flew.\n\nThe president said the decision shouldn\u2019t be an excuse for violence and called on law enforcement to \u201cwork with the community, not against the community\u201d and to distinguish those who were stoking the turmoil from those who \u201cjust want their voices heard.\u201d In Ferguson, riot police officers marched.\n\nMr. Obama acknowledged that violence would \u201cmake for good TV,\u201d but appealed to reporters and broadcasters to focus on those offering solutions.\n\n\u201cWe do have work to do here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president is to travel to Chicago on Tuesday afternoon to talk about his immigration plan. Ferguson is about 300 miles to the southwest.\n\n\u2014 Julie Hirschfeld Davis\n\nAs President Obama spoke, dozens of Howard University students were on the march from campus to the White House, hands and voices raised. \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot,\u201d they chanted, and \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d\n\nThe students commandeered U Street for the two-mile march, with drivers honking their horns in unison with the students, and passers-by cheering. Police cars followed along but stayed out of the way.\n\nRodney Leggette, 27, said he hoped the images would be \u201cbroadcast across the country, that Missouri knows they\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nHe said the events on Monday night were \u201can encapsulation of American race relations \u2014 a black man in the White House and poor black people in the streets getting tear-gassed.\u201d\n\n\u2014 A. J. Chavar and Elena Schneider\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s sudden need to fill both the top job at the Pentagon and the No. 1 post at the Justice Department will provide the Senate\u2019s new Republican majority with immediate opportunities to challenge the White House after assuming control in January.\n\nThe nominee to replace Chuck Hagel as secretary of defense will join Loretta E. Lynch, the New York prosecutor who is the president\u2019s choice for attorney general, as the first test subjects of the Republicans\u2019 approach to administration nominees.\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee, which will be led by Senator John McCain of Arizona, can be expected to press the Pentagon candidate on the administration\u2019s conduct of antiterrorist operations in the Middle East \u2014 a sore point with Mr. McCain.\n\nAs for Ms. Lynch, Republicans have made clear that they intend to focus on the president\u2019s use of executive authority on immigration during her confirmation hearings.\n\n\u201cWhat I will say is that no attorney general should be confirmed unless that attorney general makes perfectly clear that they\u2019re not willing to be a part of this illegal and unconstitutional action,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz of Texas told Fox News on Monday.\n\nMr. Cruz and other Republicans have suggested that all nominations be blocked in retaliation for the executive action, though they would allow exceptions for national security posts like secretary of defense. Even if that doesn\u2019t happen, the confirmation landscape has been altered considerably by the Republican takeover, and nominees should brace for tough scrutiny.\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nPresident Obama travels to Chicago on Tuesday in hopes of selling his immigration plan beyond the Hispanics who are most affected by it. And he figures his adopted hometown is the place to do it \u2014 specifically in a speech at a community center dedicated to Polish-Americans.\n\nWhen he announced his new policies last week, Mr. Obama placed them in the context of the United States as a nation of immigrants, \u201cwhether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific or the Rio Grande.\u201d\n\nHe will make his pitch at the Copernicus Community Center, named after the famous Polish astronomer. The location was carefully chosen: There are more than 168,000 Americans of Polish ancestry in Chicago, about 6 percent of the city\u2019s population, according to the Census Bureau.\n\n\u2014 Julie Hirschfeld Davis\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 three finalists for their 2016 convention city \u2014 New York; Philadelphia; and Columbus, Ohio \u2014 neatly capture the party\u2019s state of limbo.\n\nWhat the party did not say in its news release on Monday about the finalists, but numerous Democrats indicate is the case, is that neither President Obama nor Hillary Rodham Clinton have offered much input about the decision. Mr. Obama has never been much interested in party-building, and Mrs. Clinton is not yet a candidate, let alone the party\u2019s leader.\n\nThe search committee wants to avoid the wrong choice as much as it hopes to find the right location.\n\nDo they go with New York \u2014 Brooklyn, to be exact \u2014 as a nod to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s current home state and Bill Clinton\u2019s nomination in Manhattan nearly a quarter-century ago? Or is there pressure to follow the Republicans, who picked Cleveland, to the swing state of Ohio? Or do they go a third way and choose Philadelphia?\n\nThe ideal option might have been Chicago \u2014 Mrs. Clinton\u2019s original hometown and Mr. Obama\u2019s adopted one \u2014 but officials there were not interested.\n\n\u2014 Jonathan Martin\n\nSenator Charles E.

Her husband knows I love her. Michelle knows I love her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing either of them can do about it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Steve Kenny\n\nHave a look at the top candidates to replace Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.\n\nThe speaker-elect of the Nevada State Assembly was forced to relinquish his leadership role over newspaper columns and radio commentaries that were \u201crife with derogatory remarks about blacks, women, Latinos and gays.\u201d\n\nThe F.D.A. wants restaurants to count your calories for you.\n\nLost your luggage?
