(Photo: Google)\n\nGREELEY \u2014 One of the last surviving community banks in Greeley is getting out of the trust business but will continue to serve its other customers.\n\nThe president of Cache Bank and Trust, Byron Bateman, appeared before the state banking board in Denver on Thursday regarding the bank\u2019s plans to sell 200 trust accounts.\n\nThe board doesn\u2019t have to approve the sale but Bateman is required to notify the board. However, the issue was listed as \u201crequest to sell assets\u201d on the meeting agenda, which created concerns that the bank was getting out of the business altogether, The Greeley Tribune reported.\n\nBateman says that\u2019s not the case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just selling about 200 trust accounts that have nothing to do with the bank; they\u2019re not even on the bank balance sheet,\u201d Bateman said.\n\nThe bulk of the trust accounts being sold are self-directed IRAs which Bateman said have become too cumbersome for the small bank, which also has branches in Fort Collins and Denver, to manage under the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThe trust accounts are being sold to a new company called Dunham Trust Co., which will be able to use Cache offices to meet with trust customers. The sale will take three to four months to complete.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://noconow.co/1HsQsQz", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Cache Bank and Trust also has Fort Collins and Denver branches.", "og": {"site_name": "Coloradoan", "description": "Cache Bank and Trust also has Fort Collins and Denver branches.", "title": "Greeley bank to sell trust accounts but stay open", "url": "http://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2015/05/25/greeley-bank-sell-trust-accounts-stay-open/27925103/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/coloradoan.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cache Bank and Trust also has Fort Collins and Denver branches.", "title": "Greeley bank to sell trust accounts but stay open", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67365a55c9cfb95a05a0c7bbf8bd59e1d0a80c2a/c=112-0-581-469&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/25/FortCollins/B9317480897Z.1_20150525155725_000_GI6AT1QNO.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@coloradoan", "site": "@coloradoan", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=743847167", "fb": {"app_id": 140942715960163}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "cache bank, greeley banks, colorado banking"}, "article_summary": "Cache Bank and Trust, headquartered in Greeley, is getting out of the trust business.\nThe president of Cache Bank and Trust, Byron Bateman, appeared before the state banking board in Denver on Thursday regarding the bank\u2019s plans to sell 200 trust accounts.\n\u201cI\u2019m just selling about 200 trust accounts that have nothing to do with the bank; they\u2019re not even on the bank balance sheet,\u201d Bateman said.\nThe trust accounts are being sold to a new company called Dunham Trust Co., which will be able to use Cache offices to meet with trust customers.\n(Photo: Google)GREELEY \u2014 One of the last surviving community banks in Greeley is getting out of the trust business but will continue to serve its other customers."}
