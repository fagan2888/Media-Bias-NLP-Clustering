The status of those cases is not clear.\n\nThe FTC's involvement with Tiversa raises questions about how the agency investigates data breaches. Critics in the legal community have argued that Congress never granted the FTC power to police data security nor equipped the agency for that mission.\n\n\"They have an incredibly broad mandate, and that means enforcement on a shoe-string,\" said Gerald Ferguson, an expert in data protection law at Baker & Hostetler LLP.\n\n, CVS Caremark and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts are among more than 50 companies the FTC has reached settlements with over alleged lax data security, according to the agency. The settlements with the FTC typically do not involve fines but require the companies to take often costly steps to improve data security. Since the FBI raid earlier in March, Tiversa has placed its CEO Robert Boback on leave as the company conducts an internal investigation about the allegations of improper conduct, according to a person briefed on the case who declined to be named because the investigation is ongoing. Robert Ridge, an attorney for Boback, declined to comment. The allegations against Tiversa first surfaced last year during testimony in the FTC's civil data security case against the cancer testing company LabMD. The case represented the first instance when a company fought and beat the FTC in the agency\u2019s administrative court over data security allegations. The FTC alleged that poor security practices at LabMD allowed a patient insurance file to get released through the LimeWire peer-to-peer filesharing network, which was often used for downloading music. Both the FTC and LabMD said the information that Tiversa gave the agency was used in the investigation of the cancer testing company. But in FTC\u2019s administrative court in Washington, D.C. last May, Wallace testified that when Tiversa determined that a company\u2019s files were available on filesharing software, Tiversa would reach out to the affected company and pitch its remediation service. When companies such as LabMD declined the offer, their names were included on a list that Boback handed over to the FTC, according to court transcripts of Wallace's testimony. For example, when LabMD refused Tiversa\u2019s services, Boback \u201cbasically said, \u2018f__ him, make sure he\u2019s at the top of the list,\u2019\u201d according to Wallace's testimony. Wallace said that he was also instructed to falsify evidence that LabMD\u2019s patient file was rapidly spreading online and falling into the hands of identity thieves. Wallace testified that Boback told him, \u201c'We need this at four different IP addresses, and they need to be bad guys.'\u201d The Justice Department granted Wallace immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony. The FTC has said in court filings that while information from Tiversa caused the agency to begin the probe, its case against LabMD was supported by its own independent investigation. LabMD CEO Michael Daugherty said in an interview with Reuters that he is a victim of a Tiversa extortion scheme. The costs and distraction associated with the case had driven LabMD out of business, Daugherty said. He acknowledges that one of his employees, in violation of company policy, installed a filesharing software on her computer for her personal use. But Daugherty said the issue harmed no patients. No one outside LabMD ever accessed the file, Daugherty said, and evidence of its spread was falsified by Tiversa. \u201cWhat concerns me is the collaboration between the FTC and bad actors,\u201d Daughterty said. \u201cThis case is not just about LabMD, it\u2019s about every company contacted by the FTC.\u201d That testimony led FTC Chief Administrative Law Judge D. Michael Chappell to dismiss the case against LabMD last November, ruling that the evidence against the medical company was \u201cunreliable, not credible, and outweighed by credible contrary testimony from Mr. Wallace,\u201d according to court records. A Tiversa spokeswoman said in November that the company \"acted appropriately and legally in every way with respect to LabMD, despite their efforts to besmirch our reputation.\u201d The agency appealed Judge Chappell\u2019s ruling and is now re-arguing the case against LabMD before the agency\u2019s commissioners.
