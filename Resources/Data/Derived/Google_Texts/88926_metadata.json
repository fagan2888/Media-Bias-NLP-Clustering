(Nasdaq: VGGL) founder Robert Sillerman wants to buy a minority stake in the company's Wetpaint business for $10 million.\n\nThe proposal comes after media mogul Sillerman offered to take another one of his companies, SFX Entertainment Inc. (Nasdaq: SFXE) private in late February for $4.75 per share. (On March 20 the company's shares opened at $4.19.) He is the CEO of both SFX and Viggle.\n\nWetpaint operates a celebrity news site. New York-based Viggle, which developed a mobile application that gives members redeemable rewards points for watching television shows or listening to music, acquired Wetpaint in 2013.\n\nSillerman's acquisition proposal would give him a 25 percent stake in Wetpaint and the option to buy the rest of the business for $40 million. He'd pay for the rest of Wetpaint with $20 million in cash and a five-year note bearing interest at 6 percent. Viggle's board of directors is expected to form a special committee to evaluate the proposal.\n\nViggle has been on Mergers & Acquisitions Distressed Company Watch List for months because a history of recurring losses and working capital deficiencies led its accountant to raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern, or without the threat of liquidation.\n\nThe business has been featured in our Turnaround Tuesday column several times, most recently when Sillerman provided it with a $2 million loan in January for working capital. He has provided Viggle with about $8.75 million in unsecured loans, according to a March 18 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nViggle has a sales agreement a subsidiary of SFX Entertainment Inc. (Nasdaq: SFXE), under which SFX acts as exclusive sales agent for the sale of advertising and sponsorships.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/tech_telecom/viggle-founder-sillerman-offers-10m-for-stake-in-wetpaint-subsidiary-255283-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/viggleimage.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Viggle Founder Sillerman Offers $10M for Stake in Wetpaint Subsidiary"}}, "article_summary": "Viggle Founder Sillerman Offers $10M for Stake in Wetpaint SubsidiaryThe proposal comes after Sillerman made a bid to take another one of his companies, SFX Entertainment, private in FebruaryViggle Inc.
