The SEC is proposing amendments to rules related to regulator access to security-based swap data held by security-based swap data repositories. If adopted, the amendments would require security-based swap data repositories (SBSDR) to make certain data available, including counterparty trade and position data, to regulators and other authorities. The proposed amendments regarding the data access requirement is conditioned on each recipient entity agreeing to indemnify the SBSDR and the SEC for any expenses arising from litigation relating to information provided.

Comments are due within 45 days of publication in the Federal Register.
