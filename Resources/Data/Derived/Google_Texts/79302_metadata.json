But to CBIA and the thousands of employers that use its exchange, the idea was tried and true.\n\nPhilip Vogel, senior vice president of CBIA\u2019s Service Corp.\n\nCBIA launched its insurance exchange, Health Connections, in 1995 and has since offered employers with fewer than 100 employees a variety of health care plans from which to choose.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for almost 20 years, bringing choice, simplicity and quality products to small businesses,\u201d said Philip Vogel, senior vice president of CBIA\u2019s Service Corp.\n\nA small business owner can now purchase coverage through Access Health CT and apply for a federal subsidy to offset the cost. However, Vogel said he feels the state\u2019s exchange is more geared to individuals who are either uninsured or low-income, rather than focused on small businesses. In that arena, he said, CBIA Health Connections shines.\n\nThe CBIA exchange offers a total 24 health plan designs offered through Aetna Inc., ConnectiCare Inc. and Oxford Health Plans L.L.C. The exchange handles all the administrative efforts for HRA and COBRA services and issues only one bill and phone number for service.\n\nAdditionally, CBIA offers a free wellness program to increase employees\u2019 health and productivity.\n\n\u201cSmall businesses need a place to go that can offer flexible plans and understands competition and the private sector,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cUnfortunately I think (the state exchange) is challenged from a systems and customer service standpoint.\u201d\n\nSo far the state exchange has initiated only 106 small business plans, falling below its enrollment goals.\n\nVogel said private health exchanges were a key discussion point during the 1990s health reform under the Clinton administration. The effort tanked nationally, but it spurred CBIA to launch its own exchange.\n\n\u201cWe looked at it and said it\u2019s a business worth exploring,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that the private sector should be doing.\u201d\n\nWith the roll out of new regulations under the Affordable Care Act, Vogel said the CBIA exchange underwent a massive restructuring in redesigning its plans and filings with the Connecticut Insurance Department. But with the relaunch, Vogel said plan retention rates have improved dramatically and demand for new plans has remained strong.\n\n\u201cIt was an exorbitant effort,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cAll the plans we had had to be changed to comply with the ACA \u2026 It\u2019s a brand new sweep. It\u2019s been a challenging time. But it\u2019s all working out.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, Vogel also said he expects more employers to use CBIA\u2019s exchange, especially as the federal employer mandate comes online. By 2015, employers with more than 50 full-time employees will be required to provide employee health insurance or will face a penalty of up to $3,000 per person.\n\n\u201cWe try to make everything as simple as possible for small businesses already overwhelmed with competing on a global and regional scale,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cIt\u2019s one simple package, place to call and go.\u201d\n\nPrint", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "connecticut business and industry association,health connections,affordable care act,access health ct", "description": "Caters to small businesses\u2019 needs, officials say.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb34\"", "article_summary": "The CBIA exchange offers a total 24 health plan designs offered through Aetna Inc., ConnectiCare Inc. and Oxford Health Plans L.L.C.\nAs more employers seek employee health coverage plans, officials at the Connecticut Business and Industry Association are seeing an uptick in companies purchasing health plans through CBIA\u2019s private insurance exchange.\nVogel said private health exchanges were a key discussion point during the 1990s health reform under the Clinton administration.\nIn that arena, he said, CBIA Health Connections shines.\nBut to CBIA and the thousands of employers that use its exchange, the idea was tried and true."}
