It also wants them to voice opposition to potential fracking leases on federal land in South Park, near the headwaters of the South Platte River \u2014 a major source of metro area drinking water. Any lease decisions by the feds are on hold, for now.\n\nSo far, the effort hasn\u2019t gained traction with city officials, but the activists hope the petitions help.\n\nGreenpeace says in a news release that nearly 2,000 people have signed on, either on paper or by posing for photos holding signs, with the images collected in a photo book.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the current Denver community and our future generations have the right to clean water, clean air, and to a protected quality of life,\u201d Greenpeace campaign coordinator Michael Gately said in the news release. \u201cWe stand with Denver residents in asking local officials to represent those who put them in office by keeping fracking out of our community, and in doing so protecting our health and well-being.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, while the petition language (see image above) says the signers are Denver residents, not one of the nine listed on the page shown to me lists Denver as home. They live in St. Paul, Minn., Boulder, Santa Fe, Aurora, Glendale and Fort Collins.\n\nBut the groups, which also include the Colorado Progressive Coalition, Food & Water Watch, 350 Denver and Sierra Club-Denver Metro Network, have drawn support from several northeast Denver community groups, activists and businesses.\n\nAnd some residents of Green Valley Ranch have told The Post that they hadn\u2019t been aware of the fracking potential so close to home, which worried them.\n\nThe push prompted stark criticism from industry groups in February, with pro-business advocacy group Vital for Colorado equating the effort to scare-mongering that was akin to \u201cdeclaring war on Denver\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nSo far, Hancock and council members, including some sympathetic to environmental causes, have hesitated to introduce any proposals in line with what the activists want.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re in support of keeping our water safe, but there\u2019s not actually anything on the table moving forward in any kind of urgent fashion that needs immediate attention,\u201d Councilwoman Susan Shepherd said Wednesday, calling the request odd.\n\nFor now, the federal Bureau of Land Management has paused consideration of potential fracking leases near South Park while officials study environmental safety and other issues.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re certainly willing to always talk to people,\u201d Shepherd said, \u201cand I know that (my office) has a meeting coming up with the coalition soon.\u201d\n\nCouncilman Charlie Brown, who\u2019s less in tune with the activists\u2019 objectives, said he\u2019s had \u201czero phone calls and one e-mail from my district. Of all the challenges we face in this city, this is not one of them, in my judgment. \u2026 I think they\u2019re trying to stir up their side and bring what they perceive as a very liberal city to their side.\u201d\n\nMayoral spokeswoman Amber Miller wrote in an e-mail: \u201cThanks to some of the toughest regulations and protections in the country, Colorado has proven there is a way to responsibly balance production of our energy resources while also protecting our air, water and public health. Denver remains engaged in the discussion underway at the state level, and Mayor Hancock is committed to ensuring we protect our environment, natural resources and high quality of life.\u201d\n\nHydraulic fracturing operations are common along the Front Range, but it\u2019s rare within Denver\u2019s city limits. Denver International Airport, which has 70 active wells leased out to oil and gas companies for fracking, is an exception.\n\nThe activists have focused on far northeast Denver because they say they worry that open land within Denver\u2019s boundaries \u2014 as well as mineral rights below newer housing subdivisions there and in nearby suburbs \u2014 could be eyed for fracking. So far, oil and gas companies and Green Valley Ranch developer Oakwood Homes have said they have no plans for that in northeast Denver. However, oil companies have leased ground nearby in Aurora.\n\nBut the council could be in murky legal territory if it declares a fracking moratorium. Recent state court rulings that now are on appeal have overturned other cities\u2019 fracking bans, and the industry likely would argue a moratorium is akin to a ban.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "amber miller,Charlie Brown,Don't Frack Denver,fracking,Michael Hancock,Susan Shepherd", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "The \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdDon\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdt Frack Denver\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd campaign on Wednesday delivered petitions to Denver city officials to underline their push for pre-emptive action against fracking.", "title": "Activists seeking Denver fracking moratorium deliver petitions", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/04/08/fractivists-renew-push-for-denver-moratorium-on-fracking-with-petition-delivery/118672/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2012/10/oilrig-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdDon\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdt Frack Denver\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd campaign on Wednesday delivered petitions to Denver city officials to underline their push for pre-emptive action against fracking.", "title": "Fractivists renew push for Denver moratorium with petition delivery", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/04/08/fractivists-renew-push-for-denver-moratorium-on-fracking-with-petition-delivery/118672/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2012/10/oilrig-495x329.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The \u201cDon\u2019t Frack Denver\u201d campaign on Wednesday delivered petitions to Denver city officials to underline their push for pre-emptive action against fracking."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2ee\"", "article_summary": "The \u201cDon\u2019t Frack Denver\u201d campaign by environmental and community activists on Wednesday delivered petitions to the Denver City Council and mayor\u2019s offices to underline its push for city officials to take pre-emptive action on two fronts.\nBut the groups, which also include the Colorado Progressive Coalition, Food & Water Watch, 350 Denver and Sierra Club-Denver Metro Network, have drawn support from several northeast Denver community groups, activists and businesses.\nSo far, the effort hasn\u2019t gained traction with city officials, but the activists hope the petitions help.\nDenver International Airport, which has 70 active wells leased out to oil and gas companies for fracking, is an exception.\nTwo months ago, the groups called for the council and Mayor Michael Hancock to pass a ban on new fracking operations."}
