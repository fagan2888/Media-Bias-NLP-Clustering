Once it\u2019s over, where do I go after that?\u201d Dycus said.\n\nThe forum, titled \u201cOut of Sight, Out of Mind: Young People Who Can\u2019t Go Home Reveal Holes in the Foster Care Safety Net,\u201d was hosted by New America Media and YouthWire on February 3.\n\nIn addition to former foster youth, attendees included lawyers, social workers, service providers, foster parents and members of the press. The goal of the forum was to prompt a conversation about systematic shortcomings that, according to advocates, are compounded by insufficient utilization of available federal funding streams.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that we\u2019ve had a conversation like this,\u201d said Anna Challet, one of the forum\u2019s facilitators and the youth writing workshop director at New America Media. \u201cToday\u2019s panel was about this group of youth who are left to navigate things on their own.\u201d\n\nA major issue highlighted by the panel is the shortage of placements in the foster system for older youth who often have a history of neglect, abuse and mental health needs.\n\nA deficiency of placements results in unstable housing situations that leave these youth vulnerable to homelessness and incarceration, said panelist Brian Blalock, founder and director of Bay Area Legal Aid\u2019s Youth Justice Project.\n\n\u201cWe think this is largely a forgotten subpopulation of youth, which are kids that are homeless and that are homeless predominantly because they\u2019re fleeing some abuse, abandonment, neglect, a problematic family dynamic,\u201d Blalock said.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing we can do for kids is make sure they have a stable situation so that they can make their own decisions, so that they can learn and make mistakes, and that when they make mistakes, it\u2019s not catastrophic,\u201d Blalock said.\n\nBlalock described how some reconfiguration of the foster care system is necessary in order to build a stronger safety net that more appropriately responds to aging foster youth.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that it is almost impossible for youth over a certain age to get into foster care. Regardless of the number of child protective services reports, regardless of the prevalence of abuse and neglect that the young person is fleeing, they\u2019re in the homeless shelter, they\u2019re self-reporting and they\u2019re calling child protective services themselves,\u201d Blalock said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult for them to get into the child welfare system.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have kids over 16 who can\u2019t get into the foster care system without the help of a lawyer. If you need a lawyer to access something, the system is broken down,\u201d Blalock said.\n\nAccording to Bay Area Legal Aid, of the 270 homeless youth whom the organization represented between 2011 and 2014, over 80 percent had either previous or current probation or social services involvement.\n\n\u201cThis means that not only are there youth that are homeless,\u201d Blalock said, \u201cthere are also youth that are homeless that the system knew who they were, and is not responding with a home or is not responding with something that would help them become more stable.\u201d\n\nAlthough Assembly Bill 12 (AB 12) and the Affordable Care Act have improved the safety net for more than 60,000 foster care youth in California, these young people continue to face obstacles and gaps in the system that further complicate their transition into adulthood.\n\n\u201cWe desperately need more attorneys and more social workers working on this for homeless youth. We don\u2019t know if we\u2019re scratching the surface or if we\u2019re in the middle of it, but we certainly haven\u2019t been able to reach the need yet,\u201d Blalock said, regarding the various funding streams that have opened up under AB 12. \u201cIt takes us to make sure they get those benefits.\u201d\n\nBay Area Legal Aid\u2019s Youth Justice Project provides disadvantaged youth with holistic supports, services and legal representation. With the organization\u2019s assistance, youth are able to access resources such as proper educational placement, mental health counseling, and economic stability through government benefits programs.\n\nSince 2011, Bay Area Legal Aid has recovered over $7 million for 447 of the organization\u2019s youth clientele.\n\n\u201cWhat that means on a day-to-day basis, some of those kids go from being completely homeless to having their own apartment. We can do things like foster care benefits, supplemental security income benefits, food stamps, those types of funding streams,\u201d Blalock said.\n\nThe vast majority of these dollars come from federal funding streams attached to AB 12. These represent relatively brand new dollars earmarked for the region\u2019s most vulnerable youth. These funding streams, however, aren\u2019t being pursued by the agencies that could actually use them to help at-risk and homeless youth, according to Blalock.\n\n\u201cThese kids are clearly eligible, but the systems aren\u2019t accessing [these funds] without being nudged to do so by the youth themselves, who can become incredible advocates for themselves, or by the lawyers,\u201d Blalock said. \u201cWe\u2019re having to force the system to pull down money that already exists, to give that money to the kids that we\u2019re working with in order to help them.\u201d\n\nBeing forced to advocate for themselves is nothing new for foster youth, according to Bay Area Legal Aid\u2019s Erin Palacious who also sat on the panel.\n\n\u201cWhat has shocked me over the course of these years has not been the stories that these young people tell,\u201d said Palacious. \u201cIt\u2019s usually the fact that they\u2019ve been trying to tell it so may times to so many people for such a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an unseen population,\u201d Palacious said. \u201cWhat it is, is we don\u2019t see it when it\u2019s right in front of us. Or when we do see it, we do not choose to listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to hold the system accountable for how it\u2019s supposed to work, to give these youth every opportunity to be successful,\u201d Blalock said.\n\nShane Downing is a San Francisco-based writer covering stories relating to homelessness, public health, and city planning.
