Lower Brule, SD

This story has been updated with information regarding tribal members contesting the meeting that elected Grass Rope.

A new Lower Brule Sioux Tribe Chairman has been elected by members of the Tribal Council, but members of the tribe are contesting its validity.

According to a press release from National Native Media and Consulting, Lewis Grass Rope was chosen Thursday by three members of the Tribal Council to fill the chairman seat left vacant by the passing of former Chairman Michael Jandreau back in April. Two Tribal Council members were not present for the vote, putting the decision into question.

Tribal official Kevin Wright had previously been acting as chairman following Jandreau's death.

Tribal members tell KELOLAND News that the decision was an illegal one as not all Tribal Council members were present and the meeting that was held did not take place on the Lower Brule Sioux Reservation; a petition has been handed in to remove the three tribal council members that authorized the decision.
