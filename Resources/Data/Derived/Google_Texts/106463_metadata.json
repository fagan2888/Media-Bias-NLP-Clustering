Mainly everything has to be kosher. The meat is supplied, the seasonings are all provided. Even the utensils, pots, pans, smokers and grills are provided.\n\nIt\u2019s a challenge that everyone says levels the playing field, so the best pit master wins.\n\n\"Everyone is cohesive, very friendly. If you need something, each team goes out of their way to help you and make sure you have that ingredient. It\u2019s been a challenge to try to find correct ingredients to cook with your kosher meats. It\u2019s been fun so far,\u201d said BBQ competitor Big Billy.\n\nOf course, there were both Jewish and non-Jewish teams competing on Sunday.
