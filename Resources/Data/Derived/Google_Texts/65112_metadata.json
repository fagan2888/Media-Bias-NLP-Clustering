Where did C.J. Anderson come from and why in the world would we need to spend second- and third-rounders on Montee Ball and Ronnie Hillman when we have that beast? Thanks.\n\n\u2014 Ariel Belkin, Los Angeles\n\nAriel \u2013 C.J. Anderson came from the University of California-Berkeley, where as a junior and senior he was a backup to Isi Sofele. He came from Laney community college in Oakland, Calif. He came from the rough streets of Vallejo, Calif., which is near Oakland.\n\nAnd he came from way back on the Broncos\u2019 depth chart.\n\nIn Game 4 this season against the Arizona Cardinals, Anderson didn\u2019t even dress. The Broncos started Montee Ball. Ronnie Hillman was No. 2. And because rookie Juwan Thompson can contribute on special teams, he was No. 3.\n\nAnderson would flash running ability when he got his sporadic chances the past two years, but it wasn\u2019t until Ball and Hillman went down with significant lower-body injuries that Anderson got his first real opportunity to shine.\n\nBall was a second-round draft pick. Hillman was a third-rounder. Anderson was undrafted. It\u2019s happening more and more. Arian Foster, Chris Ivory, Jonas Gray, Joique Bell and Isaiah Crowell are among the undrafted running backs of note. Priest Holmes was undrafted.\n\nIt goes to show that the draft, or acquisition of rookies, doesn\u2019t end with the seventh round. Give the Broncos\u2019 scouting department, particularly Matt Russell, credit for finding this rushing gem.\n\nMike \u2013 I am so frustrated with our defense. What in the world is going on? John Elway goes out and gets top defenders, and I don\u2019t see the improvement. At least not lately. I guess I\u2019m more disappointed than anything. Is it the play-calling? Can you enlighten me? I\u2019m really beginning to think that this team is not a Super Bowl team.\n\n\u2014 Betsy Meier, Colorado Springs\n\nBetsy \u2013 The biggest concern with the defense is at linebacker, where they have lost two starters to significant injury. Danny Trevathan was arguably their best defensive player last year and he\u2019s only essentially played in one game this year. Trevathan is back practicing from his knee fracture this week, but he won\u2019t be eligible to play until Game 14 at San Diego.\n\nMiddle linebacker Nate Irving, however, isn\u2019t coming back. He\u2019s finished with a torn MCL. Brandon Marshall has been outstanding replacing Trevathan, but Trevathan has been missed. Steven Johnson and rookie Lamin Barrow are replacing Irving, but their inexperience showed in the last two games against St. Louis and Miami.\n\nTrevathan and Irving are the Broncos\u2019 best run-tackling linebackers, and their absence is catching up to the defense, which has suddenly allowed 114.0 yards rushing on average the past two games, after allowing just 67.0 rushing yards through their first nine games.\n\nBut the Broncos are also struggling lately to find the right defensive tackle rotation outside of Terrance Knighton. Marvin Austin was benched last week, Sylvester Williams was caught playing high on several long Dolphin runs and Malik Jackson is a far better pass rusher from the inside than he is a run-stopper.\n\nMalik Jackson. Worth the stupid penalties? How many personal fouls does this guy have total for the season? At some point a player\u2019s production and worth have to be balanced against the negatives he brings to the team. In your view, how does Jackson tip the scales?\n\n\u2014 David \u201cBronco\u201d Brown, Lenexa, Kan.\n\nDavid \u2013 Jackson is worth it. He does play with a crazed state on Sundays, and there are times when his emotion crosses the line between aggression and making a critical mental mistake.\n\nBut you have to be careful about overly taming wild stallions. Jackson is a terrific inside pass rusher. Any coach would tell you it\u2019s better to hold back a player than try to push more out of him.\n\nJust wondering if the Broncos have a beef about playing two teams in a row (Dolphins and Chiefs) that are coming off Thursday night games? Having 10 days off and extra time to prepare. With the early bye and the Thursday game after a Sunday night game, it seems the schedulers were unkind to the Broncos. Thank you.\n\n\u2014 Shay, Brigham City, Utah\n\nShay \u2013 I\u2019m sure they noticed. But the Broncos played on Thursday night before traveling to New England. If the Pats were miffed before the game, they got over it.\n\nAnd the Broncos just beat the well-rested Dolphins. The Chiefs coming off a stinging loss to the horrific Raiders negates any advantage they had with added preparation. And the shocking revelation of safety Eric Berry\u2019s medical condition will take more than a few days to get over.\n\nThe Chiefs may still beat the Broncos on Sunday night, but if they do, I\u2019m not sure the extra rest/preparation will get much credit.\n\nThe biggest gripe I\u2019ve heard about the Broncos\u2019 schedule was in regards to their early bye in Week 4. They have since played eight games in eight weeks with five games in the next five weeks to go.\n\nThat\u2019s 13 games in 13 weeks without a break. It won\u2019t be easy keeping those bodies in peak physical condition for the stretch run. That first-round playoff bye is always a carrot but it\u2019s dangling like a \u2026 like a \u2026 like a \u2018roid-injected carrot this year!\n\nShould we be concerned about too much wear and tear on Peyton Manning\u2019s throwing arm? As I recall, Tony Dungy had him on a pitch count in Indy at one point. Thanks in advance. Always appreciate your insight.\n\n\u2014 George G., Groveland, Calif.\n\nGeorge \u2013 Manning is no Double-A pitching prospect. He\u2019s thrown for 525 touchdowns (more than anyone in history) and 68,522 yards (second-most of all time and just 3,316 behind Brett Favre).\n\nI think he\u2019s got his throwing program figured out by now.\n\nHe did have to reconfigure things after four neck surgeries that cost him the 2011 season left him with nerve damage in his right biceps.\n\nManning doesn\u2019t come out early for an early throwing session before games \u2014 a practice he stopped after his three-interception game at Atlanta early in the 2012 season. It wasn\u2019t the picks so much as everyone coming up to him to say hello.\n\nWe all know Manning well enough to know that when he\u2019s in his preparation mode, stay out of his way. I think Manning has the rest of this season and then two more years left in his throwing arm.\n\nHey, Mike. I may be way out of line here, no pun intended, but why not put Ben Garland in at guard, move Orlando Franklin back to right tackle, and move Manny Ramirez and Louis Vasquez over one space to the left? I know Ben doesn\u2019t have much experience, but he\u2019s a player who will put it all on the line for his team. I\u2019m probably way out in left field here, but what could it possibly hurt? Plus, Ben knows the offense.\n\n\u2014 Mike Fields, Thornton\n\nMike \u2013 Not way out of line. My only answer to this is if the Broncos\u2019 coaches thought their line would be better with Garland at left guard, Ramirez back at center, Vasquez back at right guard and Franklin at right tackle, they\u2019d do it.\n\nThe Broncos are committed to not putting Franklin back at right tackle. Start there. And they don\u2019t believe Garland would be an upgrade over Franklin at left guard. Keep in mind, Franklin is a four-year offensive line starter, and Garland was shifted to the offensive line just last year.\n\nFranklin is a free agent after this year. Garland will compete for the starting left guard position next year.\n\nI wholeheartedly reject the Broncos\u2019 excuses for not pursuing RBs LeGarrette Blount or Ben Tate. Somebody will sign them, and the Broncos will probably regret that later in the playoffs. Bill Belichick would do it. Denver has still not learned that you have to be able to run and control the clock to win in the playoffs. Just look at the way K.C. and the Patriots are surging now.\n\n\u2014 Dan Pradere, Seattle\n\nDan \u2013 You obviously mailed off your letter before Tate was claimed off waivers by the Minnesota Vikings, so the Broncos couldn\u2019t have got him if they wanted him, and before Belichick indeed signed Blount.\n\nGood call on your part. Belichick being Belichick, Blount replaced last week\u2019s Patriot hero, Jonas Gray, and played well, rushing for 78 yards and two touchdowns on 12 carries just days after he was released by Pittsburgh for insubordination.\n\nBut here\u2019s why Blount made sense for the Patriots and not the Broncos: He played for the Pats last year. He knows their offense. He does not know the Broncos\u2019 offense. It would have taken him the rest of this season to pick it up. See Trent Richardson with the Indianapolis Colts last year.\n\nI do agree that even with C.J. Anderson\u2019s breakout performance the past three weeks, the Broncos are dangerously thin at running back because there is no guarantee Hillman (groin) or Ball (foot) will fully recover from their injuries.\n\nBut in C.J. the Broncos trust.\n\nHi, Mike. Just finished reading your latest mailbag, and I had a thought (not totally serious): If the Broncos were the No. 1 rushing team in the NFL with Tim Tebow, what about signing him and giving him a package of plays? Everyone would know we were running the ball, but that didn\u2019t really stop him before.\n\n\u2014 Jonathan Cain, Lakewood\n\nJonathan \u2013 As you saw Sunday, the Broncos don\u2019t need Tebow to run the ball. All they need is to try. The Broncos committed to running the ball Sunday, even when they were behind, 14-3. They stayed with the run even when they were down 28-17 in the second half.\n\nManning was effective with less passes and more runs. When you can run, you can beat tough defenses on the road, in cold weather, in January. When you can\u2019t run, you can\u2019t get through all those challenges of cold weather, tough defense, road game, playoffs.\n\nManning and the pass must remain No. 1 in the Broncos\u2019 offense. But it can no longer be Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.\n\nMike \u2013 I notice a lot of people complimenting you on your work lately, saying things like \u201cLove your work\u201d or \u201cI look forward to reading your work each week.\u201d Is that the key to getting a question on the Broncos Mailbag each week? BTW, Love your work.\n\n\u2014 Deborah, Ventura, Calif.\n\nDeborah \u2013 One time at a frat party, my college roommate Tom Fehn showered a heavyset, young lady with compliments about her beauty.\n\nWhen I questioned Tom about the sincerity of his flattery, he said: \u201cEverybody deserves a compliment.\u201d That has always stuck with me. (Obviously.)\n\nHappy Thanksgiving to you and all the people out there who enjoy the Broncos \u2018bag.\n\nPose a Broncos- or NFL-related question for the Broncos Mailbag.
