Hookers 4 Hillary, a group of 500 Nevada prostitutes, endorse Hillary Clinton for president, citing her promise to continue Obamacare.

Hookers 4 Hillary

While political pundits have noted that a surprising number of women don't support Clinton, Hookers 4 Hillary proudly stumping for her. The prostitutes at Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Nevada, a legal brothel, say they give extra time to clients who donate to Hillary's presidential campaign.

Hookers 4 Hillary lays out a four-point platform revealing why they endorse Clinton on its website (see video). "Hillary Clinton, as part of her husband’s administration, envisioned health care reform in the 1990’s, long before President Obama was able to sign it into law," reads the statement.

"The Affordable Health Care Act made health insurance available for the first time ever to the 500 independent contractors employed by Dennis Hof [owner of the Moonlite Bunny Ranch]. With any Republican nominee likely to work for its repeal, the Bunnies want to protect the quality health coverage that they now enjoy."

Amazingly, Hookers 4 Hillary want Obamacare to continue despite its escalating costs and disastrous website roll-out. The prostitutes also cited Hillary's "foreign policy experience" and support for agencies that protect public health for their endorsement.

Neither Hillary Clinton nor husband Bill have commented on their enormous popularity among hookers.
