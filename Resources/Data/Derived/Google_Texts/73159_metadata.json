Almost always that label is unfairly applied to the pro-life candidate, even when the pro-abortion candidate holds positions on abortion way outside the mainstream.\n\nGubernatorial elections will be held in Virginia and New Jersey on November 5.\n\nPro-life Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (R) is facing pro-abortion Terry McAuliffe (D) and pro-abortion Robert Sarvis (I) for governor in Virginia.\n\nPro-life New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (R) is being challenged by pro-abortion state Senator Barbara Buono (D).\n\nWhat are the candidates\u2019 positions on life?\n\nVirginia Gubernatorial Election\n\nAbortion\n\nKen Cuccinelli opposes abortion on demand, supports legal protection for unborn children, and opposes using your tax dollars to pay for abortion on demand.\n\nTerry McAuliffe supports a policy of abortion on demand, which allows abortion for any reason. When asked about his position on taxpayer-funded abortions, Terry McAuliffe refused to say whether he supports \u201ctaxpayer-funding of abortion up until the moment of birth.\u201d\n\nRobert Sarvis has said \u201cabortion is an individual issue\u201d and that he prefers \u201cto see no decisive legislation in either direction.\u201d His position would continue abortion on demand.\n\nObamacare\n\nObamacare will provide government funding in many states for insurance plans that pay for abortion on demand, and will lead to the rationing of lifesaving medical treatments.\n\nKen Cuccinelli opposes Obamacare and believes it should not be implemented. Terry McAuliffe supports Obamacare and has pledged to implement the law in Virginia. Obamacare will provide government funding in many states for insurance plans that pay for abortion on demand, and will lead to the rationing of lifesaving medical treatments.\n\nAbortion Provider Regulations\n\nAmericans were horrified when they heard testimony about the atrocities in the Kermit Gosnell murder trial. They were disgusted at his utmost disregard for women, appalled at the filthy conditions at his clinic, and devastated to learn about his brutal method of \u201csnipping\u201d the spinal cords of babies he had deliberately aborted alive.\n\nFollowing the exposure of Gosnell\u2019s \u201cHouse of Horrors,\u201d many attorneys general from across the nation initiated investigations into abortion facilities in their states.\n\nAttorney General Ken Cuccinelli has worked to improve health and safety standards to protect women\u2019s health in abortion facilities across the Commonwealth.\n\nTerry McAuliffe has promised to take executive action to allow abortion clinics, which he admits do not meet Virginia\u2019s health and safety regulatory standards, to remain open.\n\nTo download a comparison flyer of the Virginia Gubernatorial Candidates, click here.\n\nNew Jersey Gubernatorial Election\n\nAbortion\n\nGov.
