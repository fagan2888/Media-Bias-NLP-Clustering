LAKE TANGANYIKA, Tanzania (AP) — Hundreds of women, many with children strapped on their backs alongside their few belongings, sing melodious tunes expressing their joy as their small boats approach the ferry M.V. Liemba.

“We are thanking God for leaving Burundi. Now we are in Tanzania we are safe,” the women sing in Kirundi, Burundi’s official language, after they boarded the ferry.

They are among a group of about 600 Burundi refugees evacuated by the U.N. refugee agency Saturday from a makeshift refugee camp at the fishing village of Kagunga, Tanzania.

The small town has hosted thousands of refugees crossing over from Burundi and now has been hit by a cholera outbreak. The refugees are being taken to Kigoma where they will be bused further inland to Nyarugusu, a camp with better facilities, said Celine Schmitt, a spokeswoman for the U.N refugee agency.

Tens of thousands of Burundians are escaping political turmoil triggered by President Pierre Nkurinziza’s bid for a third term in office in the June 26 elections.

Burundi recently experienced a civil war from 1993 to 2003 which killed at least 250,000 people.

Bujumbura, Burundi’s capital, has had four weeks of street protests in which 20 have died and 431 injured. The protests started after it was announced that Nkurunziza will run for another term, which many say is against the constitution.

The protests boiled over last week when a section of the army attempted a coup, which was crushed in 48 hours.
