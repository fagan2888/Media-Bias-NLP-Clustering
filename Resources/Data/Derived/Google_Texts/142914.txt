Today's Ben Carson news: Dr. Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. But he said there's one part of the law he'd keep -- prohibiting insurers from turning away people with preexisting conditions.

"I think the banning of people being turned away from health insurance because of pre-existing conditions is one of very few bright spots in an otherwise horribly written law," Carson wrote in a response to a question from a supporter. "Providing coverage to people who are sick is extremely important. When I work with Congress to repeal the law, I think we should keep this protection for the sick."

Carson has been answering questions from supporters on his Facebook page.
