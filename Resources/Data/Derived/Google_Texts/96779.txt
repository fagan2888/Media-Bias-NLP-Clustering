Co-starring Michael McKean as J. Edgar Hoover and Brandon J. Dirden as Martin Luther King, Jr., the show is scheduled to play a limited engagement at The Neil Simon Theatre on Broadway.

Rehearsals are to begin Jan. 14, with previews beginning Feb. 10, and an opening night set for March 6. It is directed by Bill Rauch, artistic director of Oregon Shakespeare Festival.

“‘All the Way is a gripping new play about a pivotal moment in American history,” a synopsis said. “This drama will take audiences behind the doors of the Oval Office and inside the first years of Lyndon B. Johnson’s presidency, and his fight to pass a landmark civil rights bill.”
