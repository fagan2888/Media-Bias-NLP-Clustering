One day, a fellow student lured her into an empty room at the high school and raped her.\n\nShe told only her best friend about the attack.\n\n\u201cAutomatically, there was shame involved,\u201d Willis-Blount said. \u201cSo that prevented me from telling anyone else.\u201d\n\nA few months later, her friend insisted that Willis-Blount go to Planned Parenthood for a check-up.\n\nShe and her friend skipped school and went to the clinic, and clinic staff told her she was pregnant.\n\n\u201cI was stunned,\u201d said Willis-Blount. \u201cThey said, \u2018well, we can help you out,\u2019 and gave me pamphlets on abortion.\u201d\n\nTerrified of telling her parents about the pregnancy and scared no one would believe that she had been raped, Willis-Blount made an appointment for an abortion.\n\nThe day the abortion was scheduled to take place, Willis-Blount forged an excuse note for school. The secretary, sensing that something was wrong with the upset and nervous student in front of her, sent her to the guidance counselor.\n\nWillis-Blount told the guidance counselor she was pregnant, who told her mother. Her mother asked the family\u2019s pastor to come to the house when they told her father.\n\nWillis-Blount said that the next few weeks were \u201ctense\u201d in her home as her parents fought about what she should do. She initially said she wanted to keep her baby, but later said she would have an abortion, believing it would improve the tension in the home.\n\n\u201cI felt that all the fighting, everything that had happened was my fault, and this would end it,\u201d Willis-Blount said.\n\nBut in the backseat of her parents\u2019 car on the way to her second abortion appointment, Willis-Blount told her father to pull over.\n\n\u201cI felt like I had heard God tell me to take his hand and trust him whatever the outcome would be,\u201d Willis-Blount said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t her fault. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do, but I wasn\u2019t going to kill her.\u201d\n\nWillis-Blount went to a pregnancy counselor who walked her through all of her options.\n\n\u201cShe made me feel like I was mature enough to make my own decision,\u201d Willis-Blount said.\n\nShe chose an open adoption. The couple she selected already had a son and were \u201cthrilled\u201d to learn she was having a girl.\n\nShe gave birth to a baby girl five days before her 15th birthday. Her daughter\u2019s adoptive mother was in the delivery room with her.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a blessing,\u201d Willis-Blount said. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to call it a silver lining; it was beautiful.\u201d\n\nWillis-Blount said she has seen her daughter every year, and she has had the opportunity to meet her extended biological family.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s about to go to college. She wants to be an emergency room trauma surgeon,\u201d Willis-Blount said. \u201cShe wants to save lives, which I think is apropos.\u201d\n\nWillis-Blount is now a public relations professional, a motivational speaker, and a pro-life activist.\n\nWillis-Blount said that too often, society and politicians present a false choice between \u201cthe well-being of women and the well-being of children.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so quick to throw the baby under the bus instead of examining the issues surrounding abortion. We should focus on providing health care and mental health care for women and girls in difficult situations and confronting poverty, drugs, and sex trafficking.\u201d\n\nWillis-Blount said that \u201call life matters\u2014no exceptions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have compassion and empathy for women who have had an abortion. The awful irony of the pro-choice movement is that it doesn\u2019t feel like a choice. I know what it\u2019s like to be in a hard situation. But we should never have the right to take another life. Any situation, no matter how grim, can be turned around for good.\u201d\n\nWillis-Blount said that it\u2019s \u201cfrustrating\u201d to hear pro-choice advocates and politicians use rape survivors as examples of people who need Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever want anyone using my rape or my daughter to keep their loophole open,\u201d Willis-Blount said. \u201cDo not speak for me. If you want to know what a woman in that situation needs, ask me. I\u2019ve got two degrees, my daughter is about to get hers, we\u2019re doing fine.\u201d\n\nShe said the undercover videos showing Planned Parenthood executives discussing the sale of aborted fetal organs were difficult to watch.\n\n\u201cIt did traumatize me to see the videos. I actually took the time to watch the videos, unlike some of the politicians that voted.\u201d\n\nWillis-Blount is disappointed that the Senate failed to get the votes necessary to defund Planned Parenthood. \u201cApparently I don\u2019t have control over where my tax dollars go.\u201d\n\nShe added that consumers should be aware which companies are donating to Planned Parenthood and make their spending decisions accordingly.\n\n\u201cUnborn children are being discriminated against,\u201d Willis-Blount said. \u201cIt\u2019s long overdue that we do something about it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Crystal Willis-Blount, a birth mother and a rape survivor, says that she and her daughter are not \u201ctalking points\u201d for pro-choice politicians.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Crystal Willis-Blount, a birth mother and a rape survivor, says that she and her daughter are not \u201ctalking points\u201d for pro-choice politicians.", "title": "Why This Rape Survivor Chose Life for Her Daughter", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150805_Crystal_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-18T19:23:10+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1UzkStj"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Crystal Willis-Blount, a birth mother and a rape survivor, says that she and her daughter are not \u201ctalking points\u201d for pro-choice politicians.", "title": "Why This Rape Survivor Chose Life for Her Daughter", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150805_Crystal_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-08-18T09:16:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-18T19:23:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Crystal Willis-Blount, pro-life, prolife, Planned Parenthood, Center for Medical Progress, Save The 1"}, "article_summary": "Crystal Willis-Blount, a birth mother and a rape survivor, says that she and her daughter are not \u201ctalking points\u201d for pro-choice politicians.\n\u201cSo that prevented me from telling anyone else.\u201dA few months later, her friend insisted that Willis-Blount go to Planned Parenthood for a check-up.\nWillis-Blount told the guidance counselor she was pregnant, who told her mother.\nBut in the backseat of her parents\u2019 car on the way to her second abortion appointment, Willis-Blount told her father to pull over.\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever want anyone using my rape or my daughter to keep their loophole open,\u201d Willis-Blount said."}
