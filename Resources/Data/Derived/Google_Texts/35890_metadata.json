Local officials said the meetings will be held quarterly, with the next one possibly in March.\n\nThe two previous sessions were marked by sharp criticism and complaints, and this latest gathering was no exception.\n\nAs Altose extolled the medical center's commitment to quality, one woman in the audience muttered, \"Then why doesn't this happen?\"\n\nA veteran seated nearby was even harsher. \"Lies!\" he simply said.\n\nQuestions about individual circumstances raised by some of the 60 or so veterans attending were referred to consultations with case workers in separate rooms.\n\nOther remarks by veterans and family members were met with sympathy and promises to improve.\n\nOne widow of a Vietnam veteran who had been treated by the VA said, \"I hope no veteran has to go through what my husband went through. He came in for dental implants and went out in a body bag.\"\n\nAltose expressed his regrets for any difficulties that she or her husband had experienced, and noted, \"We take very seriously any areas that need to be improved. We are dedicated to improving.\"\n\nOne veteran said it took three months to get an appointment with a VA doctor. Come time to file a claim for benefits, \"they used that time against me (in denying the claim), saying I was at fault for not acting promptly,\" he said.\n\n\"I volunteered to fight for my country, nobody forced me, and I think I deserve better care than that,\" he added.\n\nA woman veteran diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder complained about calls from VA staffers who rate benefit claims, asking questions without being sensitive to the potential psychological impact of some inquiries.\n\n\"You have raters asking questions without knowing the consequences of those questions,\" she said.\n\nWeber agreed. \"I can see how that can be a bad thing,\" he said. \"I'm going to take that back with me and try to own it.\"\n\nSome veterans were there to vent.\n\nOne vet said he had been given three different disability claim ratings by the same VA doctor over the years, \"and I didn't get a penny out of it to this day. How can I have any confidence and faith in a system that does that?\"\n\nHe abruptly left before VA officials could answer, saying, \"I don't need to hear your response.\"\n\nAnother man took issue with a statement about the timeliness of VA medical care. \"If it were timely care, I still would have my father here,\" he said. \"It was not timely care, and now my father is dead.\"\n\nBut some vets also voiced support of VA programs and medical care.\n\nJen Pitts, 46, a Marine veteran from Parma, said she found the critical stories of other vets a little \"confounding\" because \"my care has always been really great.\"\n\nAnother vet, treated by the VA for heart attacks and kidney cancer, said, \"You guys have taken excellent care of me. I wish everybody could experience what I have with the VA.\"\n\nA woman Marine veteran said the VA has improved during the past 13 years, and its program for female vets has \"grown by leaps and bounds. It's a safe environment, and the staff is wonderful.\"\n\nNear the end of the two-hour session, Altose, his voice gone hoarse, thanked the veterans for their input, both good and bad. \"We take this seriously,\" he said. \"We wlll all work to make things better.\n\n\"This is a team sport,\" he added. \"We all need to be working toward serving the veteran. That's the bottom line.\n\n\"Let's not forget that we do an awful lot of good things,\" he continued. \"Is there room for improvement? Absolutely.\"\n\nRichard Lasky, 65, of Parma, similarly urged his fellow veterans to be patient participants for change. \"If we don't complain, they're not going to change. But they've been very responsive to doing that,\" he said.\n\nThe Vietnam vet said that when he got back home in 1969, \"I would never walk into a VA.\"\n\nBut Lasky said the system has changed for the better. As he told the VA officials, \"The bottom line is that now you listen. I think you're making strides.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "department-of-veterans-affairs,town-hall,veterans", "title": "Vets offer problems and praise at VA town hall meeting in Parma", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Vets offer problems and praise at VA town hall meeting in Parma\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2014/12/vets_offer_problems_and_praise.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/plain_dealer_metro/photo/16536893-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14717283\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-12-10T12:17:21Z\", \"author\": \"Brian Albrecht, The Plain Dealer\", \"tags\": [\"@parma\",\"department-of-veterans-affairs\",\"town-hall\",\"veterans\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/plain_dealer_metro/photo/16536893-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "http://www. @brian_albrecht", "description": "A third town hall meeting was held Tuesday, by the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the VA's Cleveland Regional Benefit Office, inviting veterans and their families to provide feedback about the agency's programs and services.", "card": "summary", "site": "@clevelanddotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, December 10, 2014, 11:03 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/plain_dealer_metro/photo/cleveland-va-medical-center-holds-town-hall-meeting-to-hear-from-vets-fae7a0ba0d028b9c.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"balbrech\", \"author_nickname\": \"Brian Albrecht, The Plain Dealer\", \"author_id\": \"5328\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Metro News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "A third town hall meeting was held Tuesday, by the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the VA's Cleveland Regional Benefit Office, inviting veterans and their families to provide feedback about the agency's programs and services.", "title": "Vets offer problems and praise at VA town hall meeting in Parma", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2014/12/vets_offer_problems_and_praise.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, December 10, 2014,  7:00 AM", "article_author": "Brian Albrecht, The Plain Dealer", "Description": "A third town hall meeting was held Tuesday, by the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the VA's Cleveland Regional Benefit Office, inviting veterans and their families to provide feedback about the agency's programs and services."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc0ae\"", "article_summary": "Another man took issue with a statement about the timeliness of VA medical care.\nThe event, held at the Parma VA Outpatient Clinic, is part of a national effort to restore confidence in the VA's medical treatment and benefits system.\nBut some vets also voiced support of VA programs and medical care.\nAnother vet, treated by the VA for heart attacks and kidney cancer, said, \"You guys have taken excellent care of me.\nAs Altose extolled the medical center's commitment to quality, one woman in the audience muttered, \"Then why doesn't this happen?\""}
