William Barber on the beginning of the 273 mile walk to Washington\n\nAdam O\u2019Neal, the Republican mayor of a small North Carolina town named Belhaven, is currently on a nearly 300 mile journey to the nation\u2019s capital to raise awareness for a cause that\u2019s rather unpopular within his own party. This week, the mayor started walking to Washington, DC on foot, hoping to bring more attention to the human consequences of rejecting Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion.\n\nSince North Carolina hasn\u2019t yet agreed to expand Medicaid, the hospital serving O\u2019Neal\u2019s rural constituency was recently forced to close. Vidant Pungo Hospital, which used to care for a disproportionately large population of low-income and uninsured patients, can no longer afford to remain operating in Belhaven. If the state had expanded Medicaid, however, things may have turned out differently. Vidant Pungo would have received an influx of newly insured patients; like the hospitals located in states that accepted Obamacare\u2019s expansion, Vidant\u2019s profit margins probably would have improved.\n\nNow, Belhaven\u2019s residents have to travel nearly an hour to get to the closest hospital, something that has created what O\u2019Neal calls \u201ca medical desert.\u201d So he\u2019s marching 273 miles to Washington to find a solution.\n\n\u201cOur state\u2019s refusal to accept expansion is taking two billion dollars a year out of our state\u2019s healthcare system,\u201d the mayor wrote in an op-ed to explain why he\u2019s making the trek over the next two weeks. \u201cAmericans need to realize the rural healthcare struggles across our country. In the last year, more rural hospitals have closed than in the previous 15 years. Every hospital closure means deaths!!!\u201d\n\nIn order to make that point, O\u2019Neal is recounting the story of 48-year-old Portia Gibbs, who he says may not have died if she had been able to go to Vidant Pungo. Last week, Gibbs passed away after suffering a heart attack while emergency responders were waiting for a helicopter to transfer her to the closest hospital, which is now located 75 miles away. O\u2019Neal points out it may have turned out differently if Vidant Pungo, which was 47 miles away, was still open.\n\nAlthough some emergency responders say that a closer hospital wouldn\u2019t have saved Gibbs, her family is still upset that she never had the option to receive emergency care in Belhaven. They joined O\u2019Neal when he kicked off his two-week march on Monday, saying they want to prevent more potential deaths.\n\nO\u2019Neal and his supporters believe the decision to close Vidant Pungo Hospital violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it disproportionately impacted African Americans in the state who rely on that safety net hospital. Earlier this year, the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP filed an official complaint with the Department of Justice on those grounds. The DOJ initially negotiated a settlement that required Vidant Health, the regional health care system that ran the Pungo Hospital, to work out a plan to transfer control of the hospital\u2019s operation. But that plan ended up falling apart, and the civil rights complaint has since been re-filed. The president of North Carolina\u2019s NAACP, Rev. William Barber \u2014 who has been an instrumental player in the state\u2019s ongoing Moral Monday movement \u2014 will join O\u2019Neal on the first leg of his walk.\n\nNorth Carolina isn\u2019t the only state where this dynamic is unfolding. Rural hospitals are also being forced to close in states like Virginia, Georgia, and Tennessee in the absence of Medicaid expansion. The Rural Policy Research Institute sees the fight over this particular Obamacare provision as one of the most important issues facing its constituency.\n\n\u201cBelhaven\u2019s battle to hold onto emergency healthcare is shaping up to be a do-or-die challenge for rural America,\u201d O\u2019Neal explained at a recent county commissioner meeting, when he announced his intention to begin his march. \u201cWhen it\u2019s do-or-die, it\u2019s no time to sit still. That\u2019s why I\u2019m walking.\u201d The mayor is hoping to schedule a meeting with Attorney General Eric Holder and President Barack Obama once he eventually arrives in Washington.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The mayor of the small town of Belhaven, North Carolina is walking all the way to Washington, DC to ask for solutions for his impoverished constituents.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The mayor of the small town of Belhaven, North Carolina is walking all the way to Washington, DC to ask for solutions for his impoverished constituents.", "title": "This GOP Mayor Is Marching 273 Miles To Demand Medicaid Expansion", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/07/15/3460133/republican-mayor-march-medicaid/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/medicaid-walk.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The mayor of the small town of Belhaven, North Carolina is walking all the way to Washington, DC to ask for solutions for his impoverished constituents.", "title": "This GOP Mayor Is Marching 273 Miles To Demand Medicaid Expansion", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/medicaid-walk-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/medicaid-walk.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/medicaid-walk.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-15T09:11:57+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc23\"", "article_summary": "Health This GOP Mayor Is Marching 273 Miles To Demand Medicaid Expansion CREDIT: WITN screenshot Mayor Adam O'Neal and Rev.\nVidant Pungo Hospital, which used to care for a disproportionately large population of low-income and uninsured patients, can no longer afford to remain operating in Belhaven.\nO\u2019Neal points out it may have turned out differently if Vidant Pungo, which was 47 miles away, was still open.\nSince North Carolina hasn\u2019t yet agreed to expand Medicaid, the hospital serving O\u2019Neal\u2019s rural constituency was recently forced to close.\nThis week, the mayor started walking to Washington, DC on foot, hoping to bring more attention to the human consequences of rejecting Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion."}
