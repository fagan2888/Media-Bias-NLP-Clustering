Update at 2:58 p.m. by Julie Fancher: Plano police said the Central Expressway has reopened.

Original post: Plano police advise motorists to avoid a section of Central Expressway near Plano Road until at least 3 p.m. Sunday.

A downed power line forced police to close the major north-south artery about noon, just as many families were traveling home from Easter church services. Motorists report traffic is backed up nearly a mile in both directions.

It is unclear what knocked the power line down. Utility crews are working to restore service and reopen the freeway.
