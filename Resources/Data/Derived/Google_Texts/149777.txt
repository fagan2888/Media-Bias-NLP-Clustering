Bertolini also commented on the future of the health care industry and what changes he'd like to see made to Obamacare before he can support it.

"We need a broader population to join," he said. "We need younger people to join, we need more of the uninsured to join, we need a different set of products, more rating flexibility, a broader range of rates for people to buy from and more markets that we have strong lower-cost control in so that we can offer those products on an affordable basis."

In addition, he referred to these concessions as "legislative changes" that the company isn't likely to see under the current government administration.

"What we need is a president that will work with Congress and a Congress that will work with the president," he said. "And both candidates are going to have to make promises about changes to Obamacare."
