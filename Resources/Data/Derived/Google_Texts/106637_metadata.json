While studies so far have not identified a statistically significant change in calorie consumption from menu labeling, some have argued that even a small reduction in calorie intake can go a long way in reducing the likelihood of certain chronic diseases such as diabetes.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Background And The Law?\n\nAs the brief explains, in 1994 the FDA required nutritional information be displayed on packaged food but exempted restaurants and other ready-to-eat establishments. The new, proposed rule, which is based on a section of the Affordable Care Act, requires some 300,000 establishments to clearly display the calories contained in standard menu items. An important goal of the law is that it requires labeling for all establishments selling \u201crestaurant-like\u201d food, such as grocery store salad bars and roadside convenience stores. The rule will preempt any existing local or state laws.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Debate?\n\nWhile the law may seem straightforward, there were vigorous debates about every word of the FDA rule. The brief summarizes the key debates over what kind of food establishments are affected, the cost of compliance, and how much of an impact calorie labeling would make on consumers\u2019 menu selections.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nWith less than six months to go before the rule takes effect, one major unresolved issue is determining who will enforce it \u2014 local officials, FDA inspectors, or both. With some members of Congress trying to delay implementation, the FDA recently released a compliance guide that restates the requirements \u201cin plain language.\u201d\n\nAbout Health Policy Briefs\n\nHealth Policy Briefs are aimed at policy makers, congressional staffers, and others needing short, jargon-free explanations of health policy basics.
