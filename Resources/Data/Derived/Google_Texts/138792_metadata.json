One mailer, no less blunt than the Democrats\u2019 efforts, portrayed Mr. Recchia as a circus clown. Another showed him wearing a dunce cap.\n\nThe race for the swing district, won barely by President Barack Obama two years ago, has long been bitter. Mr. Grimm was indicted in April on wire and mail fraud charges related to a Manhattan restaurant he managed before he was elected to Congress. Mr. Recchia repeatedly ripped Mr. Grimm for the charges, though the Republican pleaded not guilty and will be tried in December. In turn, Mr. Grimm tried to tie Mr. Recchia to liberals relatively unpopular in Staten Island like Mayor Bill de Blasio and also mocked Mr. Recchia for his lack of mastery of basic policy.\n\nThough neither candidate has overly emphasized women\u2019s issues on the campaign trail\u2013and one extensive mammography study questions whether the tests even work\u2013Democrats in the state and nationally are hoping the Republican Party is becoming too toxic for women voters. State Democrats formed the Women\u2019s Equality Party to help Gov. Andrew Cuomo underscore his support for various women\u2019s rights issues as he takes on a social conservative in Republican Rob Astorino. Nationally, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and U.S. Senate Democrats are looking to avoid midterm landslides by appealing to women voters.\n\nMr. Grimm\u2019s campaign called the Democratic mailers \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and \u201cdesperate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is beyond disgraceful and desperate to exploit female cancer patients for cheap political gains with these absurd and outright false attacks,\u201d said Nick Iacono, a spokesman for Mr. Grimm. \u201cThe Congressman\u2019s legislative record clearly demonstrates his relentless commitment to finding a cure for breast cancer and all forms of cancer as evidenced by his steadfast support for additional funding for cancer research and his presence at all the local charity walks and functions throughout Staten island and Brooklyn.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Ross Barkan", "sailthru.author": "Ross Barkan", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/imagejpeg_0-1.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/imagejpeg_0-1.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "Domenic Recchia, Michael Grimm, ny-11, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "breast cancer, mammograms, mammography, new york state democrats, michael grimm, domenic recchia, ny-11, staten island, war on women, grimm breast cancer, breast cancer awareness month", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/imagejpeg_0-1.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "breast cancer, mammograms, mammography, new york state democrats, michael grimm, domenic recchia, ny-11, staten island, war on women, grimm breast cancer, breast cancer awareness month", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "\u2018The Difference Between a Survivor and a Victim\u2019: Cancer-Themed Mail Rips Grimm", "sailthru.byline_email": "rbarkan@observer.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "ross", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/imagejpeg_0-1.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "Mail from State Democrats slam Congressman Michael Grimm for anti-Obamacare votes that they say will lead to the spread of breast cancer.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ross-barkan-headshot-e1402611381985.jpg?quality=80&w=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "sailthru.byline_twitter": "@rossbarkan", "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2014-10-13T14:58:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-13T14:58:36+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/ross"}, "sailthru.description": "Mailers from New York State Democrats slam Congressman Michael Grimm for anti-Obamacare votes that they say will lead to the spread of breast cancer.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "Mailers from New York State Democrats slam Congressman Michael Grimm for anti-Obamacare votes that they say will lead to the spread of breast cancer.", "title": "\u2018The Difference Between a Survivor and a Victim\u2019: Cancer-Themed Mail Rips Grimm", "url": "http://observer.com/2014/10/the-difference-between-a-survivor-and-a-victim-cancer-themed-mail-rips-grimm/", "image": {"width": 635, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/imagejpeg_0-1.jpg?quality=80", "height": 357}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Ross Barkan is a national political reporter for The New York Observer.
