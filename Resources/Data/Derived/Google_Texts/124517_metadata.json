In addition, of the 136,860 people diagnosed with the disease, nearly 50,310 will die.\n\nHowever, many still do not schedule a colonoscopy when they turn 50.\n\nDr. Sakhie Hussain, medical director of the Endoscopy Center at Advocate Trinity Hospital in Chicago, offers three reasons why the routine screening saves lives.\n\nColon cancer is 100-percent preventable\n\nColon cancer starts in either the colon or the rectum.\n\nSymptoms of the cancer include rectal bleeding, stomach pain, weakness, weight loss and low red blood cells. A colonoscopy can diagnose the cancer before the symptoms start.\n\n\u201cWhen you have breast cancer, the first cells they find in a biopsy are cancerous, but in a colonoscopy exam, when we find hybrid cells called \u2018polyps,\u2019 it is not cancerous,\u201d says Dr. Hussain. \u201cOnce we remove them, you no longer have to worry about anything.\u201d\n\nEarly detection pays off\n\nColon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. behind lung cancer.\n\nThe five-year survival rate for colon cancer found at the early stage is 90 percent, according to the Colon Cancer Alliance. The five-year survival rate for colon cancer found at the regional stage is 70 percent.\n\n\u201cIf you are 50 and you haven\u2019t had your colonoscopy, the risk of getting colon cancer is very high,\u201d says Dr. Hussain. \u201cBut, whenever it is caught early, your survival rate skyrockets.\u201d\n\nThe first one is free\n\nOnce a person reaches 50 years old, most routine, preventative screening colonoscopies are covered with no co-insurance or co-payment under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThere are no financial implications, so there is no reason why you shouldn\u2019t have one,\u201d says Dr. Hussain. \u201cPrevention is better than a cure.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Crusader", "og": {"site_name": "Gary/Chicago Crusader", "description": "By Ernst Lamothe Jr.,\u00a0ahchealthenews.com The numbers are scary.
