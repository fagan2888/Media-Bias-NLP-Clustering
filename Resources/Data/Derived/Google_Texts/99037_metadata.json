Sanders, an independent, is challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nRubio to Nevada: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, seeking the Republican nomination for president, is planning many more trips to the early-nominating state of Nevada. The Washington Post writes Rubio said Thursday he plans to be back \u201cquite often.\u201d The Post says that among the four early states, Nevada is perhaps the best test case for Rubio\u2019s strategy to present himself as a new kind of Republican. \u201cNevada \u2014 especially Las Vegas \u2014 is much more representative of the rest of the country than Iowa and New Hampshire in many different ways,\u201d longtime Nevada political expert Jon Ralston told the Post. \u201cLas Vegas is a melting pot, a strong union town in a right-to-work state. It has a burgeoning Asian and Hispanic population.\u201d\n\nSalmon may challenge McCain: Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon is \u201ctaking a serious look\u201d at a primary run against Sen. John McCain in 2016, a source close to the representative told National Journal. The source said the congressman has been \u201cgratified by the strong level of support\u201d he\u2019s seen from supporters, and would likely make a decision by early August. If Salmon runs, it would begin what would likely be the election cycle\u2019s most closely watched primary, pitting former Republican presidential nominee McCain against a lawmaker with the strong support of local and national conservative groups.\n\nGOP split on health-law fix: A month before the Supreme Court is expected to rule on a key component of the Affordable Care Act, congressional Republicans are split over strategy for handling the possible fallout. The Wall Street Journal writes Republicans are divided over whether to extend temporarily the health law\u2019s tax credits if the court voids them in most of the country. Some lawmakers say an extension would buy them time to enact a broader overhaul of the 2010 health law they oppose.\n\nHabitat for Humanity wants relief: Habitat for Humanity is the latest group to seek relief from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. The Hill writes the housing nonprofit is fighting for an exemption from the law\u2019s regulation that requires housing appraisers to receive \u201ccustomary and reasonable\u201d compensation. The regulation was aimed at boosting housing-market protection by making sure mortgage companies and banks wouldn\u2019t get faulty financial advice from cheap appraisers. But the Hill writes Habitat for Humanity, which relies on appraisers who volunteer their services, says the rule has created a headache for their more than 1,400 U.S. affiliates that fear they\u2019re bucking Dodd-Frank in accepting free appraisal services.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Bernie Sanders\u2019 message resonates with seniors; Rep.
