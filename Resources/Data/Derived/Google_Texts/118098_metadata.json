Barbara Boxer.\n\nA Field Poll last month showed 48 percent of likely voters in the race remain undecided.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s because the headline-stealing presidential primary has grabbed all of the attention. Whatever the reason, we\u2019re here to help.\n\nThe state\u2019s leading public media newsrooms will hold a debate Tuesday night called \u201cCalifornia Counts \u2014 Race for the Senate.\u201d KPBS will host the debate from the station\u2019s San Diego television studio in partnership with KPCC in Pasadena, KQED in San Francisco and Capital Public Radio in Sacramento.\n\nThe debate will air live at 7 p.m. on 88.5 FM and stream on KQED.org.\n\nThe debate is part of California Counts, an election coverage initiative from KPBS, KPCC, KQED and Capital Public Radio. The partnership is a first for the stations. Reports from California Counts focus on major issues and solicit diverse voices on what\u2019s important to the future of the state.\n\nWho will be debating?\n\nTwo Democrats, California Attorney General Kamala Harris and congresswoman Loretta Sanchez of Orange County, and three Republicans, Tom Del Beccaro, Duf Sundheim and Ron Unz. Del Beccaro and Sundheim are former heads of the state Republican Party. Unz is an entrepreneur, writer and publisher. If you want to read up on the candidates, you can find a profile on Harris here; read about Sanchez here; and find more info on the GOP candidates here.\n\nWho\u2019s asking the questions?\n\nThe moderator is KPBS investigative reporter Amita Sharma. The panelists are Scott Shafer, senior editor for KQED\u2019s California Politics and Government Desk; Mary Plummer, senior politics reporter for KPCC; Linnea Edmeier, managing editor for Capital Public Radio; and Marco Serrano, reporter for Univision San Diego.\n\nHow will you know if a candidate\u2019s not answering a question?\n\nThis is for those watching the debate on TV or on the Web. Each question will be on the screen. So if a candidate dodges the question or veers off topic, you\u2019ll be able to see exactly what he or she was asked in the first place. Candidates, take note and just answer the questions. For radio listeners, expect the moderator or panelists to point out candidates who dodge the questions.\n\nHow does the audience get to participate?\n\nWe didn\u2019t want a debate without a little audience participation. That\u2019s why one of the questions was picked from an online poll \u2014 no, it wasn\u2019t scientific \u2014 done by KPBS, KPCC, KQED and Capital Public Radio. First, we asked for questions that you wanted us to ask. Three topics emerged as the most popular: the Affordable Care Act, foreign policy and the environment. Then we let you vote online. The environment won, so the candidates can expect a climate change question.\n\nAnother question will come from the studio audience, which will largely be made up of students from San Diego State University. (If you didn\u2019t know, KPBS is based on the SDSU campus.) We want to get these millennials engaged in the election, given that turnout among voters under 24 in the June 2014 primary was abysmal \u2014 3.7 percent in California.\n\nWhat\u2019s this Facebook Live pre-debate show?\n\nThis is our way of getting the debate fun started early. Before the show, KPBS \u2014 with help from our partners at KPCC and KQED \u2014 will host a Facebook live stream starting around 6:15 p.m. Tuesday. KPBS anchor Maya Trabulsi will take Facebook viewers around the station and into the studio to catch some of the action before the candidates arrive on stage.\n\nAlong the way, she\u2019ll talk to some of the SDSU students and give them a pop quiz on politics. (She needs to go easy on them. This is finals week on campus, after all.) If you want to learn more about how this works before the debate, click here.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPBS.
