Late Thursday, the company said it had developed two new platforms to its gene-sequencing lineup, the NextSeq 500 and the HiSeq X Ten.\n\nShutterstock\n\nThese and other systems are geared toward analyzing human genes to expose potential disorders, and in some cases to find cures for debilitating diseases such as cancer. The company\u2019s systems are able to identify embryos that may have severe genetic disorders. It also is developing several analytical tools designed to more quickly process genomic information.\n\nThe new strategy was announced at an investor conference on Thursday.\n\n\u201cNeedless to say, the tone was upbeat, and clearly reflective of a company hitting its stride amidst a backdrop of rapid market expansion,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s Tycho Peterson said in a note to clients. He raised his price target on the company\u2019s shares to $190 from $120, making note of the potential $20 billion market.\n\nDan Leonard of Leerink Research did the same and upped his price target on shares to $140 from $110.\n\n\u201cWhile [Illumina's] stock is expensive, in our view, by any measure, we believe investors will be willing to pay $20 billion for a company visibly executing toward a $20 billion market opportunity in an enviable competitive position,\u201d Leonard said in a note to clients.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nRecord price drops for prescription drugs\n\nMounting hepatitis C drug optimism boosts Gilead to top of S&P 500\n\nObamacare, Medicare cuts could hit UnitedHealth profits, CEO says", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-01-17T12:06:04-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "A new broad corporate strategy unveiled by Illumina Inc. boosts the company's shares by as much as 10%.", "title": "Illumina shares up on plan to tap $20 billion gene-sequencing market", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/17/illumina-shares-soar-on-plan-to-tap-20-billion-genome-sequencing-market/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS812_dna_st_MG_20140117101841.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "biotechnology,genome sequencing,health care,Illumina Inc.", "article.headline": "Illumina shares up on plan to tap $20 billion gene-sequencing market", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "biotechnology,genome sequencing,health care,Illumina Inc.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "A new broad corporate strategy unveiled by Illumina Inc. boosts the company's shares by as much as 10%.", "article.published": "2014-01-17T12:06:04-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/17/illumina-shares-soar-on-plan-to-tap-20-billion-genome-sequencing-market/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "A new broad corporate strategy unveiled by Illumina Inc. boosts the company's shares by as much as 10%.", "title": "Illumina shares up on plan to tap $20 billion gene-sequencing market", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/17/illumina-shares-soar-on-plan-to-tap-20-billion-genome-sequencing-market/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS812_dna_st_MG_20140117101841.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1876", "article.updated": "2014-01-17T12:10:18-05:00"}, "article_summary": "He raised his price target on the company\u2019s shares to $190 from $120, making note of the potential $20 billion market.\nDan Leonard of Leerink Research did the same and upped his price target on shares to $140 from $110.\n\u201cWhile [Illumina's] stock is expensive, in our view, by any measure, we believe investors will be willing to pay $20 billion for a company visibly executing toward a $20 billion market opportunity in an enviable competitive position,\u201d Leonard said in a note to clients.\nA new broad corporate strategy unveiled by Illumina Inc. was enough to boost the company\u2019s shares by as much as 10% in early trades Friday, as Wall Street said the genome-sequencing specialist could tap into a market worth up to $20 billion.\nIllumina /quotes/zigman/83650/delayed /quotes/nls/ilmn ILMN shares were up $11.13 to $136.16 in recent action, a record high."}
