In 2008, University of California San Diego political scientist James Fowler found that Democrats who appeared on the show raised 44 percent more money after their appearance than before, while appearances by Republicans had no effect or a slightly negative one. At the time, Fowler attributed the findings to a ripple effect \u2014 someone who appears on Colbert\u2019s show will receive more attention from mainstream media, meaning more attention from the general public.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, the ripple effect from Colbert\u2019s new Late Show could be especially large as viewers tune in to see how the real Stephen Colbert handles a talk show. And the presidential hopefuls are eager \u2014 maybe a bit too eager \u2014 to capitalize on it. Bush\u2019s team sent out an email offering anyone who donated $3 to his campaign entry into a raffle for a trip to New York and a VIP ticket to the taping of the first Colbert Late Show.\n\nIf the former Florida governor was hoping for a fundraising bump to go with his Colbert Bump, the raffle may have backfired a bit. Colbert last week posted a video (see below) in which he mocked Bush\u2019s raffle. \u201cNo one from Jeb\u2019s campaign asked if this was ok with me to raise money off my first show,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cWhere\u2019s my cut of that sweet three bucks, governor, huh?\u201d\n\nRelated: There\u2019s Only One Candidate People Actually Like \u2013 and It\u2019s Not Trump or Bush\n\nColbert launched a raffle of his own, with all proceeds going to the Yellow Ribbon Fund, which supports injured service members and their families. Besides a ticket to the first show, the winner will also be able to suggest one \u201cnon-obscene\u201d question for Colbert to ask Bush.\n\nThe little spat is a reminder to candidates \u2014 being on Colbert\u2019s bad side can be absolutely brutal. It\u2019s a lesson that any Bush should know quite well.\n\nTop Reads For The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The real Stephen Colbert is already flexing his political muscle, booking Jeb Bush, Jo", "title": "Can Jeb Bush, Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden Get a Colbert Bump?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/09/08/Can-Jeb-Bush-Bernie-Sanders-or-Joe-Biden-Get-Colbert-Bump", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11282012_stephen_colbert_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/09/08/Can-Jeb-Bush-Bernie-Sanders-or-Joe-Biden-Get-Colbert-Bump", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11282012_stephen_colbert_article.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The real Stephen Colbert is already flexing his political muscle, booking Jeb Bush, Jo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The real Stephen Colbert is already flexing his political muscle, booking Jeb Bush, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders to be on his new Late Show over its first two weeks, with Bush slated to appear on tonight\u2019s inaugural episode.\nIf the former Florida governor was hoping for a fundraising bump to go with his Colbert Bump, the raffle may have backfired a bit.\nColbert \u2014 or his blustery, self-aggrandizing persona as host of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d \u2014 used to boast that politicians who appeared on his show would see a boost in popularity, which he termed the Colbert Bump.\nRelated: Stephen Colbert: 9 Years of Epic \u2018Truthiness\u2019 Comes to an EndAt least one study suggests that the bump was real, at least for some candidates.\nBesides a ticket to the first show, the winner will also be able to suggest one \u201cnon-obscene\u201d question for Colbert to ask Bush."}
