(CNN) - As Scott Brown mulls another Senate bid this year, he's taking some time to rock out.

The former Massachusetts senator, who's considering a challenge against Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in his new home state of New Hampshire, jammed Sunday night with the band Cheap Trick, playing their 1978 single "Surrender."

"Hope you all enjoy this as much as I did," the Republican said in a post on Facebook, linking to the YouTube video of Brown singing and playing the guitar.

The concert took place in Lynn, Massachusetts.

Brown, who started learning to play the guitar about year ago, also played in December with his daughter, Ayla, and Mike Huckabee on the former Arkansas governor's Fox News Channel program.
