Money line: \u201cI always had a great relationship with Harry Reid. And frankly, if I weren\u2019t running for office I\u2019d be able to deal with her [Pelosi], I\u2019d be able to deal with Reid, I\u2019d be able to deal with anybody.\u201d This point has been made often, most recently by Andy McCarthy, but it can\u2019t be repeated enough: This guy is on the verge of beating Ted Cruz as an \u201coutsider\u201d by touting his record of cronyism. How can you be anti-establishment, wonders McCarthy, when you\u2019re crowing about your history of essentially bribing politicians, including politicians from the other party? It\u2019s a perfect complement to Trump, the least socially conservative candidate in the Republican field, landing the endorsement of the son of the man who founded the Moral Majority. Trump\u2019s success is like a flashing road sign, \u201cRepublicans don\u2019t actually care about most of the things they claim to care about.\u201d\n\nThree points. One: To reiterate the takeaway from last night\u2019s post, Trump feels free to tout his chumminess with Pelosi et al. only because he has absolute confidence that there\u2019s nothing he could say or do that would alienate his base. (In this case, the right side of his base, although it\u2019s the right who\u2019ll decide Iowa.) Cruz\u2019s brand as a full-spectrum conservative is a form of accountability: If he\u2019s elected and tacks towards the center, he can be held to account for why his principles don\u2019t match his actions. Trump\u2019s brand is a total lack of accountability. My fans won\u2019t abandon me no matter what I do in office, he says, and he\u2019s testing that theory by talking up his relationships with Democratic villains in crunch time before a conservative electorate goes to vote. Not even a centrist like Kasich would tout his relationships with Pelosi and Schumer, not even in order to draw a contrast with Cruz\u2019s obstructionism. Trump does it because he thinks his cult of personality will forgive him anything. And they will \u2014 but are there enough of them to beat Cruz in Iowa? If there are, how might a president who\u2019s convinced he\u2019s unaccountable to anyone behave in office?\n\nTwo: I don\u2019t understand how Trump fans reconcile the fact that this guy spent six months running as a strong man, who\u2019d impose his will on Washington through a combination of charisma, an electoral mandate, and raw executive power, but has spent most of the last month touting his willingness and ability to make deals with every Democrat in Washington, as if Pelosi and Schumer will accede to his demands out of sheer admiration for his testicular fortitude. Neither one of them\u2019s going to care if Trump wins big in the fall; their base is the left, not centrist Democrats, and the left despises Trump. In particular, Schumer will be eager to show the left as the Democrats\u2019 new leader in the Senate that he\u2019ll drive a hard bargain for their agenda, especially knowing how eager Trump will be to prove he can broker deals. Meanwhile, if Trump turns into the \u201cradical centrist\u201d everyone expects as president, he\u2019ll gradually lose the support of House conservatives, creating a new headache for Paul Ryan in building a coalition that can get to 218. Point being, Trump will have to work much harder than he expects to make enough people happy in Congress to move legislation. And it\u2019ll take plenty of palm-greasing. One of the reasons earmarks were such a curse word for grassroots conservatives even though they were a tiny part of the federal budget is what they symbolized about Washington culture \u2014 namely, federal money being doled out to special interests in the name of brokering legislative compromises that frequently left no one happy. The logic of Trump\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll make deals!\u201d pitch is that the earmark mentality would be back in force. It\u2019s nice that he\u2019s finally starting to level with his fans that he won\u2019t be the Green Lantern as president (unless he gets frustrated by gridlock and decides to go Full Metal Obama with executive power), but I hope they know what that means.\n\nThree: It\u2019s going to be endlessly enjoyable watching Trump\u2019s fan base in conservative media, especially among radio talkers, turn rhetorical somersaults to defend his \u201ccomity and compromise\u201d approach to Congress after spending the last three years applauding Ted Cruz for extending a middle finger to everyone there, starting with his own majority leader. If Trump can convince the dean of conservative talk radio to claim that he\u2019s opposed to big government when nothing of the sort is true, it\u2019ll be a snap to convince him that the only way to achieve lasting conservative victories is by bringing Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer on board in new legislative packages. If Trump ends up beating Cruz on Monday night and Cruz fades from the race, I think Cruz will come to realize that his strategy was sound, his organization was sound, but his campaign was based on a fundamentally flawed premise, which is that conservative populists were more deeply committed to conservatism than they were to populism, even when \u201cpopulism\u201d is presented as \u201cbargaining with Wall Street Democrats.\u201d Sorry, Ted. Exit quotation from a Twitter pal: \u201cOld and busted: BUT HE FIGHTS. New Hotness: BUT HE REACHES ACROSS THE AISLE.\u201d\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Outsiders.", "title": "Trump: I\u2019ve always had a good relationship with Nancy Pelosi and was close to Chuck Schumer in many ways", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/26/trump-ive-always-had-a-good-relationship-with-nancy-pelosi-and-was-close-to-chuck-schumer-in-many-ways/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-26T18:21:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-26T19:29:53+00:00"}, "keywords": "deals, Democrats, GOP, immigration, pelosi, relationship, schumer, trump,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Trump: I\u2019ve always had a good relationship with Nancy Pelosi and was close to Chuck Schumer in many waysposted at 1:21 pm on January 26, 2016 by AllahpunditThe key bit comes at 5:40 of the clip.\nOne: To reiterate the takeaway from last night\u2019s post, Trump feels free to tout his chumminess with Pelosi et al.\nNot even a centrist like Kasich would tout his relationships with Pelosi and Schumer, not even in order to draw a contrast with Cruz\u2019s obstructionism.\nonly because he has absolute confidence that there\u2019s nothing he could say or do that would alienate his base.\nTrump\u2019s success is like a flashing road sign, \u201cRepublicans don\u2019t actually care about most of the things they claim to care about.\u201dThree points."}
