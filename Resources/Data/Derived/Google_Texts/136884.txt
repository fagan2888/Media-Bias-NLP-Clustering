Bloomberg Business reported Saturday that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, believing the United States is planning a coup against him and his government, has ordered embassy staff from the country and banned George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and Marco Rubio from entering the country.

“In the past several days, we’ve detected activity and captured several Americans involved in espionage, trying to capture people,” Maduro said. “To protect our country we’re going to introduce an obligatory visa system for any American who wants to come here. They’ll have to pay in dollars what Venezuelans have to pay to go to the U.S.”

Also banned: Florida Republicans Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.

I've always wanted to travel to a corrupt country that is not a free democracy. And now Castro's lap dog won't let me! #quepena #maduro — Mario Diaz-Balart (@MarioDB) February 28, 2015

Venezuela bans "terrorists" @marcorubio, @RosLehtinen and @MarioDB http://t.co/2RLTdU1zmp — Patricia Mazzei (@PatriciaMazzei) March 1, 2015

Also, the Venezuelan president called @RosLehtinen by the old nickname given to her by the Cuban regime: "she-wolf" http://t.co/2RLTdU1zmp — Patricia Mazzei (@PatriciaMazzei) March 1, 2015

So what is this about American spies? CNN reported today that Maduro has claimed to have captured an American pilot planning a coup.

@patrickdehahn @instapundit A coup attempt with one pilot? Those budget cuts must have hit the CIA pretty hard. — Bryan Costin (@bcostin) March 1, 2015

Just a reminder that the paradise of Venezuela is now to the point where it’s swapping oil for toilet paper.
