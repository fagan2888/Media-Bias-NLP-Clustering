Taking advantage of up-to-the-minute innovations in media is key to success.\"\n\nThe new agency will build upon ID Media's impressive healthcare client roster, which includes a wide range of pharmaceutical therapies, payers, providers and clinical trial recruitment.\n\nFormerly Senior Vice President, Marketing at Digitas Health, Michael Maher will be responsible for the direction and expansion of ID Health.
