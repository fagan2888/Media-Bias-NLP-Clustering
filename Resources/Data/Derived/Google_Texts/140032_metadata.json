High-profile decisions in campaign finance, contraceptive coverage and public-employee unions had divided the Court into red and blue wings. It was the 10th term of Chief Justice John Roberts, I wrote, and \u201chis quest for a non-partisan Court seems in retrospect like the impossible dream.\u201d A year later, the situation is subtly different. The justices this term did not buy the world a Coke and keep it company; they divided, but divided on different lines. The Court this term showed different caucuses: a hard-right bloc (Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito), a conservative Republican bloc (Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy), and a moderate-to-liberal bloc (Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor). They disagreed on philosophy, not party, and individual justices felt much freer to cross lines.\n\nThe 5-4 liberal / conservative split persists: It showed up in Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency, which examined cost calculations under the Clean Air Act, and Glossip v. Gross, where the majority rejected a challenge to Oklahoma\u2019s lethal-injection procedure. But more interesting are the cases where the lines were scrambled. Related Story A Contentious Final Day at the U.S. Supreme Court Kennedy\u2019s vote gave 5-4 victories to the liberals in Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, which examined the impact of race on redistricting in state legislatures, and Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, which upheld disparate-impact claims under the Fair Housing Act. In Arizona Legislature v. Independent Redistricting Commission, Kennedy\u2019s vote saved an anti-gerrymandering initiative in the most partisan case of the term. Not a shock; the bull elk of the Court often bucks the conservative line. More surprisingly, Roberts crossed over in, of all things, a 5-4 campaign-finance case, Williams-Yulee v. Florida State Bar, to block judicial candidate campaign fund solicitation. Most surprisingly of all, though, Clarence Thomas suddenly stepped out. In Zivotofsky v. Kerry, the Jerusalem passport case, he partially joined the four liberals and Kennedy to support the administration. Then, in a kind of unicorn sighting, he provided a fifth \u201cliberal\u201d vote in Walker v. Sons of Confederate Veterans to allow Texas to prohibit Confederate flag license plates. Kennedy then crossed to make five in Obergefell v. Hodges, striking down same-sex marriage bans while Roberts stayed with the conservatives. It\u2019s oh-so-tempting to conclude that the Court moved to the center; but I have my doubts. First is that this year the cases moved to the right. At least four of the big cases\u2014Black Caucus, Arizona Legislature, Texas Department of Housing, and King v. Burwell\u2014represented far-right attempts to use the Court to win long-standing policy goals. Not content with the Court\u2019s steady rightward march, movement conservatives sought to force the pace. As Ian Millhiser recently observed, these losses\u2014particularly in the nakedly partisan ACA case\u2014may betray judicial impatience with outside efforts to politicize the Court. If so, it was a long time coming: Last term the Court showed no such reluctance in Hobby Lobby and Harris v. Quinn, a case on public-employee unions, to march with the armies of the right.\n\nAnd the string of liberal \u201cvictories\u201d represents disasters averted, not new frontiers discovered. The liberal wing might have felt like the cabin boy for the Dread Pirate Roberts, who ended each day with a shout of \u201cGood night, Westley, I\u2019ll most likely kill you in the morning!\u201d Let\u2019s not forget that, in King v. Burwell, old-line Republicans Roberts and Kennedy saved what is, in historical fact, an old-style, market-oriented Republican-style program, hatched by the Heritage Foundation and put into effect first by Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. It is tempting to discuss the Roberts Court as if it were a conscious entity, slowly moderating its view of the world. But it\u2019s not: It is a nine-person committee in which any one member can often change a key result. The transcendence-and-fulfillment Kennedy of Obergefell voted for Confederate flag license plates, judicial campaign-fund solicitation, and lethal injection; the \u201cmoderate\u201d Roberts was aggressively conservative on same-sex marriage and redistricting. Big results in both cases, but no outbreak of centrist unity. But if the Court was not united, it did seem, for most of the term, to be more relaxed. The Justices usually seemed to like each other. Only in the last days of the term, with the results in health-care subsidies, same-sex marriage, redistricting, and lethal injection, did the scorpions begin stinging each other. Among those stings, this term saw a marked decline in the quality of that old press favorite, the vicious Scalia dissent. The vitriol level was the same, but the content was oddly jejune. The King v. Burwell dissent, in my judgment, is the single most persuasive brief anyone involved in the case ever wrote\u2014on behalf of the government. With a straight face, Scalia insisted that the ACA\u2019s required online calculators, outreach efforts, and required reports in federal-exchange states were deliberately designed to calculate $0 in subsidies; remind curious taxpayers that $0 meant $0; and reassure the federal government that $0 had been given. Read that way, the ACA was the statutory equivalent of the White Queen in Through the Looking-Glass, who promised \u201cjam tomorrow and jam yesterday, but never jam today.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The justices this year seemed to be less likely to vote along traditional partisan lines, but bitter battles over philosophical ideals in recent decisions could be a sign of bigger wars to come next fall.", "author": "Garrett Epps", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The justices this year seemed to be less likely to vote along traditional partisan lines, but bitter battles over philosophical ideals in recent decisions could be a sign of bigger wars to come next fall.", "title": "Was the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015 Less Divided or More Divided Than The Year Before?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/06/RTR4H3KI/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/supreme-court-divisions-2015/397403/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "It is tempting to discuss the Roberts Court as if it were a conscious entity, slowly moderating its view of the world.\nAt this time last year, the Supreme Court seemed to me a mirror of America, hopelessly polarized along party lines.\nKennedy then crossed to make five in Obergefell v.
