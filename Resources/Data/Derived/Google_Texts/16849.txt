A private fundraiser on Thursday night for the New Hampshire Republican State Party drew out some big names in state politics to mingle with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and take in some minor-league baseball.

Mr. Christie is considering a 2016 presidential bid, and relationships he builds now in New Hampshire political circles could help him in the state that traditionally holds the nation’s first primary.

Notable names in the VIP box included state party chairwoman Jennifer Horn, Manchester mayor Ted Gatsas, Merrimack County Sheriff Scott Hilliard, national Republican committeeman Steve Duprey, former state executive councilor Raymond Wieczorek, GOP gubernatorial candidate Walt Havenstein and David Wihby, the state director for U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R, NH), according to people who attended.

Several New Hampshire political consultants were in the general admission seats, including strategists Chris Wood and Matt Mayberry, the people said. The game was played in Manchester, where the Reading Fightin Phils defeated the home-team New Hampshire Fisher Cats, 6-5.

They were among roughly 200 people to come out to the Northeast Delta Dental Stadium on Thursday night to see Mr. Christie, the people said. About 25 paid $2,500 to be in a luxury box with Mr. Christie, while the others contributed $45 for general admission, a dinner and the game.

Mr. Christie was in New Hampshire Thursday to campaign for Mr. Havenstein, a former business executive who is running in the Sept. 9 Republican primary. At the event, Mr. Christie’s remarks focused on getting Mr. Havenstein elected for governor and maintaining Republican control of the state senate. He also said he will be in New Hampshire again.

“He made it clear he’d be back up here often,” one of the attendees said.
