Discover below how High Point University is continuing its growth with the Congdon School of Health Sciences and the Fred Wilson School of Pharmacy \u2014 a $120 million investment.\n\nForward.\n\nIt\u2019s the direction in which High Point University sets its sights.\n\nDr. Nido Qubein sees the bright future beyond the mountainous construction on the southern side of campus and $150 million in enhancements underway.\n\nHe saw it more than a decade ago when he arrived. There was deferred maintenance then and facilities in need of new life. He energized campus in a way that not only inspired a physical change, but also a change in the university\u2019s DNA.\n\nA can-do attitude was infused. He calls it the art of the possible.\n\nTen years later, remarkable things have been accomplished. Undergraduate enrollment has tripled. The number of faculty almost tripled. The size of campus has quadrupled. So has the number of employees.\n\nBut it\u2019s just the beginning. At a ground breaking last fall, the next step began with construction of the Congdon School of Health Sciences and the Fred Wilson School of Pharmacy. Hundreds gathered at the memorable event in HPU\u2019s history, including North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory and 20 physician assistant studies students wearing white coats.\n\nMcCrory celebrated the 100 new jobs the schools will create, the 700 new graduate and doctoral level students they will bring to campus and the graduates they will produce to fill needed health care positions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s talent,\u201d McCrory said, motioning to the students. \u201cHigh Point University is building it to make sure our state and our nation are sustainable.\u201d\n\nA Campus of Innovation\n\nFocusing future programs on undergraduate and graduate health care degrees is reflective of something else the governor told the crowd.\n\n\u201cTo compete, you have to anticipate, not react,\u201d McCrory said. \u201cIn business and politics, if you react, you\u2019re late. It\u2019s the same for education. What you\u2019re doing now is responding to our future needs.\u201d\n\nThe growth of High Point University is focused on preparing students for the world as it\u2019s going to be. That\u2019s why university leaders chose to embark on these programs. The landscape of health care is changing. Baby boomers are aging and retiring, yet they desire to stay active. More people than ever before have access to health care through the Affordable Care Act. These programs prepare students to tackle the challenges of a booming health care industry.\n\nThey\u2019ll do it in the 224,000-square-foot complex that will house both academic schools and offer advanced biomedical research facilities, a cadaver lab, standardized client space that records students\u2019 interactions with patients to allow for critiquing, and medical simulation labs.\n\n\u201cI came to High Point University because it has a can-do attitude,\u201d said Dr. Dan Erb, dean of the School of Health Sciences who came to HPU from Duke University. \u201cThe programs that we\u2019re building here are going to change lives.\u201d\n\nThe first class of physician assistant students came to HPU in June 2015. These 20 students, selected out of 800 applicants, were the ones in the white coats at the ground breaking that day. The ones McCrory said will unleash talent needed in the world.\n\n\u201cWe get to leave our finger print on this,\u201d said Jamey Williams, a member of the inaugural class. \u201cI get to be part of the image of this program. In another year, we\u2019ll be practicing. And then for the first time, people will know what an extraordinary High Point University physician assistant can do.\u201d\n\nInvesting in the Vision\n\nEvery aspect of the 10-year transformation \u2014 the increases in enrollment, academic majors, facilities and support staff \u2014 happened in the midst of one the worst economic recessions of this generation. Yet President Qubein and university supporters believed. And because they believed, they invested their time and energy to turn what seemed like the impossible into reality.\n\nThe $120 million total investment for these health sciences and pharmacy programs is the university\u2019s single largest investment in history. It\u2019s able to take that step without debt thanks to philanthropic investors and increased operating revenues.\n\n\u201cOur university is the American dream personified,\u201d Dr. Qubein said. \u201cThis is what happens when you believe in the principles that built this great nation in the first place.\u201d\n\nThose principles resonate with the two families \u2014 Earl and Kitty Congdon, and Fred and Barbara Wilson \u2014 who are helping make this facility possible. Earl Congdon is executive chairman of Old Dominion Freight Line, one of America\u2019s leading transportation logistic companies with 15,000 employees. Fred Wilson is chairman of the board of Piedmont Chemical Industries Inc., including five companies with plants in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nFor many years they\u2019ve been involved at HPU. They serve on the Board of Trustees and have facilities on campus named in honor of their achievements in business, philanthropy and beyond. They\u2019ve recently furthered their generous support of High Point University by each making eight-figure gifts.\n\nAt the official ground breaking ceremony, Dr. Qubein announced that the two academic schools would be named in their honor \u2014 the Congdon School of Health Sciences and the Fred Wilson School of Pharmacy.\n\n\u201cThey make it possible for us to bring these schools to fruition,\u201d he said.\n\nThey become part of a group of multiple families who have given $10 million or more to HPU, and many others who have made major contributions of $1 million or more. A total of $280 million has been raised since 2005 without a formal campaign. After doubling faculty, tripling undergraduate enrollment and quadrupling the size of campus, HPU continues to flourish. In 2015 alone, the university opened Cottrell Hall, a $22 million facility funded by gifts from parents of students, and Centennial Square II, the university\u2019s second town home complex.\n\n\u201cThese individuals who invest in High Point University\u2019s mission create an abundance of opportunity for our students,\u201d Qubein said. \u201cThey have always had faith in our vision. When you have faith and you have courage, anything is possible.\u201d\n\nThe World as It Will Be\n\nHow do we know what the world will be in the future? The answer is simple: we don\u2019t.\n\nBut here\u2019s what we do know: The future will always bring change. It will always offer opportunity. And it will always include challenge.\n\nSo High Point University prepares its students to be nimble, to embrace change and to learn how to anticipate the problems of tomorrow before they start. When they do that, they\u2019re ready.\n\nAnd they will do just that. HPU physician assistant studies will graduate its first class in 2017, while the School of Pharmacy anticipates accepting its first class in fall 2016.\n\nMeanwhile undergraduate students are studying exercise science and master\u2019s students are studying athletic training in the School of Health Sciences, while a doctoral program in physical therapy is slated to begin in 2017 \u2014 the same year the new complex will be completed.\n\nTheir clinical rotations will be completed in close proximity to campus, and they\u2019ll graduate with many job opportunities available throughout the world. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows these fields are expected to grow up to 34 percent by 2024 \u2014 far faster than average.\n\nThe landscape of health care will continue to shift. What the world will be is a question mark. But the ability of High Point University graduates to tackle it is certain.\n\nView this story and more in the Winter 2016 edition of the HPU Magazine:", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,www.highpoint.edu", "author": "High Point University", "og": {"site_name": "High Point University", "description": "This story is\u00a0featured in\u00a0the Winter 2016 edition of the HPU Magazine.
