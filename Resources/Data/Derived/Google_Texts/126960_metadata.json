Murrow Award from the Radio-Television Digital News Association (RTDNA) for hard news reporting. As a regional winner, the report is now in play for national recognition.\n\nIn addition to the Baylor Teen Health Clinic, which works with sexually active teens, Feibel\u2019s local sources included a Greenspoint teen pregnant with her second child and a now 35-year-old mom who wants to mentor at-risk girls \u201cwho remind me of how I was.\u201d\n\nFeibel acknowledges that statistics can be tough to report, especially for a radio audience.\n\n\u201cWhat you want to keep in radio to keep people listening is the voices, so I really tried to keep the two women front and center,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI saw the statistic \u2014 through the CDC study \u2014 I was just surprised because I hadn\u2019t thought about repeat teen births. People talk about teen pregnancy, but I never thought about teens who get pregnant more than once,\u201d she added.\n\nFeibel, who lives in Montrose, was lured from 10 years as a print reporter in 2010, when News 88.7 radio station opened a new beat to cover health and science, a topic she had covered previously for a New Jersey newspaper. Her experience also includes covering city hall for the Houston Chronicle.\n\n\u201cI wanted to cover health again,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the four years since, her reporting depicts a city of \u201cmedical haves and haves-not,\u201d she said.\n\nShe was invited to be part of a collaborative between Houston Public Media affiliate NPR and Kaiser Health News on the Affordable Care Act. Texas is the largest state to not subscribe to the law.\n\n\u201cWhat we decided to do is important for a lot of people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to cover, and it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, too. There\u2019s been misinformation about ACA and a lot of political fighting about it.\u201d\n\nFeibel\u2019s \u201cTeen Pregnancy in Texas\u201d was selected from a competitive field of entries from major market commercial and public radio stations in Texas and Oklahoma, which comprises the RTDNA\u2019s region six.\n\n\u201cI am very proud of this recognition for Carrie Feibel,\u201d said Jack Williams, News 88.7 news director. \u201cCarrie exemplifies Houston Public Media\u2019s mission to consistently deliver quality journalism to our audience.\u201d\n\nThe awards dinner and show for RTDNA honorees and their news organizations will be held in New York City on Oct. 6.\n\nIn addition to News 88.7, the Houston Public Media family includes TV Channel 8 and Classical 91.7 and has a combined weekly audience of more than 1.5 million.
