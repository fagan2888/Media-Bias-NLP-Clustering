Watertown, SD

A Lake Norden man was killed after his motorcycle crashed into a city maintenance truck in Watertown Friday afternoon.

Witnesses said 22-year-old Jeffrey McCrary was attempting to pass slow-moving traffic on his motorcycle heading westbound on US Highway 212 and crashed into the rear end of a city maintenance truck. The truck had been parked to remove landscaping rocks.

The driver of the truck, 46-year-old Darwin Tortenson, was beginning to move out into the road when he saw McCrary's motorcycle approaching. Tortenson tried to speed up to avoid a collision, but was unable to do so. The truck's amber lights were activated at the time of the crash.

McCrary died at a Watertown hospital. Tortenson was not injured.

Law enforcement says speed may have been a factor in the accident. The investigation continues, and charges are pending.
