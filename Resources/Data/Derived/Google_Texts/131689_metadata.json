But such oversights aren\u2019t new \u2014 and the case points to a little-known threat to security and Interpol hopes national authorities will \u201clearn from the tragedy.\u201d\n\nMore than 1 billion times last year, travelers boarded planes without their passports being checked against Interpol\u2019s database of 40 million stolen or lost travel documents, according to the Lyon-based international organization.\n\nInterpol has made warning about the issue for years, and just last month it bemoaned that \u201conly a handful of countries\u201d regularly use its stolen or lost travel documents database of records from 167 countries. For example, the database was searched more than 800 million times last year \u2014 but one in eight searches was conducted by United Arab Emirates alone.\n\nOn Sunday, Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble said in a statement that his organization has long asked why countries would \u201cwait for a tragedy to put prudent security measures in place at borders and boarding gates.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, we have a real case where the world is speculating whether the stolen passport holders were terrorists, while Interpol is asking why only a handful of countries worldwide are taking care to make sure that persons possessing stolen passports are not boarding international flights,\u201d he said.\n\nNoble, who has called passport fraud one of the world\u2019s greatest threats, said he hopes \u201cthat governments and airlines worldwide will learn from the tragedy of missing flight MH 370 and begin to screen all passengers\u2019 passports prior to allowing them to board flights.\u201d\n\nThe declared thefts of the two passports used \u2014 one of Austrian national Christian Kozel in 2012, and one of Luigi Maraldi of Italy last year \u2014 were entered into Interpol\u2019s database after they were stolen in Thailand, the police body said.\n\nInterpol also said it and national investigators were examining other suspicious passports and working to determine the true identities of those who used the stolen passports to board the Malaysia Airlines flight.\n\nIn November, in yet another talk on the subject, Noble said that four of every 10 international passengers are still not screened against the Interpol database, which produced more than 60,000 hits in 2012.\n\nSome countries have taken the threat more seriously than others. In 2006, U.S. authorities scanned the Interpol database about 2,000 times \u2014 but did so 78 million times just three years later.\n\nInterpol, which has 190 member countries, says rising international travel is creating a new market for identity theft, and bogus passports have found a market among many people: Illegal immigrants, terrorists, drug runners \u2014 pretty much anyone looking to travel unnoticed.\n\nSometimes, authorities are outmatched: Ticket-buying regulations and border control techniques vary from country to country, and an Interpol official says there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all explanation why some countries don\u2019t use its database systematically. The U.S, U.K. and the United Arab Emirates are the biggest users, Interpol says.\n\nIn Thailand, where immigration police last year caught a Thai man with 5,000 fake passports, officials say international cooperation helps battle the plague \u2014 but passport forgers are now using advanced technology.\n\n\u201cIt must take great skills and expertise by our officers to detect the fake passports and visa stamps because the system cannot detect them the whole time,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Warawuth Thaweechaikarn, commander of the Immigration Police\u2019s investigative division. Thai authorities also say some new techniques include finding a lookalike to match the passport, or altering the image on the passport to look like the holder.\n\nInterpol is now reaching out to the private sector. It\u2019s preparing an initiative called \u201cI-Checkit\u201d that will let businesspeople in the travel, banking, and hospitality industries screen documents against the lost-documents database when customers book a flight, check into a hotel room or open a financial account. The project is still being worked out, an official said.\n\nWith untold millions of state-issued passports in use worldwide, citizens can help with vigilance.\n\nPolice Lt. Gen. Panya Maman, told reporters that Maraldi, the 37-year-old Italian, had deposited his passport as a guarantee at a motorbike rental shop. But when he returned the bike, the shop said they\u2019d already given his passport to some guy who looked like him. Maraldi then filed a missing passport report to local police in Phuket in July.\n\nSpeaking Sunday in Bangkok, Maraldi said he had no idea who made off with it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Interpol knew about stolen passports that two passengers used to board an ill-fated Malaysia Airlines flight bound for China, but no country checked the police agency's vast database on stolen documents beforehand, it said Sunday.
