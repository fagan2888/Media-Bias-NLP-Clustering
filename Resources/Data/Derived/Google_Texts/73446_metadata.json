Gov. Mike Huckabee has just announced he will be making an appearance, as himself, in the faith-based film.\n\nStarring in the sequel are Melissa Joan Hart (\u201cSabrina: The Teenage Witch\u201d), Jesse Metcalfe (\u201cDallas,\u201d \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d), Fred Thompson (\u201cLaw & Order\u201d), Hayley Orrantia (\u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d), Robin Givens (\u201cHead of the Class\u201d) and \u201cDuck Dynasty\u2019s\u201d Sadie Robertson.\n\nThe original \u2018God\u2019s Not Dead\u2019 struck a nerve with Christian audiences last year, finally offering them an option on marquees usually full of titles glorifying sex, drugs, etc. The second installment, produced by Pure Flix Entertainment, will follow a high school teacher\u2019s battle to keep her job after voicing Christian ideals in her classroom.\n\nThe former governor of Arkansas and current presidential candidate said it was a \u201ctrue honor\u201d to make a cameo in the sequel in a recent statement:\n\n\u201cThe breakout film GOD\u2019S NOT DEAD struck a nerve with America depicting how believers are marginalized in the classroom, and \"God\u2019s Not Dead 2\u201d is virtually ripped from the day\u2019s headlines by showing how people of faith are now being criminalized and taken to the courtroom,\u201d he said. \u201cA few years ago, such a film would be fiction that could someday be true; now, GOD\u2019S NOT DEAD 2 is the story that has become true for believers across the nation. GOD\u2019S NOT DEAD 2 is a wake-up call.\u201d\n\nDefending religious freedom has no expiration date. Huckabee would be the first person to tell you that. This past summer, he was one of two presidential contenders, the other being Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), to stand by Kentucky Clerk Kim Davis\u2019 side when she was jailed for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses. Meanwhile, in an effort to defend the right to life, Christian business owners have sued the Health and Human Services agency for forcing them to provide abortifacients to their employees.\n\nChristians are no doubt glad to see Hollywood is also willing to stand for religious liberty.\n\nLook for Gov. Huckabee and the rest of the cast when \u2018God\u2019s Not Dead 2\u2019 arrives in theaters April 1, 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The battle for religious freedom comes to the big screen..05/27/2016 8:32:15AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The battle for religious freedom comes to the big screen.", "title": "Gov.
