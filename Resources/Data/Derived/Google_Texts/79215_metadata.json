Its front-line workers earn from $19 to $28.50 an hour, with benefits.\n\nUber is estimated to be worth some $40 billion, and has 850 employees. Uber also has over 163,000 drivers (as of December \u2013 the number is expected to double by June), who average $17 an hour in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and $23 an hour in San Francisco and New York.\n\nBut Uber doesn\u2019t count these drivers as employees. Uber says they\u2019re \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d\n\nWhat difference does it make?\n\nFor one thing, GM workers don\u2019t have to pay for the machines they use. But Uber drivers pay for their cars \u2013 not just buying them but also their maintenance, insurance, gas, oil changes, tires, and cleaning. Subtract these costs and Uber drivers\u2019 hourly pay drops considerably.\n\nFor another, GM\u2019s employees get all the nation\u2019s labor protections.\n\nThese include Social Security, a 40-hour workweek with time-and-a-half for overtime, worker health and safety, worker\u2019s compensation if injured on the job, family and medical leave, minimum wage, pension protection, unemployment insurance, protection against racial or gender discrimination, and the right to bargain collectively.\n\nNot to forget Obamacare\u2019s mandate of employer-provided healthcare.\n\nUber workers don\u2019t get any of these things. They\u2019re outside the labor laws.\n\nUber workers aren\u2019t alone. There are millions like just them, also outside the labor laws \u2014 and their ranks are growing. Most aren\u2019t even part of the new Uberized \u201csharing\u201d economy.\n\nThey\u2019re franchisees, consultants, and free lancers.\n\nThey\u2019re also construction workers, restaurant workers, truck drivers, office technicians, even workers in hair salons.\n\nWhat they all have in common is they\u2019re not considered \u201cemployees\u201d of the companies they work for. They\u2019re \u201cindependent contractors\u201d \u2013 which puts all of them outside the labor laws, too.\n\nThe rise of \u201cindependent contractors\u201d Is the most significant legal trend in the American workforce \u2013 contributing directly to low pay, irregular hours, and job insecurity.\n\nWhat makes them \u201cindependent contractors\u201d is the mainly that the companies they work for say they are. So those companies don\u2019t have to pick up the costs of having full-time employees.\n\nBut are they really \u201cindependent\u201d? Companies can manipulate their hours and expenses to make them seem so.\n\nIt\u2019s become a race to the bottom. Once one business cuts costs by making its workers \u201cindependent contractors,\u201d every other business in that industry has to do the same \u2013 or face shrinking profits and a dwindling share of the market", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former secretary of labor on the rise of \"independent contractors\" and the threat they pose to our labor force", "author": "Robert Reich", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former secretary of labor on the rise of \"independent contractors\" and the threat they pose to our labor force", "title": "Robert Reich: America is winning the race to the bottom", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/24/robert_reich_america_is_winning_the_race_to_the_bottom_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former secretary of labor on the rise of \"independent contractors\" and the threat they pose to our labor force", "creator": "@rbreich", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "title": "Robert Reich: America is winning the race to the bottom", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Robert Reich: America is winning the race to the bottom", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, GM, New York, RobertReich.org, San Francisco, uber", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But Uber drivers pay for their cars \u2013 not just buying them but also their maintenance, insurance, gas, oil changes, tires, and cleaning.\nThey\u2019re \u201cindependent contractors\u201d \u2013 which puts all of them outside the labor laws, too.\nOnce one business cuts costs by making its workers \u201cindependent contractors,\u201d every other business in that industry has to do the same \u2013 or face shrinking profits and a dwindling share of the market\nUber workers aren\u2019t alone.\nWhat makes them \u201cindependent contractors\u201d is the mainly that the companies they work for say they are."}
