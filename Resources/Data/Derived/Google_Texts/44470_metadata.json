They took Stanfill\u2019s name off a company website.\n\nBut a tax hike on executives\u2019 carried-interest income passed the House, though it later was defeated.\n\nStanfill died Nov. 7 at home in Denver. He was 79. He was battling cancer.\n\nHe grew up mostly in rural Craig, northwestern Colorado, around movies. His father managed the local theater. He and his brothers helped run the place, sometimes carrying signs promoting the next film. These included the likes of the Lawrence Olivier version of Hamlet.\n\nStanfill also worked in forests fighting wildfires. After the family moved to Texas, he attended Texas Tech University and joined the Air Force, training as a pilot. He graduated from the University of Colorado and went to Chicago. He moved about 1967 to Denver, his base for a career in finance, venture capital and equity lending, most recently as a principle with Montegra Capital Resources.\n\nStanfill chose finance, he recently told a young entrepreneur, so that he could consume arts and give back to the community.\n\n\u201cBill was an extraordinary person \u2014 urbane, loving, intuitive and complicated,\u201d said Susan Barnes-Gelt, his partner for nearly 25 years.\n\nOn Stanfill\u2019s 65th birthday, he took his daughter, Whitney, and sons, Derek and David, to Paris and London. They walked a lot. \u201cHe believed the best way to learn about a city, get a feel for it, was to walk its streets,\u201d Whitney Stanfill said. \u201cHe had humble roots. Growing up, they didn\u2019t have a lot of extra money. He had intelligent parents who instilled great values.\u201d\n\nMountains and movies were lifelong passions.\n\nAnd business trips sometimes became adventures, darting across cities, lacking language skills abroad, seeking odd restaurants, said Jack Tankersley , a business partner for more than a decade in Larimer Venture Management. Stanfill\u2019s fiery testimony in Congress \u201cwas classic Bill,\u201d Tankersley said. \u201cHe felt it was important to do that.\u201d\n\nStanfill served on boards for Colorado Public Radio, the Denver Council on Foreign Relations, Colorado Outward Bound, Denver Health Foundation, Denver Silent Film Festival and Denver University\u2019s Korbel School of International Relations.\n\nHe\u2019s survived by Barnes-Gelt; brothers Stan and Shelton, his children and three granddaughters.\n\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700, bfinley@denverpost.com or @finleybruce", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "William Stanfill, a capitalist with a conscience, dies at 79", "title": "William Stanfill, a capitalist with a conscience, dies at 79", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/22/william-stanfill-a-capitalist-with-a-conscience-dies-at-79/", "image": {"width": 407, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151122__20151123_A4_A4-CD23cd23stanfillpp1.jpg", "height": 423}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151122__20151123_A4_A4-CD23cd23stanfillpp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-22T19:34:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T04:42:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It isn\u2019t fair, he testified, that the bonuses venture capital, private equity and hedge fund managers make are taxed at a preferential rate.\nThey took Stanfill\u2019s name off a company website.\nWhen Denver financier and philanthropist William Stanfill went to Congress a few years ago, he told lawmakers not to give people like him special treatment.\nHe moved about 1967 to Denver, his base for a career in finance, venture capital and equity lending, most recently as a principle with Montegra Capital Resources.\n\u201cHe felt it was important to do that.\u201dStanfill served on boards for Colorado Public Radio, the Denver Council on Foreign Relations, Colorado Outward Bound, Denver Health Foundation, Denver Silent Film Festival and Denver University\u2019s Korbel School of International Relations."}
