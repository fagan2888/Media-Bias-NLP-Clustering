In 1965 -- the first year that smoking prevalence data were collected -- 42.4% of adults in the U.S. smoked cigarettes. Close to one in four U.S. adults still smoked cigarettes in 1997, compared with roughly to one in seven in 2015.\n\nMen continue to smoke at higher rates than women, with 16.7% of U.S. adult men identified as current cigarettes smokers in 2015, compared with 13.6% of U.S. adult women.\n\nOne in four men in the U.S. were identified as former smokers, compared with 18.9% of women, according to early release data from the National Center for Health Statistics' 2015 Health Interview Survey.\n\nAmong other findings in the newly released report:\n\nMore adult women than men in the U.S. have never smoked cigarettes (67.5% compared to 58.3%).\n\nAmong both sexes, adults age 65 and older were less likely to be current cigarette smokers (8.4%) than adults between the ages of 18 and 44 (16.5%) and 45 and 64 (16.9%).\n\nAdult men were more likely than women to smoke cigarettes in all age groups.\n\nThe age-adjusted prevalence of current cigarette smoking by ethnicity was 9.9% for Hispanic adults, 17.4% for non-Hispanic whites, and 16.8% for non-Hispanic black adults.\n\nSmoking declines stalled for several years prior to 2009, when they started to fall again after the federal cigarette tax was increased.\n\nAnti-tobacco advocates credited this move, along with the 2012 launch of the first federally-funded mass media campaign aimed at reducing tobacco use and the 2009 federal law placing restrictions on the marketing and sale of cigarettes for the record low smoking rate recorded in 2015.\n\nIn a written press statement, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids president Matthew L. Myers also praised the Affordable Care Act's mandate requiring tobacco cessation coverage by private insurers and improved coverage of such treatments by Medicaid.\n\n\"To date, 25 states, Washington D.C. and thousands of localities have enacted comprehensive smoke-free laws that apply to all workplaces, including restaurants and bars,\" Myers noted. \"These laws protect nearly 60% of the U.S. population.\"\n\nMyers added that while the continued decline in cigarette smoking is good news, \"the battle is far from over.\" He called on Congress to reject the House Appropriations Committee's recent proposal that would weaken FDA's new oversight over e-cigarettes and cigars.\n\nHe noted that tobacco use remains the nation's leading cause of preventable death, killing nearly half a million Americans.\n\n\"We cannot let up in the fight against tobacco because the tobacco industry never lets up,\" he said. \"The industry spends $9.5 billion a year -- more than $1 million every hour -- to market its deadly and addictive products. Elected officials must be equally aggressive in working to end the tobacco epidemic for good.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Salynn  Boyles", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/Pulmonology/Smoking/58111", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "description": "Just 15.1% of adults smoked cigarettes in 2015", "card": "Summary", "title": "CDC: Smoke Is Clearing in U.S."}, "dc.date.issued": "2016-05-24 17:02:36", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "primarycare,pulmonology,smoking", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-24 17:02:36", "sailthru.title": "CDC: Smoke Is Clearing in U.S.", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "Just 15.1% of adults smoked cigarettes in 2015", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-05-25 17:05:36", "date": "2016-05-24 17:02:36", "sailthru.description": "Just 15.1% of adults smoked cigarettes in 2015", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/Pulmonology/Smoking/58111", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "type": "article", "description": "Just 15.1% of adults smoked cigarettes in 2015", "title": "CDC: Smoke Is Clearing in U.S."}, "sailthru.featured": 0, "dc.date": "2016-05-24 17:02:36", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "primarycare,Other,pulmonarymedicine", "sailthru.image.full": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png"}, "article_summary": "Myers added that while the continued decline in cigarette smoking is good news, \"the battle is far from over.\"\nClose to one in four U.S. adults still smoked cigarettes in 1997, compared with roughly to one in seven in 2015.\nIn 1965 -- the first year that smoking prevalence data were collected -- 42.4% of adults in the U.S. smoked cigarettes.\nMen continue to smoke at higher rates than women, with 16.7% of U.S. adult men identified as current cigarettes smokers in 2015, compared with 13.6% of U.S. adult women.\nThe age-adjusted prevalence of current cigarette smoking by ethnicity was 9.9% for Hispanic adults, 17.4% for non-Hispanic whites, and 16.8% for non-Hispanic black adults."}
