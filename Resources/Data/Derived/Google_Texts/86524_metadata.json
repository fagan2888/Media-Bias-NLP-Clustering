God forbid there is someone who needs a transplant or something like that,\u201d Jason Sandel, the vice-chairman of the New Mexico Medical Insurance Pool told members of the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee Thursday.\n\nEstablished in 1987, the high-risk pool provides access to health insurance for those who have been denied health coverage because they are considered uninsurable. Sandel said about 10,000 New Mexicans are in the pool and of that number, the federal policies of about 1,500 will be terminated at the end of 2013 because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThese are (people needing) kidney transplants, these are hemophiliacs, these are HIV patients,\u201d Sandel said. \u201cIf they lose coverage, their situation is going to turn grave immediately.\u201d\n\nThose 1,500 policyholders must transfer their coverage to the individual policies offered by the ACA.\n\n\u201cThe most immediate focus we have is making sure those folks don\u2019t lose that coverage,\u201d Sandel said.\n\nWith the Dec. 31 deadline coming in little more than seven weeks, Sandel said it\u2019s essential the problems with the healthcare.gov website get fixed.\n\nWhen asked what kind of frame is needed, Sandel told New Mexico Watchdog, with a rueful laugh, \u201cYesterday. The federal site needs to be up and running as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nSandel also serves on the board of the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange, which launched on Oct. 1, the same day as the healthcare.gov site.\n\nThe NMIX website has not reported any appreciable problems, but the state health care exchange can be used only to sign up small businesses and their employees. Individual claims, such as the ones needed to sign up the 1,500 high-risk customers, must go the federal site.\n\nSandel said the NMIX board sent a letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius complaining about the Obamacare rollout and emphasizing how important it is for New Mexico to see technical problems at the federal site get fixed.\n\nIn addition to signing up the high-risk pool participants, Sandel said the website needs to be running smoothly so that the NMIX can reach its goal of signing up at least 84,000 in New Mexico by October 2014.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get people enrolled we are going to fail,\u201d Sandel told the committee.\n\nWith each day the federal website is down, health care professionals and economists say the potential increases for \u201cadverse selection.\u201d\n\nThat is, that older and sicker customers will doggedly return to the site to sign up because, due to their health issues, they have more motivation to get covered. Younger and healthier customers, meanwhile, will be less like to come back to a website that\u2019s experiencing technical issues and won\u2019t sign up at all.\n\nIf young and healthy people don\u2019t enroll, the ACA won\u2019t work economically.\n\n\u201cThere are significant claim dollars (in the high-risk pool) that need to be offset with good dollars coming into the system,\u201d Sandel said.\n\nAs for the 1,500 who must switch by the end of this year, Sandel said they won\u2019t be left out in the cold.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019ve got critically ill people who need to maintain health insurance coverage and there\u2019s a commitment to the pool to make sure that happens,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the bills still have to be paid and that could mean taxpayers picking up the tab if the problem isn\u2019t fixed by Jan. 31.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly correct,\u201d Sandel said. \u201cSo those are some of the discussions that we\u2019re having.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s NM Watchdog video of our interview with Sandel:\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Another Obamacare headache: 1,500 in NM have to move out of the state's high-risk insurance pool by the end of the year.
