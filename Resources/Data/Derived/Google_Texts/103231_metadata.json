So, if we turn around before dropping 10 percent or more, we have a chance of being positive for this year, but because we've gone 47 months without a decline of 10 percent or more versus the average of 18 months since World War II, I think there's a good likelihood this becomes a correction, and if that's the case it ends up taking four months to get back to break even,\" he said.\n\nStovall said the market could see a near term pop after last week's big drop, and he does not see a bear market coming. The S&P 500 Friday was down 64 points at 1970.\n\n\"As a result of last week's near 6 percent drop, history says we should expect a pop next week. During this bull market, whenever the S&P 500 fell by 4 percent or more, the market gained an average 2.3 percent in the following week, and registered a price advance 80 percent of the time. What's more, since 1945, the 500 gained an average 1.6 percent in the week after a 4 percent plus decline and rose 66 percent of the time,\" Stovall noted.\n\n\n\nU.S. equities were slammed hard Friday, after weakness in world markets, particularly in the emerging market currencies. China's weak manufacturing data Friday added to the selling spiral, and Shanghai stocks were down more than 4 percent. Commodities were also slammed as the oil complex was sharply lower, with West Texas Intermediate crude futures falling through $40 per barrel. The Dow ended Friday down 530 points at 16,459.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "Standard and Poor's/Capital IQ's Sam Stovall says the market could be heading for a true correction, and maybe the first negative year since 2011.", "author": "Patti Domm", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Standard and Poor's/Capital IQ's Sam Stovall says the market could be heading for a true correction, and maybe the first negative year since 2011.", "title": "S&P strategist: Possible negative year for stocks", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/23/sp-strategist-says-possible-negative-year-for-stocks.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/08/21/102938139-GettyImages-484635956.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Standard and Poor's/Capital IQ's Sam Stovall says the market could be heading for a true correction, and maybe the first negative year since 2011.", "title": "S&P's Stovall says possible negative year for stocks", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/23/sp-strategist-says-possible-negative-year-for-stocks.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/08/21/102938139-GettyImages-484635956.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@pattidomm", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Market Insider, Market Insider, Investment Strategy, Market Outlook, S&P 500 INDEX, Dow Industrials, NASDAQ, Shanghai, WTI Crude Oil (Jul'16), business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-08-23T19:36:49-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Market Insider", "modified_time": "2015-08-23T19:37:22-0400", "tag": "WTI Crude Oil (Jul'16)"}, "pageNodeId": 102941062, "news_keywords": "markets outlook, S&P 500, negative year, correction"}, "article_summary": "The S&P 500 Friday was down 64 points at 1970.\nChina's weak manufacturing data Friday added to the selling spiral, and Shanghai stocks were down more than 4 percent.\n\"A five to 10 percent decline takes one month to materialize on average and two months to get back to break even.\n\"As a result of last week's near 6 percent drop, history says we should expect a pop next week.\nU.S. equities were slammed hard Friday, after weakness in world markets, particularly in the emerging market currencies."}
