As a result, Elizabeth Fechtel, who won the crown last Saturday, is now the runner up. The woman who had come in second - Victoria Cowen - is now the new Miss Florida.\n\nExecutive Director Mary Sullivan says the tabulation error was noticed during a routine recount. She says a mark on one judge's ballot was inadvertently overlooked. The ballots were retabulated by an independent auditor, and the contestants were notified of the correct results.\n\nThe change comes after the Miss Delaware winner was disqualified because she was too old.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.
