The head of the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday that sanctions imposed on Russia from the European Union and the U.S. have had a clear effect on the country.

IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde spoke to Judy Woodruff about the diplomatic crisis following Russia’s annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea and how subsequent sanctions have affected the Russian economy.

“There has clearly been consequences from the talk of sanctions and from the sanctions themselves,” she said.
