In June, nine more were indicted on a range of charges related to the death of a 72-year-old woman, Aurelia Rios. Medford nonetheless holds a three-star, or average, rating from Medicare and a four-star rating for its health inspection, and state health workers reported no deficiencies during the home\u2019s most recent health inspection last August.\n\nA provision of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires Medicare to use payroll data to verify the accuracy of staff levels, but the agency has not begun to follow the requirement. The agency said it was still working on the verification system and hoped to have it running soon.\n\nThe other major part of the ratings that is not checked by Medicare, the so-called quality measures, is also susceptible to manipulation. The score in this area is based on data collected by the home about every patient, such as whether bedridden or wheelchair patients are developing bedsores and how many residents experience serious falls.\n\nNursing homes receive an extra star on their overall rating if they get five stars in this area. The number of nursing homes with five stars in quality measures has increased significantly since the beginning of the program, to 29 percent in 2013 from 11 percent in 2009.\n\n\u201cThey need to spot-audit those, but they haven\u2019t done it,\u201d said Charlene Harrington, a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Nursing, who is an expert on nursing home staffing.\n\nFederal officials acknowledged that the quality measures rating needed improvement and said they were testing an auditing program that they hoped to expand nationally. The agency also plans to consider additional metrics, such as the number of residents being given antipsychotic drugs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. David Gifford, senior vice president of quality and regulatory affairs at the American Health Care Association, the nursing home trade group, says the ratings have had a positive effect on the industry. \u201cI think it\u2019s helped move us all along in the right direction,\u201d he said, adding that any suggestion that facilities were manipulating their ratings was far-fetched. \u201cI have not seen any evidence of that or heard any evidence of it,\u201d he said.\n\nA Five-Star Pursuit\n\nFew have pursued top ratings with more zeal than North American Health Care, which operates Rosewood and 34 other nursing homes scattered across California and three other Western states. Each of the chain\u2019s nursing homes has a five-star rating, and the company maintains a team of more than 30 nurses who conduct mock inspections to ensure the homes perform well. In recent years, the chain has awarded $50,000 bonuses to nursing home administrators who achieve or maintain a five-star rating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s everything to us,\u201d Mr. Sorensen, the chief executive of North American, said. \u201cIf you create a product that people can trust and admire, the profits that you hope for \u2014 they follow as a result of excellence.\u201d\n\nDespite the chain\u2019s exemplary performance in the Medicare ratings, Rosewood is not the only one of its homes to have had problems that are not reflected in the score. State inspectors concluded that staff at another home, Chatsworth Park Health Care Center in Los Angeles, neglected in 2010 and 2011 to properly care for a man with Parkinson\u2019s disease who developed malnutrition and extensive bedsores, which typically occur because of substandard care, and later died.\n\nAt another of the chain\u2019s nursing homes, the Grand Terrace Care Center near San Bernardino, Calif., the staff failed in 2010 to properly care for a woman with diabetes and other conditions. The coroner ruled that her death was due in part to a urinary tract infection and bedsores that had become so bad, they had developed gangrene and were infested with maggots, according to a state report about the case.\n\nIn 2010, when both episodes took place, Chatsworth carried an overall rating of three stars, and Grand Terrace was rated four stars. Both now hold five-star ratings.\n\nMr. Sorensen said his staff disputed the facts in these cases, and he maintained that the residents received good care.\n\nNeither case shows up on the Medicare website. Until recently, California often refused to cite nursing homes for federal-level violations, the only type that counts toward a star rating. State workers are responsible for enforcing both state and federal laws governing nursing homes. A spokesman for the California Department of Public Health said the state was now doing so.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Conway, of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said his agency worked hard to make sure states were enforcing federal law but acknowledged that there had been problems. \u201cWe are aware of some issues with states,\u201d he said, adding that the federal website warned consumers that state actions were not listed there. Still, he said, \u201cthe goal would be not to have that gap.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth American is also under investigation by the office of the inspector general for the federal Health and Human Services Department. Mr. Sorensen declined to say what the investigation entailed, and a spokesman for the inspector general\u2019s office would not comment. It is not publicly known whether the investigation relates to care.\n\nEd Dudensing, a Sacramento lawyer who has represented several clients against the chain\u2019s homes, including Rosewood, said he had deposed more than 30 current and former employees of North American Health Care in recent years. Based on those interviews, he said, \u201cI strongly disagree with the suggestion that its nursing homes are five-star quality.\u201d\n\nMr. Sorensen said the lawsuits against Rosewood were without merit. \u201cWe\u2019re in this business because we want to do the right thing for our patients,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is our agenda.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, nearly all of North American Health Care\u2019s nursing homes held four- or five-star ratings for staff levels, an outcome that Mr. Sorensen attributed to the company\u2019s investment in quality workers.\n\nNevertheless, an analysis by The Times of 2012 staffing data reported by North American\u2019s nursing homes in California shows that the company consistently reported higher levels of staffing to Medicare than it reported to Medi-Cal, California\u2019s health care program for the poor, which audits the data.\n\nThe chain\u2019s 29 homes in California reported staff levels to the federal government that were on average 23 percent higher than what they reported to the state in 2012, the most recent year for which state data were available. Statewide, California nursing homes reported levels to Medicare that were 15 percent higher than what they reported to Medi-Cal.\n\nMr. Sorensen said the state and federal staff data could not be compared because some employees, like the director of nursing and other supervisory positions, were not counted by the state but were counted at the federal level. He said the disparity could also be a result of different reporting periods and month-to-month variations in staff and patient levels.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA spokesman for the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development said that supervisory positions like the director of nursing were included in state staff data and that the main reason for the disparity was probably that the federal data accounted only for the two weeks preceding the annual survey, while the state data reflected the whole year.\n\nMs. Harrington, who sits on the technical advisory board for Medicare\u2019s rating system and has served as an expert witness on behalf of plaintiffs suing nursing homes, said the disparity showed that the chain\u2019s homes were probably adding people before the annual inspection. \u201cThey\u2019re inflating their staffing,\u201d she said.\n\nEven as North American\u2019s nursing homes were reporting high levels of staffing to Medicare, executives were focusing on keeping labor costs low, according to interviews with former employees and records made available in connection with lawsuits.\n\nIn 2011, for example, the nursing home administrator at Rosewood eliminated six full-time jobs and cut back on staff hours just days after the annual inspection was completed, according to emails the chain provided to plaintiff lawyers in a pending lawsuit against Rosewood. Ms. Harrington described such cuts as \u201csubstantial.\u201d The home received a four-star rating in staffing that year.\n\nKyle Dahl, Rosewood\u2019s administrator at the time, said in an interview that the staff reductions had been made to prepare for expected cuts to Medicare and Medi-Cal. But he acknowledged that consultant nurses were often brought in before the annual inspection to prepare the home. Their presence also had the effect of keeping staff levels higher than usual. Mr. Dahl likened the annual inspection to a visit from one\u2019s mother-in-law. \u201cYou might throw an extra vacuum over the carpet to make sure everything looks good,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople could potentially staff up during that time period.\u201d\n\nFor some families, however, all that effort did not translate to high-quality care, and they said they wished they had better options. Elizabeth Chandler and her husband, Ken, placed his mother in Rosewood in 2011 to recover from a broken femur. Ms. Chandler said she had been impressed that Rosewood had a top rating, \u201clike a hotel.\u201d\n\nMr. Chandler\u2019s mother died after experiencing serious falls at the home, and the family is suing Rosewood. Ms. Chandler said she felt misled by the rating system.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know where to look to get accurate information,\u201d she said. \u201cI can go and find a preschool for my child better than I can find a skilled nursing facility for my loved one.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140824220412, "twitter": {"description": "Medicare\u2019s five-year-old rating
