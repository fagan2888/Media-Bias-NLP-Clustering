Craig Labadie, who was appointed by the city last year to determine the adequacy of the relocation assistance package assembled by Jisser, only approved a rent subsidy for a one-bedroom apartment.\n\nIn a letter Thursday to City Attorney Molly Stump, Jisser's lawyer Margaret Ecker Nanda accused the council of \"inappropriately intruding upon the field of appraising\" and even suggested it could be penalized as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The City Council has no authority to engage in the act of appraising by amending an appraiser's scope of work -- particularly with the unabashed intention of affecting the valuation outcome of the appraisals,\" said Nanda, adding that the council similarly had no legal grounds to increase the rent subsidy.\n\nNanda also pointed out that an ordinance governing Buena Vista's closure did not explicitly include safety and schools as factors to be considered in an appraisal, but she noted that Beccaria and Webster Inc. considered them when determining the fair market values of the homes at the park.\n\nThat appraisal, conducted in April 2013, pegged the average value of the homes at about $18,816.\n\nDavid Beccaria, meanwhile, is refusing to conduct the appraisal ordered by the council and intends to quit if it doesn't back off.\n\n\"I believe at this point I have more than satisfied the requirements of an appraiser in responding to inquiries about our appraisal reports,\" Beccaria wrote in a May 5 letter to Mayor Karen Holman.\n\n\"The appraisal process cannot be caught up into the political controversy that exists in this community regarding this mobile home park. We must maintain our independence and impartiality. I am not an advocate for any party. I only advocate for the opinions of value stated in the reports.\"\n\nBeccaria's appraisal has come under fire from lawyers for the residents association, who claim that it used flawed methodology and failed to take into account the value of the park's location in Palo Alto.\n\n\"That's not going to allow a resident to purchase really anything in the Bay Area or to even move long term to an apartment in the Bay Area,\" Nadia Aziz, an attorney for the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley, said about the average value in a recent interview. \"If they want to purchase a mobile home, they're going to have to move to the Central Valley and beyond.\"\n\nIn light of Beccaria's refusal to do another appraisal, lawyers for the residents association have called on the city to appoint someone who will.\n\nHome to about 400 mostly low-income Latino residents, Buena Vista is the city's single-largest source of affordable housing.\n\nThe relocation assistance package approved by Labadie would see the owner pay residents an amount equal to 100 percent of the on-site fair market value of each mobile home, a lump sum equal to 100 percent of the differential between average rents for apartments in cities surrounding Palo Alto and the average space rents at Buena Vista for a period of 12 months, and the \"actual, reasonable\" moving costs for relocating all personal property.\n\nDisabled or handicapped residents would also receive help with packing or replacing special equipment.\n\n\"The park owner seeks what it has always sought in this process,\" Nanda wrote in her letter to Stump, \"that the findings of the hearing officer Craig Labadie be upheld on appeal without the imposition of legally unsupportable 'additional considerations' by the City Council.\"\n\nEmail Jason Green at jgreen@dailynewsgroup.com;
