After participants went around the room, Berry said, workers checked to see if the people had recorded enough visits to qualify for a free lunch.\n\nBerry recalled the look of panic among some attendees when workers asked to see their \u201cgreen card\u201d \u2013 which is also the common form of identification the government issues to immigrants when they become permanent residents, signifying they\u2019re not in the country illegally.\n\n\u201cWe did not know nor did we want to know who was documented. We were just trying to provide information about health resources,\u201d Berry said in an email, amplifying an anecdote she shared at a forum in Kansas City, Mo., on Thursday. \u201cThe green card comment was misinterpreted. Lesson learned.\u201d\n\nBerry was one of about 50 attendees at a day-long forum at the Kauffman Foundation Conference Center, where health care outreach workers shared best practices developed during the initial roll-out of the health insurance marketplace.\n\nThat enrollment period stretched from October 2013 through March, and as of mid-August, according to federal data, the exchange had 7.3 million paying customers.\n\nThe forum \u2013 hosted by the Missouri Foundation for Health\u2019s Cover Missouri Coalition \u2013 came as the second enrollment period is set to begin Nov. 15 and run through mid-February. Audience members consisted of enrollment specialists known as \u201cnavigators\u201d and \u201ccertified application counselors.\u201d\n\nOne major takeaway from the first sign-up period is to have a presence at as many events as possible, said Dara Taylor of the St. Louis office of Community Catalyst, a national consumer health advocacy organization. Taylor led a session on promising outreach and enrollment strategies.\n\nTaylor said she has even heard of successful efforts at gun shows and encouraged attendees to be creative \u2013 by gaining entry to cattle sales in rural areas, for example.\n\nShe also encouraged discussions within organizations to find out what events are attended by co-workers.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t realize all the events that happen within their community,\u201d she said.\n\nOther efforts she mentioned:\n\n\u00b7 Super Saturday events in collaboration with tax preparers at libraries, enabling consumers to learn about the marketplace while getting tax-filing assistance\n\n\u00b7 Phone banks in partnership with local TV stations\n\n\u00b7 Participation at parent teacher nights\n\n\u00b7 Distribution of fliers with information about the marketplace in grocery store bags\n\nOther successful strategies mentioned by attendees included convincing taxi drivers to carry informational literature in their cars and flashing enrollment messages on public busses.\n\nIt works better to have a spot at an event like an art fair or cultural festival than trying to get people to attend a health fair, said Karimah Baptiste, outreach and enrollment program manager at Swope Health Services.\n\nBerry suggested another approach.\n\nTo overcome distrust of the Affordable Care Act in rural areas, she said, her office enlisted the assistance of local insurance agents because they were known in the community.\n\n\u201cThis is somebody who is at the football games on Friday nights,\u201d Berry said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Meridith Berry and her team learned a valuable lesson at an event where they were encouraging Hispanics to purchase coverage through the health insurance", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/navigators-share-strategies-obamacare-enrollment", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/styles/medium/public/201410/navigator_101014_0.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Meridith Berry and her team learned a valuable lesson at an event where they were encouraging Hispanics to purchase coverage through the health insurance", "title": "Navigators Share Strategies For Obamacare Enrollment"}, "story_id": 355199378, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@mikesherrykcpt"}, "author": "Mike Sherry", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Navigators Share Strategies For Obamacare Enrollment"}, "nid": 63155, "datePublished": "2014-10-10", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, health insurance exchange, Heartland Health Monitor", "wordCount": 645, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "That enrollment period stretched from October 2013 through March, and as of mid-August, according to federal data, the exchange had 7.3 million paying customers.\nThe forum \u2013 hosted by the Missouri Foundation for Health\u2019s Cover Missouri Coalition \u2013 came as the second enrollment period is set to begin Nov. 15 and run through mid-February.\nTaylor led a session on promising outreach and enrollment strategies.\nAfter participants went around the room, Berry said, workers checked to see if the people had recorded enough visits to qualify for a free lunch.\nWe were just trying to provide information about health resources,\u201d Berry said in an email, amplifying an anecdote she shared at a forum in Kansas City, Mo., on Thursday."}
