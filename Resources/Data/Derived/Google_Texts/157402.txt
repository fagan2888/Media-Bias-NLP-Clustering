Texas Senator and current Iowa contender Ted Cruz has a penchant for quoting his favorite film, 1987’s “The Princess Bride,” but apparently the man whose lines he quotes most often isn’t entirely happy about having his work associated with a Republican campaign.

“They Photoshopped his face right over my face!” Mandy Patinkin, who played “Inigo Montoya” in the film, told the New York Times’ Jason Horowitz. “I said, ‘How can I stop this?’”

“I would like to be with Senator Cruz for a moment and I would like to respectfully ask him, since he quotes all the lines from ‘The Princess Bride’ and certainly all of my character, Inigo Montoya’s, lines, I would like to know why he doesn’t quote my favorite line?”

“Senator Cruz,” Patinkin said, “if you’re going to say those lines, you’ve got to say the other line, too.” That “other line” occurs after Montoya has fulfilled his self-imposed destiny to exact revenge on the six-fingered man who killed his father. “I have been in the revenge business so long,” Montyoa said, “now that it’s over, I don’t know what to do with the rest of my life.”
