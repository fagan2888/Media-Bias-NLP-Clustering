You\u2019re there because of your health insurance,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou would rather have the opportunity to spend the next couple of years with your child until they get \u2014 if that was your choice \u2014 until they get into primary school.\u201d\n\nBiden said because of Obamacare that women will now be able to make an \u201cindependent choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re now trapped in that job because if you leave, you lose your health insurance. Now you\u2019ll be able to \u2026 make an independent choice,\u201d Biden told \u201cThe View.\u201d \u201cDo you want to stay in that job and still have health insurance, or do you want to \u2026 stay in that job, even though you can get health insurance absent that job? And it gives women a great deal more freedom.\u201d\n\nBiden added: \u201cIt\u2019s the peace of mind this gives to people.\u201d\n\nObama said Tuesday that about 4 million people have signed up for health insurance through federal or state marketplaces set up under his health care law.\n\nThe White House has set an unofficial goal of 7 million enrollees by the end of March.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
