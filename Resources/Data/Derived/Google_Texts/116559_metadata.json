I finally agreed, then half-jokingly asked whether I would receive hazardous duty pay.\n\nIn fact, I wasn\u2019t sure what the point of writing the piece was, since I was certain that it would just be the same tired, debunked lies that FOX News and the GOP have been subjecting the country to for the past several years.\n\nYou know the score: \u201cJob Killer!\u201d \u2026 \u201cGazillions of Policies Cancelled!\u201d \u2026 \u201cDeath Spiral!\u201d \u2026 \u201c$700B Stolen from Medicare!\u201d and so forth \u2013 all of which have been proven flat-out wrong or absurdly exaggerated. Hell, I figured I could write most of this column before the debate even took place.\n\nNear silence on Obamacare\n\nInstead, something very different happened: Near silence on the ACA (in the midst a whole lot of screaming and insults on every other topic). Obamacare was virtually absent from both debates.\n\nOh, don\u2019t get me wrong; between the two debates (the \u201cKiddie Table at 5 p.m. and then the \u201cMain Event\u201d at 9:00) there were a couple of ACA mentions here and there:\n\nIn \u201cRound 1,\u201d Lindsey Graham, Jim Gilmore, George Pataki and Rick Santorum claimed that Obamacare should be repealed in order to \u201chelp grow the economy and create jobs\u201d \u2026 which is a pretty silly thing to say considering that in the five years since the ACA was passed, over 12.6 million jobs have been created nationally, the unemployment rate has dropped from 9.9% to 5.3%, the budget deficit has been cut from 9.8% of GDP to 2.8% and the projected lifespan of Medicare has been extended by 17 years (not to mention the uninsured rate plummeting from 18% to 11.4% over just the past 2 years).\n\nBobby Jindal actually bragged about denying Medicaid expansion to 166,000 of his own constituents, and flat-out lied about the expansion program by falsely claiming that federal funding would \u201cgo away in a few years.\u201d That\u2019s nonsense; the feds cover 100 percent of Medicaid expansion through next year and after that it drops down gradually \u2013 to 90 percent of the cost. The states never have to pony up more than 10 percent of the total, which is still a far lower portion than they have to cover for traditional Medicaid.\n\nIn \u201cRound 2,\u201d John Kasich gave a refreshingly passionate defense of his decision to expand Medicaid under the ACA.\n\nAnd yes, Mike Huckabee did indeed whip out the incredibly tortured \u201c$700 billion cut from Medicare\u201d claim.\n\nHowever, during the Big Event, the prime-time, nationally broadcast, massively hyped-up FOX News debate, aside from Kasich\u2019s Medicaid question, Obamacare only came up one other time \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t even really about the ACA:\n\nIn a question to Donald Trump, \u201cThe Donald\u201d was reminded that he used to support single-payer healthcare, but now says Obamacare should be repealed/replaced. So the question was really about him being a flip-flopper \u2013 not about the ACA itself.\n\n3 minutes of air time\n\nIn short, from what I can gather, the Affordable Care Act \u2026\n\n\u2026 the law which has consumed 99 percent of the Republican Party\u2019s attention for the past 6 years or so \u2026\n\n\u2026 the law which has survived over 50 repeal attempts \u2026\n\n\u2026 the law which recovered from an unprecedented epic technical meltdown \u2026\n\n\u2026 the law which survived a federal government shutdown designed specifically to destroy it \u2026\n\n\u2026 the law which survived hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Koch Brothers attack ads \u2026\n\n\u2026 the law which survived two major Supreme Court decisions \u2026\n\n\u2026 proved to be worth perhaps three minutes of total airtime and discussion out of nearly four hours of Republican Party Presidential debate.\n\nBecause FOX News \u2013 FOX NEWS \u2013 had consciously decided that Obamacare is no longer a top issue to spend time screaming about.\n\nFive years ago right after the ACA was signed into law, David Frum, a neoconservative former speechwriter for George W. Bush, wrote an (in)famous essay called simply \u201cWaterloo\u201d in which he stated:\n\n\u2026 Legislative majorities come and go. This healthcare bill is forever. A win in November is very poor compensation for this debacle now.\n\nNo illusions please: This bill will not be repealed. Even if Republicans scored a 1994 style landslide in November, how many votes could we muster \u2026 to re-allow insurers to rescind policies when they discover a pre-existing condition \u2026 to banish 25 year olds from their parents\u2019 insurance coverage? And even if the votes were there \u2013 would President Obama sign such a repeal?\n\n\u2026 So today\u2019s defeat for free-market economics and Republican values is a huge win for the conservative entertainment industry. Their listeners and viewers will now be even more enraged, even more frustrated, even more disappointed in everybody except the responsibility-free talkers on television and radio. For them, it\u2019s mission accomplished. For the cause they purport to represent, it\u2019s Waterloo all right: ours.\n\nKing vs. Burwell was the Republican Party\u2019s \u201cHail Mary\u201d play. A few days after the Supreme Court decision came down back in June, I said:\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m actually not particularly concerned about [the ACA being repealed] \u2026 I\u2019m among those who believe that at this point, even if the GOP manages to sweep the House, Senate and White House next year, they still won\u2019t actually make good on a full repeal of the ACA \u201croot and branch\u201d as Mitch McConnell keeps vowing \u2026 I truly think that it\u2019s already too firmly entrenched in the American economy and healthcare system in too many areas to be destroyed.\n\nObamacare Hatefest still to come?\n\nI could be wrong, of course. Perhaps FOX will indeed devote 30 minutes to an Obamacare Hatefest in one of their future debates. But the fact that they barely mentioned it at all tonight was far more significant than any questions they might have brought up about it.\n\nTed Cruz and some other GOP politicians may still be clamouring to \u201cmake 2016 a referendum on repealing Obamacare,\u201d but unless I\u2019m mistaken, FOX News has finally accepted reality: The Affordable Care Act is here to stay.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The fact that FOX barely mentioned [Obamacare] at all tonight was far more significant than any questions they might have brought up about it.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Health Insurance Resource Center", "description": "\"The fact that FOX barely mentioned [Obamacare] at all tonight was far more significant than any questions they might have brought up about it.\"", "title": "Has FOX News surrendered on Obamacare?", "url": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2015/08/07/has-fox-news-surrendered-on-obamacare/", "image": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/assets/2015/08/republican-debater-2015.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1007310172}, "keywords": "health care debate, Medicaid, Presidential debates", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-07T07:04:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff7b\"", "article_summary": "Because FOX News \u2013 FOX NEWS \u2013 had consciously decided that Obamacare is no longer a top issue to spend time screaming about.\nPerhaps FOX will indeed devote 30 minutes to an Obamacare Hatefest in one of their future debates.\nTed Cruz and some other GOP politicians may still be clamouring to \u201cmake 2016 a referendum on repealing Obamacare,\u201d but unless I\u2019m mistaken, FOX News has finally accepted reality: The Affordable Care Act is here to stay.\nIn \u201cRound 2,\u201d John Kasich gave a refreshingly passionate defense of his decision to expand Medicaid under the ACA.\nObamacare was virtually absent from both debates."}
