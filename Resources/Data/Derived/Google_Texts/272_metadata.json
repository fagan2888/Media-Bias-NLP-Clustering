Planned Parenthood is squarely behind the federally funded sex education in Hawaii schools. The Hawaii Youth Services Network and the University of Hawaii received almost two million dollars from the federal government\u2019s PREP funding\u2014which is part of Obamacare\u2014to develop, replicate, and implement \u201ccomprehensive sex education\u201d in Hawaii schools. Planned Parenthood of Hawaii is a partner with both entities in the grants.\n\nHawaii Youth Services Network has worked closely with Planned Parenthood in pushing Planned Parenthood\u2019s perverse, morally bereft sex education. Planned Parenthood thanked HYSN for partnering with it in 2012 to produce a sex ed teacher training workshop for middle school and high school known as the Positive Images workshop.\n\nThe workshop was billed as essential for \u201cmiddle and high school teachers, community health educators, youth-serving professionals, and staff involved with teen pregnancy, STI, and HIV prevention programs.\u201d The \u201ctrainers\u201d were none other than Planned Parenthood of Hawaii\u2019s Sonia Blackiston and Kathleen Stofocik. \u201cBoth trainers have led numerous sexual health workshops across Hawaii, including Sex Ed 101 for Educators, Contraception and STI 101, I\u2019m Askable, Avoiding the Wide Eyes and Giggles , and HOPE (Helping Our Parents Educate),\u201d according to the workshop promo.\n\nThe University of Hawaii is also a friend of Planned Parenthood and abortion. A February 2012 Life News story says that the university was then deciding \u201cwhether to provide funding for the Planned Parenthood abortion business to start doing abortions at Kauai inside the Mahelona Memorial Hospital in Kapa\u2019a.\u201d\n\nClearly, Planned Parenthood is squarely behind the sex education grant money and likely had a great deal of input into writing the law requiring comprehensive sex education in schools that receive funding specifically earmarked for sex education. That law passed the legislature in 2009, supplanted the 1995 abstinence supporting law, and opened the doors for the current PREP grants.\n\nYou can find policies on sex education for Hawaii and other states here: http://answer.rutgers.edu/page/state_policy.\n\nNote that the law does not require Planned Parenthood style sex education in Hawaii public schools. Period. It requires that any school that receives state funding specifically for sex education provide medically accurate, factual, and comprehensive information that is age appropriate and includes education on abstinence and contraception.\n\nThis law supplants the 1995 abstinence law that was previously in effect. The new law follows Planned Parenthood\u2019s agenda so closely that it looks as though it was penned by Planned Parenthood.\n\nHave no doubt: Planned Parenthood will claim that it is the law that children in Hawaii must be subjected to its comprehensive sexuality education, and will use that claim to try to blackmail schools and parents into accepting its perverse sex education. This applies in other states as well. Planned Parenthood is misrepresenting the law when it makes such claims.\n\nIt is time for parents in Hawaii and all across the United States to do their homework.
