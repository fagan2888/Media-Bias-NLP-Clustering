As previously reported, the ACA requires that certain restaurants with \"50 or more full-time equivalent employees\" provide health care coverage to the workers and dependents. Currently those who work at least 30 hours per week are considered full-time, but lobbyists wanted to changed the requirement to 40 hours per week.\n\nAccording to the Huffington Post, the House Republicans agreed and passed the bill 252 to 172. Twelve Democrats also voted in favor of the bill. House Republicans say that the bill \"protects the 40-hour workweek,\" while restaurant lobbyists claim \"the 30-hour definition under the current healthcare law forces employers to restructure our workforce and unwantedly reduce employee hours.\"\n\nHowever, Congress' own budget analyst says the bill \"damages\" the 40-hour workweek and will create more part-time employees as a result.\" Representative Jared Polis argued during a debate on the House floor: \"If this very dangerous provision were to become law, many, many Americans would find themselves cut from 40 to 39 hours, 39 and a half hours...Go home at 4:30 on Friday. Sorry, no health care.\"\n\nThere is a chance that the bill will not become a law, however. President Obama has promised to veto it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of employees may no longer qualify for benefits.", "author": "Khushbu Shah", "og": {"site_name": "Eater", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of employees may no longer qualify for benefits.", "title": "Obamacare Coverage for Restaurant Workers at Risk After House Vote", "url": "http://www.eater.com/2015/1/9/7520909/obamacare-restaurant-workers-house-congress", "image": "https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQNiWhCFyA7i-9_1zs2bo4oz-1o=/0x2:1000x565/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/45186482/health-insurance-obama-care-restaurant-employees.0.0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hundreds of thousands of employees may no longer qualify for benefits.", "title": "Obamacare Coverage for Restaurant Workers at Risk After House Vote", "url": "http://www.eater.com/2015/1/9/7520909/obamacare-restaurant-workers-house-congress", "image": {"src": "https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQNiWhCFyA7i-9_1zs2bo4oz-1o=/0x2:1000x565/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/45186482/health-insurance-obama-care-restaurant-employees.0.0.jpg"}, "site": "Eater", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-09", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare Coverage for Restaurant Workers at Risk After House Vote", "fb": {"app_id": 143972162345360}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "google-site-verification": "ZvsTR4mG6LQds-1bOnir71ybGjhQyVKPLMJNLcoZu08", "sailthru.tags": "general,eater", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/eater", "published_time": "2015-01-09T17:41:32Z"}, "sailthru.description": "Hundreds of thousands of employees may no longer qualify for benefits.", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaef6\"", "article_summary": "The House of Representatives passed a bill yesterday that changes the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) definition of what counts as a full-time work week.\nAccording to the Huffington Post, the House Republicans agreed and passed the bill 252 to 172.\nAs previously reported, the ACA requires that certain restaurants with \"50 or more full-time equivalent employees\" provide health care coverage to the workers and dependents.\nCurrently those who work at least 30 hours per week are considered full-time, but lobbyists wanted to changed the requirement to 40 hours per week.\nHouse Republicans say that the bill \"protects the 40-hour workweek,\" while restaurant lobbyists claim \"the 30-hour definition under the current healthcare law forces employers to restructure our workforce and unwantedly reduce employee hours.\""}
