He then skated over to the corner and was mobbed by his teammates as the season-high crowd of 22,404 cheered wildly.\n\nGame 5 is Monday night in Anaheim.\n\nBrandon Saad had a goal and two assists for Chicago, which has won all four of its overtime playoff games this year. Captain Jonathan Toews had a goal and an assist, Patrick Kane scored for the second straight game, and Corey Crawford finished with 47 saves \u2014 helping the Blackhawks stay alive when the Ducks had a big push in the first extra session.\n\nRyan Kesler, Corey Perry and Matt Beleskey scored in a 37-second stretch in the third for Anaheim, and Andersen had 35 saves. Emerson Etem also scored.\n\nAnaheim outshot Chicago 17-5 in the first overtime, forcing Crawford to make several clutch stops. The Blackhawks also had a prime opportunity when Andrew Shaw shot it off the crossbar on a power play, and Patrick Sharp was stopped by Andersen on a breakaway.\n\nEtem\u2019s third goal of the playoffs tied it at 1 late in the second, setting the stage for a wild finish to regulation.\n\nToews\u2019 wrist shot over a prone Andersen got the lead back for Chicago at 2:38, and Brent Seabrook made it 3-1 on a big slap shot 5 minutes later. It was the first goal of the conference finals for Toews, who has been wrestling with Kesler all over the ice for most of the series.\n\nThe Ducks responded with a frenzied rally, silencing the big crowd. First, Kesler beat Crawford for his fifth goal of the playoffs at 8:42, and then Beleskey used Blackhawks defenseman Kimmo Timonen as a screen for perfectly placed wrister that tied it at 3. Perry capped the dazzling stretch with a rebound score for Anaheim\u2019s first lead at 9:19.\n\nThe three goals in 37 seconds were the second-fastest three playoff goals scored by one team in NHL history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Toronto scored three times in 23 seconds against the Atlanta Flames on April 12, 1979, with Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville assisting on the final goal in that stretch for the Maple Leafs.\n\nAnd there was still one more goal to go in the third.\n\nThe only penalty of the period was a holding whistle on Ducks winger Jakob Silfverberg, and Chicago turned it into Kane\u2019s tying score at 12:39. Kane slide Richards\u2019 pass underneath Andersen, and the goaltender\u2019s momentum helped carry the puck just past the goal line.\n\nAnaheim controlled most of the final frantic minutes, but Crawford stood tall to help send it to overtime. Chicago winger Bryan Bickell also had a shot go off the crossbar with 2:58 remaining.\n\nStill smarting from their first home loss of the playoffs, the Blackhawks opened with their best period of the series. They kept the puck in Anaheim\u2019s zone for much of the early part of game, but the Ducks blocked 12 shots in the first 20 minutes.\n\nThere was no score in the final minute when the Blackhawks made the most of a huge break.\n\nWith Chicago defenseman Brent Seabrook in the box for slashing, Saad got the puck along the boards in his defensive zone. Ducks defenseman Francois Beauchemin then got tangled up with referee Chris Rooney, sending both of them to the ice, and Saad took off for a breakaway.\n\nKesler made one last try to break up the rush, but Saad deftly knocked his stick away before beating Andersen into the upper right corner with 47 seconds left. It was Saad\u2019s first goal since Game 1 of the second round against Minnesota.\n\nThe Ducks started to pick up their play midway through the second. Beleskey had a great power-play look at 15:43, but Crawford was there for the stop.\n\nAnaheim then tied it at 1 when Kyle Palmieri\u2019s open shot from the slot went off Etem\u2019s right side and into the goal with 1:46 left in the second. It was Etem\u2019s first point of the series.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chicago Blackhawks beat Anaheim Ducks 5-4 in Game 4 of Western final", "title": "Chicago Blackhawks beat Anaheim Ducks 5-4 in Game 4 of Western final", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/23/chicago-blackhawks-beat-anaheim-ducks-5-4-in-game-4-of-western-final/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523__blackhawksp1.jpg", "height": 473}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523__blackhawksp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23T22:28:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T08:47:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Antoine Vermette scored at 5:37 of the second overtime, and the Chicago Blackhawks beat the Anaheim Ducks 5-4 on Saturday night to tie the Western Conference finals at two games apiece.\nBrandon Saad had a goal and two assists for Chicago, which has won all four of its overtime playoff games this year.\nAnaheim outshot Chicago 17-5 in the first overtime, forcing Crawford to make several clutch stops.\nAnaheim controlled most of the final frantic minutes, but Crawford stood tall to help send it to overtime.\nRyan Kesler, Corey Perry and Matt Beleskey scored in a 37-second stretch in the third for Anaheim, and Andersen had 35 saves."}
