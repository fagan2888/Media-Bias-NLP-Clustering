Ulster County Executive Mike Hein can be seen sitting at left. Brian Hubert \u2014 Daily Freeman\n\nKINGSTON, N.Y. >> Chelsea Clinton, on the campaign trail for her mother Hillary Clinton, touted the Democratic candidate for president\u2019s record on healthcare, education, women\u2019s rights and gun control in an approximately 40-minute speech at the Senate Garage Sunday, ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary.\n\nAmong the crowd were several prominent area Democrats, including Ulster County Executive Michael Hein, Kingston Mayor Steve Noble, who was there with his wife Julie and their son, and State Assemblyman Kevin Cahill, D-Kingston.\n\nOn healthcare, Clinton said her mother was the best choice to continue the momentum gained under the Affordable Care Act passed under President Barack Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow 90 percent of Americans have health insurance,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t throw that momentum out and start from scratch,\u201d she said, referring to plans by Clinton\u2019s opponent, Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, to scrap the Affordable Care Act in favor of a Medicare-for-all program.\n\nVIDEO: Chelsea Clinton speaks at the Senate Garage in Kingston\n\nThe audience roared as Clinton discussed how her mother has fought for universal health coverage since the early 1990s.\n\n\u201cIt was Hilary Care before it was Obamacare,\u201d she said. \u201cI think she really knows how to take us from 90 percent healthcare coverage to 100 percent coverage.\u201d\n\nShe said if elected, her mother would work to bring down prescription drug prices by having medicare negotiate with drug companies.\n\n\u201cWe could reduce costs 60 to 80 percent that way,\u201d she said, as the audience cheered.\n\nVIDEO: Chelsea Clinton lays out her mother\u2019s plan for healthcare\n\nOn overturning the Citizen\u2019s United decision in the Supreme Court, she said no one has worked harder than her mother on seeing it overturned.\n\n\u201cOverturning Citizen\u2019s United is ethical and personal for my mom,\u201d Clinton said during a large portion of her speech devoted to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cBased on the average retirement ages of Supreme Court Justice, the next president will appoint two to three justices,\u201d she said. \u201cThat could have an impact for generations.\u201d\n\nShe said her mother can work with unlikely allies, citing her work with former Republican Texas Representative Tom DeLay on the Child Health Program that ensures over eight million low income children.\n\nClinton said her mother will be the best candidate to stop a tide of laws restricting women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\nIn 2016, she said 300 such laws were passed at the state and local level.\n\n\u201cI find it challenging that my mother\u2019s opponent sees women\u2019s issues as a distraction,\u201d she said.\n\nShe cited her mother\u2019s efforts to create a position within the U.S. government that advocates for women\u2019s rights around the world when she was secretary of state, a program she said has continued under John Kerry\u2019s tenure.\n\nWhen asked by a 10-year-old boy during a question-and-answer session if she wanted to be president, she said no, but she encouraged him to consider getting involved with politics to make changes on issues he really cared about.\n\nA young girl told Clinton she\u2019d be excited to see there be a \u201cgirl president.\u201d\n\nAfter her speech, she spent several minutes with smartphone-wielding well-wishers who were taking selfies, and then she spoke briefly with reporters.\n\nWhen asked what distinguishes Hillary Clinton from Senator Bernie Sanders, she said there were several strong distinctions.\n\n\u201cI think she has a stronger record of being able to make change, rather were talking about healthcare reform or early childhood education or fighting climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that\u2019s been able to be deliver real progress.\n\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s the only candidate on either side of the aisle that tells you how she\u2019s going to pay for everything,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said her mother has what it takes to have realistic enforceable gun control and has much stronger record than Sanders. \u201cShe believes, given the strong support, even among gun owners, for child safety locks and universal background checks, that we should be able to get there.\n\n\u201cWe need to strip the gun industry of the unique protections the gun industry enjoys,\u201d she said, adding that her mother during a recent debate pointed out that the toy gun industry has more regulation than the gun industry has.\n\nShe attacked Sanders record on gun control.\n\nShe said he supported these protections for gun makers.\n\nWhen asked by reporters about healthcare, she said her mom has the clearest plan to get 100 percent of Americans insured and a plan that would incentivize governors who haven\u2019t expanded medicaid to lower health care costs.\n\nShe said her mother\u2019s plan would cap premium and out of pocket costs in any month or any year.\n\n\u201cThat was part of her original plan back in \u201893-\u201994,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI hope whether voters care about finishing on the work of the Affordable Care Act or building on the progress President Obama has made on gun control, or building on the progress President Obama has made on rebuilding our standing around world, they\u2019ll support my mom.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: Chelsea Clinton Tout\u2019s her mother\u2019s record on Healthcare, gun control and foreign policy",
