In a case sure to stir up memories of the Lois Lerner investigation, which saw IRS Commissioner John Koskinen dragged before Congress for multiple hearings, the agency destroyed a computer hard drive belonging to an IRS official connected to the subject of a Congressional query.\n\nEarlier this year, the IRS was ordered by a federal judge to preserve documents \u2013 including electronic documents \u2013 that were possibly related to an ongoing dispute between the agency and Microsoft.\n\nRelated: New Lerner Emails Mean IRS Targeting Scandal Creeps Closer to DC\n\nThe disagreement between the IRS and the software giant centered on compliance with the federal tax code, specifically, the agency was looking into the company\u2019s transfer pricing practices. A major concern in establishing the tax liability of multinational corporations, transfer pricing refers to the sale of goods and services between entities that are part of the same corporate structure.\n\nSome companies have been known to illegally reduce their tax liabilities by \u201cmispricing\u201d the goods and services exchanged between their subsidiaries.\n\nThe computer hard drive the IRS destroyed belonged to Samuel Maruca, who oversaw the transfer pricing section at the agency\u2019s Large Business and International division.\n\nIn the Microsoft case, the software giant\u2019s attorneys became curious when they were directed to meet with, and in some cases have their clients give depositions before non-IRS attorneys as part of the case.\n\nRelated: 32,774 \u2018Found\u2019 IRS Emails Prompt Criminal Probe\n\nThe company filed a Freedom of Information Act request, and discovered that the IRS had spent more than $2.5 million on outside legal assistance, often to trial lawyers charging the government $1,000 per hour or more.\n\nThe revelation led Microsoft to protest that senior executives from the company ought not to be forced to comply with demands to testify, on the grounds that the private attorneys do not have the legal standing to conduct interviews related to an IRS audit.\n\nA federal judge disagreed, and though he said that the involvement of the outside attorneys was \u201ctroubling,\u201d told the company to comply.\n\nHowever, while the courts might have sided with the IRS, the Senate Finance Committee and the House Oversight and Investigations Committee were not pleased to learn that the agency, which employs thousands of tax attorneys, spent millions of dollars on outside legal help.\n\nRelated: Treasury IG Finds IRS Destroyed More Lerner Emails\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, wrote to Koskinen in May, noting, \u201cThe IRS has over 40,000 employees dedicated to enforcement efforts, including more than 36,000 tasked specifically with exams and collections. If none of these employees, nor IRS Office of Chief Counsel or Department of Justice tax attorneys, have sufficient expertise to undertake the examination at hand, we should have a broader conversation about your agency\u2019s hiring practices and recruitment needs.\u201d\n\nHatch also challenged the idea that it was acceptable to allow non-government attorneys to participate in the audit of a private firm.\n\n\u201cUnlike private contractors, Treasury Department officials are required to swear an oath to the Constitution and are subject to rules of conduct and federal law regulating their interactions with taxpayers\u2026. Turning over inherently government functions such as the conduct of an examination to private contractors not only jeopardizes the rights of taxpayers, but also confuses the examination process and changes the well-regulated relationship between revenue examiners and private taxpayers.\u201d\n\nThe revelation that the agency had destroyed a hard drive that Congressional investigators viewed as central to an ongoing inquiry infuriated House Oversight and Investigations Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah).\n\nRelated: IRS Stirs Up New Crisis With Non-Profits Over Social Security Numbers\n\nIn a letter to Koskinen last week, co-signed by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, he wrote, \u201cIt is stunning to see that the IRS still does not take reasonable care to preserve documents that it is legally required to protect,\u201d and demanded information related to the agency\u2019s document retention policies.\n\nIn a line that seems to presage further uncomfortable Congressional hearings for Koskinen, they also wrote, \u201cThe destruction of evidence subject to preservation orders and subpoenas has been an ongoing problem under your leadership at the IRS.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service appears to have, once again, violated a court order requiring the preservation of evidence needed by investigators looking into questionable practices at the agency.", "title": "Here We Go Again \u2026 IRS Destroys Another Hard Drive", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/25/Here-We-Go-Again-IRS-Destroys-Another-Hard-Drive", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03272013_IRS_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/25/Here-We-Go-Again-IRS-Destroys-Another-Hard-Drive", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03272013_IRS_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service appears to have, once again, violated a court order requiring the preservation of evidence needed by investigators looking into questionable practices at the agency.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The computer hard drive the IRS destroyed belonged to Samuel Maruca, who oversaw the transfer pricing section at the agency\u2019s Large Business and International division.\nIn a case sure to stir up memories of the Lois Lerner investigation, which saw IRS Commissioner John Koskinen dragged before Congress for multiple hearings, the agency destroyed a computer hard drive belonging to an IRS official connected to the subject of a Congressional query.\nSome companies have been known to illegally reduce their tax liabilities by \u201cmispricing\u201d the goods and services exchanged between their subsidiaries.\nA federal judge disagreed, and though he said that the involvement of the outside attorneys was \u201ctroubling,\u201d told the company to comply.\nEarlier this year, the IRS was ordered by a federal judge to preserve documents \u2013 including electronic documents \u2013 that were possibly related to an ongoing dispute between the agency and Microsoft."}
