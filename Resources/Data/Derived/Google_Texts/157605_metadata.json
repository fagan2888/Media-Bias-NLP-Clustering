That alone would be very, very harmful to the state.\"\n\nThe investment council oversees the state agency that invests New Jersey's $80 billion pension system.\n\nByrne also served on Christie's pension and health benefits commission, which recommended a different solution to tackling New Jersey's underfunded retiree benefits.\n\nAs part of a broad overhaul, the commission said, the state should scale back employees' health benefits and use the savings to pay down the pension system's $40 billion unfunded liability. A constitutional guarantee of pension payments should be passed only if the health benefit savings were realized. Christie, a Republican running for president, has endorsed that plan.\n\nThe health benefits system has an unfunded liability of $53 billion, according to the commission's September 2014 report.\n\nStarting in 2018, the Affordable Care Act will impose a 40 percent excise tax on high-benefit, high-cost health plans. That will cost the state nearly $60 million in 2018 and rise to $284 million by 2022, the commission said.\n\nSweeney's plan, which does not address health benefits, \"removes any incentive to deal on that issue,\" Byrne said.\n\nHe added, \"I don't think the constitution ought to be a budget document.\"\n\nSweeney says his plan would get the pension system on track to fiscal health by 2022. In fiscal 2018, the state would be required to contribute about $3 billion.\n\nTo get the question on the ballot in 2016, the Legislature must approve Sweeney's bill with a simple majority in both this legislative session, which ends in mid-January, and the next. Alternatively, the Legislature could approve the amendment next session with a three-fifths majority vote.\n\naseidman@phillynews.com\n\n856-779-3846 @AndrewSeidman", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"url": "http://articles.philly.com/2015-12-13/news/68986227_1_pension-system-health-benefits-pension-payments", "site_name": "philly-archives", "type": "article", "description": "Amending New Jersey's constitution to ensure the state makes its contributions to the public-employee pension system could be \"disastrous for the state's financial future over time,\" the chairman of...", "title": "State official calls Sweeney pension amendment 'disastrous'"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 174828689230209}, "description": "Amending New Jersey's constitution to ensure the state makes its contributions to the public-employee pension system could be \"disastrous for the state's financial future over time,\" the chairman of"}, "article_summary": "Byrne also served on Christie's pension and health benefits commission, which recommended a different solution to tackling New Jersey's underfunded retiree benefits.\nThe investment council oversees the state agency that invests New Jersey's $80 billion pension system.\n\"The state hasn't lived up to its commitments, and that's bad,\" Byrne, a former chairman of the state Democratic Party, said Friday.\nSweeney's plan, which does not address health benefits, \"removes any incentive to deal on that issue,\" Byrne said.\nThe health benefits system has an unfunded liability of $53 billion, according to the commission's September 2014 report."}
