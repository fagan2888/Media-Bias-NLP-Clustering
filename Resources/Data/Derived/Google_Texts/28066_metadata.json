The Nuggets, more than most teams, are acutely aware of this.\n\nThat\u2019s why Randy Foye\u2019s return on Saturday night after missing 26 straight games with a quad injury was the perfect time for one of the oldest tricks in NBA players\u2019 books: The Fake Substitution.\n\nRandy, you have the floor.\n\n\u201cGallo said \u2018Randy! Coach called you.\u2019 So I took off running,\u201d Foye said, a grin rising on his face. \u201cThen coach looked at me when I ran up. He was like \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 I said, \u2018You didn\u2019t call me?\u2019 And then I ran back to the bench and I looked and everybody was in tears (laughing).\u201d\n\nClassic.\n\n\u201cThey got me,\u201d Foye said. \u201cI\u2019m usually the prankster on the team. But, it was so truthful coming from Gallo, because Gallo doesn\u2019t play around like that. So when Gallo said, \u2018Go ahead Randy, coach called you,\u2019 I sprinted. I was ready to go.\u201d\n\nAnd so, of course, Foye was extra cautious when he was actually called to sub in.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t move until I looked and was like \u2018You sure?\u2019\n\n\u201cAlright.'\u201d\n\nFollow Chris Dempsey on Twitter @dempseypost or email him at cdempsey@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Denver,NBA,Nuggets,Randy Foye", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/01/18/randy-foye-falls/12417/", "site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog", "title": "Randy Foye falls for it"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Randy Foye falls for it", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/01/18/randy-foye-falls/12417/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Teammates christened Randy Foye's return from an extended injury absence by playing a practical joke on him during his first game back."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb504\"", "article_summary": "So when Gallo said, \u2018Go ahead Randy, coach called you,\u2019 I sprinted.\nCoach called you.\u2019 So I took off running,\u201d Foye said, a grin rising on his face.\nI was ready to go.\u201dAnd so, of course, Foye was extra cautious when he was actually called to sub in.\n\u201cGallo said \u2018Randy!\n\u201cThen coach looked at me when I ran up."}
