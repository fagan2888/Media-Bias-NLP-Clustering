(Photo: File photo by Mark Vergari/The Journal News)Buy Photo\n\nMount Kisco Medical Group, one of the largest physician groups in the Lower Hudson Valley, is laying off 109 employees.\n\nThe company plans to finalize the layoffs within the next 90 days. Dr. Scott Hayworth, president and CEO, said the job cuts stemmed from outsourcing some billing operations to IKS Health, a New York City-based company.\n\nAffected employees received written notices Monday, and they will receive severance packages, including several weeks of pay and benefits, which vary based upon the amount of time with the company, according to Hayworth.\n\n\"This is a difficult day for everyone at MKMG,\" Hayworth wrote in an email.\n\nThe company gave technology demands as the main reason it partnered with IKS for some billing operations. It also cited government regulations, such as the Affordable Care Act, increasing the amount of effort involved in billing and other record-keeping, which has prompted many doctors and hospitals to outsource related departments.\n\nEstablished in 1946, Mount Kisco Medical Group has nearly 2,700 employees total and serves more than 500,000 patients, making it among the largest independent physician groups in the Lower Hudson Valley.\n\nThe group's doctors cover 40 different health care providers in Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess and Ulster counties.\n\nThe layoffs represent about 50 percent of its in-house billing operation. The company said the initial severance package spans six weeks of pay and benefits, following the initial 90-day period that starts Monday.\n\nEligible employees will also receive an additional week of pay for each full year of service at the group, up to an additional six weeks. They will also receive job-placement assistance, both internally and externally, the group said.\n\nAs for the MKMG patients, all calls to the billing department will be answered by IKS Health, according to Hayworth.\n\nIKS Health is headquartered in New York City. The company also has offices in Alabama, California and Colorado, along with locations in India, according to its website.\n\nTwitter: @DRobinsonLoHud\n\nRead or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1I2jtZa", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Mount Kisco Medical Group laying off 109 workers", "og": {"site_name": "lohud.com", "description": "Mount Kisco Medical Group laying off 109 workers", "title": "Mount Kisco Medical Group laying off 109 workers", "url": "http://www.lohud.com/story/money/business/2015/06/01/mount-kisco-medical-layoffs/28311385/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lohud.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mount Kisco Medical Group laying off 109 workers", "title": "Mount Kisco Medical Group laying off 109 workers", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/da9807bb8cd9de50a46b930d3dee80d428af662a/c=536-0-2839-2303&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/01/Westchester/B9317561786Z.1_20150601142215_000_GNKAV4E6V.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@lohud", "site": "@lohud", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600070416", "fb": {"app_id": 169889109713077}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Mount Kisco Medical Group, Mout Kisco Medical Group layoffs, MKMG, Mount Kisco Medical layoffs, Mount Kisco layoffs"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33e8\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: File photo by Mark Vergari/The Journal News)Buy PhotoMount Kisco Medical Group, one of the largest physician groups in the Lower Hudson Valley, is laying off 109 employees.\nAs for the MKMG patients, all calls to the billing department will be answered by IKS Health, according to Hayworth.\nDr. Scott Hayworth, president and CEO, said the job cuts stemmed from outsourcing some billing operations to IKS Health, a New York City-based company.\nJob cuts stem from outsourcing some billing operations to IKS Health, a New York City-based companyBuy Photo Scott D.
