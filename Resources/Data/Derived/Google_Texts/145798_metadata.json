The survey found interest in UBI programs was greatest among drivers in the 18- to 34-year-old age group, of which 66% said they would definitely or probably purchase a UBI policy.\n\nBeyond pricing advantages, the survey also measured consumers\u2019 interest in valued-added services that can also be enabled by the technology. Approximately 72% of people interested in UBI said they would be willing to pay for additional services such as vehicle theft tracking (83% interested), automated emergency response (82%) and vehicle wellness reports (79%).\n\n\u201cConsumers\u2019 interest in UBI-related value-added services presents a great opportunity for insurance companies,\u201d said Robin Harbage, global lead for Towers Watson\u2019s UBI practice and DriveAbility service offering. \u201cInsurers can begin thinking about de-commoditizing their products by incorporating these services into their UBI offering. They can really cater their products to the very specific needs of the market, and if done effectively, it will lead to growth and higher retention levels.\u201d\n\nIn fact, interest is so strong in UBI that, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, \u201cMany industry experts predict that UBI is poised for rapid growth in the U.S., with 20% of all vehicle insurance in the U.S. expected to incorporate some form of UBI within five years.\u201d The association noted that growth is being spurred by technological advances that continue to improve the cost, convenience and effectiveness of telematics devices.\n\nProgressive Insurance, which provides the Snapshot device, offers its UBI service in about 25 and 30 states. Meanwhile, Allstate, Esurance and The Hartford have various technologies they are using but in a smaller number of states.
