Pablo Alcala/AP\n\nLIBERTY, Ky. \u2013 For the better part of a decade, Frank McAninch ignored many of his ailments. A bad cold: \u201cYou weather it out yourself.\u201d A torn rotator cuff from working cattle: \u201cLet time heal it.\u201d\n\nThen in early 2012, McAninch noticed a spot on his right cheek that became irritated every time he shaved. A year after spotting it, he asked his primary care doctor to take a look.\n\nMcAninch said his doctor told him not to worry. But one year later, nothing had changed.\n\nAt the time, visiting a dermatologist wasn\u2019t an option for McAninch, who didn\u2019t have health insurance.\n\n\u201cIf you get sick, you don\u2019t go to the doctor unless it\u2019s an emergency,\u201d said McAninch, a farmer living in Liberty, a small town in rural south central Kentucky. \u201cAnd if you do, you pay out of pocket.\u201d\n\nFortunately for McAninch, he didn\u2019t have to wait too long before seeing a dermatologist. On Oct. 1, 2013, Kentucky\u2019s health insurance exchange, Kynect, went live. The website is the state\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which mandated health insurance for individuals and gave states the option to set up their own insurance exchanges in lieu of the federal government\u2019s exchange, healthcare.gov. Seventeen states, plus the District of Columbia, have chosen this option.\n\nWithin two weeks of Kynect\u2019s launch, McAninch, a husband and father of two daughters, applied for insurance and found out he qualified for Medicaid under the health care law\u2019s new eligibility requirements. For states such as Kentucky that have chosen to expand Medicaid under the law, adults between the ages of 19 and 64 qualify if their income is less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level (or $32,499 for a family of four).\n\nAfter receiving his coverage, McAninch visited a dermatologist who discovered that he had squamous cell carcinoma, a non-melanoma skin cancer that can be dangerous if not treated. The dermatologist removed it, leaving 47-year-old McAninch cancer free.\n\nAs of July, McAninch is one of some 521,000 Kentuckians who\u2019ve received coverage through the health insurance exchange, according to Carrie Banahan, executive director of the Office of the Kentucky Health Benefit Exchange. The Kentucky exchange has become a poster child for success because of the high number of people newly insured through the system. A recent Gallup poll indicated that Kentucky\u2019s uninsured rate has dropped from 20.4 percent last year to 11.9 percent in mid-2014, the second steepest decline after Arkansas.\n\nTo be sure, not everyone believes that Kynect will benefit the state in the long run, and the issue has cropped up in the U.S. Senate race between Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat. Critics have cited looming Medicaid costs and spiked insurance rates as reasons why Kynect and the ACA, also known as Obamacare, don\u2019t work. Some point to evidence that Kynect\u2019s success may be premature.\n\nFor one, the majority receiving coverage through Kynect \u2013 300,000 \u2013 qualified for Medicaid under new eligibility rules, rather than enrolling in private coverage. Critics assert that this could put a strain on the state when the federal Medicaid subsidy drops by 10 percent in 2020. It could also lead to increased fees on insurance providers, resulting in higher health insurance prices.\n\nPhotos: Top 10 Senate Races EXPAND GALLERY Photo Gallery x of x Full Screen NORTH CAROLINA.

Jim Cole/AP x of x \u00d7\n\n\u201cHow to pay for the surge in Medicaid recipients, when we haven\u2019t had a comparable surge in paying insured is a problem that\u2019s been put off so far,\u201d said Stephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky. \u201cThe Republicans here are predicting that there are going to be huge health care costs down the road and when the actual costs of Kynect and the Medicaid enrollments hit, it\u2019s going to be extremely unpopular.\u201d\n\nBut for McAninch and others living in rural Kentucky, health insurance means a newfound security.\n\n***\n\nSitting in a pink floral chair on a porch overlooking his group of bulls, McAninch recalled the day, about four years ago, that a chain saw gashed his shin. His wife, Renee, drove him to an emergency room in town so that doctors could stitch up the wound. He paid about $500 in out-of-pocket medical costs that day.\n\n\u201cYou do what you have to,\u201d McAninch said in an interview Tuesday, clad in a blue and red flannel shirt tucked into light bluejeans, and a National Family Farm Coalition baseball cap.\n\n\u201cBut what if you had cut your limb off?\u201d said Renee, leaning next to him on the porch.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThank goodness.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time McAninch and Renee have played the \u201cwhat if\u201d game. They\u2019ve done it since Renee stopped working in the medical field 10 years ago to stay at home with their daughters, and the couple lost their health insurance. McAninch\u2019s job, raising beef cattle, can be dangerous, and the fear of how he would pay for a serious injury or illness always lingered.\n\nWhen the dermatologist diagnosed McAninch with skin cancer, the family knew how lucky they were to be covered. McAninch wonders how long he would have waited to see a dermatologist, and what the health impact could have been. Since qualifying for Medicaid, though, the family hasn\u2019t had to worry.\n\n\u201cIt gave me a sense of security to know that if anything was wrong, any health issue, that we could go to the doctor, and it wouldn\u2019t be \u2013 that the cost wouldn\u2019t be insurmountable,\u201d he said. \u201cThat we could handle it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA huge relief,\u201d echoed Renee.\n\nJust five miles away, one of McAninch\u2019s friends, Michael Taylor, feels a sense of peace, too.\n\nTaylor is 43, a divorced father of two who manufactures and delivers farm equipment. Before enrolling in health insurance through Kynect, he said he paid $700 a month for individual health insurance, a premium that continued to spike after two back surgeries and a stroke.\n\nTaylor hadn\u2019t paid much attention to Obamacare, but then McAninch urged him to look into Kynect. After enrolling, his monthly premium dropped to $120.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of stress off. I bought a new truck with the money I saved from that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means a lot. You get to see what you\u2019re out here working every day for.\u201d\n\n***\n\nUnlike the two Kentuckians, some Americans experienced long wait times, crashed websites and frustration when they sought to enroll in the new health insurance program. When McAninch and Taylor signed up, they made a quick call.\n\n\u201cIt took about 20 minutes,\u201d McAninch said. \u201cI think I was on hold for maybe five, 10 minutes. No issue.\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky exchange\u2019s smooth enrollment process has stood in contrast to other states that have had issues with their own rollouts. Massachusetts had to rely heavily on paper enrollment applications because of its faulty website. In Oregon, technical glitches rendered the state\u2019s online exchange unusable, and it transitioned from a state-based operation to the federal system, which has been riddled with its own problems.\n\nBut in Kentucky, more than 32,000 people enrolled in coverage within the first month of Kynect\u2019s operation. During the first enrollment period between Oct. 1, 2013, and April 15, 2014, three-quarters of enrollees indicated they were uninsured, according to Banahan, the state official.\n\n\u201cWe think one of the reasons that we\u2019ve been successful is because of some of the features and functionality available on the system,\u201d she said.\n\nBanahan credits the simplicity of the exchange for its arguable success. Unlike other state-based health insurance exchanges and the federal website, users didn\u2019t have to create an account in order to plug in their numbers to determine their eligibility status. Banahan said it\u2019s also one of the few states that offer a streamlined application process, allowing shoppers to apply for Medicaid and qualified health plans in one shot.\n\nTo get the word out, the state advertised heavily, and trained 5,000 people to support enrollment, including insurance agents and application counselors, called \u201cKynectors.\u201d\n\nAnd it helped that the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Steve Beshear, has embraced the Affordable Care Act and has been a staunch advocate of the state-based exchange. Kentucky ranks 45th among U.S. states in overall health, according to the United Health Foundation.\n\nThe governor has seen Kynect as a way to boost the health of a state that the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index ranked 45th in median household income.\n\n***\n\nThe controversy over the health care law remains a divisive political issue that\u2019s playing out in Kentucky in the race between McConnell and Grimes.\n\nMcConnell shares the sentiment that the law has led to increased insurance prices and higher deductibles, as well as a lack of access to doctors and hospitals. During a debate with Grimes last week, he vowed to repeal it \u201croot and branch\u201d if re-elected. During the same debate, however, the senator mentioned that he would preserve Kynect, a notion that Banahan asserted would be impossible if Obamacare were repealed.\n\nKynect \u201cwould not serve its purpose any longer,\u201d she said.\n\nPolls have showed that in Kentucky, labeling makes a difference. In an NBC and Marist survey released in May, a 56 percent majority of those polled said they disliked Obamacare, while only 22 percent disliked Kynect. A national Gallup poll earlier this month found that more people feel they have been hurt by the Affordable Care Act than helped. Of those surveyed, 16 percent said they had been helped by the law, 27 percent said they had been hurt by it and 54 percent felt it had no effect on them.\n\n\u201cObamacare on the one hand taps into the dislike that President Obama has here more generally,\u201d Voss said. \u201cYou stick his name in front of it, it reminds Kentucky voters of a lot of things.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Grimes has vowed that she will not take away coverage from the newly insured, but has largely avoided praising the Affordable Care Act and has said that she would work to fix the law if elected.\n\nAccording to Voss, however, the issue may not prove a deciding factor in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cI think on balance it\u2019s really been a wash,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t like the national Democrats, people who are turned off by references to President Obama, it\u2019s just another arrow in the quiver to use against the Democratic candidate. People who like this [government] involvement, who are inclined to support it, it helps rile them up to oppose McConnell.\u201d\n\nFor McAninch, though, the notion that his health insurance could be ripped away disturbs him.\n\nHe believes that because he works year-round for 40 to 60 hours a week, he deserves coverage. When Renee goes on vacation, he stays home. It\u2019s up to him to make sure that no cattle jump the fence.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Kentucky Politics Mired in Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Deep red Kentucky has embraced the president's unpopular health care law.", "title": "Kentucky Politics Mired in Obamacare", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/11/03/kentucky-politics-mired-in-obamacare", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/f9/81f253639d5b7d855251234491895b/media:9f93b040f9bf49fc8588de928076fc70SenateStateofPlayAnalysis.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Kentucky Politics Mired in Obamacare", "description": "Deep red Kentucky has embraced the president's unpopular health care law.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Nov. 3, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jani Actman,Pulse,picks,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,Obama, Barack,Obama administration,McConnell, Mitch,Kentucky,2014 Congressional elections,politics,campaigns,Politics [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Deep red Kentucky has embraced the president's unpopular health care law."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe09\"", "article_summary": "Before enrolling in health insurance through Kynect, he said he paid $700 a month for individual health insurance, a premium that continued to spike after two back surgeries and a stroke.\nIt could also lead to increased fees on insurance providers, resulting in higher health insurance prices.\nJim Cole/AP x of x Photo Gallery x of x NORTH CAROLINA.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, right, and his Democratic Senate opponent, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, during a joint appearance earlier in October.\nAs of July, McAninch is one of some 521,000 Kentuckians who\u2019ve received coverage through the health insurance exchange, according to Carrie Banahan, executive director of the Office of the Kentucky Health Benefit Exchange."}
