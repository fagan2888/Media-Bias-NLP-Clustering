No way around it. We often attribute their awkward gait to childhood development and trying to match their parents' stride for stride. A review published in The Journal of Experimental Biology suggests that a child\u2019s lack of grace is less about growing into their movements (\u201cwalk before you run\u201d sound familiar) and more about physiological factors, such as muscle development and shorter limbs.\n\n\u201cSome scientists see a young child appearing to walk and run uneconomically and then attribute it to being underdeveloped,\u201d said Jim Usherwood from the Royal Veterinary College, UK in a statement. \u201cYou can see that by watching a 3-year-old running; they barely get off the ground. You activate the muscles and there is a physiological cost to activating it.\u201d\n\nUsherwood and his colleague Tatjana Hubel recruited 18 children between the ages of 1.1 and 4.7 years old. Two of the children were Usherwood\u2019s daughters. To track each child\u2019s movement, the research team used a camera system that tracked reflective dots specifically positioned on the children\u2019s limbs. Children were asked to match their parent\u2019s speed, go faster, or go slower, while researchers were careful not to influence the gait they used.\n\nOver the course of their investigation, Usherwood and Hubel found that while time was misinterpreting their results, another factor was also unaccounted for: muscle. They found that since children\u2019s legs are shorter than adults\u2019, it takes a shorter amount of time for them to push up and away from the ground, it means their muscles have less time to contract and generate the power they need, and it means their feet are on the ground for a longer period of time in between each stride.\n\nThe research team was only able to recreate a successful model showing the movements of both child and parent after they accounted for the amount of muscle a person would need to propel them along a certain speed. So, a child running with shorter limbs compared to their adult counterpart requires more time to lift each leg in the air during a full stride. A child\u2019s shorter limbs and underdeveloped muscles often do not provide them with enough time to stop them from falling flat on their face while running.\n\nSource: Hubel T, Usherwood J.
