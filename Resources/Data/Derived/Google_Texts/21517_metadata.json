He was 89.\n\nKnown as \u201cConcrete Charlie,\u201d Bednarik epitomized the tough-guy linebacker and also was an outstanding center for the Eagles from 1949 to 1962. He is best remembered for a game-saving tackle at the 9-yard line on the final play of the 1960 title game, and it was typical Bednarik. He threw Green Bay running back Jim Taylor to the ground and refused to let him up while the final seconds ticked off as the Eagles held on for a 17-13 win.\n\n\u201cEverybody reminds me of it and I\u2019m happy they remind me of it,\u201d Bednarik once said. \u201cI\u2019m proud and delighted to have played in that game.\u201d\n\nHe died at an assisted living facility in Richland, Pennsylvania, following a brief illness, the Eagles said in a statement.\n\nREAD: Chuck Bednarik: As tough as they come\n\nTwo of his daughters said Bednarik had dementia, an affliction common in former professional football players.\n\n\u201cHe died from dementia from football-related head injuries,\u201d Thomas told the The Express-Times of Easton \u201cIt was not brief.\u201d\n\nPamela McWilliams, who also believes football injuries played a role in his decline, said her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cI certainly think it played a big role in it \u2013 he took a lot of blows and they certainly didn\u2019t have the safety equipment they have now back then,\u201d McWilliams told The Express-Times. \u201cIt seemed like quite a few of the guys he played with and against had it.\u201d\n\nBednarik, who frequently criticized modern athletes, said he played on all but two kickoffs against the Packers and could have kept playing if he needed to, unlike today\u2019s players who \u201csuck air after five plays.\u201d He missed only three games in his 14-year career.\n\nThe tackle on Taylor actually was the second hit that season that drew headlines. Earlier in 1960, he knocked out New York Giants running back Frank Gifford with a blow so hard that Gifford suffered a concussion and didn\u2019t play again until 1962.\n\nAn iconic photograph captured Bednarik pumping his fist over Gifford\u2019s prone body, though the linebacker insisted he wasn\u2019t gloating. He said he didn\u2019t notice what happened to Gifford after the hit and only saw that he had fumbled and another Eagle recovered the ball.\n\nBednarik was the last NFL starter to play regularly on both offense and defense until Deion Sanders did so for Dallas in 1996. Sanders\u2019 achievement hardly impressed Bednarik.\n\n\u201cThe positions I played, every play, I was making contact, not like that \u2026 Deion Sanders,\u201d Bednarik said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t tackle my wife. He\u2019s back there dancing out there instead of hitting.\u201d\n\nBorn May 1, 1925, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Bednarik flew 30 combat missions over Germany as a gunner during World War II. He then played center for Penn from 1945 to 1948, and was selected first overall in the 1949 NFL draft by the Eagles.\n\nIn 1950, he was All-NFL as a center, then he was voted All-NFL as a linebacker in 1951 through 1957, and again in 1960.\n\nBednarik, whose gnarled fingers in retirement stood as a reminder of the ruggedness of his profession, said he never made more than $27,000 in a season and supplemented his income by selling concrete, earning his nickname. At one point, he pawned his championship ring and his Hall of Fame ring.\n\nIn early 2005, when the Eagles won the NFC championship and had Philadelphia in a Super Bowl frenzy, Bednarik was bitter enough to root for the Patriots in the Super Bowl. He later apologized to owner Jeff Lurie and was a welcomed visitor at training camp and other alumni functions.\n\n\u201cPhiladelphia fans grow up expecting toughness, all-out effort and a workmanlike attitude from this team and so much of that image has its roots in the way Chuck played the game,\u201d Lurie said in a statement released by the team.\n\nThe Maxwell Football Club presents an award in Bednarik\u2019s honor to the defensive player of the year in college football.\n\nBednarik is survived by his wife, Emma, and five daughters -Charlene Thomas, Donna Davis, Carol Safarowic, Pam McWilliams, and Jackie Chelius, as well as 10 grandchildren and a great-grandchild.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Eagles: Chuck Bednarik, football hall of famer, has died at 89", "title": "Eagles: Chuck Bednarik, football hall of famer, has died at 89", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/21/eagles-chuck-bednarik-football-hall-of-famer-has-died-at-89/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150321_115747_chuck-bednarik.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150321_115747_chuck-bednarik.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-21T11:56:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T18:56:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Chuck Bednarik, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and one of the last great two-way NFL players, died early Saturday, the Philadelphia Eagles said.\nREAD: Chuck Bednarik: As tough as they comeTwo of his daughters said Bednarik had dementia, an affliction common in former professional football players.\n\u201cThe positions I played, every play, I was making contact, not like that \u2026 Deion Sanders,\u201d Bednarik said.\nThe Maxwell Football Club presents an award in Bednarik\u2019s honor to the defensive player of the year in college football.\nKnown as \u201cConcrete Charlie,\u201d Bednarik epitomized the tough-guy linebacker and also was an outstanding center for the Eagles from 1949 to 1962."}
