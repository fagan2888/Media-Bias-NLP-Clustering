At least one in four Californians \u00e2\u0080\" more than 10 million people \u00e2\u0080\" were born in another country.\n\nAnd they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a diverse bunch: Some immigrants, like my parents, are naturalized U.S. citizens. Others are green card holders. Some live here illegally. In addition, there are many thousands of people who have temporary status here on work or student visas.\n\nLots of you have asked how the Affordable Care Act affects immigrants. How I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to hand you a one-size-fits-all response! But this is Obamacare, after all, and the law treats categories of immigrants differently.\n\nQ: What types of immigration status will be covered under Obamacare?\n\nA: Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with one important little detail: All naturalized citizens and legal immigrants must have health insurance as of Jan. 1 or pay a tax penalty. (That is, unless they fit into a category of people who are exempt, including those who cannot find \u00e2\u0080\u009caffordable\u00e2\u0080\u009d coverage, as defined by the law.)\n\nThe insurance requirement isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as ironclad for people with temporary visas. Some will have to abide and some won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. (Thanks, Obamacare!) If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure where you fall, check with an immigration attorney.\n\nWhether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re eligible for zero, some, or all Obamacare programs depends on your legal status:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\" Naturalized U.S. citizens are eligible for all Obamacare benefits, including the expansion of California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Medicaid program for low-income residents, which is called Medi-Cal.\n\nThey also can receive tax credits for plans purchased through the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health insurance exchange, Covered California (as long as they meet the income guidelines and other qualifications).\n\n\u00e2\u0080\" Lawful permanent residents (also known as green card holders); people with temporary work and student visas (such as H-1B, J and F visas); refugees and asylees; Cuban/Haitian entrants; and others can all buy from the exchange and apply for tax credits.\n\nPeople in most of those categories also will be eligible for expanded Medi-Cal if their incomes qualify. Some states \u00e2\u0080\" but not California \u00e2\u0080\" require a five-year waiting period before allowing certain immigrants to enroll.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\" People who are here illegally cannot participate in any of these programs, but can receive emergency or prenatal treatment, as they do now. They also don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to comply with the Obamacare requirement.\n\nQ: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a legal immigrant who has been in the U.S. for less than two years. I already have private health insurance from my country (Mexico), which covers me internationally. I can't afford to get another health plan. Am I obliged to buy another health plan here? Will I have to pay the penalty if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t?\n\nA: Remember that important little detail I mentioned above, Laura? If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a legal immigrant you have to have health insurance starting Jan. 1.\n\nDoes health insurance from another country qualify? Probably not. Coverage from a foreign insurer does not meet the Obamacare requirement unless the insurer has received approval from the federal government, says Jenny Rejeske, health policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "EMILY BAZAR", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/n22zd3-emilybazar2binary1333981.jpg", "content_section": "news", "content_title": "ASK EMILY: Obamacare affects immigrants, too", "author": "EMILY BAZAR", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "Health Care: ASK EMILY: Obamacare affects immigrants, too | health, obamacare, eligible, people, insurance, california, immigrants, status, cal, medi", "title": "ASK EMILY: Obamacare affects immigrants, too", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/n22zd3-emilybazar2binary1333981.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/health-681697-obamacare-eligible.html", "type": "article"}, "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2013-12-08 14:53:48", "content_author": "EMILY BAZAR", "sailthru.title": "ASK EMILY: Obamacare affects immigrants, too", "sailthru.tags": "news, health, obamacare, eligible, people, insurance, california, immigrants, status, cal, medi", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/n22zd3-emilybazar2binary1333981.jpg", "content_type": "article", "Keywords": "health, obamacare, eligible, people, insurance, california, immigrants, status, cal, medi", "publication_date": "2013-12-08", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/n22zd3-emilybazar2binary1333981.jpg", "Description": "Health Care: ASK EMILY: Obamacare affects immigrants, too | health, obamacare, eligible, people, insurance, california, immigrants, status, cal, medi"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf3d\"", "article_summary": "In addition, there are many thousands of people who have temporary status here on work or student visas.\nI already have private health insurance from my country (Mexico), which covers me internationally.\nA: Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with one important little detail: All naturalized citizens and legal immigrants must have health insurance as of Jan. 1 or pay a tax penalty.\nDoes health insurance from another country qualify?\nBut this is Obamacare, after all, and the law treats categories of immigrants differently."}
