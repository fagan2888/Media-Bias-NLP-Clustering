Ted Cruz scored a surprising third-place finish in New Hampshire in yesterday\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary, and now it looks like he\u2019s going for a knockout before South Carolina. Cruz tweeted out the campaign\u2019s latest web ad after his victory, one that takes aim at the winner, Donald Trump. The ad depicts children playing with their new \u201cDonald Trump action figure,\u201d and says what he does most is \u201cpretend to be a Republican\u201d:\n\nIt\u2019s a tour de force of counter-Trump arguments. The ad manages to mention Trump\u2019s friendship with Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid (and adds in a shot at Anthony Weiner, too). Bailouts and Too Big To Fail get mentioned, but it\u2019s Trump\u2019s support for eminent domain that gets most of the attention:\n\nGIRL DOLL: Check out my house, Mr. Trump!\n\nTRUMP DOLL: That\u2019s a lousy house! I\u2019m gonna take your house with eminent domain \u2014 and park my limos there.\n\nKIDS: [while destroying dollhouse] Eminent domain! Eminent domain!\n\nVOICEOVER: We wouldn\u2019t tolerate these values in our children. Why would we want them in a president?\n\nRidicule can be a powerful tool in politics, and it might be the only kind of attack that will work on Trump. His supporters don\u2019t appear to care much about Trump\u2019s lack of policy substance and consistency; they like his attitude and his ability to shift the Overton window on acceptable debate. Trump has a thin skin, though, and Cruz does not. If he can force Trump to demonstrate that thin skin, it might undermine the perception of Trump\u2019s toughness, while still appealing on policy grounds to other voters.\n\nThis still holds some risk. Some voters might not appreciate the use of children to make these points (perhaps especially the reference to Anthony Weiner, considering the context). Cruz got some media heat for using his own kids in a Saturday Night Live skit, which was ludicrous, but this might reopen that debate. Trump and his supporters will complain that it\u2019s a low blow, but since Trump himself often ridicules his opponents with personal attacks, that\u2019s a non-starter. In fact, Cruz might be counting on that reaction to counter Trump\u2019s recent attack on him as a \u201cpussy,\u201d to demonstrate that Trump might be suffering from a case of projection.\n\nIt\u2019s a good time for Cruz to go on the attack. It got lost in the John Kasich shuffle last night, but Cruz far outperformed expectations in New Hampshire, beating out Jeb Bush for third place. Combined with his win in Iowa, Cruz has significant momentum, and is aiming to take over the race by beating the other leading candidate rather than punching downward or sideways, as Team Jeb is doing. This ad could steal some of the post-primary buzz from Kasich, and set up a real fight in South Carolina.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cI like bailouts for the banks!\u201d", "title": "It\u2019s on: New Cruz ad ridicules Trump as fake Republican", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/02/10/its-on-new-cruz-ad-ridicules-trump-as-fake-republican/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/onUaRyvfv1A/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/onUaRyvfv1A/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@GoingRedBook"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-10T15:01:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-10T17:35:14+00:00"}, "keywords": "Donald Trump, pussy, Ted Cruz,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd32ae\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s on: New Cruz ad ridicules Trump as fake Republicanposted at 10:01 am on February 10, 2016 by Ed MorrisseyLike Donkey Kong.\nEminent domain!\nCruz tweeted out the campaign\u2019s latest web ad after his victory, one that takes aim at the winner, Donald Trump.\nI\u2019m gonna take your house with eminent domain \u2014 and park my limos there.\nKIDS: [while destroying dollhouse] Eminent domain!"}
