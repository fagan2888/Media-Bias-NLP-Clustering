He attacked his defender, Josh Norman, in a manner best described as weaponized helmet assault, and was eventually suspended for a game by the NFL.\n\nBeckham has suggested, through proxies, a plausible motive for his nutter: various Panthers hurled gay slurs at him.\n\nBecause if there\u2019s one thing that justifies a pro football player going crazy on national TV\u2014at least in the eyes of other football players and fans\u2014it\u2019s being called a faggot.\n\nAnd why might that be? Maybe because football is the most homophobic subculture this side of the Westboro Baptist Church?\n\nThink about it, folks: the entire football universe freaked out last season at the mere prospect of welcoming its first openly gay player, Michael Sam.\n\nOf course, nobody ever just comes right out and says, \u201cfootball hates fags.\u201d Instead, players and sports pundits speak in a familiar code.\n\nHere, for instance, is how all-pro receiver turned broadcaster Michael Irvin defended Beckham.\n\nFor some reason, everybody goes after him with gay slurs. He\u2019s a different kind of dude. He has the hairdo out, he\u2019s not the big muscular kind of dude. The ladies all love him. He\u2019s a star. I wonder why people are going in that direction. It blows my mind. I told him he can\u2019t let stuff that people say get to you.\n\nTranslation: the fact that Beckham bleaches his hair and doesn\u2019t have big muscles puts his heterosexuality in doubt, which is why he gets called a faggot all the time. But he has sex with lots of \u201cladies,\u201d which makes him totally legit, so he shouldn\u2019t worry about it.\n\nBeckham\u2019s own teammate, punter Brad Wing, offered the same brand of frat boy logic. He hinted that a photo of Beckham embracing a former LSU teammate may have triggered rumors of his homosexuality, then went on to elaborate that Beckham \u201cwas kind of actually happy about it, because all the girls he\u2019s messing around with weren\u2019t fighting with each other anymore.\u201d\n\nGot that? If, as an NFL player, you hug another man, you\u2019re under suspicion as a homo\u2014until such a time as a teammate can vouch for your heterosexual promiscuity.\n\nOfficially, of course, the league condemns all forms of discrimination. But football is, and always has been, a cult of hyper-masculinity. It\u2019s a realm in which the attitudes around gender and orientation aren\u2019t just out of date. They\u2019re medieval. Men are defined as big, strong, violent, physically courageous warriors. Women are defined as sexual hood ornaments. Homosexuals aren\u2019t just abhorrent, they\u2019re aberrant, betrayers of the given order.\n\nThink about it this way: dozens of NFL players have been accused of rape, or domestic abuse, or even animal abuse stemming from dog fighting. None of their teammates are expected to experience existential anguish when these guys rejoin the league. Nobody says, \u201cGeez, is the NFL really ready for a violent criminal?\u201d\n\nAnd why would they? Violent transactions\u2014of the sort that would be illegal in any other context\u2014are the profit center of pro football.\n\nEvery now and again, of course, some player will be foolish enough to express his honest feelings toward homosexuality. At which point the rest of the football world will loudly revile them.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to San Francisco 49er Chris Culliver two years ago, when he was asked about Ravens defensive tackle Brendan Ayanbadejo, a vocal advocate for LGBT equality.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do the gay guys man,\u201d Culliver told a local radio host. \u201cI don\u2019t do that. No, we don\u2019t got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do \u2026 Can\u2019t be with that sweet stuff. Nah\u2026can\u2019t be\u2026in the locker room man. Nah.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York Giants star blames gay slurs for losing control on field.
