He\u2019s having a heck of an offseason.\u201d\n\nBut wait, it gets better for Knighton. The Broncos and their fans don\u2019t really care how much fame and fortune their lovable 330-something-pound defensive tackle engulfs off the field.\n\nTheir hope is that all this newfound attention doesn\u2019t get in Knighton\u2019s way of creating interior havoc at the line of scrimmage. Equipped with an outsized confidence that matches his frame, Knighton said his second season with the Broncos will be his best.\n\n\u201cI think the game has slowed down so much for me,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, I think I\u2019m in the prime of my career. I honestly don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a center that can block me. I\u2019ll just keep working at it. I\u2019ve watched film from last year, and I\u2019ve watched future opponents. Right now, I\u2019m just trying to go out there and dominate and continue where I left off.\u201d\n\nChances are, a few NFL centers will be made aware of the fearless faith Knighton has in himself. Which is only fair, because he notices the brashness of the enemy too.\n\nAs the San Antonio Spurs were blowing out the Miami Heat in the decisive Game 5 of the NBA Finals on Sunday night, Arizona Cardinals defensive back Tyrann Mathieu tweeted, \u201cThis is turning out to be worse than the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nKnighton took that as an affront.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Knighton tweeted in reply. \u201cYa\u2019all on the schedule.\u201d\n\nIt was a more patient Knighton who spent three days in Los Angeles this offseason filming a Bridgestone tires commercial.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fun, though,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dog was a little timid. But we ended up getting along pretty good.\u201d\n\nThe highlight of the commercial is when a Bridgestone researcher, riding shotgun and holding Knighton\u2019s dog as the hungry Bronco drives to a grocery store, tries to change the radio station.\n\n\u201cShe likes country,\u201d Knighton says, scolding the researcher.\n\nKnighton said the most common reaction he has received from the ad is people teasing him about how the dog stole the show.\n\nThere was one play during the Broncos\u2019 practice Monday that offered proof Knighton hasn\u2019t been distracted by the spotlight.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 first-string offense was running goal-to-go plays against the No. 1 base defense. Peyton Manning called out an audible. Knighton put his left hand behind his fortress of a rump and waved middle linebacker Nate Irving to shift over to his left.\n\nSure enough, the play was a counter handoff to tailback Montee Ball, who ran into the gap that Irving had just moved to fill. Ball was stacked up for no gain.\n\n\u201cI know my stuff,\u201d Knighton said. \u201cI played against Peyton six times when I was with Jacksonville (and Manning was with Indianapolis). When the offense makes a check, I go to the sideline and let them know what I heard. Being right by the quarterback, lining up right under the center, it\u2019s kind of my responsibility to let everyone know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nThese are heady times for Knighton. He is enjoying the recognition and will take more endorsements if they come, but he also understands he\u2019s lucky to be in this position.\n\n\u201cI think it was the name, \u2018Pot Roast,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt blew up nationally. Playing at the level I did last year \u2014 there probably would have been a lot more had we won the Super Bowl. But it was a heck of a lot more than when I was in Jacksonville.\u201d\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Broncos\u2019 Terrance Knighton endorsing tires, domination", "title": "Denver Broncos\u2019 Terrance Knighton endorsing tires, domination", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/16/denver-broncos-terrance-knighton-endorsing-tires-domination/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140617__Terrance-Knighton-broncosp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140617__Terrance-Knighton-broncosp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-16T20:18:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:44:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It was only a year ago that Terrance Knighton arrived at Broncos headquarters as an obscure washout from Jacksonville.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Knighton tweeted in reply.\nEquipped with an outsized confidence that matches his frame, Knighton said his second season with the Broncos will be his best.\nThere was one play during the Broncos\u2019 practice Monday that offered proof Knighton hasn\u2019t been distracted by the spotlight.\nThe Broncos and their fans don\u2019t really care how much fame and fortune their lovable 330-something-pound defensive tackle engulfs off the field."}
