Minnesota and Alaska are the only states to license dental therapists, but several others are considering legislation to allow the new field. National health reform organizations, including the Pew Charitable Trusts, have launched campaigns to show how dental therapists can take pressure off primary care doctors and dentists, particularly as the Affordable Care Act rolls out and new patients seek care.\n\nMetzer has become a leading voice.\n\n\u201cWhat the legislators and policymakers ultimately want to know is: How is this going to impact health care?\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cIs this going to lower the overall cost over time? And we can say, \u2018Yes, it is.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "&nbsp;.", "title": "Health beat: Dental therapists have CEO smiling", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/health-beat-dental-therapists-have-ceo-smiling/235879431/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138705771235605.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138705771235605.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "&nbsp;.", "title": "Health beat: Dental therapists have CEO smiling", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/health-beat-dental-therapists-have-ceo-smiling/235879431/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138705771235605.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138705771235605.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "&nbsp;."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3513\"", "article_summary": "Minnesota and Alaska are the only states to license dental therapists, but several others are considering legislation to allow the new field.\nBut today she has found herself thrust into the national spotlight on health reform as an advocate for using an innovative profession called dental therapists to improve patients\u2019 health and reduce medical costs.\n\u201cWhat the legislators and policymakers ultimately want to know is: How is this going to impact health care?\u2019\u2019 she said.\nOver the past two years, Minnesota has licensed 28 dental therapists.\nDental therapists span the divide between the hygienist and the dentist, in much the same way a nurse practitioner or physician assistant works in a medical setting."}
