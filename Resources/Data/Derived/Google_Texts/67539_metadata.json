In Alabama, that means income up to $46,000 for an individual and $92,000 for a family of four.\n\nVelezis said businesses with fewer than 50 full-time employees don\u2019t have to worry about the law at all. \u201cIf you\u2019re under 50, you\u2019re good,\u201d Velezis said. That means you don\u2019t have to offer your employees insurance under the law, but you can.\n\nVelezis also told the group at the Chamber of Commerce of Huntsville-Madison County that three companies will be selling policies on Alabama\u2019s exchange: Blue Cross Blue Shield, United Health and Humana. Not all will offer policies in all counties, he said, but Blue Cross will. The policies will be available at the federal website Oct. 1, but Velezis said the companies can't discuss the specifics until then.\n\n\n\nFor small business owners, the key question is what \u201c50\u201d means. Companies with fewer than 50 full-time employees are not affected, but 50 is based on a calculation that makes part-time employees part of the company\u2019s final total. The math works like this:\n\nAny employee working 30 hours a week is considered one full-time employee. Part-time employees\u2019 monthly hours are added together and divided by 120 (30 hours of week a month). The total of \"full time equivalents\" is added to the full-time employee number. Hit 50, and you fall under the law. That means, Velezis said, you \u201cmust offer minimum essential coverage and it must be affordable.\u201d\n\nBusinesses can begin applying for new business plans on the exchanges on Oct. 1 \u2013 just like individuals \u2013 but they have been given another year before they have to. Penalties, and they are costly, won\u2019t start for businesses until Jan. 1, 2015.\n\nIf the total for a business is 50 or greater, Velezis said, all it will take is one employee going to an exchange for insurance to trigger the penalties for having no company plan. But for companies under 50 and their employees, there still might be an incentive to consider the subsidized exchanges, as this back-and-forth between Velezis and a business owner showed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m under 50 employees and I provide a plan, but it doesn\u2019t meet that test for affordable,\u201d the man asked. \u201cWhat are the impacts?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no penalty,\u201d Velezis said.\n\n\u201cI just keep on business as usual, but (the workers) can go to the exchange,\u201d the man said.\n\n\u201cThey can go to the exchange, they can get a subsidy, but you won\u2019t be penalized,\u201d Velezis replied. That's because the employer has fewer than 50 workers.\n\n\n\n\u201cActually, in that world, I\u2019m kind of getting a good deal,\u201d the man said. \u201cThey can potentially go and get cheaper coverage than I\u2019m offering, because I have a good plan. So that might be good for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere will be people that fall into that category,\u201d Velezis said. \u201cWhen you add the subsidies, it would be a better deal for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Lee Roop | lroop@al.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, news", "title": "Small business owner?
