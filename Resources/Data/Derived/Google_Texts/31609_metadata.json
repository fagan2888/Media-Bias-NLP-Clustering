The items were handmade \u2014 crocheted or knitted \u2014 with yarn donated by Huntsman.\n\n\u201cI can always remember my mom having a crochet hook in her hand,\u201d Huntsman said, as she wiped away tears. \u201cThis is what my mom would have wanted.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Topeka Crochet Guild donated 2,100 items. They topped that number this year, Gould said.\n\n\u201cEvery year, our numbers have grown,\u201d Gould said.\n\nA snowman blanket that had been started by Huntsman\u2019s mother was completed by one of the guild members. Huntsman and Gould held it up as Huntsman recalled her mother\u2019s love of crocheting.\n\n\u201cWe want you to have it,\u201d Gould said.\n\nHuntsman smiled and hugged Gould.\n\nWhile there were tears Thursday night, there also was plenty of laughter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a hooker trying to keep Topeka warm,\u201d said Sandra Harter, jokingly referring to the hooks used when crocheting.\n\nThe Topeka Crochet Guild meets at 1:30 p.m. the first and third Sunday of every month at the Topeka and Shawnee County Public Library, 1515 S.W. 10th.\n\nMembers also meet at 6:30 p.m. every Thursday at the Baker\u2019s Dozen.\n\nThe guild uses only donated yarn to make items for charitable organizations and local hospitals. And while members make other donations throughout the year, the holidays are a perfect time to spread the warmth.\n\n\u201cEach piece is made with love,\u201d Harter said.\n\nGuild members range in age. Member Cathy Long, of Topeka, is currently teaching a 9-year-old how to crochet.\n\n\u201cWe have retired teachers, retired nurses,\u201d Gould said. \u201cWe have all walks of life.\u201d\n\nHats made from extra-soft yarn for cancer patients, tiny colorful hats for babies in neonatal intensive care units and blankets made from camouflage yarn for veterans at Colmery-O\u2019Neil VA Medical Center sat in piles on tables Thursday night. Small groups gathered around the tables and counted and sorted items. Members have even started making sleeping mats out of plastic shopping bags that can be spread on the ground to help protect the homeless from the wet ground.\n\nDog toys and small blankets for cages will be donated to Helping Hands Humane Society, too.\n\n\u201cIt warms our hearts to be able to donate and help provide warmth,\u201d said guild member Tricia Eddy, of Topeka.\n\nThe guild is looking for donations of yarn, patterns and hooks. Donations can be dropped off at Baker\u2019s Dozen or arrangements can be made by calling Gould at (785) 267-5404.\n\nThe group also has a Facebook page.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always open to more donations,\u201d Gould said. \u201cAnd everyone is welcome.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Ann Marie Bush", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Topekan Michelle Huntsman was sorting through items at her mother's home last year when she discovered hundreds of skeins of yarn.", "title": "Topeka Crochet Guild donates items made with love, yarn", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2013-11-17/topeka-crochet-guild-donates-items-made-love-yarn", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/12816709.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Topekan Michelle Huntsman was sorting through items at her mother\u2019s home last year when she discovered hundreds of skeins of yarn.Instead of throwing the yarn away, Huntsman Googled \u201cTopeka crochet\u201d and came across the Topeka Crochet Guild, which was formed about 51/2 years ago.Her mother, who is deceased, loved to crochet, so Huntsman decided to donate the yarn to the guild."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba44\"", "article_summary": "Instead of throwing the yarn away, Huntsman Googled \u201cTopeka crochet\u201d and came across the Topeka Crochet Guild, which was formed about 51/2 years ago.\n\u201cThis is what my mom would have wanted.\u201dLast year, the Topeka Crochet Guild donated 2,100 items.\nThe Topeka Crochet Guild meets at 1:30 p.m. the first and third Sunday of every month at the Topeka and Shawnee County Public Library, 1515 S.W.\nA snowman blanket that had been started by Huntsman\u2019s mother was completed by one of the guild members.\nThe guild uses only donated yarn to make items for charitable organizations and local hospitals."}
