(Photo by Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters)\n\nU.K. Prime Minister David Cameron is running on his economic record, claiming credit for having seen the country through the recession and the recovery. At the polls in Thursday's general election, we'll find out to what degree British voters find that account persuasive. Paul Krugman, unsurprisingly, isn't buying it, and in a long essay in the Guardian last week, he took the British press to task for failing to question Cameron's claims:\n\nAll of the economic research that allegedly supported the austerity push has been discredited. Widely touted statistical results were, it turned out, based on highly dubious assumptions and procedures \u2013 plus a few outright mistakes \u2013 and evaporated under closer scrutiny. It is rare, in the history of economic thought, for debates to get resolved this decisively. The austerian ideology that dominated elite discourse five years ago has collapsed, to the point where hardly anyone still believes it. Hardly anyone, that is, except the coalition that still rules Britain \u2013 and most of the British media. I don\u2019t know how many Britons realise the extent to which their economic debate has diverged from the rest of the western world \u2013 the extent to which the UK seems stuck on obsessions that have been mainly laughed out of the discourse elsewhere.\n\nOne poll found that while only 39 percent of voters trust Cameron on the economy, his opponent, Ed Miliband, has the confidence of just 19 percent of voters on the issue. The Labour party leader has been arguing that voters should look beyond top line statistics on growth, unemployment and inflation, as Danica Kirka reports for the Associated Press.\n\nApparently the message isn't getting across with voters or with journalists, possibly because Miliband has not directly criticized the Conservative emphasis on reducing the deficit, himself arguing that less government borrowing will create growth.\n\nWelcome to Wonkbook.

Top story: Britain goes to the polls\n\nBritain hasn't had an election quite like this one in a while. \"Thursday\u2019s results could set off a mad scramble for power come Friday morning, as parties joust for position with the public, cobble together alliances with sworn enemies and seek to exploit ambiguities in a set of procedures for determining who governs Britain that could be put to the test as never before. At the end of it all, either Conservative incumbent David Cameron or Labor challenger Ed Miliband will emerge as prime minister ... For a society that loves rules as much as Britain does, there are surprisingly few of them to govern the process by which parties decide who should run the country once voters have had their say. Britain lacks a written constitution, and the procedures have evolved over time.\" Griff Witte and Dan Balz in The Washington Post.\n\nHealth care and the economy are two major issues in the election. \"The Conservatives have centered their campaign on their economic record, highlighting the U.K.\u2019s recovery under their watch and accusing the previous Labour government of irresponsible spending. Mr. Cameron says only a Conservative government will keep the economy on track and continue to create jobs. Mr. Miliband, on the other hand, has sought to position his party as one that will fight for the working class, particularly during a time when prices have risen faster than wages. The party has also promised to protect the country\u2019s beloved state-funded health service, an area where voters trust the Conservatives less.\" Jenny Gross in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe candidates haven't been talking much about housing. \"With house prices in Britain increasing by 7.2% in the year to February and the cost of renting a house in Britain rising by 2.1% in the year to March, voters might have expected the question of housing to play a bigger part in the election campaign. They had no such luck. Instead both parties got away with making lots of nice noises and empty promises, while saying little about what they would to to tackle the basic causes of the crisis. Some of their proposals could even exacerbate it. Once the election is over, a radically new approach will be necessary to prevent the crisis becoming even worse.\" The Economist.\n\nIP: Britain's problem is that productivity is not improving. \"Prime Minister David Cameron, the Conservative incumbent, boasts of Britain\u2019s 'jobs miracle,' while Ed Miliband, the Labour Party leader who hopes to replace him, bemoans the worst 'cost of living crisis' since the 1920s. Oddly, both men are right. Britain has enjoyed one of the rich world\u2019s best records on job creation in recent years. It could teach other countries, including the U.S., a thing or two about encouraging work and hiring. And yet, Britain also has one of the worst records on productivity, as measured by output per worker, which explains why wage gains are badly lagging behind the cost of living.\" The Wall Street Journal.\n\nCHAMPION: Keep your eye on the Scots. \"The Scottish National Party looks set to deliver a huge shock to the British political system. If I were a Scot, I\u2019d be sorely tempted to vote for the SNP today, too. Not because I think it would be good for either Scotland or the U.K. to break up the union. Nor because I like the party\u2019s 1970s brand of socialistic economic policies. I\u2019d be tempted because the SNP seems driven and different. ... To the extent that they compromise to be constructive, they risk losing the support of diehard independence advocates. So they have an apparent incentive to make the U.K. as dysfunctional as possible. ... The English, it seems, are also lusting for the sense of freshness and purpose that the SNP projects, and that their own political parties have so dismally failed to provide -- even if they don\u2019t like the SNP's particular, separatist purpose one bit.\" Bloomberg View.\n\nBritain's future is at stake. \"Future historians may prefer to recall the existential questions that accumulated in the campaign, little-noticed, like toxic mercury in a dolphin\u2019s liver. Who wants to be British? What is Britain for? They will certainly marvel at a massacre of Scottish unionist MPs at the hands of the separatist Scottish National Party (SNP) which, assuming the polls are even half-right, is about to leave Britain\u2019s 300-year-old, once swaggeringly successful, union of nations looking desperately enfeebled. Politicians on all sides are talking on that theme but, a week before a general election, with such fevered partiality that the real issue of Britain\u2019s future is being warped or ignored.\" The Economist.\n\n2. Top opinions\n\nMATTHEWS: Rep. Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) rhetoric on poverty doesn't match his policies. \"Some of his ideas on the topic are worthwhile \u2014 he's right that the Earned Income Tax Credit needs to be increased \u2014 and the fact that a major national politician has taken an interest in the topic at all is a cheering development. But for all Ryan's rhetoric on poverty, he's also the author of a series of budgets that would absolutely wreck programs for the American poor, inflicting massive human suffering on the nation's most vulnerable residents. ... It's the budget of someone who wants a smaller government, a lower deficit, no new taxes, and a gigantic army and has decided to make all those other promises work out by massively cutting programs for the poor. The simple fact of Ryan's budgets is that they prove he doesn't take poverty all that seriously, at least not when it collides with his other budgetary promises.\" Vox.\n\nBOUIE: Hillary Rodham Clinton's speech on immigration changes the race. \"On Tuesday, speaking to a group of DREAMers\u2014unauthorized kids brought to the country as children\u2014at a Nevada high school, she gave the same full-throated support to comprehensive immigration reform, going beyond President Obama\u2014and activist expectations\u2014to endorse changes to the immigration detention system, a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants, protections for children brought to the country illegally, and an expansion of the president\u2019s executive order, meant to keep millions of unauthorized immigrants from deportation and give millions more the right to apply for work permits and other documentation. ... Clinton is already well-positioned with Latino voters. By tacking to the left of the president\u2014and essentially giving immigration activists their core demands\u2014she moves closer to rebuilding the coalition that elected Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.\" Slate.\n\nYORK: How will the GOP field respond? \"Rather than quickly condemn Clinton's new position, the two leading Republican presidential candidates most associated with immigration reform \u2014 Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio \u2014 said nothing at all about it... Clinton's move has made a big problem even bigger for Bush, Rubio, and the entire Republican Party. ... Her new position effectively trumps all other immigration reform offers on the table. Her message to Hispanic voters is: No Republican \u2014 not Jeb, not Marco, not anybody \u2014 will offer you as much as I will. The Republican response is unclear. Can Bush and Rubio say they share Clinton's goal of citizenship for millions of currently illegal immigrants but disagree with her way of getting there? That's not terribly strong. Do they stick with the 'legal status' that Clinton characterizes as 'second-class status'?\" The Washington Examiner.\n\nClinton has the right policies. \"A shot at citizenship is the only proper goal of sensible immigration reform. But even under the most generous and ambitious proposals, immigrants won\u2019t be able to reach that goal for years, if ever. Creating a citizenship path requires Congress to pass a bill, and there\u2019s no sign when that will happen. ... There is a pressing need to lift the burden of fear and separation from families, to unshackle workers who are chained to exploitive jobs by fear of deportation. Mrs. Clinton has shown that she understands this. But meanwhile, the Republicans are stuck in the early 2000s, still talking of border security and illegal invaders,\" observes the editorial board of The New York Times.\n\n3. In case you missed it\n\nIf the Supreme Court strikes down Obamacare, Republicans might keep it around. \"Three top Republicans told Bloomberg on Tuesday they are preparing a legislative response in case their party gets what it is wishing for: A Supreme Court ruling that would eviscerate a central tenet of President Barack Obama's health care law by declaring tax credits on the federal exchange illegal. While such a ruling would represent a political victory for Republicans who have contended that Obama's signature legislative initiative is an overreach, some party leaders acknowledge that the real-life consequences could make it a Pyrrhic one. Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Senate Republicans were 'close to a consensus' that would 'not leave 6 or 7 million Americans in the lurch' if they lose their insurance tax credits.\" Sahil Kapur for Bloomberg.\n\nWhere the poor can get where they're going, they can get ahead. \"In a large, continuing study of upward mobility based at Harvard, commuting time has emerged as the single strongest factor in the odds of escaping poverty. The longer an average commute in a given county, the worse the chances of low-income families there moving up the ladder. The impact of transportation on social mobility is stronger than several other factors, like crime, elementary-school test scores or the percentage of two-parent families in a community, said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and one of the researchers on the study.\" Mikayla Bouchard in The New York Times.\n\nO'BRIEN: Janet Yellen suggests stocks are overvalued. \"Markets, though, shrugged off this concern. The Standard & Poor's 500 was only down 0.78 percent on the day. ... After the housing market's collapse nearly brought the entire global economy with it, the Fed realized that it couldn't blithely assume it could ignore what was going on and just clean up any financial mess. It'd have to do what it could\u2014either talking down markets or regulating them or both\u2014to keep the financial system safe without sacrificing the economy. ... Sure, stock prices are elevated, but so are earnings. And really, where else are you going to put your money? Bank accounts barely offer any interest, and bonds are about as pricey as they could possibly be.\" The Washington Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "British voters still trust Prime Minister David Cameron on the economy.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/max.ehrenfreund", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "British voters still trust Prime Minister David Cameron on the economy.", "title": "Austerity makes a last stand at the British polls", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/07/wonkbook-austerity-makes-a-last-stand-at-the-british-polls/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2014-07-23/Reuters/2014-07-23T165141Z_01_SLP106_RTRIDSP_3_BRITAIN-BUSINESS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@MaxEhrenfreund"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/07/wonkbook-austerity-makes-a-last-stand-at-the-british-polls/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "David Cameron, Ed Miliband", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/max.ehrenfreund"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "David Cameron, Ed Miliband"}, "article_summary": "At the polls in Thursday's general election, we'll find out to what degree British voters find that account persuasive.\nHardly anyone, that is, except the coalition that still rules Britain \u2013 and most of the British media.\nTop story: Britain goes to the pollsBritain hasn't had an election quite like this one in a while.\nBritain's Prime Minister David Cameron speaks at the Commonwealth Games Business Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in this July 2014 photo.\n\"The Scottish National Party looks set to deliver a huge shock to the British political system."}
