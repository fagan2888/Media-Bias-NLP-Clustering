Bill Walker on Thursday announced his intentions to expand Medicaid in the state under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Independent governor sent a letter to the Republican-controlled legislature informing them of his plan to offer expanded benefits beginning Sept. 1. The state legislature has twice quashed Walker's attempts to pass a bill granting the benefits.\n\nHe said even if a legislature committee rejects his proposal, he said he has the statutory authority to move forward with it.\n\nThe ACA, or Obamacare, provided additional federal funding to states to expand Medicaid funding programs. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama encouraged all states that haven't expanded Medicaid to do so, saying it could insure 4 million more people in 22 states.\n\n\"Alaska and Alaskans cannot wait any longer,\" Walker said at a news conference Thursday. \"We're not going to step away from this opportunity to help fellow Alaskans, period.\"\n\nUnder the ACA, the federal government covers 100 percent of the cost of Medicaid expansion through 2016, at which point the state must contribute up to 10 percent.\n\n\"We'll play that hand when it's dealt to us,\" Walker said. \"I can't deny benefits to Alaskans today because we're not sure about that 10 percent,\" he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alaskan Gov.
