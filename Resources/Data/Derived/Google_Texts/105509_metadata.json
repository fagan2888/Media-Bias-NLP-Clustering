They hope it will contain the medical histories of 9 million insured members \u2013 about a quarter of California\u2019s population \u2013 by the time it goes live at the end of this year.\n\n\n\nThe two insurers will invest $80 million to get the exchange off the ground and keep it running for the first three years.\n\n\n\nTheir announcement quickly raised concerns about the privacy of medical data. Consumer groups questioned whether patients\u2019 interests would be sufficiently aired in an organization founded by private-sector insurance companies with the collaboration of hospitals and big health systems.\n\n\n\nThose who don\u2019t want their records in the database will be able to opt out.\n\n\n\nProponents say the exchange, which might be the largest such effort among hundreds in the United States, can improve the quality of care and reduce health costs by avoiding duplicate lab tests, preventing adverse drug interactions and quickly alerting doctors or nurses who are seeing a patient for the first time to any conditions or prior surgeries they need to know about.\n\n\n\nIt might even save lives if ER doctors, dealing with unconscious patients, are able to pull up such information immediately and make better-informed treatment decisions.\n\n\n\nAnd it puts California front and center in the growing trends towards digitized records and integrated care, which are an important part of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think this could really be a milestone moment for health care in the U.S., simply because of the scale of the collaboration,\u201d said Jennifer Covich Bordenick, CEO of Washington, D.C.-based eHealth Initiative, a nonprofit organization that conducts an annual survey of more than 300 health information exchanges nationwide.\n\n\n\nAnthem, Blue Shield and medical providers collaborating with them hope Cal Index will ultimately attract all health plans, hospitals and medical groups in the state. It could hold the medical records of all Californians who don\u2019t choose to be excluded.\n\n\n\n\u201cUltimately our goal is to have all payers and all providers participate and truly make it a utility for the health industry in the state,\u201d said Paul Markovich, CEO of Blue Shield.\n\n\n\nSome observers questioned whether Cal Index can succeed when so many other attempts to create such information exchanges \u2013 including one in California known as Cal eConnect \u2013 have failed.\n\n\n\nAbout a dozen regional information exchanges exist in California. Kaiser Permanente has its own system that contains the records of its more than 9 million members statewide. But hospitals and physician groups, especially ones that compete with each other, have traditionally resisted sharing information, which has resulted in a fragmented patchwork of health information.\n\n\n\nKaiser declined to comment on whether it would join Cal Index. Health Net, another major insurer, \u201cthinks it\u2019s a good idea, and we are always open to evaluating good ideas,\u201d said spokesman Brad Kieffer.\n\n\n\nThe new exchange is certain to face resistance from privacy advocates, who fret about the darker possibilities associated with putting so much intimate personal information out there. The same day as the announcement, the New York Times reported that a Russian gang had gained access to 1.2 billion Internet passwords.
