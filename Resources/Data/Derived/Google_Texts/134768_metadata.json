(Photo: Daily Herald Media)Buy Photo\n\nThom Field was originally known as Wausau Schools Athletic Field, which was 14 acres of a swampy bog. Walter Thom was instrumental in the creation of Thom Field, so that\u2019s how it got the name. The land was purchased to stay as an athletic field.\n\nI live right by Thom Field, and it was a great area to be raised in when I was a child and a great place to raise our two daughters, Jennifer and Rebecca. I am very upset at the way the Wausau School District has been maintaining Thom Field.\n\nMany years ago, the track was taken out around the football field, then the playground was taken out and now it is a parking lot for buses and officials. The lights were taken out around the softball diamond, which was also used as an ice skating rink during the winter. The tennis courts are now being used as a parking lot. The last thing was that they are not mowing the east side of Thom Field on a regular basis.\n\nI called the Wausau School District and complained. I was told that since the Wausau School District no longer uses that side of the field, that in order to save money they were not mowing all the time.\n\nThe community does use the field for various activities. Does the community not count? I thought that both the Wausau School District and the city of Wausau emphasized getting moving and doing things together as a family. That was being done when the grass was shorter.\n\nI called my City Council representative and complained that I thought the city of Wausau had an ordinance about how high grass could be, that being no more than one foot high \u2014 and last week, the grass was more than a foot high. The day after I complained, the district was mowing the grass with big mowers. I should have been careful what I wished for, because then the cut grass was left in big clumps and still no one could have used the field for anything.\n\nThis week, the field was maintained and the grass was carefully cut. I saw a crew of six or seven workers using heavy-duty mowers. If this is a money issue, how much money does the district save if they eventually need a large crew to cut the grass? And if this maintenance was only done in response to an event, then should we expect to see long grass any time there is no scheduled event?\n\nShame on you, Wausau School District!\n\nPeggy Olbrantz lives on Wausau\u2019s east side.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1MKwkxw", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Wausau School District should keep this space accessible to all.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "The Wausau School District should keep this space accessible to all.", "title": "Keep Thom Field grass looking nice", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/07/23/keep-thom-field-grass-looking-nice/30567439/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Wausau School District should keep this space accessible to all.", "title": "Keep Thom Field grass looking nice", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/194e90be92ffa7897c9c610cf421575afebc8f8d/c=160-0-1120-960&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/23/Wausau/B9318190391Z.1_20150723115938_000_GKRBE6MUH.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@wausauherald", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Walter Thom was instrumental in the creation of Thom Field, so that\u2019s how it got the name.\nI am very upset at the way the Wausau School District has been maintaining Thom Field.\nBuy Photo The grass at Thom Field in Wausau was well-manicured this week, but for much of the summer the area had become overgrown.\nThe last thing was that they are not mowing the east side of Thom Field on a regular basis.\nI thought that both the Wausau School District and the city of Wausau emphasized getting moving and doing things together as a family."}
