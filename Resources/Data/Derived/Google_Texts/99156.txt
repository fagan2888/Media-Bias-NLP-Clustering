"Space Camp to learn English? By that standard doing almost anything in an English speaking country like the U.S. must qualify. Why not a trip to an amusement park?" Paul's report read.

ADVERTISEMENT Paul, who is running for president, pointed to a grant offered by the State Department — and announced through the U.S. embassy in Pakistan — that would allow "non-elite" Pakistani kids between the age of 13 and 18 enrolled in an English-language program to come to the United States for a two-week trip. The trip would involve visiting NASA's Space Camp and then traveling to Washington, D.C.

The program was estimated to get $250,000 in funding.

The Kentucky Republican targeted the program as part of his "waste report," which Paul uses to highlight what he views as wasteful government spending.

The program, according to the State Department's announcement, was meant to teach leadership skills, improve an understanding of the United States and "promote the development of English language, social, and analytical skills of the participants, through first-hand experiences in science and technology."
