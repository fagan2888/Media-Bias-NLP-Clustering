The president took the issue up on Thursday with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, while Vice President Joe Biden was in Guatemala on Friday to discuss the problem with Central American leaders.\n\n\"You\u2019re clearly not going to send a child back to a circumstance where there is no one there for them,\" Biden said. \"But we do intend, and everyone agreed, it is necessary to put them back in the hands of a parent in the country from which they came.\"\n\nCecilia Munoz, the White House domestic policy director, said that some of Friday's measures were designed to help Central American countries stem the migration.\n\nRelated: Immigration Reform: A Lot of Work for Nothing?\n\nEfforts aim to \"deal with the misinformation that is being deliberately planted by criminal organizations, by smuggling networks, about what people can expect when they come to the United States,\" she told reporters.\n\nFrom October to June 15, 52,000 unaccompanied children arrived on the U.S. border with Mexico, Mayorkas said. DHS is looking for more facilities to house the minors, he said.\n\nRepublicans blame the influx of children on Obama's 2012 decision to give temporary relief from deportation to some young people brought to the United States illegally by their parents.\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker John Boehner urged Obama on Friday to deploy the National Guard to handle the children and relieve the taxed Border Patrol. The White House's Earnest rejected that idea, saying there are already \"significant enforcement resources\" deployed along the border.\n\nDemocratic Congressman Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez further criticized the National Guard idea as \"a na\u00efve and aggressive knee-jerk reaction that is completely inappropriate in these circumstances.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The White House on Friday stepped up efforts to slow the flow of illegal children into", "title": "Obama Pledges Millions to Fix Security in Central America", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/22/Obama-Pledges-Millions-Fix-Security-Central-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/04172014_Obama_Podium.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/22/Obama-Pledges-Millions-Fix-Security-Central-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/04172014_Obama_Podium.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The White House on Friday stepped up efforts to slow the flow of illegal children into", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa7d\"", "article_summary": "Cecilia Munoz, the White House domestic policy director, said that some of Friday's measures were designed to help Central American countries stem the migration.\nWashington has scrambled to address a flood of children arriving illegally at the border causing President Barack Obama has called an urgent humanitarian crisis.\nHouse of Representatives Speaker John Boehner urged Obama on Friday to deploy the National Guard to handle the children and relieve the taxed Border Patrol.\nThe White House's Earnest rejected that idea, saying there are already \"significant enforcement resources\" deployed along the border.\n\"We are surging resources to increase our capacity to detain individuals and adults with children, and to handle immigration court hearings,\" Homeland Security Deputy Director Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters."}
