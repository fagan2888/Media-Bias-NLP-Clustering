the Political Grapevine\u2026\n\nHeard it on the Grapevine\n\nAnonymous quotes can serve the useful purpose of allowing a person to be honest without fearing retribution.\n\nIn a Washington Post article about Hillary Clinton's leadership style -- the reporter quotes a former aide.\n\n\"She's not a paranoid person -- I don't think -- but she wants some paranoid people around her.\"\n\nThen adds the caveat --\n\n\"Who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of Clinton's distaste for those who speak to reporters when not authorized to do so.\"\n\nOne writer at the Washington Free Beacon quipped --\n\n\"She's not paranoid -- but for the love of god don't tell her I said that.\"\n\nWatching the Clock\n\nIn the next few weeks -- the Supreme Court will decide whether ObamaCare tax credits can be given out through federal exchanges.\n\nThe law explicitly says they can only be awarded through marketplaces -- quote -- established by the state.\n\nThe New York Times interviewed two dozen writers of the law -- who called the clause things like a drafting error -- and an oversight.\n\nAll quotes -- said the federal exchange credits should be upheld.\n\nNotably not quoted the infamous Jonathan Gruber -- the health care adviser who was paid nearly $300,000 dollars by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHe said something very different.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJanuary 18, 2012\n\nGruber: What's important to remember politically about this is if you're a state and you don't set up an exchange, that means your citizens don't get their tax credits.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nThe National Review noted Gruber's absence.\n\n\"Pretending he isn't there -- won't make him go away.\"\n\nPretty in Pink\n\nFinally -- in Wisconsin -- pink could be the new orange.\n\nAt lease for hunting.\n\nA bipartisan group of legislators is preparing a bill to legalize blaze pink for hunters.\n\nCurrently -- state law mandates that blaze orange make up the majority of above-the-waist clothing -- for safety reasons.\n\nThe new color option would be aimed at boosting the number of women hunters.\n\nThere are differing opinions about whether the pink can be as easily seen as the orange -- and whether it would make any difference in recruiting female hunters anyway.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "SHOWS/Special Report", "dcterms.modified":
