Take a look:\n\nAffordable Care Act: Tracking of Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund Costs Could Be Improved \u2026The IRS did not track all costs associated with implementation of the ACA including costs not charged to the HIRIF. Specifically, the IRS did not account for or attempt to quantify approximately $67 million of indirect ACA costs incurred for Fiscal Years 2010 through 2012. Indirect costs include, for example, providing employees with workspace and information technology support. The IRS established a methodology to track ACA costs in its accounting records. However, the IRS accounted for only direct costs, such as labor and contract costs, because it did not believe that indirect costs should be recovered from the HIRIF\u2026 \u2026By not also identifying and tracking indirect costs, the IRS lacks complete information regarding the full cost of ACA implementation. This lack of complete information on ACA implementation costs limits the IRS\u2019s ability to accurately report to stakeholders the total resources it applied to the ACA implementation and fully estimate the resources needed in the future for this effort.\n\nThis is just the beginning. If the IRS managed to mishandle $67 million during the preparation process, what\u2019s going to happen when the agency is responsible for overseeing the new Obamacare tax regulations that affect every American citizen?\n\nThe political targeting of charity groups by supposedly \u2018non-partisan,\u2019 IRS officials was hard enough to stomach, but the idea that these same officials are going to be in charge of financing national health care services is nothing short of a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe missing $67 million is going to be pocket-change in comparison to how much Obamacare will cost in the long run. But in this economy, most Americans can\u2019t spare their pocket change, let alone $67 million worth of taxed income.\n\nWhich begs the question, yet again: Who assumed the IRS was more capable than you to oversee your health finances?", "article_metadata": {"description": "From the government body that brought you Tea Party Takedown and Lois Lerner Lies comes yet another scandal that illustrates the sheer incompetence and corruption of our unaccountable government..05/24/2016 6:21:20AM EST.", "author": "Kate Andrews", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "From the government body that brought you Tea Party Takedown and Lois Lerner Lies comes yet another scandal that illustrates the sheer incompetence and corruption of our unaccountable government.", "title": "Kate Andrews - $67 Million of Obamacare Funds Allocated to IRS Are 'Missing'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kateandrews/2013/09/27/67-million-of-obamacare-funds-allocated-to-irs-missing-n1710440", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/144/4022e858-9785-4a6c-a027-6333f63ed529.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "From the government body that brought you Tea Party Takedown and Lois Lerner Lies comes yet another scandal that illustrates the sheer incompetence and corruption of our unaccountable government.", "title": "Kate Andrews - $67 Million of Obamacare Funds Allocated to IRS Are 'Missing'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kateandrews/2013/09/27/67-million-of-obamacare-funds-allocated-to-irs-missing-n1710440", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/144/4022e858-9785-4a6c-a027-6333f63ed529.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "$67 Million of Obamacare Funds Allocated to IRS Are 'Missing' , Kate Andrews, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda89d\"", "article_summary": "The missing $67 million is going to be pocket-change in comparison to how much Obamacare will cost in the long run.\nBut in this economy, most Americans can\u2019t spare their pocket change, let alone $67 million worth of taxed income.\nSpecifically, the IRS did not account for or attempt to quantify approximately $67 million of indirect ACA costs incurred for Fiscal Years 2010 through 2012.\n$67 million allocated to an IRS slush fund for the purpose of rolling out Obamacare is unaccounted for, according to a report issued by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.\nIf the IRS managed to mishandle $67 million during the preparation process, what\u2019s going to happen when the agency is responsible for overseeing the new Obamacare tax regulations that affect every American citizen?"}
