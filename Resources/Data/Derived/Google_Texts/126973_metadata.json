Nickless Volunteer Clinic looks a lot like any other doctor's office. People quietly fidget while watching an episode of Family Feud, kids present challenges to their parents, and patients regularly shuffle in and out of the office for a moment with the doctor.\n\nThere's one key difference: none of these patients are well-insured.\n\nBay City resident Mike Arnold was among a small group of people waiting at the clinic on the evening of Wednesday, April 2, suffering from a sinus infection just two months after moving from Arizona to Bay City. Usually, he said, he just tries to \"Dayquil or Nyquil it\" if his symptoms aren't severe. Now, though, he found himself at the clinic for the first time, seeking his first professional treatment in nine years.\n\n\"It's pretty much the only place I've got to go,\" he said.\n\n\n\nA decade of service\n\n\n\nClinic history and facts 2003 \u2013 Administrators at McLaren Bay Region hospital commit to open a clinic for the locally underinsured. 2004 \u2013 The Bay Area Volunteer Clinic opens. 2005 \u2013 After a significant fundraising campaign raises $4 million dollars, with a large donation from the Nickless family, the clinic is renamed the Helen M. Nickless Volunteer Clinic. 2005 \u2013 Average weekly clinic attendance is roughly 36 patients. 2006 \u2013 Space for dental services offered at Delta College and the Bay Arenac ISD Career Center provides for dental care. 2006 \u2013 Bay County Health Department offers space for women's health screenings. 2009 \u2013 As a result of the large demand, the clinic begins only accepting new patients from Bay County. 2008 \u2013 Mental health counseling added to clinic's Wednesday evening services. 2011 \u2013 Average weekly clinic attendance grows to 50 patients. 2013 \u2013 Average weekly clinic attendance drops to 41 patients as more than 200 patients move to an insurance program offered by the Bay Health Plan. 2014 \u2013 Clinic celebrates 10th anniversary with gala celebration planned for Friday, April 11, at the Doubletree hotel and conference center in downtown Bay City. Source: Helen M. Nickless Volunteer Clinic\n\nThe Nickless Clinic, located at 1460 W. Center Ave. in Hampton Township, turned 10 years old on Monday, March 31, marking a decade since the group opened its doors to people like Arnold in 2004. Since then, the clinic has strived to serve the uninsured and underinsured, marshaling resources to help patients see primary care physicians and specialists alike, receiving x-rays to lab work, all for free.\n\n\n\nToday, the clinic is open Wednesday evenings until every patient is served, with sign-in open from 4-6:30 p.m. Patients with chronic problems are seen on Wednesday afternoons.\n\n\"It is a big milestone,\" said Dr. Floyd Stevens, medical director at the clinic. \"We were discouraged by some very high-standing people in the beginning who said there was no need for it, that we were creating a need for it by being there. They were saying we had no people living under bridges, we had no people in desperate need. But those weren't the people we were trying to serve \u2014 we were trying to serve those who had no insurance and didn't qualify for insurance.\"\n\nThe clinic is marking the occasion with a 10-Year Clinic Gala, an event recognizing volunteers, both medical and clerical, scheduled for 6 p.m. on Friday, April 11, at the Doubletree hotel and conference center in downtown Bay City. A buffet dinner is scheduled for 7 p.m., with a celebration, featuring words from Alice Gerard, president and CEO of McLaren Bay Region hospital.\n\nTickets are $50 each, available by calling the McLaren Bay Medical Foundation, the clinic's financial supporter, at 989-895-4727. Tickets also are available at the door.\n\nProceeds benefit the Nickless Clinic, which has an annual operating budget of $250,000.\n\nAmong the clinic's volunteers is Alice Cornejo, who has been with the clinic for much of its existence.\n\n\"I love it,\" she said, sitting behind the clinic's front desk. \"I love it. To me, the charts aren't charts, they're people. It's not just a piece of paper.\" In particular, Cornejo remembers what it was like to see the need in the community when she first joined years ago.\n\n\"To think that there were so many young kids, young people, or older, that were working two jobs or three jobs and couldn't afford a doctor,\" she said. \"I used to do intake, when a patient comes back and you interview them. I did that for six months, and then I told (the clinic manager) I couldn't do it. She said, 'Why?' I said, 'I feel like crying.' \"\n\n\n\nHumble beginnings\n\n\n\nStevens has served as medical director of the clinic since its earliest days. He said he recalls the discussion beginning to coalesce around the project 15 years ago.\n\n\"The idea was actually proposed back in '99,\" Stevens said. \"It seemed like there were more patients being seen in the emergency rooms and the residency clinics that were unable to afford it more than we had ever noticed before.\"\n\nThe idea lacked funding in 1999, though, and it waited years until groups around the community put their weight behind it, finally launching in 2004. Within the next several years, the group was renamed in memory of Helen M. Nickless, after her family made substantial financial contributions to the clinic.\n\n\n\nStevens said starting the clinic was intimidating \u2014 \"fear and trepidation\" was the phrase he used.\n\n\"We were fearful,\" he said. \"Either No. 1, are we interpreting (need) correctly, or No. 2, are we going to be able to meet the needs? Because the needs included things like medication, laboratory, x-rays, connecting people with places they can get ongoing care. We didn't want to just be a Band-Aid clinic and then step back. We were creating the concept at the same time we were furnishing care.\"\n\nIn the years following the clinic's opening, the group saw a strong response, with as many as 90 patients visiting the clinic one evening. Because the clinic serves everyone who visits, that can mean keeping the office running until 1 a.m., Stevens said. In 2009, the clinic limited its coverage area to Bay County to cope with demand.\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act and beyond\n\n\n\nThough Stevens said that changes to healthcare law, including the Affordable Care Act, have decreased the number of patients seeking care, he doesn't think the need for care will go away.\n\n\"We see that the numbers of patients that we have to take care of has gone down,\" he said. \"But the number of patients that still contact us for information is very, very high.\" Stevens added that 15 to 20 percent of patients they see every week are new to the clinic. \"I think there's always going to be people who fall through the cracks, but I think that number will diminish.\"\n\nJoyce Hardy, a longtime nurse and the manager of the clinic, noted that Medicaid expansion taking effect in Michigan this month likely will decrease the number of people using the clinic.\n\n\n\n\"That's a lot more affordable,\" she said, noting that many of the clinic's patients aren't welfare recipients. \"Most of the people who come to the clinic are people who work but can't afford health insurance.\"\n\nHardy also said the Affordable Care Act will take some time to be implemented, especially with confusion surrounding the law. Additionally, she said that even when it is implemented, large deductibles may still make a number of individuals eligible for the Nickless Clinic's care.\n\n\n\nCindy Charters of Essexville came the clinic for the first time on April 2. She placed a call to the staffers at the healthcare.gov website before the insurance exchange closed on March 31, and now she's waiting for a call from government officials to help sign her up. In the meantime, though, she still needs care.\n\n\"I could get (insurance) through work, but they don't pay anything and I can't afford what they offer,\" she said.\n\nKimberly Knapp, another patient, said she's been unemployed since the summer of 2013. The Nickless Clinic is a place she has come to rely on, since plans offered through the Affordable Care Act are too expensive for her, she said.\n\nKnapp said she's been coming to the clinic for about eight years.\n\n\"Pretty much everything I've needed I've come here for,\" she said.\n\nHardy said that as of October 2013, the Nickless Clinic had seen about 7,500 patients, resulting in about 23,000 visits.\n\nIn 2013, a total of 2,000 visits were made to the clinic, down from 2,400 in 2012.\n\nWhen asked if the clinic will still be around 10 years from now, Stevens said, \u201dThe intent was to create a clinic to meet peoples\u2019 needs. If there are no needs, we\u2019ll close our doors.\n\n\"Right now, we have enough money to keep on going, and we have enough interest to keep on working.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sam Easter is a general assignment reporter for The Bay City Times.
