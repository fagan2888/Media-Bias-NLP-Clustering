The Daily Signal revealed those concerns in a story yesterday.\n\nSlavitt, a former OptumInsight/QSSI group vice president, left the company last month to work as the principal deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs Obamacare and HealthCare.gov. His post makes him the No. 2 at the agency under CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner.\n\n>>> Company That \u2018Saved\u2019 HealthCare.gov Faces Questions of Cronyism\n\nThe former Optum executive gave the maximum campaign contributions allowed to President Obama\u2019s Victory Fund and Obama for America\u2014now Organizing for Action\u2014in 2012, federal campaign records show.\n\nAccording to the ethics waiver, issued July 11 by the Department of Health and Human Services and posted publicly last week, Slavitt will be able to begin working on matters involving his former company, OptumInsight/QSSI.\n\nWithout a waiver, Slavitt would have had to wait at least one year before participating in work that involves his former employer.\n\nThe letter states that Slavitt severed financial ties with OptumInsight/QSSI upon his hiring at CMS, and upon doing so will be \u201cempowered to participate fully in particular matters of general applicability, such as regulation and policy determinations, that affect the healthcare-related industries in which your former employer operates.\u201d\n\nSlavitt is also able to participate in meetings with OptumInsight/QSSI personnel to discuss \u201ctechnical issues or progress on existing contracts\u201d and can \u201cweigh in on or make decisions on policy matters or technical direction that would result in the necessity of [OptumInsight/QSSI] having to perform additional compensated work under existing contracts to implement health care reform under the ACA.\u201d\n\n>>> This Circuit Court\u2019s Obamacare Decision Could Have Huge Consequences\n\nIn the waiver, Edgar Swindell, associate general counsel for ethics at HHS, praised Slavitt for his work in the health care industry. He wrote:\n\nThe information provided to me indicates that you bring an exceptional blend of managerial experience, health care industry acumen, and hands-on experience from working for the systems integrator for healthcare.gov, Optum.\n\nHans von Spakovsky, a legal scholar at The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, told The Daily Signal ethics waivers are unusual. He continued:\n\nIt\u2019s not a good idea to waive those kinds of potential conflicts of interest. This very case shows why it\u2019s not a very good idea. \u2026 The person is going to have divided loyalties.\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Signal, Aaron Albright, spokesman for CMS, said:\n\nAndy Slavitt has taken all appropriate steps, such as severing financial ties with his former employer, which allow him to execute his duties as principal deputy and participate in broad policy matters, including those affecting the health care industry. He will be recused, as appropriate, from participation in specific party matters, such as contracts or claims, involving his former employer. However, the terms of the limited waiver ensure that Andy will be able to continue to interact with all of the contractors as needed so the Marketplaces will be ready to enroll millions more Americans into quality, affordable coverage.\n\nOptumInsight/QSSI is the sister company of UnitedHealthcare, which offers health insurance plans on a variety of state-run exchanges and plans to expand into the federal exchange run by HealthCare.gov. Both are owned by UnitedHealthGroup.\n\nUnitedHealth purchased QSSI in September 2012. Before its acquisition, QSSI was tasked with building the federal data hub, which connects multiple government agencies to streamline verification of consumer information when Americans log into the federal and state exchanges and apply for Obamacare subsidies.\n\nThe company, now operating as OptumInsight/QSSI, was then tasked with saving HealthCare.gov after its disastrous implementation in October. HHS issued a new contract with OptumInsight/QSSI in January solidifying the tech company\u2019s role as a \u201csenior advisor.\u201d\n\nSlavitt\u2019s new high-ranking post at CMS as well as OptumInsight/QSSI\u2019s participation with HealthCare.gov has raised red flags for Republican lawmakers, who believe both circumstances present conflicts of interest. Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, sent letters to CMS\u2019 Tavenner and UnitedHealth chief executive Stephen Hemsley seeking answers to several questions about \u201cany conflicts of interest\u201d between UnitedHealthcare and OptumInsight/QSSI.\n\nNeither CMS nor UnitedHealth responded to the senators\u2019 inquiries.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Andrew Slavitt was granted an ethics waiver by the Department of Health and Human Services to begin working with his former company immediately.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Andrew Slavitt was granted an ethics waiver by the Department of Health and Human Services to begin working with his former company immediately.", "title": "Obamacare Official Given Government Ethics Waiver", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140722_SlavittWaiver_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-22T22:57:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1p8BINO"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Andrew Slavitt was granted an ethics waiver by the Department of Health and Human Services to begin working with his former company immediately.", "title": "Obamacare Official Given Government Ethics Waiver", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140722_SlavittWaiver_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "cronyism,obamacare", "published_time": "2014-07-23T03:01:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-22T22:57:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Andrew Slavitt, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, HealthCare.gov, Department of Health and Human Services, Marilyn Tavenner, OptumInsight/QSSI, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealthGroup, Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe20be\"", "article_summary": "Without a waiver, Slavitt would have had to wait at least one year before participating in work that involves his former employer.\nAccording to the ethics waiver, issued July 11 by the Department of Health and Human Services and posted publicly last week, Slavitt will be able to begin working on matters involving his former company, OptumInsight/QSSI.\nThe waiver was granted despite Republican lawmakers\u2019 concerns about Slavitt\u2019s potential conflict of interest.\nSlavitt, a former OptumInsight/QSSI group vice president, left the company last month to work as the principal deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs Obamacare and HealthCare.gov.\nThe company, now operating as OptumInsight/QSSI, was then tasked with saving HealthCare.gov after its disastrous implementation in October."}
