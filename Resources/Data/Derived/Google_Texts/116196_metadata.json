It\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d said Joel White, president of the Council for Affordable Coverage.\n\nThe group, which counts major insurer Aetna and seniors advocacy group AARP among its members, said it hopes to join a growing effort on Capitol Hill to make claims data widely accessible, particularly to the analysts who crunch the data and drive changes in the marketplace.\n\nData are a big part of Obamacare, with analysts saying more information means better choices. But there\u2019s also a danger of consumers being overwhelmed, particularly by data they may not have the knowledge to evaluate.\n\nThe Obama administration in 2013 released data on what various hospitals charge Medicare for common services, exposing major differences. For example, a hospital in New Jersey charged $30,000 less to implant a pacemaker than one about 20 miles away, and there was an ever greater price gap for gall bladder surgery between two Florida hospitals down the road from each other, a New York Times analysis found at the time.\n\nConsumer advocates cheered the release, and said more is needed \u2014 but prying the data loose could be difficult, with the Clear Choices coalition saying that securing reliable price information from hospitals remains a Kafkaesque endeavor.\n\nChristine Riedl, chief of Aetna\u2019s product strategy, showed off a Web tool Thursday that lets policy holders simulate a claim, providing them a heads-up on their potential costs.\n\nBeyond prices, advocates said consumers should be able to rate doctors and other health care providers, even if some bitter customers will give unfair reviews.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like TripAdvisor. You\u2019ve got to take it all with a grain of salt, but this is the world we live in now, and consumers want this information,\u201d said Sally Greenberg, executive director of the National Consumers League.\n\nThe coalition also said consumers can\u2019t always figure out the financial links between providers, leaving patients to wonder whether they are being referred to a practitioner out of concern for their care or to pad a doctor\u2019s pocket.\n\nAnd they said Obamacare\u2019s insurance portals could do a better job of detailing which plans cover specific drugs, and whether users will still be able to see their regular doctor.\n\nMr. White, a former Republican Hill staffer, said the climate around health care may be frosty because of Obamacare, but there\u2019s still room for agreement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s figuring out that sweet spot where Republicans and Democrats can come together,\u201d he said, \u201cand then convincing leadership it\u2019s not going to blow up the floor when you move the bill.\u201d\n\nIn response, the Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday it already is making the insurance marketplace more user-friendly by making it easier to compare plans and linking to directories that let users see which doctors are in a plan\u2019s network.\n\nKelly Brantley, a senior manager at Avalere Health, a Washington-based consultancy, said the HealthCare.gov website is more user-friendly this year than it was in its first go-around last year, but it remains to be seen if consumers can find the right plans for their needs.\n\n\u201cThat matching process,\u201d she said, \u201cis the key to the success of this whole endeavor.\u201d\n\nThe coalition said it expects Congress to take a small step toward more transparency if it passes a Medicare payment overhaul bill that cleared the House last month and will hit the Senate floor next week. The bill would allow academics, known as \u201cqualified entities,\u201d to study Medicaid claims data and figure out which procedures work best for patients.\n\n\u201cFreeing that data,\u201d the coalition said, \u201ccould empower us to save trillions and improve care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Insurers, a tech company and advocacy groups banded together Thursday to demand that Obamacare provide better data to consumers on price and quality, saying it's easier to compare hotel rooms than it is to choose between health care plans.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Insurers, a tech company and advocacy groups banded together Thursday to demand that Obamacare provide better data to consumers on price and quality, saying it\u2019s easier to compare hotel rooms than it is to choose between health care plans.", "title": "Health care coalition demands better data from Obamacare", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/9/health-care-coalition-demands-better-data-from-oba/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/15/heath-overhauljpeg-01c56.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/15/heath-overhauljpeg-01c56.jpg", "description": "Insurers, a tech company and advocacy groups banded together Thursday to demand that Obamacare provide better data to consumers on price and quality, saying it's easier to compare hotel rooms than it", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Health care coalition demands better data from Obamacare"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Joel White"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ca5\"", "article_summary": "Mr. White, a former Republican Hill staffer, said the climate around health care may be frosty because of Obamacare, but there\u2019s still room for agreement.\n\u201cFreeing that data,\u201d the coalition said, \u201ccould empower us to save trillions and improve care.\u201d\nBeyond prices, advocates said consumers should be able to rate doctors and other health care providers, even if some bitter customers will give unfair reviews.\nInsurers, a tech company and advocacy groups banded together Thursday to demand that Obamacare provide better data to consumers on price and quality, saying it\u2019s easier to compare hotel rooms than it is to choose between health care plans.\nData are a big part of Obamacare, with analysts saying more information means better choices."}
