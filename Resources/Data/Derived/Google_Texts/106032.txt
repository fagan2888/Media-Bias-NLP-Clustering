A 42-year-old man who skied out of bounds Friday at Durango Mountain Resort at Purgatory was found Saturday in a remote part of Hermosa Creek drainage.

Members of the La Plata County Search and Rescue discovered Alex Magennis, a former Durango resident who lives in Cincinnati, during a snowstorm. Magennis had texted his wife Friday afternoon to say he skied into an out-of-bounds area near Lift 8 and planned to continue skiing east to an area known as Needles.

Officials said he was cold and exhausted when found but didnâ€™t report any injuries.

They said it was the second time in the past decade that Magennis had skied out of bounds in the same vicinity.

The search for Magennis this weekend involved more than two dozen people from six organizations and 350 man hours, said Butch Knowlton, director of the Colorado Office of Emergency Management.

Rather than heading east toward Needles, as he told his wife he would do, Magennis was tracked to the south and to the west into Elbert Creek and Big Lick Creek, officials said. Searchers followed his tracks throughout the night as heavy snow fell, spotting two of his rest stops.

At about 11:30 a.m. Saturday, one of the teams made contact with Magennis about seven miles north of the Hermosa Creek Campground.

About 10 years ago, Magennis skied out of bounds in the same general area and made it to Needles with another person, officials said.
