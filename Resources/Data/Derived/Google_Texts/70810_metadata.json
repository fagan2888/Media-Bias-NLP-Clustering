But when one of the administration\u2019s many lawless actions shifted certain responsibilities to the states, we gained the standing to sue that so many others have lacked. So on July 29, I accepted the president\u2019s invitation and filed a lawsuit on behalf of the state of West Virginia to hold the Obama administration accountable for its illegal conduct. Though we are a small state \u2014 with approximately 1.8 million people \u2014 our lawsuit speaks for the millions more who wish to sue but cannot.\n\nThe president and his administration have ignored the law on a breathtaking range of issues. For example, President Obama directed the Environmental Protection Agency to propose new environmental rules that will devastate coal miners and raise electricity prices sky-high, even though the EPA admits that the \u201cliteral\u201d terms of the Clean Air Act prohibit the regulations. Similarly, after he failed to pass immigration reform through Congress, the president decided to ignore the laws on the books and give out work permits as he pleases. He did the same thing with the Affordable Care Act, giving billions of dollars of tax credits that the law does not authorize. Finally, when Americans learned that the president could not keep his promise that \u201cif you like your health plan, you can keep it,\u201d he ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to create an \u201cadministrative fix\u201d \u2014 to stop enforcing politically unpopular parts of the law.\n\nAmericans from both political parties have decried this lawlessness. Citizens from across the country have called on the president to work with Congress to change policies in a lawful manner. Regardless of whether one supports the policy changes or not, the president cannot play by different rules than everyone else. No one is above the law.\n\nEven some courts have stepped in. This June, the Supreme Court struck down one of President Obama\u2019s unlawful greenhouse-gas regulations, rebuking the president\u2019s attempt to \u201crewrite clear statutory terms.\u201d So, too, in July, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., struck down the president\u2019s attempt to give out tax credits clearly not permitted under the law. Both courts reaffirmed the \u201cprinciple of legislative supremacy\u201d \u2014 that Congress, not the president, makes law.\n\nUnfortunately, even public and judicial outcries have not stopped the president. He has selectively refused to enforce some of the laws Congress passed. In fact, reports suggest that he may rewrite even more laws soon.\n\nOur lawsuit specifically challenges the president\u2019s \u201cadministrative fix\u201d to Obamacare, which was designed to remedy a flaw within the Affordable Care Act that resulted in Americans with health insurance losing their coverage. But rather than properly change the law, which Congress said it was willing to do, the president unilaterally \u201cfixed\u201d it by ceasing federal enforcement of the plan-canceling provisions. Because of the way the law is written, this abdication by the federal government had the unusual effect of shifting enforcement responsibility to the states. This increased responsibility gives us the standing to sue.\n\nIt is important to point out that our goal is not to put individual health-insurance policies at risk. We just want the president to follow the laws as written, as the Constitution requires him to do. Congress \u2014 not the president \u2014 gets to write the laws. Here, the law provides that the federal government \u201cmust\u201d enforce those provisions of the law.
