Even so, it's unusual for an actor in a lead role to voluntarily hand over the lion's share of the spotlight to someone else. Swapping roles is almost unheard of.\n\nMarcus Graham has just done it and has no regrets at all. \"Size doesn't matter,\" he laughs. \"I can't believe I just said that! In fact, I didn't say that!\"\n\nWhen Griffin announced it was ending its 2014 season with a revival of David Williamson's 1987 hit Emerald City, Graham was down to play the central character, Colin, a screenwriter who faces a comic clash of cultures when he moves from serious Melbourne to frivolous Sydney. Some time later, Griffin announced Mitchell Butel would play the second fiddle, Mike, an opportunistic writer looking to get his name on the credits of Colin's next movie project.\n\nCulture clash: Playwright David Williamson's Emerald City still reflects modern Sydney and its art scene.

I was defending Colin.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"And I was sticking up for Mike,\" Graham adds. \"I said to Mitch: why don't we swap roles? This all happened over lunch, so we had to go to [director] Lee Lewis and tell her. She was a bit 'what the f---?' for a minute, but then we spent the afternoon reading each other's lines and everything seemed to click. Now Mitch is the star!\"\n\n\"Yeah, but now I have more lines to learn,\" Butel says. \"But at least if we f--- it up we'll be able to help each other out.\"\n\nAward winning: Marcus Graham with Robyn Nevin in Angels in America last year, in which he also worked with Mitchell Butel. Photo: Heidrun Lohr\n\nColin and Mike are chalk-and-cheese types with more in common than they could ever admit, Graham explains. \"Colin is basically David Williamson, this artistically driven writer who comes to Sydney to find celebration and success in Sydney terms.\"\n\nBy contrast, Mike is a \"huckster\", Butel says. \"He's that classic Sydney type - less interested in the art and more interested in commerce. They are both very flawed human beings but in different ways. They are two pretzels of ambivalence.\"\n\nPretzels?\n\n\"They are inversions of each other,\" Graham says. \"Everything Mike lacks, Colin has, and vice-versa. If they could only get on, they would be a brilliant success.\"\n\nGraham and Butel admit the swap probably wouldn't have happened had they not worked together in Belvoir's Helpmann Award-winning Angels in America. Years earlier, they worked together on Bell Shakespeare's Othello.\n\n\"I was Rodrigo and I understudied Marcus' Iago,\" says Butel. \"Marcus got sick for a couple of days and I had to go on as him. So we've done the swappy-swappy thing before.\"\n\nThough Emerald City is nearly 30 years old and the skylines of both cities have changed, Williamson's satirical contrasting of Sydney and Melbourne is still on the money, say the actors.\n\n\"The idea that success is getting closer to that harbour view still holds in Sydney. It's like this beautiful jewel we're still dazzled by,\" Butel says. \"But I think the play is a bit tough on Melbourne. It's come a long way; it's much groovier now.\"\n\nThe old divide between those who do it for art's sake and those who do it for money has broken down, too, says Graham. \"I think the artistic community has moved closer to having more respect for commercial success over the past few years. It used to be that if something was successful, it probably wasn't very good. Emerald City is born of that kind of thinking and David Williamson's own experience of it.\"\n\nWith a set design by artist Ken Done, Griffin's production of Emerald City will be pure '80s, says Butel. \"It's a bit of a nostalgia trip but on the other hand, the gags are still so good. Williamson taps right into that Australian comic sensibility. I don't think anyone does it better.\"\n\nEmerald City opens at Griffin Theatre on October 24; $32-$49, 9361 3817.\n\nKilling time\n\nMitchell Butel doesn't have a lot of time on his hands at the moment, but what little he has he's determined to fill. Instead of taking Sunday evenings off during the season of Emerald City, Butel will be performing solo in a new cabaret, Killing Time.\n\n\"It's the first time I've done cabaret in Sydney in 14 years,\" he says. \"So no pressure.\"\n\nKilling Time shares some of Emerald City's preoccupations, Butel says. \"It's about middle age and mid-life crises, balancing hope and regret, envy and contentment. It's not a show-bizzy show. I don't talk about my life as an actor. It's more personal, more about lost loves and getting older and what an idiot I've been sometimes. It's me as the everyman.\"\n\nThe selection and sequencing of the songs for Killing Time \u2013 a mix of jazz, blues and standards - is very deliberate, Butel says. \"To start with, we made a list of every song that had some connection to the clock. We came up with about 400 and then whittled it down into a 24-hour cycle that follows someone's life from naivety to understanding, to appreciating that, as you get older, you're not losing who you once were or what you once desired. It's all still there.\"\n\nKilling Time plays at Hayes Theatre on November 9, 23, 30 and December 7; $35-$40, 8065 7337.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Stage", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "A secondary role as a brash huckster proved irresistible to \"Emerald City\" star Marcus Graham.", "title": "Emerald City stars choose role reversal", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/stage/emerald-city-stars-choose-role-reversal-20140930-10nqit.html", "image": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/09/30/5828590/Thumbnail6157363710nqw3image.related.thumbnail.320x214.10nqit.png1412437028095.jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "cXenseParse": {"ffx-assettype": "article", "ffx-assetid": 61573637}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msvalidate.01": "3A0F8B0A5D246EFE15A2F9F975D1E623", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "A secondary role as a brash huckster proved irresistible to"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca00b\"", "article_summary": "Culture clash: Playwright David Williamson's Emerald City still reflects modern Sydney and its art scene.\nInstead of taking Sunday evenings off during the season of Emerald City, Butel will be performing solo in a new cabaret, Killing Time.\nEmerald City is born of that kind of thinking and David Williamson's own experience of it.\"\nStageUnderstudies: Actors Marcus Graham (left) and Mitchell Butel will perform in Emerald City at the Griffin Theatre.\nWith a set design by artist Ken Done, Griffin's production of Emerald City will be pure '80s, says Butel."}
