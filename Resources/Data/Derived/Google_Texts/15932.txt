"I'm just a bill, yes I'm only a bill, and I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill. But I know I'll be a law someday, at least I hope and pray that I will, but today I am still just a bill."

Remember that anthem? If you do, you may want to check out Saturday Night Live's updated version, which debuted this weekend. The eager, musically-inclined piece of legislation meets President Obama, who promptly kicks him down the steps of the Capitol and introduces a new friend: Mr. Executive Order.

But even Mr. Executive Order is a little shocked to discover that the president has the authority to unilaterally legalize four million immigrants.

"Woah! Okay, go big or go home, huh?" says the bill.

Meanwhile, the bill pulls himself back up, promises to shut down Congress and go to Court... and is quickly kicked back down the steps again by Obama.

Kudos to SNL for finally delivering some half-decent political satire.
