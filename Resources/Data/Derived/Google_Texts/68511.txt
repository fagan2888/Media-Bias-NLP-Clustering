Sioux Falls, SD

The 4th of July holiday is bringing a wave of customers to firework retailers across KELOLAND.

Hot Shot Fireworks owner Shelly Raderschadt says her business' shelves were nearly empty after a busy July 3rd. This morning, workers were unwrapping boxes and re-stocking the store for those last minute firework purchases.

"We're just seeing an excitement this year. Sales have been up because of the beautiful weather and all of the rain. Everyone feels really good about shooting, and I would just say everyone coming in is excited to celebrate this year," Raderschadt said.

Raderschadt says the store's top sellers include artillery shells and 500 gram shells. While rules vary across KELOLAND, the use of fireworks within Sioux Falls is prohibited, with the exception of small items, like sparklers and snakes, which don't have an audible report, projectile, or launching component.
