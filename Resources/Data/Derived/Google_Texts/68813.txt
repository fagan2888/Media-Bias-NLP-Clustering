A missing Golden woman who didn’t return home after a Colorado ski trip has been found, officials said.

Lacey Oar, 32, was confirmed safe by the Delta Police Department on Friday.

A community Facebook page dedicated to finding Oar said that an unidentified male took Oar, who was physically unharmed, to a hospital.

Oar headed southwest on Dec. 23 to ski Wolf Creek and Crested Butte and was supposed to return home on Sunday Dec. 27, according to the Facebook page.

Oar was considered endangered due to concerns that she was “experiencing a medical issue,” according to a Delta Police Facebook post.

The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office and the Delta Police Department investigated her disappearance.

“Thank you everyone SO MUCH for all of your help!!!,” the community Facebook post said. ” We are so grateful for everything you’ve done!”
