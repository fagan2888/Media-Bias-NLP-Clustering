Two groups pushing for stricter gun regulations opened an online merchandise site on Black Friday, just in time for the holiday shopping rush.

Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and Everytown for Gun Safety are offering T-shirts, coffee mugs, tote bags and even baby onesies on the new website, the New York Daily News reported Friday.

For $30, shoppers can purchase a t-shirt an American flag made of bullets and the phrase “Americans are 20 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than people in other developed countries.”

“Your purchase helps us build awareness of and advance solutions to gun violence in America,” Everytown’s website reads.

Other apparel, including the children’s t-shirts and baby onesies bear the slogan “future gun sense voter,” and sell for $24.
