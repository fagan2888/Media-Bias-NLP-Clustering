This includes Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, George Pataki, John Kasich, Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham, who dropped out of the race last week.\n\nRight to Rise, the super PAC backing Bush, has reserved more than $10 million in TV airtime between January and the primary in New Hampshire, CBS News confirmed. Two ads are expected to air during the Super Bowl.\n\nConservative Solutions PAC, backing Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, has launched ads touting his work to fight ObamaCare in Iowa in Hampshire.\n\nThe Center for Responsive Politics, which gathers campaign finances data, says that Right to Rise has raised $103 million so far, while Conservative Solutions has raised $16 million.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Des Moines Register analyzed super PAC filings with the Federal Election Commission", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/super-pac-spending-higher-in-new-hampshire-than-iowa/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/11/11/50537ba5-e40b-4bd8-8c58-8f4d2f1bd52b/thumbnail/1200x630g2/740c559db70bfc470f21e48f5ee6240c/2015-11-11t023542z873727610tb3ebbb07784lrtrmadp3usa-election.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "The Des Moines Register analyzed super PAC filings with the Federal Election Commission", "title": "Super PAC spending higher in New Hampshire than Iowa"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Des Moines Register analyzed super PAC filings with the Federal Election Commission", "title": "Super PAC spending higher in New Hampshire than Iowa", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/super-pac-spending-higher-in-new-hampshire-than-iowa/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/super-pac-spending-higher-in-new-hampshire-than-iowa/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/super-pac-spending-higher-in-new-hampshire-than-iowa/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/11/11/50537ba5-e40b-4bd8-8c58-8f4d2f1bd52b/thumbnail/1200x630g2/740c559db70bfc470f21e48f5ee6240c/2015-11-11t023542z873727610tb3ebbb07784lrtrmadp3usa-election.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/super-pac-spending-higher-in-new-hampshire-than-iowa/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/super-pac-spending-higher-in-new-hampshire-than-iowa/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "keywords": "conservative solutions, jeb bush, iowa, marco rubio, 2016, right to rise, new hampshire", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "conservative solutions, jeb bush, iowa, marco rubio, 2016, right to rise, new hampshire"}, "article_summary": "Spending from super PACs during this 2016 election cycle has so far been higher in New Hampshire than in Iowa, according to The Des Moines Register.\nConservative Solutions PAC, backing Sen.
