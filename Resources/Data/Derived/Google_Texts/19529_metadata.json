No, this is not a new Hollywood franchise aimed at teenage boys; rather, this is how an elected member of Congress conducts himself.\n\nThe fail is strong with this one and the best part is the Republicans don\u2019t even get why it\u2019s in poor taste. Their response to getting called out for blatant sexism? \u201cObamacare!\u201d\n\nRepresentative Southerland held a men-only fundraiser back in March for which the invite, obtained by BuzzFeed, instructs the \u201csmall group of concerned men\u201d to \u201ctell the misses not to wait up\u201d because \u201cthe after dinner whiskey and cigars will be smooth & the issues to discuss are many.\u201d Further:\n\n\u201cGood men sitting around discussing & solving political & social problems over fine food & drink date back to the 12th Century with King Arthur\u2019s Round Table,\u201d the invitation said.\n\nThat\u2019s the Republican Party equating their fundraiser with a 12th century tradition of men-only.\n\nNaturally, the Republican Congressmen is running against a woman, Democrat Gwen Graham. Having to compete with women in the work place has brought out the worst in Republican campaigns from Mitch McConnell\u2019s desperate attempts to belittle his opponent Alison Lundergan Grimes to Greg Abbott\u2019s ugly attacks on his Democratic opponent in Texas, Wendy Davis. To make matters worse for Southerland, he\u2019s an endangered incumbent.\n\nThis story would not be complete without the cherry on the condescension. Southerland is also trying to mislead women into voting for him by telling them that he voted for the Violence Against Women Act. In truth, he voted for the GOP version, which was so bad that NOW referred to it as a vote against violence against women \u2013 in other words, the Pro-Violence Against Women Act.\n\nThe GOP House version was so bad that President Obama vetoed it. It actually enabled abusers on multiple levels, while cutting out key protections for Native American women, minorities and the LGBT community for starters. The Republican version was literally about taking key protections away from women. It was a giant, deliberate regression meant to appease abusers in the old boys network that only solidified the GOP as the party of legitimate rape and \u201cshutting it down\u201d.\n\nSoutherland\u2019s campaign manager had the perfect Republican response when questioned about the fundraiser invite, telling BuzzFeed in an email that the media should be focusing on Gwen Graham\u2019s positions on Obamacare instead, calling the attention on the fundraiser \u201claughable\u201d.\n\nNotice that the Republican Congressman\u2019s campaign manager did not attack the Democrat for being for Obamacare. However, days ago in a separate response, they did attack Graham for being for Obamacare. No limit to the number of mouths they will speak out of in order to trick northern Florida voters, apparently. Soon they will be pretending they voted for it, just like they are misleading the voters about voting for the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nAll of this is to say that Republicans bypassed the 1950s and are surging their binders full of women fail well into the 12th century at record speeds. The Democratic Congressional Campaign called Republicans out this morning for \u201c\u2018Finishing School for White Men\u2019 Not Going According to Plan\u201d after a week of GOP sexism fails, including the NRCC airing an ad in which Representative Ann Kirkpatrick (D-AZ) is represented by a pair of sexy legs in high heels and a skirt \u201cstrutting back and forth\u201d with no full body shown and certainly not a head (this was their attempt to paint her as Obama\u2019s girl because that is not offensive to pretty much everyone).\n\nSteve Southerland doesn\u2019t want the female voters of Florida to know that he voted for a pro-violence against women act and he thinks his men-only fundraiser, likened to the 12th century, with the added \u201ctell the misses not to wait up\u201d is not offensive. But affordable healthcare! Now there\u2019s a real offense.\n\nImage: SaintPetersBlog", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida Republican Congressman Steve Southerland held a fundraiser for men only and the invite instructed them to tell the \"misses\" not to wait up because the boys would be smoking cigars and drinking whiskey whilst solving the world's problems.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Florida Republican Congressman Steve Southerland held a fundraiser for men only and the invite instructed them to tell the \"misses\" not to wait up because the boys would be smoking cigars and drinking whiskey whilst solving the world's problems.", "title": "Republicans Regress to 12th Century for Men-Only Fundraiser: 'Tell the Misses Not to Wait Up'", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/09/05/republicans-surge-12th-century-tell-misses-wait-up-fail.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/southerland-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-05T10:18:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "2014 Elections,Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-09-05T10:09:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-05T10:18:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7f6\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s the Republican Party equating their fundraiser with a 12th century tradition of men-only.\nAll of this is to say that Republicans bypassed the 1950s and are surging their binders full of women fail well into the 12th century at record speeds.\nFlorida Republican Congressman Steve Southerland held a men-only fundraiser and the invite instructed them to tell the \u201cmisses\u201d not to wait up because the boys would be smoking cigars and drinking whiskey whilst solving the world\u2019s problems like they did in the 12th century.\nSteve Southerland doesn\u2019t want the female voters of Florida to know that he voted for a pro-violence against women act and he thinks his men-only fundraiser, likened to the 12th century, with the added \u201ctell the misses not to wait up\u201d is not offensive.\nThe fail is strong with this one and the best part is the Republicans don\u2019t even get why it\u2019s in poor taste."}
