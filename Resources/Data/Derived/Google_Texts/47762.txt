Health plans and insurers that have had success on the Affordable Care Act exchange have been invited to speak at a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services forum next month to share insights on the market.

CMS announced the forum in a blog post Monday, noting that Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, CareSource, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, SelectHealth, UPMC and the Society of Actuaries will be among those attending the event.

“At the forum, presenters will describe strategies around consumer engagement, provider contracting, and care coordination models tailored by population data,” Kevin Counihan, the CEO of HealthCare.gov, wrote in the post, adding that attendees “will have the opportunity to discuss novel techniques that may help companies offer better health care coverage at lower cost.”

It was expected that companies would take time to adjust to the marketplace and that some would adjust more quickly, Counihan wrote. The forum aims to give insurers that are still adapting to the exchange a chance to hearing from companies that have had more success.

“This discussion will also help us work together towards a vibrant Marketplace that drives high-value, high-quality health care,” Counihan wrote. “Whether you are a patient, a provider, a business, a health plan, or a taxpayer, the long-term stability of the Marketplace is in everyone’s interest — both families who need access to quality, affordable coverage they can count on, and companies that have a chance to expand into a new market with millions of consumers.”

The forum will take place on June 9.
