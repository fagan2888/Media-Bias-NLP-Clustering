Even in the rare cases where VA management does punish employees, the agency is being thwarted by union-backed civil service rules.\n\nFor example, a VA employee in Puerto Rico was reinstated with back pay last month after she was fired upon being arrested for armed robbery. She pleaded guilty, but her union got her job back by arguing in a grievance that a VA manager at the facility is a registered sex offender and another VA hospital manager was once arrested for drunken driving and found in possession of pain pills.\n\nIn Alexandria, Louisiana, a VA nursing assistant is still on the payroll while awaiting trial on manslaughter charges in the death of a 70-year-old Air Force veteran in 2013. Hospital officials initially called the veteran\u2019s death an accident, but a coroner determined the veteran died from blunt force trauma to the head.\n\nHouse Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller, Florida Republican, said the case is an example of \u201cVA\u2019s continued and pervasive failure to seriously discipline its employees.\u201d The agency has said civil service rules make it difficult to fire poor-performing employees and has recommended changes to Congress.\n\nMr. Cooper said it\u2019s taken the VA two years to propose firing three senior leaders responsible for the Phoenix VA scandal, \u201cwhich led to nearly 300 veterans dying waiting for care.\u201d\n\nThe VA didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe agency\u2019s problems go far beyond civil service rules, however.\n\nThe agency\u2019s inspector general released twelve reports on VA health care systems in Texas last month, revealing that seven of them have scheduling mismanagement that led to extended wait times for veterans. The reports blamed that lack of supervision, poor training of employees and weak management controls for data manipulation.\n\nIn San Diego, California, the inspector general reported Friday that staff at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center manipulated waiting list data to make it appear veteran patients received mental health care more quickly than they actually did. The report covered fiscal 2012 and 2013.\n\nThe department\u2019s inspector general told USA Today in February it has investigated 73 VA facilities across the country, and found scheduling problems in 51 cases. But the inspector general still has not released reports with the findings of nearly all those investigations to Congress or the public.\n\nIn Denver, the VA said it has no plans to punish any other employees over massive cost overruns at the VA medical facility under construction. The executives responsible for the cost of the project rising to $1.7 billion have already left the department, the agency said in an internal review, while three other executives were transferred or demoted.\n\nIn Jackson, Mississippi, an investigation found that taxpayers are paying millions for VA hospitals to keep health care workers with questionable records on paid leave for years. The Clarion-Ledger reported in February that two surgeons at the G.V. \u201cSonny\u201d Montgomery VA Medical Center whose annual salaries total more than $500,000 have been on paid leave more than two years. Their salaries count against the Jackson VA\u2019s budget, but veterans receive no care from them.\n\nThe paper found that 2,560 VA employees spent at least one month on paid leave in 2014, costing taxpayers $23 million \u2014 more than any other federal agency. VA Secretary Robert McDonald said the agency is streamlining the administrative leave process so employees can be disciplined more quickly.\n\nIn Clarksburg, West Virginia, veteran Terry Riley has filed suit against the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center, alleging that the facility has \u201ca practice of falsifying and reducing emergency room numbers.\u201d His claim accuses the facility\u2019s managers of \u201cutilizing false clinics to enable senior managers to reduce ER visits and receive a high yearly bonus,\u201d against VA policy.\n\nThe VA last month did take disciplinary action against one notable employee. The agency suspended the head of the Veterans Benefits Administration Danny Pummill for allowing two lower-ranking officials to manipulate the agency\u2019s hiring system for their own gain.\n\nMr. Pummill was suspended without pay \u2014 for 15 days. Deputy VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said Mr. Pummill failed to exercise proper oversight as Kimberly Graves and Diana Rubens forced lower-ranking managers to accept job transfers and then stepped into the vacant positions themselves, keeping their senior-level pay while reducing their responsibilities.\n\nBut Ms. Graves and Ms. Rubens were reinstated last month after administrative judges overturned their firings. The agency reprimanded them and cut their pay by 10 percent.\n\nLast week, Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, and Mr. Miller wrote to Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs Chairman Johnny Isakson, Georgia Republican, to warn that failure of Congress to pass new language allowing the VA to fire corrupt or negligent officials would be a \u201cdisservice\u201d to the nation\u2019s veterans. They urged him to consider Mr. Miller\u2019s bill, which would expand the agency\u2019s authority to fire employees.\n\n\u201cWe are now concerned that you have halted the aforementioned negotiations and may be taking an approach that favors reaching a deal with the administration or others at any cost, regardless of whether it actually addresses the VA\u2019s many problems or pays for new programs in a responsible way,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cWe hope you realize that any piece of comprehensive veterans\u2019 legislation that doesn\u2019t provide the VA secretary swift and comprehensive disciplinary authority for all VA employees misses the true mark on what ails the department.\u201d\n\nSome veterans groups are concerned that the VA\u2019s problems are getting less attention during the presidential election year.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged some of the individuals running for president have been vocal about the plight of our veterans, but what\u2019s more important is that our next commander in chief, regardless of party, commit to reforming the VA and standing up to the special interests that have prevented reforms to the department that would ensure our veterans receive the best care possible,\u201d Mr. Cooper said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you thought the Obama administration had put its problems with veterans behind it, think again.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "If you thought the Obama administration had put its problems with veterans behind it, think again.", "title": "VA still plagued by problems two years after scandal", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/3/va-still-plagued-by-problems-two-years-after-scand/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/03/4_3_2016_ap5597701044438201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/03/4_3_2016_ap5597701044438201.jpg", "description": "If you thought the Obama administration had put its problems with veterans behind it, think again.", "card": "summary", "title": "VA still plagued by problems two years after scandal"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Social Issues, John Cooper, Department Of Veterans Affairs"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Cooper said it\u2019s taken the VA two years to propose firing three senior leaders responsible for the Phoenix VA scandal, \u201cwhich led to nearly 300 veterans dying waiting for care.\u201dThe VA didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nEven in the rare cases where VA management does punish employees, the agency is being thwarted by union-backed civil service rules.\n\u201cThe VA is broken, and if we want veterans to be assured of a VA that works, we need to systemically reform it.\u201dEmployee discipline has become an embarrassment.\nIn Denver, the VA said it has no plans to punish any other employees over massive cost overruns at the VA medical facility under construction.\nIf you thought the Obama administration had put its problems with veterans behind it, think again."}
