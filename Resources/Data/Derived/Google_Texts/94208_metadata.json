This is from Campbell\u2019s article\n\n\u201cWhile the House called for all state workers to get a 2 percent raise, House senior budget writer Nelson Dollar said that\u2019s now unlikely with less money to spend. \u2018It\u2019s $420 million less, so obviously what the House was looking at in terms of raises and in terms of investing in education will not happen,\u2019 said Dollar, a Cary Republican.\u201d\n\nA TABOR constrained budget would, obviously, be even more inadequate.\n\nThe obvious and incredibly sobering bottom line therefore: If North Carolina puts TABOR into the constitution,we are all but guaranteed that teachers and other state employees will never get another decent raise again unless the state literally does away with some major function of government to free up the necessary funds.\n\nNo wonder Colorado legalized pot. People need something to ease the pain of being the only Americans forced to live under such a disastrous amendment.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf814\"", "article_summary": "the rate of inflation plus population growth) were a TABOR amendment in place.\nPeople need something to ease the pain of being the only Americans forced to live under such a disastrous amendment.\nThis is from Campbell\u2019s article\u201cWhile the House called for all state workers to get a 2 percent raise, House senior budget writer Nelson Dollar said that\u2019s now unlikely with less money to spend.\n\u2018It\u2019s $420 million less, so obviously what the House was looking at in terms of raises and in terms of investing in education will not happen,\u2019 said Dollar, a Cary Republican.\u201dA TABOR constrained budget would, obviously, be even more inadequate.\nThe obvious and incredibly sobering bottom line therefore: If North Carolina puts TABOR into the constitution,we are all but guaranteed that teachers and other state employees will never get another decent raise again unless the state literally does away with some major function of government to free up the necessary funds."}
