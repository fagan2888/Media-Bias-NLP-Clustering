Planned Parenthood has already said the videos would lead to violence against their clinics.\n\nIn a statement to Breitbart News, he flatly stated, \u201cThe Center for Medical Progress does not support vigilante violence against abortion providers. There are people at Planned Parenthood who I still consider friends and my thoughts and prayers are with them at this time for no one to be injured.\u201d\n\nIn response to the inevitable charges against him, Daleiden said, \u201cWe only visited the Denver clinic in Colorado. PPRM CEO Vicki Cowart says Planned Parenthood still doesn\u2019t know the full details of what is going on in Colorado Springs.\u201d\n\nOther pro-life leaders are echoing Daleiden\u2019s statement.\n\nSteven Ertelt, editor of LifeNews, told Breitbart, \u201cAnyone who would direct violence towards a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic is clearly not pro-life. The shooter today is showing a crass and horrific lack of respect for human life that is totally at odds with everything the pro-life movement stands for.\u201d\n\nFather Frank Pavone of Priests for Life called for calm:\n\nAs leaders in the pro-life movement, we call for calm and pray for a peaceful resolution of this situation. What is motivating this shooting will become clearer in due time. We ask that in the meantime, nobody jump to conclusions regarding the connection between this violence and the controversy over abortion and Planned Parenthood, and we ask that people do not use this situation to inflame emotions on either side of the abortion issue.\n\nJim Sedlak of the American Life League, who has been exposing Planned Parenthood for more than twenty years, said, \u201cAlthough American Life League\u2019s STOPP International fights against the policies and programs of Planned Parenthood, we condemn the use of violence. Every human being is created by God and is deserving of respect. We pray for the victims of the Colorado attack and for the quick capture of the person responsible.\u201d\n\nTroy Newman, president of Operation Rescue, and who serves on Daleiden\u2019s board, said, \u201cOperation Rescue unequivocally deplores and denounces all violence at abortion clinics and has a long history of working through peaceful channels to advocate on behalf of women and their babies. We express deep concern for everyone involved and are praying for the safety of those at the Planned Parenthood office and for law enforcement personnel. We pray this tragic situation can be quickly resolved without further injury to anyone.\u201d\n\nReverend Pat Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition said, \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t know the reasons for the shooting near the Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs today, the pro-life movement is praying for the safety of all involved and as a movement we have always unequivocally condemned all forms of violence at abortion clinics. We must continually as a nation stand against violence on all levels.\u201d\n\nFollow Austin Ruse on Twitter @austinruse", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Daleiden is nervous that Planned Parenthood will blame Friday's shooting at a Colorado Springs abortion clinic on him and his videos.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "David Daleiden is nervous that Planned Parenthood will blame Friday's shooting at a Colorado Springs abortion clinic on him and his videos.", "title": "David Daleiden Condemns CO Planned Parenthood Shooting", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 641, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/ap_ap-photo1986-wi-e1448670927162.jpg", "height": 479}, "updated_time": "2015-11-27T16:41:30-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/27/david-daleiden-producer-planned-parenthood-organ-harvest-videos-condemns-colorado-shooting/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "David Daleiden is nervous that Planned Parenthood will blame Friday's shooting at a Colorado Springs abortion clinic on him and his videos.", "creator": "@austinruse", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/ap_ap-photo1986-wi-e1448670927162.jpg", "title": "David Daleiden Condemns CO Planned Parenthood Shooting", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,david daleiden", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-11-27T16:36:01-07:00", "categories": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-11-27T16:41:30-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe060d\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThere is little doubt that David Daleiden is nervous that Planned Parenthood will blame Friday\u2019s shooting at a Colorado Springs abortion clinic on him and his videos.\nWe express deep concern for everyone involved and are praying for the safety of those at the Planned Parenthood office and for law enforcement personnel.\nSteven Ertelt, editor of LifeNews, told Breitbart, \u201cAnyone who would direct violence towards a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic is clearly not pro-life.\nPlanned Parenthood has already said the videos would lead to violence against their clinics.\nJim Sedlak of the American Life League, who has been exposing Planned Parenthood for more than twenty years, said, \u201cAlthough American Life League\u2019s STOPP International fights against the policies and programs of Planned Parenthood, we condemn the use of violence."}
