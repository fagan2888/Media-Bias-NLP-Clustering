According to Noah Rothman of HotAir.com, however, \u201cIf that is an accurate interpretation, it is worth noting that Wasserman Schultz disturbingly equated the president issuing executive edicts with \u2018doing his job.\u2019 That\u2019s a unique take on the role of chief executive, especially considering that the Supreme Court recently ruled by 9 to nothing that Obama\u2019s take on what constitutes his job violates the separation of powers.\u201d\n\nIn June, in a 9-0 decision, the high court struck down Obama\u2019s recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board because the Senate wasn\u2019t legally out of session at the time.\n\nAlthough just superficially totaling up the number of executive orders (helped along by an analysis in the Obama-friendly Washington Post) has been a Democrat talking point, it actually misses the point.\n\nFor many of the right and the left, such as highly respected liberal law professor Jonathan Turley, it\u2019s not the amount of executive orders but instead the scope and the content. No one really cares, for example, if a president issues an innocuous executive order about national belly button lint day or which dignitary\u2019s name goes on a post office. Those actions don\u2019t prompt a constitutional controversy over separation of powers and checks and balances in relation to the selective enforcement or non-enforcement of federal law.\n\nAs The Daily Caller noted about the humanitarian and law enforcement crisis at the southern border that may have been created by Obama administration policy, \u201cDespite the relative rarity in issuing executive orders, Obama has wielded his pen unilaterally on hot-button issues, frustrating Republicans. One example was a 2012 executive order implementing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy which has provided amnesty to nearly 600,000 illegal immigrants. Recent reports have suggested that Obama may issue new executive orders amid the immigration crisis currently unfolding at the southern U.S. border involving tens of thousands of unaccompanied child immigrants.\u201d\n\nThe GOP-controlled House voted 225-201 on Wednesday to sue Obama in connection with the many unilateral changes made to Obamacare without the approval of Congress, primarily focusing on the one-year delay in the employer mandate.\n\nWasserman Schultz has a history of going on TV with extremely partisan memorized messaging despite how abrasive or ridiculous it sounds. On one occasion, she even claimed she was misquoted by a tape recorder. During the last presidential campaign, she denounced 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney for offshore bank accounts even though she also held overseas investments.\n\nWasserman Schultz has also insisted that it is acceptable for President Obama to deny any knowledge of scandals engulfing his administration, but the same doesn\u2019t apply to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.\n\nThe congresswoman may inadvertently be on to something as far as the president\u2019s work load is concerned, however. According to the New York Post, and despite one crisis after another, as of late July, Obama \u201chas played 81 rounds of golf and had attended 75 political fund-raisers in the 628 days since his 2012 re-election.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, in also condemning the House lawsuit against Obama, apparently forgot that she tried to impeach George W. Bush in 2008.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama cheerleader Debbie Wasserman Schultz may have experienced a talking points malfunction.
