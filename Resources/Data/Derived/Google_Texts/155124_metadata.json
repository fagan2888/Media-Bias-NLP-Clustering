It looked like a college party house; the owner had Band-Aided over what should have been surgically repaired. The bathrooms were dark and grimy, the attic a rat graveyard. The living room floor was a patchwork of different woods and had what our realtor called a \u201cwhale-tail,\u201d settling unevenly with a giant hump in the middle.\n\n6 tips to being a good client Here are six tips from Joel Krueger of Krueger Construction on making the homeowner-contractor relationship go more smoothly during a home renovation: 1. Discuss details before you sign the contract. \u201cTalk in advance about what you\u2019re really trying to accomplish,\u201d Krueger says. 2. Consider renovating everything at once. \u201cYou can save money in the long run because my guys can start another project indoors if the weather is bad, and then there\u2019s no down time,\u201d Krueger says. 3. Schedule around the contractor. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Come at 10.\u2019 If we do that, we can\u2019t get a full workday in. It\u2019s a waste of time,\u201d Krueger says. \u201cMy guys like to start at 7:30 or 8.\u201d 4. Send instructions in writing. But don\u2019t nag. \u201cLittle reminders are fine, but you have to have good communications,\u201d Krueger says. 5. Pay promptly. \u201cRemember, your contractor is getting invoices in all the time. If I pay on time, my service people tend to come right away when I call for you,\u201d Krueger says. 6. Remember to praise. \u201cIt\u2019s so satisfying seeing someone\u2019s face light up; it makes the guys have even more pride in their work,\u201d Krueger says. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s the true payment for my job.\u201d\n\nBut a structural engineer swore the 1840 house was sound. The housing inspector agreed, although he called for multiple repairs.\n\nWe knew we wanted two of the small bedrooms combined into a master suite, an updated master bathroom and a new kitchen.\n\nAnd so, armed with a basic architect\u2019s drawing, we hired Joel Krueger of Krueger Construction to renovate the house before we moved in. Joel is a good contractor but, make no mistake, renovation is still the painful labor that makes you want only one child.\n\nWeek one\n\nThe living room floor is pulled up, exposing old wooden joists.\n\nIn the bedroom, a wall comes down to make way for our master suite, and another wall reveals a chimney from the living room fireplace. We can expose the brick, but we\u2019re advised against opening a bedroom fireplace since fumes from the living room fires below could kill us. We\u2019re neophytes at this renovation stuff, but we\u2019re pretty sure not dying is the right plan.\n\nAs the crew tears through the wall between the kitchen and dining room, they expose another fireplace, and old magazines stuffed in the thimble, the hole where a wood-burning stove would have vented. There also are bones from old food.\n\nWeek two\n\nWith a renovation contract, much is \u201cowner supplied.\u201d Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s become your new hangouts, and you realize you can easily blow your own budget when you fall for fancy light fixtures.\n\nNo wonder the house tilted! The joists beneath the living room floor were not even connected, just loose timbers lying in the dirt. The joists are \u201csistered\u201d with new, stronger pieces of wood. We had only budgeted for some spot repair, but the whole floor needs to be redone.\n\nApparently, the stairs from the lower to upper level were just floating on rotted board. They\u2019re building an extra cement pier so we don\u2019t tumble to our deaths one day. Again, I\u2019m on board with the \u201cno death\u201d construction.\n\nWeek three\n\nThe plumber is going to have to redo all the gas lines and the electrician will need a new breaker box. Cha-ching! Gotta love old houses.\n\nKrueger\u2019s Tom Mueller comes up with an idea for a narrow bookcase to fill the space between the wall and the newly exposed bedroom chimney, which juts out at an odd angle. Can we afford it? Joel nods and we cheer.\n\nWeek four\n\nThe architect\u2019s drawing is off by one kitchen cabinet. Also, the counter-depth refrigerator is actually going to stick out about four inches. Can we live with that?\n\nWe decide four inches and one less cabinet is no big deal, considering what just happened with the siding, which is much more rotten than anyone thought. The original plan was to do spot repairs, but about three-fourths of the siding must be replaced.\n\nGeorge McDonald, another Krueger worker, was pulling down rotten siding and a bunch of wiring fell out, too. Seems the previous owners had just stuck wires behind the siding to get it out of the way. It could have been serious if George had hammered into a live wire. Not only could it have shorted the whole house, but George would have been a bit crispy.\n\nWeek six\n\nKitchen and bathroom walls are in, and living room floor planks have either been remilled and fitted back, or reclaimed from some other old house.\n\nThe crew has not only rid the attic of rat carcasses, but has built storage lofts in the attic, no charge.\n\nTom points to black speckles on the floor of our closet and bedroom.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get those ducts cleaned,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is what\u2019s coming out of them. You don\u2019t want to breathe that stuff.\u201d\n\nNo, of course not. A call to the duct cleaners adds $1,000 to our budget.\n\nWeek nine\n\nIt\u2019s starting to look like a home and not a construction site: the upstairs floors and stairs are stained, the master bath has some fixtures, the living room is painted, and the roof is now Tinner\u2019s Red and not the heat-sucking black it used to be.\n\nThe crew is appalled by the front door. Not even an external door, it makes the rest of their work look shabby. Joel finds a solid door and frame from a reclaimed wood place, and we have a new front door.\n\nWeek 10\n\nWe\u2019re moving in next week. Joel\u2019s confident the house will be ready.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he temporizes, \u201cthe inside will be ready. We may still be working on the outside.\u201d\n\nThe outside has been delayed by weeks of unremitting rain, but it definitely is a blue house now rather than the previous weak yellow. The shutters are elsewhere, awaiting paint.\n\nMove-in week (11)\n\nCrewmember Wesley Harrell painstakingly made a floor vent of reclaimed wood to match the lovely heart pine floors in the kitchen. Unfortunately, one of the crew puts the leg of his ladder right over the vent, shattering both the vent and his wrist in the fall. He\u2019ll need surgery. The shutters are at this worker\u2019s house, and he\u2019s not painting them anytime soon.\n\nThe cleaning lady arrives the day before the move. She does her best, but workers are still everywhere drilling and spreading dust over rooms she\u2019s just cleaned.\n\nAt one point on moving day, we have 16 people at our house: four movers; Joel; and an assortment of workers.\n\nAfter the move\n\nOnly touch-ups remain: some paint spots, a small roof leak, an outlet that got covered over. All get fixed over the next two weeks.\n\nNearly a month later, all of the invoices are in and Joel presents us with our final bill: it\u2019s about 2.5 percent over budget. Not bad for a project that is more than $200,000, but not good for our tight budget. He explains that the extras \u2014 fancier kitchen cabinets, the siding and even the bedroom bookshelf \u2014 as well as the gas lines put us over. His explanation rings true: We did get lots of extras, and the work is top-notch. Ruefully, we write the check.\n\nOur renovated house is beautiful. And we hope to never do it again.
