But Meir\u2019s success turned out to be an exception to the rule, and its politics remain male-dominated. Female representation is low compared to Western democracies, and only 23 women have served as government ministers or deputy ministers since Israel\u2019s creation in 1948.\n\nGideon Rahat, a professor of political science at Jerusalem\u2019s Hebrew University, said the strong showing for women in recent primaries follows a gradual rise in women\u2019s participation in the Knesset since the late 1990s.\n\nHe said that while more established parties such as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Likud have elected only three women into its ranks, with another two appointed, newer parties are bringing in more. The newly formed Kulanu, for instance, is one-third female. Two parties have women at the helm: Tzipi Livni from Hatnuah and Zehava Galon from Meretz.\n\nHere is a look at some of the women who have top spots on their party lists:\n\nSTAV SHAFFIR\n\nThe 29-year-old Labor party lawmaker emerged out of mass street protests in 2011 against the rising cost of living to become a popular politician who champions the causes of the middle class. A video of her lambasting nationalist politicians for funneling money to supporters became a viral sensation. She captured the No. 3 spot in the primary of the main opposition party, Labor, ahead of a number of well-established party veterans. This will be her second term in parliament.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In shakeup, women get top spots in Israeli political parties", "author": "Tia Goldenberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In shakeup, women get top spots in Israeli political parties", "title": "In shakeup, women get top spots in Israeli political parties", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/09/in_shakeup_women_get_top_spots_in_israeli_political_parties/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/mideast-israel-female-politicians.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In shakeup, women get top spots in Israeli political parties", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/mideast-israel-female-politicians.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "In shakeup, women get top spots in Israeli political parties", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "In shakeup, women get top spots in Israeli political parties", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd873f\"", "article_summary": "While the number of women in Israel\u2019s 120-seat Knesset isn\u2019t likely to rise dramatically from its current 27, the number of women holding senior positions likely will, breaking new ground for women.\nTwo parties have women at the helm: Tzipi Livni from Hatnuah and Zehava Galon from Meretz.\n3 spot in the primary of the main opposition party, Labor, ahead of a number of well-established party veterans.\nFemale representation is low compared to Western democracies, and only 23 women have served as government ministers or deputy ministers since Israel\u2019s creation in 1948.\nHe said that while more established parties such as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Likud have elected only three women into its ranks, with another two appointed, newer parties are bringing in more."}
