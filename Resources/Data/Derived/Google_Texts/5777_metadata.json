(UCC) cannot be sued for ongoing contamination from the plant.\n\nThe disaster, dubbed \u201cThe Hiroshima of the Chemical Industry,\u201d began in 1984 when a cloud of poisonous gas, methyl isocyanate, leaked from a pesticide plant whose majority owner was UCC and was operated by an Indian subsidiary, UCIL. Thousands were killed instantly and thousands more in the aftermath. Decades after the plant\u2019s closure, nearby residents continue to suffer health impacts including cancers and birth defects.\n\nThe suit was filed by EarthRights International (ERI) on behalf of Bhopal residents whose water and land continues to suffer contamination from the plant. The organization states that \u201cUCC largely abandoned the site, allowing toxic wastes to leach into the local water supply.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nJudge John F. Keenan rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that UCC was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in the \u201cinsufficient and grossly negligent\u201d remediation of the plant, stating that \u201cthe manufacturing processes and waste disposal systems to be implemented at the Bhopal Plant were all initially proposed by UCIL.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs had also sought to the state of Madhya Pradesh, which now owns the site, to cooperate in the cleanup.\n\n\u201cBecause I conclude that there is no basis to hold UCC liable for Plaintiffs\u2019 damage, there will be no court-ordered cleanup in this action, and thus, no basis for enjoining Madhya Pradesh,\u201d Judge Keenan ruled.\n\nERI denounced the ruling as a denial of justice and vowed to continue the fight.\n\n\u201cThe evidence demonstrates that Union Carbide was intimately involved in every aspect of designing and building the Bhopal plant, including the waste disposal systems that caused the pollution,\u201d Marco Simons, counsel for the plaintiffs and Legal Director for ERI, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s decision discounted this evidence, and it depends entirely on assuming that the manager who oversaw the construction of the Bhopal plant\u2014who said he worked for Union Carbide\u2014didn\u2019t really know who he worked for,\u201d Simons stated.\n\n\u201cThese families have been living with Union Carbide pollution for decades,\u201d stated co-counsel Rajan Sharma of the New York law firm Sharma & DeYoung. \u201cWe remain committed to seeking the justice that they deserve.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, UCC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Chemical.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThese families have been living with Union Carbide pollution for decades.
