Republicans will hold majorities in both houses for the first time in Obama\u2019s presidency when the next Congress convenes on Saturday.\n\nObama has vetoed only two bills since he took office in 2009, according to Senate records. That\u2019s the fewest number of vetoes since President Warren G. Harding used six from 1921-1923. \"I haven't used the veto pen very often since I've been in office. Now, I suspect, there are going to be some times where I've got to pull that pen out,\u201d Obama said in the interview, conducted by NPR before the president left for Christmas vacation in Hawaii. \"I'm going to defend gains that we've made in health care. I'm going to defend gains that we've made on environment and clean air and clean water.\"\n\nPhoto: Reuters\n\nEven though the GOP will control both houses of Congress in January, they would need a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate to overturn an Obama veto. If members voted along party lines, Republicans couldn\u2019t overcome a veto since they will have 54 percent of the seats in the Senate and about 57 percent in the House.\n\nIncoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., indicated that he would work with Democrats on jobs bills. \"Bipartisan jobs bills will see the light of day and will make it to the president's desk, and he'll have to make decisions about ideology versus creating jobs for the middle class,\" he told the AP. \"There's a lot we can get done together if the president puts his famous pen to use signing bills rather than vetoing legislation his liberal allies don't like.\"\n\nChanges to Obamacare, ranging from tweaks to a full repeal of the health care law, are also among Republican priorities. But the GOP would need Democrats to vote with them to withstand an Obama veto. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, suggested earlier this year that it is in Democrats' interest to side with Republicans on Obamacare if they want to keep their jobs.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that unifies politicians of both parties, you know, their top priority is preserving their own hide,\u201d Cruz told ABC. \u201cAnd if enough congressional Democrats realize they either stand with Obamacare and lose, or they listen to the American people and have a chance at staying in office, that\u2019s the one scenario we could do it in 2015. If not, we\u2019ll do it in 2017.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obama veto threat, obama vetoes, how many times has obama used a veto, obama veto, president veto, how many vetoes obama, obama vetos, how many vetos obama, presidential vetoes, will obamacare be repealed, obama veto pen, obama vetoe, obama vetoe pen", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "The president has only used his veto pen twice in his presidency, but vetoes should be more frequent with a Republican majority in Congress.", "title": "Obama Veto Threats: President Warns He'll Use Pen If Congress Rolls Back Obamacare, Environmental Regulations", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obama-veto-threats-president-warns-hell-use-pen-if-congress-rolls-back-obamacare-1768556", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/12/29/obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president has only used his veto pen twice in his presidency, but vetoes should be more frequent with a Republican majority in Congress.", "title": "Obama Veto Threats: President Warns He'll Use Pen If Congress Rolls Back Obamacare, Environmental Regulations", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obama-veto-threats-president-warns-hell-use-pen-if-congress-rolls-back-obamacare-1768556", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/12/29/obama.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/12/29/obama.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2014-12-29T08:10:34-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-29T08:39:59-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The president has only used his veto pen twice in his presidency, but vetoes should be more frequent with a Republican majority in Congress."}, "article_summary": "U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s veto pen will get more active in the new Congress if the body tries to roll back Obamacare or loosen environmental regulations, the president warned in an NPR interview scheduled to air Monday, the Associated Press reported.\n\"I haven't used the veto pen very often since I've been in office.\nBut the GOP would need Democrats to vote with them to withstand an Obama veto.\nPhoto: ReutersEven though the GOP will control both houses of Congress in January, they would need a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate to overturn an Obama veto.\nRepublicans will hold majorities in both houses for the first time in Obama\u2019s presidency when the next Congress convenes on Saturday."}
