Rick Perry (R-TX) at the 2014 Americans for Prosperity conservative summit.\n\nAnti-government activists and petrochemical billionaires Charles and David Koch and their network of political organizations spent an estimated $300 million to push conservative candidates and causes in 2014 \u2014 and plan to spend almost $900 million to do the same thing in the 2016 cycle. But in an interview published Tuesday, Charles Koch dismissed claims that he has much political power as \u201cludicrous,\u201d asking, \u201cif I had all this power, why aren\u2019t [the many things I would change] getting changed?\u201d\n\nHis statement suggests that he lacks political power \u2014 but he and his brother have built and bankrolled a network of political organizations that rival the size of any political party.\n\nThe elder Koch made the argument in an exclusive interview with Washington Post national reporter Matea Gold, one of a small number of journalists invited to cover select portions of the brothers\u2019 Freedom Partners conference for wealthy conservative donors and Republican presidential hopefuls this past weekend at the St. Regis Monarch Beach luxury resort in California.\n\nAsked what he says to those \u201cwho believe you have too much influence,\u201d Charles Koch told Gold, \u201cwow, believe me, if I had too much, a lot of things would change. Just like the very things we\u2019ve been talking about \u2014 this trend toward a two-tiered society and the trajectory we\u2019re on that\u2019s taking us there and criminal justice.\u201d\n\nBut while Koch is correct that he does not personally control the entire government apparatus, he significantly understates his relative influence in the political system. In the 2012 elections \u2014 the most expensive in the nation\u2019s history \u2014 the Democratic National Committee (about $319 million) and the Republican National Committee (about $404 million) combined to spend less than the Koch network\u2019s promised 2016 budget. President Obama\u2019s entire re-election campaign spent less than $684 million.\n\nThrough Freedom Partners, a tax-exempt \u201cChamber of Commerce,\u201d and American Encore, formerly the Center to Protect Patient Rights, the Kochs helped distribute millions to bankroll conservative political groups. Indeed, part of the reason that the changes Charles Koch would like to see have not come to fruition could be that, seemingly in order to help elect Republican candidates, his groups have funded socially conservative causes that he and his brother claim they are against.\n\nBut the Kochs have also built an operation that in many ways rivals the official Republican Party infrastructure. Their Americans for Prosperity is working to create a \u201cground game\u201d built around voter data, in the style of the vaunted Obama 2012 campaign. Their LIBRE Initiative is actively working to sell the Latino community on free market ideals, while opposing executive action to stop deportation of undocumented families. Their Generation Opportunity has catfished millions of millennials who liked abstract concepts like \u201cbeing American\u201d and \u201cthe Constitution\u201d on Facebook. And their various entities spent heavily to defeat Democratic Senators in 2014 and give Republicans a majority in both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe brothers\u2019 influence with Republican candidates is evident by the number of them who have flocked to Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity events, earnestly seeking their support. Now Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) promised a Koch group last year that if the GOP won a majority, it wouldn\u2019t waste time debating \u201cgosh darn\u201d minimum wage increases. The chairman of the Senate Small Business committee has publicly hailed Charles and David Koch as among the \u201cmost patriotic Americans\u201d ever.\n\nAnd while President Obama, who the Kochs and their organizations spent millions to try to defeat in 2012, has provided a check against Koch-backed efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, deregulate fossil fuels, and tax cuts for the wealthy, the congressional majority the Kochs helped elect have already advanced the brothers\u2019 agenda. Just last month, it allowed the expiration of the Export-Import Bank\u2019s charter, at the urging of Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity. The latter group hailed it as \u201ca major win for taxpayers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Wow, believe me, if I had too much , a lot of things would change.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"Wow, believe me, if I had too much [power], a lot of things would change.\"", "title": "Charles Koch: I Don\u2019t Have Too Much Power Because I Don\u2019t Completely Control The Government", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/08/05/3688184/charles-koch-not-much-power/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/05112006/RickPerryAFP.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Wow, believe me, if I had too much [power], a lot of things would change.\"", "creator": "@jeisrael", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/05112006/RickPerryAFP-321x214.jpg", "title": "Charles Koch: I Don\u2019t Have Too Much Power Because I Don\u2019t Completely Control The Government", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/05112006/RickPerryAFP.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/05112006/RickPerryAFP.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-05T12:15:03+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joshisraelinvestigates"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3291\"", "article_summary": "Politics Charles Koch: I Don\u2019t Have Too Much Power Because I Don\u2019t Completely Control The Government CREDIT: AP Photo/LM Otero Former Gov.\nAsked what he says to those \u201cwho believe you have too much influence,\u201d Charles Koch told Gold, \u201cwow, believe me, if I had too much, a lot of things would change.\nRick Perry (R-TX) at the 2014 Americans for Prosperity conservative summit.\nThe chairman of the Senate Small Business committee has publicly hailed Charles and David Koch as among the \u201cmost patriotic Americans\u201d ever.\nJust last month, it allowed the expiration of the Export-Import Bank\u2019s charter, at the urging of Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity."}
