Most mornings she\u2019s up at 5:30, answering emails and finalizing plans for the day ahead.\n\n\u201cAnd then it\u2019s family time,\u201d she says. \u201cI have two school age kids, so after I get them ready for their own day we always sit down to a nice family breakfast.\u201d\n\nOnce at the modern 53,000-square-foot center, Licht plunges into a nonstop round of seeing patients in the clinic, managing administrative matters, taking calls for birth, pediatric and newborn issues, or meeting with staff members to discuss ongoing projects.\n\nLicht, who graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and has been at the center for nine years, oversees the establishment\u2019s health providers in three departments: family medicine, women\u2019s services and mental health.\n\nHer philosophy about health care has a simple bottom line. \u201cThe patient\u2019s needs should be the centerpiece,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you put the patient first, everything comes together easily, and everybody benefits. The staff and providers are collaborative, caring and unbelievably compassionate, and that fact seeps through to patient relationships. Everybody involved gets great results.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Licht is a remarkable person,\u201d said Pedro Toledo, chief administrative officer. \u201cShe believes deeply that every single person in our community should have access to the care they need to be healthy, whether or not they can afford to pay. She embodies that belief in her work every day.\u201d\n\nPetaluma Health Center is a private, nonprofit corporation and a federally qualified health center committed to providing high-quality primary care to residents of southern Sonoma County, regardless of their ability to pay. The center provides comprehensive primary medical care, integrated behavioral health, health education, community fitness classes and wellness programs.\n\nRevenue is derived largely from two sources: patient/third party fees and grants/donations. And last year, the center was awarded nearly $100,000 in federal grants for its leadership in meeting local and national health care quality standards.\n\nSources of patient fees include Medicare, Medi-Cal, other public insurance, private insurance and self pay/uninsured. The Affordable Health Care Act, combined with a vigorous enrollment program at the center, resulted in significant changes to the latter two categories between 2013 and 2014. The fee percentage derived from private insurance jumped from 12.44 to 30 percent; self pay/uninsured fee sources declined from 48.5 to 20 percent.\n\n\u201cSome of our patients are indigent or noncitizens,\u201d Licht said. \u201cWe receive some government funding to help people who have no funds; we have a sliding scale program that takes income into account; and we utilize other programs. Our only goal as a nonprofit is to break even. Any supplement we get goes into providing care for all.\u201d\n\nAnd Petaluma Health Center continues to increase care for all, recently opening school-based clinics at Petaluma\u2019s Casa Grande and San Antonio high schools, as well as at Santa Rosa Junior College.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doubling in size in 2015,\u201d Toledo said, \u201copening a 35,000-square-foot facility in Rohnert Park. We\u2019re currently doing 120,000 patient visits per year, but we\u2019ll jump to 200,000 12 months after we open. Rohnert Park currently has no private doctors. It\u2019s the only city in the county without a primary clinic, but not for long.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit stressful,\u201d Licht said. \u201cWe\u2019re busy recruiting, looking for more health care providers, and we\u2019re continuing to innovate around how we can meet the needs of our patients \u2014 technology in telemedicine, empowering nurses to be more active team members in outpatient services. We now have patient navigators to help patients make their way through the complicated health care systems.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s no surprise that Dr. Nurit Licht, the energetic chief medical officer", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "Dr. Nurit Licht oversees Petaluma Health Care's health providers in three departments: family medicine, women\u2019s services and mental health.", "title": "Sonoma Gives: A belief that everyone deserves care", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/3348134-181/sonoma-gives-a-belief-that", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=wchdR4XpIqdMS_WDjKsiTc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYuyR8g58NSkjwUAjsuBNh6WWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2015-01-23T15:59:01-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb407\"", "article_summary": "The center provides comprehensive primary medical care, integrated behavioral health, health education, community fitness classes and wellness programs.\nHer philosophy about health care has a simple bottom line.\nWe now have patient navigators to help patients make their way through the complicated health care systems.\nShe embodies that belief in her work every day.\u201dPetaluma Health Center is a private, nonprofit corporation and a federally qualified health center committed to providing high-quality primary care to residents of southern Sonoma County, regardless of their ability to pay.\nAnd last year, the center was awarded nearly $100,000 in federal grants for its leadership in meeting local and national health care quality standards."}
