(We will, below.) She just ends with this lament:\n\nThis State of the Union address not only reached a huge audience, but set the tone of Obama\u2019s legacy as well as his plan to address other issues in his last year as president. Leaving out the recent attacks on reproductive rights, and how he will continue to address them, seems like an unsettling oversight.\n\nAs always, context is imperative. The Abortion Establishment and its many blogosphere defenders are on High Alert. They read some (not all) of the tea leaves the same way we do and their antennae are listening for any evidence of less than 100% total and absolute commitment to their radical agenda.\n\nFor instance, NARAL trashed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Ca.) today for saying in an interview that she is not for abortion on demand or for abortion used as a method of birth control. Sounds like \u201ctwisted GOP talking points,\u201d even if Pelosi raised them only to say she disagrees with them.\n\nAnd then there is the aforementioned Obama veto of H.R. 3762. No fanfare, no whoop de doo, just a quiet veto message. That (as they say) did not go unnoticed.\n\nThen there was the DEFCON 1 response to Democratic National Committee chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019s answer to a question about younger women and their, ahem, lack of enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton. As you may remember from NRL News Today, Wasserman Schultz was asked by the New York Times Magazine\n\nDo you notice a difference between young women and women our age in their excitement about Hillary Clinton? Is there a generational divide?\n\nTo which Wasserman Schultz responded:\n\nHere\u2019s what I see: a complacency among the generation of young women whose entire lives have been lived after Roe v. Wade was decided.\n\nTalk about stirring a hornet\u2019s nest\u2026\n\nMy point is a very, very simple one. We are told a hundred times a day and two hundred times on Sunday that being pro-abortion is a winning position for candidates, including presidential candidates.\n\nThat isn\u2019t true, and never has been. Why else bundle abortion up into \u201creproductive health,\u201d except to make it easier for the likes of Hillary Clinton to make the preposterous argument that if you are against abortion you are really against Pab smears.\n\nI understand the abortion crowd\u2019s hypersensitivity. Why? Because they have plenty to be worried about.\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Dave Andrusko is the editor of National Right to Life News and an author and editor of several books on abortion topics.
