Monday, Dec. 23, is Fest­ivus, the Sein­feld-birthed hol­i­day where you tra­di­tion­ally gath­er around an alu­min­um pole, par­ti­cip­ate in feats of strength, and air griev­ances about one an­oth­er. The Cost­anza-pro­claimed “fest­ivus for the rest of us” is already be­ing cel­eb­rated in state cap­it­als across Amer­ica. And now at least one U.S. sen­at­or is get­ting on board.

Start­ing this morn­ing, Sen. Rand Paul of Ken­tucky has hopped on the griev­ances train, air­ing on Twit­ter everything that peeves him about life in Wash­ing­ton and the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment. Most of the griev­ances come as slightly altered ver­sions of his more stand­ard anti-Fed, anti-big-gov­ern­ment talk­ing points. But that’s not all that’s both­er­ing Paul.

Here are some of the more non­polit­ic­al high­lights:

“I can nev­er re­mem­ber when to move my car for DC street clean­ing.”

“The Sen­ate cafet­er­ia nev­er has bur­goo.”

“Griev­ance with my oth­er­wise won­der­ful staff: leave the tur­tle­neck alone. I like it and so do view­ers.”

“Too many people wear­ing ties on TV as it is.”

“One more Fest­ivus griev­ance about bi­par­tis­an­ship. @Cory­Book­er doesn’t RT me enough.”

In re­sponse to that last dig, the Sen­ate’s new­est mem­ber chal­lenged Paul to “feats of strength” on the Sen­ate floor.
