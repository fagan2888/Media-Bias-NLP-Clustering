Then his supervisor arrived to check out the scene.\n\nHe was bitten as soon as he got out of his vehicle.\n\n\u201cIt's sad for the dogs,\u201d one neighbor told News 9. \u201cIt's the owners, it's really not the dogs, it's just the owners that don't pay attention to them,\u201d she explained.\n\nOfficers said they could not tell which dogs were responsible for which bites because they operated as a pack.\n\n\u201cIt's always a risk and we train our officers to recognize that,\u201d said Lyons. \u201cIn this case, it was very, almost like a surprise attack, he didn't see it coming,\u201d he added.\n\nLyons said both animal welfare employees are going to be okay and the juvenile who was bitten the day before has minor injuries.\n\nAnimal control officers removed the four dogs from the property and the animals will stay in quarantine for 10 days at the animal welfare facility.\n\nThe owner may be able to pick the dogs up after quarantine.\n\nHowever, if animal welfare decides this is a criminal offense, then the case goes before a judge.\n\nAnimal control has not been able to talk to the owners yet.\n\nThey left behind a yellow warning on the door of the home, telling the owners to call them immediately.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Two animal welfare employees with the city of Oklahoma City are recovering from bites they suffered during a dog attack Friday morning.", "author": "Lacie Lowry", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/26759384/dogs-attack-animal-control-officers-during-okc-dog-bite-investigation", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/5114712_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Two animal welfare employees with the city of Oklahoma City are recovering from bites they suffered during a dog attack Friday morning.", "title": "Dogs Attack Animal Control Officers During OKC Dog Bite Investigation"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/5114712_G.jpg", "description": "Two animal welfare employees with the city of Oklahoma City are recovering from bites they suffered during a dog attack Friday morning.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dogs Attack Animal Control Officers During OKC Dog Bite Investigation"}, "wnreadableurl": "dogs-attack-animal-control-officers-during-okc-dog-bite-investigation", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2014/10/10", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,news9.com, news 9, kwtv, pitbulls, Dog attack", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS06", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,news9.com, news 9, kwtv, pitbulls, Dog attack"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde51d\"", "article_summary": "Animal control officers removed the four dogs from the property and the animals will stay in quarantine for 10 days at the animal welfare facility.\n\u201cOut of nowhere, the dogs left the property and charged him and attacked him,\u201d said Trace Lyons with Oklahoma City's Animal Welfare Division.\nWarning left for owners of dogs after attack on animal controlTwo animal welfare employees with the city of Oklahoma City are recovering from bites they suffered during a dog attack Friday morning.\nHowever, if animal welfare decides this is a criminal offense, then the case goes before a judge.\nAnimal control has not been able to talk to the owners yet."}
