They're away from family. And they don't realize that there are these things can happen to you if you don't know the warning signs. Depression is very prevalent among college students, as well as alcohol addiction, drug addiction,\" said Joshua Sanchez, president of Active Minds.\n\nSanchez said there are many resources on campus to help students who need help, but many do not reach out when they need help.\n\nHe also said he hopes the week will not only create awareness, but help start an ongoing conversation on campus regarding mental health.\n\n\"There's negative connotations with (mental health.) People are called crazy or some things of that nature. It's very hurtful and it makes people shut down rather than to open up,\" Sanchez said. \"So if we can open up the dialogue and let people know what's going on now. Let them know that if they need help everybody's here, it's an open community and they can seek help.\"\n\nFor resources visit the Campus Health website here: http://oasis.health.arizona.edu/hpps_oasis_program_resources_agencies_community.htm\n\nMental Health Awareness week events:\n\nMarch 28:\n\nNoon to 1 p.m.: QPR training (suicide prevention training) at the SUMC Agave Room\n\nMarch 29:\n\n11 a.m. to 1 p.m.: CPNP on the mall\n\nNoon to 1 p.m.: Letter home on mall\n\n4 p.m. to 5 p.m.: Student Panel at the SUMC Agave Room\n\n6 p.m. to 6:45 p.m.: Stress busters at the Rec Center\n\nMarch 30:\n\n11 a.m. to 1 p.m.: Depression screening on the mall\n\n6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.: Guest speaker Kevin Breel at the ballroom\n\nMarch 31:\n\n11 a.m. to 1 p.m.: Mental health pledges and hope notes on the mall.\n\nNoon to 1:30 p.m.: QPR training (suicide prevention training) at campus health\n\n5 p.m. to 6 p.m.: Discussion panel at SUMC Santa Cruz Room\n\nApril 1\n\nNoon to 1 p.m.: Yoga at the rec center Larson room and art expression on the mall\n\nCopyright 2016 Tucson News Now.
