Doug (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\n\nIt\u2019s a terrifying thought, being thousands of feet in the air when you or someone nearby experiences a medical emergency. It's a thought all travelers, physicians, and healthcare providers consider each time a plane full of passengers with varying health conditions and concerns takes off. Luckily, a new article published in the New England Journal of Medicine examines the situation, and offers important advice for medical professionals about dealing with in-flight medical emergencies. It also has some helpful tips for travelers \u2014 tips that may end up saving a life.\n\nThe article explains that the number of medical emergencies on flights are likely underreported, with varying statistics available on the matter. The most deadly in-flight emergency is cardiac arrest, though: While it is responsible for only 0.3 percent of incidents, it has caused 86 percent of deaths. This mortality rate is despite regulations that require the presence of a defibrillator on planes.\n\nOften, doctors or nurses on flight will have no equipment at all, and this is why senior author Dr. William J. Brady, of the University of Virginia School of Medicine, urges them to think ahead.\n\n\u201cWe want physicians to think in advance about a situation,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cYou\u2019re on a small commuter plane, you\u2019re on a large transoceanic flight, whatever. Something happens. Think about the way you\u2019re going to approach that.\u201d\n\nThe article goes on to address a host of scenarios, including psychiatric emergencies, stroke, trauma, and contagious diseases. Though there is no possible way for an airline to prepare for all kinds of emergencies, it\u2019s best to learn about the most common and deadly.\n\n\u201cYou need to be intelligent,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not feeling well, if you\u2019re ill, if you\u2019re just getting over an illness, if you\u2019re just developing an illness, if you\u2019ve been injured on the way to the airport or recently, if you\u2019ve just had surgery, in situations like that you need to realize that you\u2019re going up in an environment that can be compromising medically.\u201d\n\nThough the piece goes into detail about different factors of medical emergencies, including legal ramifications and in-flight procedures, travelers can protect themselves against emergencies, too; being self-aware is key. Brady warns that even with appropriate cabin pressure, the amount of oxygen in an aircraft is lower, which could cause physiological stress. He pointed out that those who have just undergone surgery should not be flying without medical approval, and anyone developing a fever or cough should steer clear of flights for both their own and others\u2019 sake.\n\n\u201cBe smart,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t get on an aircraft and have a bad event occur just because you\u2019re in a rush to get somewhere.\u201d\n\nSource: Campion EW, Nable JV, Tupe CL, Gehle BD, Brady WJ.
