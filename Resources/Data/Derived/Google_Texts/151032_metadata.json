Collyer found that the House had made a compelling case that suing the White House was the only way to preserve its constitutional power to control federal spending and stop the administration from distributing $136 billion in insurance company subsidies that Republicans say Congress never approved.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives as an institution would suffer a concrete, particularized injury if the Executive were able to draw funds from the Treasury without a valid appropriation,\u201d Judge Collyer said in her 43-page decision.\n\nShe said the merits of the claim would be determined in a later proceeding. But her decision, if it withstands appeal, would mark the first time the House has been able to challenge an administration in court over its spending power.\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner had pressed the lawsuit both as a way to attack the health care law and to underscore what congressional Republicans say is a pattern by the Obama administration of exceeding its authority on a range of issues including health care, immigration and pollution controls.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s unilateral change to Obamacare was unprecedented and outside the powers granted to his office under our Constitution,\u201d Mr. Boehner said in a statement after the ruling. \u201cI am grateful to the court for ruling that this historic overreach can be challenged by the coequal branch of government with the sole power to create or change the law.\u201d\n\nThe judge dismissed another challenge to the law by the House, finding that the House\u2019s claim that the Obama administration had improperly moved the deadlines for new employer requirements without congressional action did not rise to a level that justified a court fight.\n\nThe Justice Department, which had argued that the dispute amounted to a political disagreement that should be settled outside of the legal system, said it would appeal. The White House had anticipated that it could lose at the lower court level and said it expected the decision to be overturned.\n\n\u201cThe law is clear that Congress cannot try to settle garden-variety disputes with the executive branch in the courts,\u201d said Jennifer Friedman, a White House spokeswoman. \u201cThis case is just another partisan attack \u2014 this one, paid for by the taxpayers \u2014 and we believe the courts will ultimately dismiss it.\u201d\n\nOther legal experts warned the decision could have far-reaching consequences if upheld.\n\n\u201cThis decision would be a radical expansion of the role of unelected judges to resolve disputes that are essentially political,\u201d said Walter Dellinger, who served as acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration. \u201cThe Supreme Court has not gone down that road before, and I doubt they will go down that road now.\u201d\n\nJudge Collyer, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, said her decision would \u201copen no floodgates, as it is inherently limited by the extraordinary facts of which it was born.\u201d\n\nBut she allowed that her ruling broke new ground, since existing precedents provided no clear path.\n\nThe usual congressional responses to executive actions said to be in conflict with laws will not suffice, she said.\n\nThe administration had suggested, for instance, that Congress could cut off funding if it was dissatisfied. Judge Collyer wrote, quoting from a House brief, that the administration was \u201capparently oblivious to the irony\u201d of its position.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe ruling in U.S. House of Representatives v. Sylvia Mathews Burwell came after the Supreme Court in June upheld a key element of the law and dismissed a challenge that threatened the very underpinnings of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA final ruling in favor of the House in the new lawsuit could undermine the health law and drive up costs for consumers if health insurance companies lose the federal aid or if replacement aid is not found, but it is not seen as having the same capacity to make the health law unworkable.\n\nMore than half of all the people with coverage purchased through public insurance exchanges \u2014 5.6 million people out of a total of 9.9 million \u2014 receive those cost-sharing reductions, which lower their out-of-pocket costs for doctors\u2019 services, hospital care and prescription drugs. Without that assistance, many of them would have difficulty paying their share of medical bills.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies must reduce co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for some people in health plans purchased through the exchanges. The federal government reimburses insurers for the \u201ccost-sharing reductions.\u201d\n\nThe fight over the employer mandate was initially the central claim in the Republican lawsuit that was strongly opposed by House Democrats when the suit was authorized by a partisan vote in the House in 2014.\n\nBut Republicans shifted their focus to the spending issue when the flow of money was first noticed by staff members at the House Energy and Commerce Committee who could not identify any congressional act approving the money. Congress had rejected a budget request for the funds.\n\nThe administration later said it determined the budget request was unnecessary, and supporters of the Affordable Care Act say language in the law states clearly that government reimbursement to private insurance companies to help cover health care premiums is mandatory and not subject to Congress\u2019s annual spending bills.\n\nRepublicans argued that the Constitution clearly gave Congress the \u201cpower of the purse\u201d as its strongest weapon against an aggressive executive branch, and Judge Collyer said that balance needed to be maintained.\n\n\u201cThis constitutional structure would collapse, and the role of the House would be meaningless, if the Executive could circumvent the appropriations process and spend funds however it pleases,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150909182834, "twitter": {"description": "The decision is a new legal threat to the health care law and gave congressional
