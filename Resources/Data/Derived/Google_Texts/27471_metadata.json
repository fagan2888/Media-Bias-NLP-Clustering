After winning a VA claim or appeal, be sure to safeguard past-due benefits.\n\nMany veterans find themselves with a substantial sum of past-due benefits, often ranging from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many veterans haven\u2019t dealt with large sums of money before, and so they make a couple of mistakes.\n\nFirst, they tell everyone how much money the VA paid them.\n\nSecond, they rush out and spend the money.\n\nI advise my clients not to tell family and friends about the amount of past-due benefits unless they need to know to help render assistance. Money causes tension inside the family more than anywhere else.\n\nUnless a family member is a caregiver or your spouse or your accountant, and needs to know how much money for some reason to help you, there\u2019s no need to tell them.\n\nDon\u2019t make any major changes until you have consulted with trusted financial planners.\n\nFor example, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to run out and immediately pay off the house until you\u2019ve consulted with a financial planner and an accountant to make sure that is the smartest way to use that money.\n\nUltimately, however, I am not a financial planner so please don\u2019t think I\u2019m giving you financial advice \u2014 I am trying to open your mind to a bigger picture that folks aren\u2019t often aware of.\n\nYes, your bills have been piling up, and you need to take care of those.\n\nAfter that, set aside an emergency fund with some of the money, and set up a cushion of 2-3 months (my family shoots for a six-month cushion) of living expenses in case something really bad happens.\n\nConsider putting the rest in an interest-bearing and low-risk account for 90 days while you talk to several financial planners and tax planners \u2014 you don\u2019t need to spend gobs of money to do this \u2014 and get an idea what your options are.\n\nThere are a lot of folks who prey on people who have come into \u201cnew money\u201d \u2014 most of them having to do with some sort of insurance or pyramid marketing scheme.\n\nDon\u2019t fall for it. Put your money in a secure savings vehicle, and let it cool while you figure out your options.\n\n2. Be sure you are signed up for direct deposit from the VA.\n\nSign up for direct deposit through the VA; a form should be included in your award packet.\n\nYou can also sign up over the phone: call 800-827-1000 and wait for the prompts. Or go to eBenefits and sign up there too.\n\nDirect deposit ensures that you will get your benefits automatically deposited to your bank account, and you don\u2019t have to worry about \u201clost checks\u201d from the VA.\n\nRemember, these clowns lose your paperwork all the time; don\u2019t be surprised when they \u201close\u201d a paper check.\n\n3. Consider whether you should enroll in VA health care.\n\nIf you were just granted service-connection, you are likely entitling to some degree of VA medical care.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t want to use the VA medical care, consider enrolling now.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to do it now, for one thing.\n\nSecond, if something catastrophic happens, you want to have the option to get medical care through the VA instead of being charged $26 for an aspirin by a private hospital.\n\nOne time you might not want to enroll in VA medical care is if you\u2019d rather get treatment at a private doctor, and live in a state that opted into the Obamacare Medicaid expansion \u2014 if you are enrolled in VA medical care, you cannot get insurance through the Medicaid expansion. For folks who are scared to death of getting treated at the VA, this might be one time you don\u2019t want to enroll in VA health care.\n\nDid you know that if you have private insurance, and seek care at the VA medical center, in most cases, you can\u2019t be balance-billed?\n\nThe VA will submit the claim, and if your insurance only pays a portion of it, they can\u2019t bill you for the difference. I\u2019m not saying you should do this, just letting you know it\u2019s an option to consider.\n\n4. Sign up for additional benefits after winning a VA claim.\n\nThere are additional benefits that you should start researching: vocational rehab, education benefits, life insurance, automobile and housing adaptation grants for mobility access, and so on.\n\nOne of my biggest regrets was not taking advantage of the VA Voc Rehab program when I was in law school.\n\nInstead of getting VA assistance for things like paying for the bar exam, I am sitting on a mountain of law-school debt.\n\n5. Research state benefits for disabled veterans.\n\nMost, if not all, states have benefits for disabled veterans.\n\nThe qualifications for state veterans benefits vary from state to state, but examples of benefits range from property tax reductions to free hunting licenses.\n\nIn Texas, for example, disabled veterans can apply to their tax appraisal district for a reduction in their property tax based on the percentage of their disability.\n\n6. Appeal for the correct effective date and/or challenge the impairment rating.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to make sure that the VA granted the correct impairment rating and effective date.\n\nIn less than 5% of the cases I\u2019ve seen, the VA has gotten the effective date correct. If you aren\u2019t sure, contact an attorney to do a claim review to see if the VA established the correct effective date.\n\nAnother area that the VA repeatedly messes up is special monthly compensation, which it is one of the hardest areas of VA law to \u201cget,\u201d so I\u2019m not too hard on the VA for messing it up.\n\nHowever, SMC could add anywhere from $93 to $2000 to your monthly benefits check and increase the past-due amounts that the VA owes you.\n\n7. File VA claims for increase.\n\nDid your condition worsen while the claim was pending?\n\nIn theory, the impairment rating should be based on the most up-to-date medical records and assessments available.\n\nHowever, the VA takes so long to issue a decision after a compensation and pension exam that many conditions can worsen during that same time period. File a claim for increase as soon as you believe your condition has worsened.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget, if you are hospitalized for your now service-connected condition, you might be eligible for a temporary total disability rating (100%).\n\nMore from Veterans Law Blog", "article_metadata": {"description": "You aren\u2019t finished after your VA claim goes through.", "author": "Chris Attig", "og": {"site_name": "Task & Purpose", "description": "You aren\u2019t finished after your VA claim goes through.", "title": "7 Things Vets Need To Do After Winning A VA Claim", "url": "http://taskandpurpose.com/7-things-vets-need-to-do-after-winning-a-va-claim", "image": {"width": 1901, "identifier": "http://taskandpurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22875471_BG1.jpg", "height": 1064}, "updated_time": "2016-02-05T15:31:13-04:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Task & Purpose", "creator": "@VetLaw_US", "image": {"src": "http://taskandpurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22875471_BG1-840x470.jpg"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@taskandpurpose"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1421504204768133, "pages": 628773943837250}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/taskandpurpose", "section": "Veterans Benefits", "tag": "Veterans Law Blog", "published_time": "2016-01-21T05:00:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-05T15:31:13-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "45s8zBDqMhlmkEcgm8pUUY88-l4aTt2YKnxw7HIKQKE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Here are seven things to think about after winning a VA claim.\nIf you were just granted service-connection, you are likely entitling to some degree of VA medical care.\nThe qualifications for state veterans benefits vary from state to state, but examples of benefits range from property tax reductions to free hunting licenses.\nAfter winning a VA claim or appeal, be sure to safeguard past-due benefits.\nSign up for additional benefits after winning a VA claim."}
