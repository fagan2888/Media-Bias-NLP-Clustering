For colorblind artist Neil Harbisson in London, U.K., he perceives color in a different way \u2014 through listening. Harbisson is able to pick up color frequencies through the \u201ceyeborg,\u201d a wearable device implanted into his skull that transforms colors into sound vibrations.\n\n\u201cHearing colors changes the way you see everything. I started perceiving colors through sound and the eyeborg soon became part of my body,\u201d Harbisson says in the Vimeo video \u201cThe Man Who Hears Colors, Even In His Dreams.\u201d He added: \u201cMy body and technology have united.\u201d\n\nHarbisson has never been able to see color (only seeing shades of gray) before because he suffers from a visual condition called achromatopsia or total color blindness. This is a non-progressive and hereditary visual disorder which is characterized by decreased vision, light sensitivity, and the absence of color vision, says the National Institutes of Health. In the U.S. it affects about 1 in every 33,000 people.\n\nThis compelled Harbisson and cyberneticist Adam Montandon to come together to develop the electronic eye. Harbisson\u2019s eyeborg is able to process the color frequency of the item that passes in front of it, which turns it into a sound frequency and passes the information to a chip installed at the back of his head. This is how he is then able to hear the color through the sound waves that are produce as they pass from the bones of the skill to his inner ear.\n\nIn 2012 during Harbisson\u2019s TED Talk, he stated: \"At the start, I had to memorize the names you give for each color, so I had to memorize the notes, but after some time this information became a perception. I didn't have to think about the notes, and after some time this perception became a feeling.\"\n\nNow he has the ability to translate songs and speeches into colors using sound frequencies. For example, Justin Bieber's \"Baby\" is full of bubble gum pinks and neon yellows. Moreover, he is able to visualize colors that the human eye cannot visual such as infrared and ultraviolet colors. Harbisson says he has even started to dream in color as he hears the electronic sounds in his sleep, even if the device isn\u2019t on.\n\nHarbisson has been claimed to be the first recognized cyborg in the world with his passport photo now including his device. He continues to be an active in the Cyborg Foundation he founded in 2010. It\u2019s an international organization that helps others to permanently implant technology into their bodies.\n\nHe says \u201cpeople will start using technology as part of the body in order to perceive more and extend senses.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "colorblind, artist, neil, harbisson, hears, color, wearable, technology, implanted, skull", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Colorblind artist Neil Harbisson has been claimed to be the first recognized cyborg in the world after being able to listen to color, even in his dreams.", "title": "Colorblind Artist Listens To Color To Paint Symphonies [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/colorblind-artist-neil-harbisson-hears-color-wearable-technology-implanted-skull-340880", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/01/colorblind-artist-neil-harbisson-hears-color-wearable-technology-implanted-skull.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Colorblind artist Neil Harbisson has been claimed to be the first recognized cyborg in the world after being able to listen to color, even in his dreams.", "title": "Colorblind Artist Listens To Color To Paint Symphonies [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/colorblind-artist-neil-harbisson-hears-color-wearable-technology-implanted-skull-340880", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/01/colorblind-artist-neil-harbisson-hears-color-wearable-technology-implanted-skull.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/01/colorblind-artist-neil-harbisson-hears-color-wearable-technology-implanted-skull.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-04T12:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-04T12:14:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Colorblind artist Neil Harbisson has been claimed to be the first recognized cyborg in the world after being able to listen to color, even in his dreams."}, "article_summary": "Harbisson is able to pick up color frequencies through the \u201ceyeborg,\u201d a wearable device implanted into his skull that transforms colors into sound vibrations.\nFor colorblind artist Neil Harbisson in London, U.K., he perceives color in a different way \u2014 through listening.\nHe says \u201cpeople will start using technology as part of the body in order to perceive more and extend senses.\u201d\nHarbisson says he has even started to dream in color as he hears the electronic sounds in his sleep, even if the device isn\u2019t on.\nMoreover, he is able to visualize colors that the human eye cannot visual such as infrared and ultraviolet colors."}
