The refugee was a father of five.\n\nThe suspects \u2014 Devon Grant-Washington, 22, Brandon Jackson, 28, Urocca Guyton, 27, Amin El-Howeris, 26, and Bruce Roberts, 26 \u2014 have been taken into custody.\n\nInvestigators determined that Malual, who was found on the 1100 block of South Xenia Street, had returned home from his job as an RTD bus mechanic and parked outside of his apartment building before he was killed.\n\nThe suspects drove to the complex hoping to shoot a rival gang member who also lived in the complex, with whom the group allegedly had been involved in several Denver-area shootouts in the months before. When Malual arrived home, one of the suspects mistakenly shot him, according to the indictment.\n\nAfter realizing their error, at least one of the suspects fired another five times into an apartment in the complex before the group fled, says the indictment.\n\nMalual came to America six years before his death as he fled with his family from war. His neighbors told The Denver Post that his family could be heard wailing from his apartment after they learned their patriarch was dead.\n\n\u201cMr. Malual and his family have been able to see this first step in a process that may help them get the justice they deserve,\u201d District Attorney George Brauchler said in a statement.\n\nMembers of the district attorney\u2019s cold-case unit, as well as sheriff\u2019s investigators, contributed to the roughly three-year investigation and ensuing arrests.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office and attorney\u2019s office presented the case to a grand jury in June and indictments against the five suspects were returned late last week. All but Roberts, who was charged with first-degree accessory to murder, were charged with first-degree murder.\n\nRoberts is being held in lieu of $50,000 bond while the rest are being held without bail.\n\nThe indictment shows investigators interviewed the five men and other witnesses several times over the past few years working to find out what transpired the morning Malual was killed. Using text-message records and cellphone global positioning system pings, officials determined that the men were in the vicinity of the complex the morning of the slaying, according to the indictment.\n\n\u201cIt was a very difficult, thorough, lengthy investigation,\u201d said Sheriff Dave Walcher, who was undersheriff at the time of the killing and responded to the homicide scene the morning Malual\u2019s body was found. \u201cUsually with homicides, the victim is known by the suspect or there is some kind of connection. There was no kind of connection between the individuals we arrested and the victim. Wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d\n\nWalcher likened the investigation to \u201cputting the pieces of a puzzle together.\u201d He said he vividly remembers the morning Malual was found.\n\n\u201cIt just had one of those feelings that it\u2019s not going to be solved tonight,\u201d he said.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jesseapaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Five men indicted in 2011 Arapahoe County shooting that left Sudanese refugee dead", "title": "Five men indicted in 2011 Arapahoe County shooting that left Sudanese refugee dead", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/29/five-men-indicted-in-2011-arapahoe-county-shooting-that-left-sudanese-refugee-dead/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-29T15:39:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:56:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "An Arapahoe County grand jury last week indicted five men associated with the Crips gang in connection with a 2011 shooting that left a Sudanese war refugee dead, according to the sheriff\u2019s office and court papers.\nThe sheriff\u2019s office and attorney\u2019s office presented the case to a grand jury in June and indictments against the five suspects were returned late last week.\nWrong place at the wrong time.\u201dWalcher likened the investigation to \u201cputting the pieces of a puzzle together.\u201d He said he vividly remembers the morning Malual was found.\nThe indictment shows investigators interviewed the five men and other witnesses several times over the past few years working to find out what transpired the morning Malual was killed.\nHis neighbors told The Denver Post that his family could be heard wailing from his apartment after they learned their patriarch was dead."}
