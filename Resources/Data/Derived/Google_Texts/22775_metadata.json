Kemper County Sheriff James Moore says Boren was a bank teller, and used information from member accounts to sign up for credit cards that she used for herself.\n\n\"She was actually using family members' identities and she was having things sent to her address, and she was actually having things sent to the bank, as well. That's where she worked,\u201d Sheriff Moore says.\n\nWith Christmas right around the corner Sheriff Moore says Boren maxed out several credit cards on Christmas items- mainly children's toys.\n\n\"She does have two young children. I know there were some things bought, toys and different things for the kids. I don't know what all she ended up spending the money on,\u201d Moore says. \u201cWe have obtained some of the credit cards that were used but there is still some money that hasn't been recouped yet.\"\n\nThis recent case is just one example of how someone can target your information. So what can you do to protect yourself from identity theft? Sheriff Moore says it's all about paying attention to and keeping up with your bank records.\n\n\"You definitely need to continue to check your credit report. You need to make sure that when you do have credit cards and you buy things that you dispose of your receipts properly,\" Sheriff Moore explains.\n\nKeeping track of every transaction during the holidays might be tough, but Moore says it's important because it doesn't take much for someone to steal your identity.\n\n\"You need to be very careful about how you handle your information, because it only takes a little bit of your personal information to get out, and get into the wrong hands. Then, your identity is gone at that time,\" Moore says.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "One woman has been charged with stealing 13 identities, including some family members.", "language": "english", "author": "Tom Williams", "og": {"description": "One woman has been charged with stealing 13 identities, including some family members.", "title": "Woman Charged with 13 Counts of Identity Theft", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Woman-Charged-with-13-Counts-of-Identity-Theft-286474751.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/B3A/4A7/B3A4A788A3F9439585CAB7943CD9C326", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/FB2/BB8/FB2BB866E6794B52A561CBF848CFB1B7.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "One woman has been charged with stealing 13 identities, including some family members.", "title": "Woman Charged with 13 Counts of Identity Theft", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Woman-Charged-with-13-Counts-of-Identity-Theft-286474751.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Ashley+Boren+fraud.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Woman Charged with 13 Counts of Identity Theft", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Woman Charged with 13 Counts"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcacf0\"", "article_summary": "With Christmas right around the corner Sheriff Moore says Boren maxed out several credit cards on Christmas items- mainly children's toys.\nThat's where she worked,\u201d Sheriff Moore says.\n\u201cWe have obtained some of the credit cards that were used but there is still some money that hasn't been recouped yet.\"\nSheriff Moore says it's all about paying attention to and keeping up with your bank records.\nKemper County Sheriff James Moore says Boren was a bank teller, and used information from member accounts to sign up for credit cards that she used for herself."}
