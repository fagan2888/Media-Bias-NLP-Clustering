Stephen A. Pohl (Photo: File)\n\nA Louisville priest has been placed on administrative leave amid an investigation into child pornography, according to a statement from the Archdiocese of Louisville.\n\nFather Stephen A. Pohl, pastor of St. Margaret Mary Parish at 7813 Shelbyville Road, was put on leave after the Archdiocese said it learned of an investigation about \u201cinappropriate photos of children that have been taken and collected by Father Pohl to determine if he has possessed or distributed child pornography.\u201d\n\nParishioners are being notified this weekend. The Rev. J. Mark Spalding, Vicar General and pastor of Holy Trinity Parish, has been named as the temporary administrator of St. Margaret Mary Parish.\n\n\u201cWe realize that this is a painful situation,\u201d Archbishop of Louisville Joseph Kurtz wrote in a letter to parishioners dated Aug. 14. \u201cAs more information becomes available, we will be in touch about opportunities to address your concerns and questions.\u201d\n\nPohl was ordained in 1985 and has been at the parish since 2008, said Cecelia Price, a spokeswoman for the Archdiocese. Price said she wasn\u2019t aware of any other disciplinary issues facing Pohl.\n\nAt this time, the Archdiocese said it had no other information about the investigation. Price said a cyber-crimes task force is conducting the investigation.\n\n\u201cI hope that the Archdiocese continues to be transparent,\u201d said Jeff Koenig, a local chapter leader of (SNAP) the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, an advocacy and support group.\n\nWhen an allegation about possible child pornography is received, The Archdiocese said the following actions are taken in conformity with its Sexual Abuse Policies.\n\nThe person who has been accused is placed on an administrative leave of absence.\n\nThe Archdiocese submits a report to civil authorities, if not already contacted, and fully cooperates with civil authorities as the investigation proceeds.\n\nThe Archdiocese conducts an internal investigation of the accusation.\n\nAll of these steps are underway, the Archdiocese said.\n\nReporter Chris Kenning can be reached at (502) 582-4697.
