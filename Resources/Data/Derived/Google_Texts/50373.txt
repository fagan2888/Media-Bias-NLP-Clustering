Rico Abreu won the 30th annual Lucas Oil Chili Bowl Nationals Saturday night - a repeat for the 2015 champion.

Abreu took the A Feature and the Golden Driller trophy in 55 laps.

He took to social media to Tweet his take on the win:

I race for those that support and believe in me. I once dreamed of just having a shot at a Golden Driller. To think I now have two!! Unreal! â€” Rico Abreu (@Rico_Abreu) January 17, 2016

Bryan Clauson took second place followed by Zach Daum in third, Jerry Coons in fourth and Kyle Larson in fifth place. Blake Hahn of Sapulpa took eleventh place.

Abreu competes at NASCAR events and is a crowd favorite. The hard-working racer competes in nearly 100 dirt track races a year but says he likes competing on different tracks with different cars.

News On 6's Harold Kuntz interviewed Rico last week about his hopes for a repeat victory.

"If you can win it here, you can win them all and not too many people have won it, and it's just really cool to be on this list," Abreu said.
