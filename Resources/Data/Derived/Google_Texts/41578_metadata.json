Given his oeuvre, I\u2019m supposed to recognize his talent as a filmmaker. Given how revered Allen is in certain circles, I\u2019ve tried to recognize this talent. I\u2019ve tried to believe we can simply work under the delusion that there are two Woody Allens\u2014the brilliant filmmaker and the sexual predator who married his ex-partner\u2019s daughter and has been accused of sexually abusing his own daughter, Dylan Farrow. I have tried, as others have, to compartmentalize art and humanity. I have tried, and it shames me, to believe that certain transgressions can be overlooked in the face of great art.\n\nWe are in the midst of awards season and Woody Allen is being feted, once again, for his latest movie, \u201cBlue Jasmine.\u201d At the Golden Globes, Hollywood\u2019s willful denial of Woody Allen\u2019s tainted history was on full and repulsive display. Allen received the Cecil B. DeMille award for lifetime achievement and Diane Keaton, his one-time muse, his Annie Hall, was there to accept on his behalf. Allen, under the guise of reclusiveness, did not face his adoring public. It is interesting, for lack of a better word, that in her speech on Allen\u2019s behalf, Keaton said, \u201cWoody\u2019s women can\u2019t be compartmentalized.\u201d\n\nAt that same ceremony, Cate Blanchett received a best actress Golden Globe for her role in \u201cBlue Jasmine.\u201d She gushed about Allen\u2019s talent and her gratitude for his call. She did not compartmentalize. She chose art over humanity. Hollywood has long done this where Allen is concerned. The allegations that have followed him for more than 20 years are either dismissed or ignored.\n\nDylan Farrow has now written an eloquent open letter, which New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof posted on his blog. Kristof also devoted his Sunday column to Farrow\u2019s letter and her allegations against Allen. Kristof writes, \u201cAllen\u2019s defenders correctly note that he denies the allegations, has never been convicted and should be presumed innocent.\u201d It\u2019s an odd sort of statement to include from someone who is purportedly supportive of Farrow. Like many public intellectuals, Kristof is demonstrating the appropriate amount of concern while also acknowledging some semblance of reasonable doubt. He wants it both ways.\n\nThere will be a lot of forthcoming conversation from \u201cpublic intellectuals\u201d about Allen, Farrow, the allegations and how we should feel about all of this. There will be a lot of people claiming to know what we cannot possibly know.\n\nThis conversation has, in fact, already begun. For the Washington Monthly, Kathleen Geier commends Dylan Farrow\u2019s bravery but also acknowledges that she is not likely to boycott Woody Allen despite \u201cDylan Farrow\u2019s powerful testimony.\u201d Geier, too, wants it both ways. Her article makes bizarre reference to Kanye West and includes a comment that it was so much easier to condemn R. Kelly than Woody Allen. The entire piece is difficult to parse and demonstrates the challenge of public intellectuals awkwardly grappling with certain topics.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dylan Farrow has written an eloquent letter accusing Woody Allen of abuse.
