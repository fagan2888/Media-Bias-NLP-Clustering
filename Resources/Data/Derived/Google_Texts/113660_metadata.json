Affordable health care is worse than a law that lets slave owners get their runaway slaves back [emphasis added].\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are quotes! I\u2019m not making this stuff up!\u201d he added. \u201cAll this would be funny if it wasn\u2019t so crazy.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s something: a lot of confusion followed the delivery of the president\u2019s remarks after both a Time reporter and the official pool report failed to give the full context of his speech. Both sources failed to make it clear that the president was referring specifically to the O\u2019Brien quote.\n\nFor instance (from the pool report):\n\nYour pooler could see Steny Hoyer\u2019s shoulders bobbing up and down with laughter when Obama took aim at an unnamed Republican lawmaker who, the President said, described the ACA as the most dangerous law ever passed. The president said that meant the lawmaker in question viewed Obamacare as worse than the Fugitive Slave Act. (The president looked over quite a bit at Hoyer, who was sittingin the front row to the left of the podium when looking out to the audience.) And then there\u2019s this:\n\n[blackbirdpie url=\"https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/383252690345525249\"]\n\nBut based on what the president actually said, he was merely having fun with what he characterized as \u201cratcheted up rhetoric\u201d of anti-Obamacare Republicans.\n\nAfter the confusion cleared, the pool reporter sent this update: \u201cYour pooler mischaracterized the President\u2019s reference to the Fugitive Slave Act. Your pooler regrets the mischaracterization.\u201d\n\nThe first Fugitive Slave Act was passed in 1793 and it allowed local governments to track down runaways slaves and return them to their \u201cowners.\u201d The 1793 law also imposed a penalty on anyone caught aiding escaped slaves.\n\nThe second Fugitive Slave Act, passed in 1850, was designed to impose harsher penalties on anyone caught assisting runaway slaves.\n\nCongress formally repealed the highly controversial laws in 1864.\n\nThis article has been updated to more accurately reflect the president\u2019s remarks.\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nFeatured image Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama at an event in Largo, Md., Thursday referenced the Fugitive Slave Acts while mocking opponents of his health care law -- but there's a lot more to this story.
