That\u2019s allowed the advent of Unicorns, the 90 or so companies with market values of $1 billion or more, which have been entirely funded on the private markets.\n\nJaneway sees reason as well as fear behind the behavior, with investors taking multiple bets, each with a relatively low probability of success, but hoping for outsize returns from the very few which do succeed. Which is different of course from saying that the mass of funds put into these companies will collectively earn a respectable return.\n\nIn China, the more than doubling in the Shanghai stock exchange has attracted legions of new investors. Shanghai stocks fell 6.5 percent on Thursday, however, and ended Friday little changed after an early 4 percent drop.\n\nRelated: Arctic Oil Won\u2019t Hit the Market Anytime Soon\n\nNew equity trading accounts rose 433 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to official data, with more than half the accounts set up by investors aged up to their early 30s. The China Household Finance Survey found that more than two thirds of the new investors in equities had not completed high school.\n\nFOMO\n\nMuch of this may be driven by concerns about relative wealth, or how much you have compared to those in your group, a force explored in a 2007 paper by Peter DeMarzo and Ilan Kramer of Stanford University and Ron Kaniel of Duke University.\n\nThey found that even when traders understand that prices are too high they may stay in the market because they fear losing out as the overvaluation persists and extends. \u201cRelative wealth concerns help support the existence of financial bubbles by increasing the risk of trading against the crowd,\u201d the study found. \u201cWhen relative wealth concerns are sufficiently strong, they can promote the creation of price bubbles.\u201d\n\nInvestors want to keep pace with their peers, and fear not having as much wealth. That raises, in a certain way, the risk of selling into a bubble. That status and group-motivated anxiety can blind investors toward other, seemingly obvious risks.\n\nRelated: Guess What Stock Has Run Up 89 Percent in the Last Year\n\nIn some ways, this seems to be more likely to happen in microclimates like Silicon Valley than in a large economy like China. After all, the huge influx of wealth has driven up the cost of most things people would like to buy, like houses, in Silicon Valley, while at the same time recalibrating upwards expectations about what constitutes an acceptable standard of living.\n\nThat is perhaps less true in China where the amount of wealth being generated is far smaller in relation to the economy. This is true, so far as it goes, but investors often get their expectations and sense of what is normal from communities, online or in real life. In these communities, tall, or true, tales of gains serve to drive further investors into risky assets and to make them less sensitive to risks.\n\nJaneway makes a larger point: that often these types of bubbles produce transformative technologies that otherwise would not come into being as quickly. Just as people lost money in railroad shares in the 19th century, or radio stocks in the 1920s, so did the railroad and radio transform modern life.\n\n\u201cThe way to think about financial speculation is that bubbles are banal but every once in a while they are necessary.\u201d\n\nA better strategy might be to put aside fear of being left behind and enjoy the changes the bubbles finance.\n\n(At the time of publication, James Saft did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.
