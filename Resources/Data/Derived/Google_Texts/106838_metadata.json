Pink slime isn't used in chicken nuggets, but what are \"nuggets\" actually made of?\n\n\u201cChicken McNuggets are made with white meat, lightly coated in a tempura batter to ensure that they are crispy on the outside, and juicy and tender in the inside.\u201d At least that's how McDonald\u2019s describes its popular chicken meal on its website. \u201cThey are cooked in a Canola oil blend, which provides 0 grams of trans fat per serving.\u201d\n\nResearchers from the University of Mississippi Medical Center were curious as to what fast food chicken nuggets were really made of. After all, they are incredibly popular in the U.S. In 2011, 50 billion pounds of broiler chickens were raised and sold, according to the National Chicken Council. And, about 50 percent of that meat was made into nuggets and similar products. However, the researchers found that for all this meat sold, much of the chicken nuggets we are served do not contain simply breast meat, as many fast food chains claim.\n\n\u201cStriated muscle (chicken meat) was not the predominate component in either nugget,\u201d the researchers noted in their study. \u201cFat was present in equal or greater quantities along with epithelium, bone, nerve, and connective tissue.\u201d Epithelium is one of the four types of animal tissue, and usually lines cavities and structures throughout the body. The study ultimately concluded that \u201cchicken nuggets are mostly fat, and their name is a misnomer.\u201d\n\nAn earlier study published in the Journal of Food Science and Technology found that up to 30 percent of processed meats are made up of fat. The new study claims that potentially even more than 30 percent of a chicken nugget may be made of fat. Large fast food chains and chicken processors, however, argue that chicken nuggets are made of 100 percent chicken meat and do not contain any disturbing ingredients.\n\n\u201cThe only meat used in McDonald\u2019s Chicken McNuggets is chicken breast meat,\u201d McDonald\u2019s states on its website. \u201cThe white meat is minced before being shaped into nuggets, and then coated with a specially seasoned batter at our trusted suppliers, such as Keystone Foods.\u201d\n\nOn the National Chicken Council\u2019s website, the NCC responds to the question of \u201cWhat\u2019s really in that nugget?\u201d with, \u201cChicken. Meat from a chicken, actually. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\n\nThe NCC, which represents big chicken processors in the U.S., goes on to list myths and facts about chicken nuggets, noting that they are not typically made from mechanically separated chicken; \u201cmeat glue\u201d is not used to hold chicken nuggets together; and that \u201cexperts\u201d like Dr. Casey Owens, associate professor at the Department of Food Science at the University of Arkansas, say \u201cThere is no \u2018pink slime\u2019 in chicken nuggets.\u201d\n\nAs if to make matters worse, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced recently that it would no longer ban processed chicken imports from four Chinese poultry processors. Prevoiusly, chickens were raised then killed in the States, shipped to China to be processed, and then shipped back to the U.S. to be implemented into fast food and pet food products.\n\n\"China does not have the best track record for food safety,\" The New York Times notes, \"and its chicken products in particular have raised questions.\"\n\nAlong with removing the ban, the USDA may be in the process of replacing USDA inspectors on U.S. chicken processing lines with poultry company employees themselves. Although this may seem questionable, the USDA believes these changes, if implemented properly, \"would enable [USDA inspectors] to better fulfill our food safety mission.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chicken nuggets, fast food, pink slime", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers studied the autopsy of chicken nuggets from two U.S. food chains and found they contain things other than simply chicken breast.", "title": "Study Shows Chicken Nuggets Mostly Comprised Of Fat, Not Chicken Meat", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/whats-chicken-nugget-not-pink-slime-also-not-white-breast-chicken-meat-258404", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/28/chicken-nuggets.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers studied the autopsy of chicken nuggets from two U.S. food chains and found they contain things other than simply chicken breast.", "title": "Study Shows Chicken Nuggets Mostly Comprised Of Fat, Not Chicken Meat", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/whats-chicken-nugget-not-pink-slime-also-not-white-breast-chicken-meat-258404", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/28/chicken-nuggets.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/28/chicken-nuggets.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-28T16:53:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-28T16:53:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers studied the autopsy of chicken nuggets from two U.S. food chains and found they contain things other than simply chicken breast."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd22dd\"", "article_summary": "Pink slime isn't used in chicken nuggets, but what are \"nuggets\" actually made of?\nLarge fast food chains and chicken processors, however, argue that chicken nuggets are made of 100 percent chicken meat and do not contain any disturbing ingredients.\n\u201cStriated muscle (chicken meat) was not the predominate component in either nugget,\u201d the researchers noted in their study.\n\u201cThe only meat used in McDonald\u2019s Chicken McNuggets is chicken breast meat,\u201d McDonald\u2019s states on its website.\nHowever, the researchers found that for all this meat sold, much of the chicken nuggets we are served do not contain simply breast meat, as many fast food chains claim."}
