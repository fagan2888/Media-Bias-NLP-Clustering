Obama is also considering taking executive action to close Guantanamo, situated at a U.S. naval station in southeast Cuba, if Congress does not drop its opposition.\n\n\"Our law is really clear,\" Ryan told reporters after a meeting of House Republicans. \"These detainees cannot come to American soil.\"\n\n\"We are making legal preparations if the president tries to break the law,\" Ryan said. \"And what boggles my mind is that the president is contemplating directing the military to knowingly break the law.\"\n\nThe speaker said that Obama is trying to extend the president's executive authority beyond its limits of the U.S. Constitution. Ryan added that not only Republicans but also many in Obama's own Democratic Party oppose detainee transfers to U.S. soil.\n\nDemocrats accused House Republicans of wasting taxpayer dollars on litigation. In recent years the House Republican majority has spent nearly $3 million in this way, said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nHouse Republicans have spent $189,498 since November 2014 on litigation challenging the administration's Obamacare healthcare program, and recently agreed to spend up to $150,000 on legal advice on the possible Guantanamo litigation, Pelosi's office said.\n\nA spokesman for Ryan, Brendan Buck, defended the spending, saying \"we wouldn't have to spend so much money if the president wasn't overreaching.\"\n\nPelosi's office said that under former House Speaker John Boehner, House Republicans spent $2.5 million defending a law that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples, before the language was struck down by the Supreme Court.\n\n(Reporting by Susan Cornwell; Writing by Eric Walsh; Editing by Susan Heavey, Frances Kerry and Steve Orlofsky)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Susan Cornwell", "Author": "Susan Cornwell", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans in the House of Representatives are preparing legal action in case President Barack Obama tries to transfer detainees at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay to the United States, House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday.", "title": "House Republicans ready legal fight against Obama's Guantanamo plan", "image": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20160224&t=2&i=1119977183&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXNPEC1N10G", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
