Republicans hold both of the state\u2019s U.S. Senate seats and a 7-to-2 advantage over Democrats in the state\u2019s U.S. House delegation. In Nashville, the GOP holds the governor\u2019s office, 73 of 99 seats in the state House and 28 of 33 seats in the state Senate.\n\nThose are not the numbers of a dying party, Haynes said, but one that is politically dominant.\n\n\u201cObviously, we don\u2019t have the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s going to change.\u201d\n\nNational political analysts have been warning for some time of dark days ahead for the GOP, citing disenchantment with the party among Latino voters, who are gaining influence in the electorate, and among young voters, who tend to have a live-and-let-live attitude when it comes to same-sex marriage and other social issues.\n\nThe doomsday predictions were back in the headlines last week after a pair of U.S. Supreme Court rulings that declared same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states and upheld the government subsidies that more than 8 million Americans have used to help buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 aka, Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans blasted both decisions as examples of judicial overreach. But a CNN poll showed most Americans thought the justices made the right call (63 percent supported the court\u2019s ruling on Obamacare subsidies, 59 percent backed the gay-marriage decision). On gay marriage, polls have consistently shown six out of 10 Americans favor legalizing same-sex unions.\n\nHaynes, who took the reins of the state GOP in April, rejects the narrative that the gap between public opinion and the party\u2019s stance on marriage and other issues is a sign the GOP is out of touch and will eventually see the consequences at the ballot box. If anything, he insists, it shows \u201cwe\u2019re a party that\u2019s big enough to have diverse ideas and different viewpoints.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. John J. Duncan Jr. of Knoxville, the longest-serving member of the state\u2019s congressional delegation, also doubts that GOP opposition to gay marriage, Obamacare or immigration reform will hurt the party at the polls, even in the long run.\n\n\u201cThe social issues are not the biggest issues to most people,\u201d said Duncan, who has served in Congress for more than a quarter-century. \u201cAs you get closer to every election \u2014 and it has been this way for a long, long time \u2014 it\u2019s the economy.\u201d\n\nThe economy, he believes, is one reason Tennessee keeps getting redder and why Republicans have become such a powerhouse in the state. Tennessee, which has one of the lowest tax burdens in the country, has grown more conservative \u2014 and, consequently, more Republican \u2014 as more people relocate there from high-tax states, Duncan said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really benefited from that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe long-term challenge for Republicans will not be red-state elections, but the presidential race, where the Latino population is more influential and is growing, said Bruce Oppenheimer, a Vanderbilt University political scientist who studies elections.\n\n\u201cClearly, at the presidential level, (Republicans) have to worry,\u201d he said.\n\nIn some states with heavy Latino populations, U.S. Senate races also could be a problem for the GOP, Oppenheimer said.\n\nIn Tennessee, the question is not whether the state will remain red \u2014 that is likely for the foreseeable future \u2014 but whether it will keep electing more moderate, establishment Republicans, like Gov. Bill Haslam and U.S. Sens. Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker, or whether the party\u2019s newer, ultraconservative wing will start winning statewide primaries, Oppenheimer said.\n\nAlexander was re-elected last year by fighting off a tea party challenger in a closer-than-expected race.\n\n\u201cThe next go-round could be a different story,\u201d Oppenheimer said.\n\nMichael Collins is the News Sentinel\u2019s Washington correspondent.
