Now we\u2019re starting to see some in-depth analyses of those breaches. In the new issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), there\u2019s a study that concludes that 29 million medical records were compromised between 2010 and 2013.\n\nThe JAMA study also found that six of the breaches involved at least one million records each \u2013 and more than one third of all breaches occurred in just five states: California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois.\n\nThe study was accompanied by an earnest editorial subtitled \u201cThe Importance of Good Data Hygiene.\u201d The authors called for a total overhaul of HIPAA, which they described as \u201cantiquated and inadequate.\u201d They noted that HIPAA doesn\u2019t adequately regulate the use of Protected Health Information (PHI) by \u201cdigital behemoths\u201d like Apple, Google, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIn addition to the JAMA report, our company did an extensive analysis of 2014 data breach trends summarized here. We thoroughly documented 89 of those breaches, and we excluded the huge Community Health Systems breach so it wouldn\u2019t skew the other data. Here are the most important trends we spotted:\n\nNon-digital breaches still a problem \u2013 In the 89 incidents, paper breaches accounted for 9 percent of compromised records in the first half of 2014 \u2013 and 31 percent in the second half. Nearly 200,000 paper records were compromised, plus about 60,000 pieces of individually identifiable health information ranging from lab specimens to x-rays. Obviously, it\u2019s still vitally important to safeguard the confidentiality of non-digital health records. Organizations must clarify and enforce policies and procedures to achieve that goal.\n\nTheft of portables still a concern -- We confirmed the loss or theft of 12 portable computing devices last year \u2013 and the lack of appropriate physical safeguards was a major contributing factor. In addition to taking greater common-sense precautions, organizations should use whole-disk encryption and other technical safeguards to render PHI unusable, unreadable or indecipherable to unauthorized people. Policies and procedures for portable device security need to be clearly communicated to all employees \u2013 and workforce training needs to involve much more than a dry online tutorial.\n\nWatch out for rogue employees and business associates \u2013 We uncovered 45 incidents involving company insiders that resulted in the compromise of nearly half a million records. In other words, about half of all the data breaches were the result of mistakes or malice by an organization\u2019s own people. It\u2019s impossible to prevent every workforce-related breach, but everyone in the organization needs to be on the lookout for unusual activities that could spell trouble. All employees and BAs need to know that the hammer will come down \u2013 swiftly and consistently \u2013 on insiders who intentionally compromise patient data.\n\nNo organization should shout \u201chooray\u201d simply for avoiding an Anthem-scale breach. There are many other incidents \u2013 improper disposal of paper records, misplaced x-rays, employee snooping, and more \u2013 that can still do a lot of financial and reputational damage. Those are the types of breaches that even a HIPAA tech-fix can\u2019t solve.\n\nThese breach trend summaries agree on one main point: healthcare organizations need to constantly assess the maturity of their information risk management programs \u2013 and not view them as a narrowly defined \u201cHIPAA compliance\u201d duty.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the new issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, there's a study that concludes that 29 million medical records were compromised between 2010 and 2013.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare IT News", "description": "In the new issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, there's a study that concludes that 29 million medical records were compromised between 2010 and 2013.", "title": "Shocks and surprises in new breach trend studies", "url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/blog/shocks-surprises-new-breach-trend-studies", "image": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/hitn-defaultlogo-700x357.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-11T13:52:28-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/blog/shocks-surprises-new-breach-trend-studies", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/hitn-defaultlogo-700x357.jpg"}, "description": "In the new issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, there's a study that concludes that 29 million medical records were compromised between 2010 and 2013.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Shocks and surprises in new breach trend studies"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-11T13:52:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-11T13:52:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In addition to the JAMA report, our company did an extensive analysis of 2014 data breach trends summarized here.\nThere are many other incidents \u2013 improper disposal of paper records, misplaced x-rays, employee snooping, and more \u2013 that can still do a lot of financial and reputational damage.\nObviously, it\u2019s still vitally important to safeguard the confidentiality of non-digital health records.\nSince 2010, HHS has documented more than 1,000 major data breaches (where each incident involved the compromise of more than 500 patient records).\nNearly 200,000 paper records were compromised, plus about 60,000 pieces of individually identifiable health information ranging from lab specimens to x-rays."}
