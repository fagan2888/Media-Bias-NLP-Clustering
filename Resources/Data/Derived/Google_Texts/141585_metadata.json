That was the conclusion of a lively, rapid-fire panel Tuesday morning at SXSW Interactive called \u201cHow to Capitalize on Open Data.\u201d\n\nThe panel, assembled by Susan Strausberg, founder of 9W Search and previous founder of Edgar Online, included Aman Bhandari, global director of strategic alliances at Merck and a senior advisor to the U.S. Chief Technology Officer at the White House; data journalist Ashish Patel, founder of The DocGraph Journal; and moderated by Michael Atkin, managing director of the Enterprise Data Management Council.\n\nAtkin started the conversation with a brief history of data, beginning with data tagging and keyword searching which \u201cunshackled\u201d data from previous formats such as spreadsheets. \u201cThis precisely defined the meaning of data as separate knowledge from format, from content.\u201d\n\nThe next big breakthrough was OWL, the Web Ontology Language, which helped people understand the relations between data.\n\nAnd now the data world is developing toward transparency, collaboration, paying for volume and paying for value. Consumer demand of data.\n\nAtkin said venture funding in data was close to $2 billion. The trend is away from legacy systems\u2014governments and industries like healthcare hoarding the data\u2014and toward transparency. This provides a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs to capitalize on data analysis products.\n\nBut, as Strausberg pointed out, there are a lot of mistakes waiting in the opportunity in terms of making sure the data is accurate.\n\nSo the question, Atkin said, is \u201cHow do we deal with intersection of opportunity and chaos?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the healthcare side, entrepreneurs are leading the way to solving the problem and making order out of chaos.\u201d\n\nFrom Silos to Open Data\n\nWhen she came out with Edgar Online, Strausberg said, the reception was negative. \u201cAccountants believe in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely subjective about their own information.\u201d Companies view the new, more open XBRL standards as a burden.\n\nIn healthcare, insurance and other industries where information was previously siloed, panelists said, it is now being shared. But neither those industries, nor the government, have quite figured out what the demand or proper use case for that data will be.\n\n\u201cWhen the Affordable Care Act was passed, there was no chief data officer at Medicare,\u201d said Bhandari. \u201cA year and a half after it passed, now there is a chief data officer. There are new animals in the kingdom that weren\u2019t there before.\u201d And that makes room for entrepreneurs. As Atkin said, we now have the capacity to do data science \u201con hardware you have at home.\u201d\n\nOne of those opportunities, said Patel, comes from interoperability of data management systems. If a patient wants to move his medical records digitally from one medical facility to another with a different data model, it can\u2019t be done.\n\nIn terms of a business model, Atkin said, \u201cData is a factor of input. You don\u2019t make money on factors. You make money on creativity and innovation.\u201d\n\nBilling and healthcare records and patient care research, Bhandari said, are areas on the forefront of data management innovation.\n\nOpportunities and Risks\n\nPrivacy is a factor, of course. When she was running Edgar Online, with millions of users getting alerts on the companies they were following, Strausberg said, only one person asked if they were protecting his privacy. Now privacy is a whole different issue, especially with the risks of criminals and cyberterrorists attacking network security. One audience member has an online prescription ordering firm and recently had a spate of people creating false doctor profiles and prescriptions. Since the company was small, it was able to identify and stop the problem quickly.\n\nWhen she founded Edgar Online, Strausberg said, she and her husband were doing research on over-valued IPOS and learned that the Edgar system of tracking company information was going digitally. \u201cIt was something of Carnac (the Magnificent) moment.\u201d Everyone in the supply chain had been involved in some way in creating the standard. \u201cIt seemed pretty clear to us that this was going to change Wall Street, everthing. We thought \u2018There\u2019s a pony there\u2019 and we, being entrepreneurs are always undaunted by the fact that nobody else is doing something.\u201d\n\nThe powers that be threatened to shut her down, as she expects other legacy data holders to do to entrepreneurs today. But they failed.\n\nData is going to get increasingly open but currently startups may have to get their foot in the door of the data holders by offering added value such as analytics.\n\nAs Bhandari said \u201cThere will never be a better time to be an entrepreneur in health care.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "SiliconHills", "title": "Open Data Offers Huge Opportunity for Entrepreneurs - SiliconHills", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.SILICONHILLSNEWS.COM/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140311_111630-300x225.jpg", "url": "http://www.siliconhillsnews.com/2014/03/12/open-data-offers-huge-opportunity-for-entrepreneurs/", "type": "article"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06f9\"", "article_summary": "This provides a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs to capitalize on data analysis products.\nAtkin started the conversation with a brief history of data, beginning with data tagging and keyword searching which \u201cunshackled\u201d data from previous formats such as spreadsheets.\nData is going to get increasingly open but currently startups may have to get their foot in the door of the data holders by offering added value such as analytics.\nBut, as Strausberg pointed out, there are a lot of mistakes waiting in the opportunity in terms of making sure the data is accurate.\nWhen she founded Edgar Online, Strausberg said, she and her husband were doing research on over-valued IPOS and learned that the Edgar system of tracking company information was going digitally."}
