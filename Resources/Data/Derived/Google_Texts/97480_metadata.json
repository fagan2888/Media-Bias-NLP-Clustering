Conduct effective evaluations. To reduce some of the inherent tensions between business-oriented hospital leaders and physicians, he suggestsed organizations establish clear expectations for physician accountability. In addition, he said organizations must evaluate individual and overall team outcomes as they transition to a value-based care model.

But cultivating effective physician leadership must be a greater priority for organizations that want to thrive in an ever-changing market, Floro argues.\n\n\"By embracing change, organizations will gain a competitive advantage that will position them well to meet the emerging requirements of healthcare's shifting paradigm,\" he wrote.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nACPE: Physician leadership linked to organizational success\n\nPhysician-led ACOs may save more money\n\n3 keys to a successful population health management approach\n\n4 healthcare leadership trends for 2015\n\nPhysicians and business-oriented bosses clash over healthcare\n\nConsolidation in healthcare will continue in 2015", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the\u00a0trend of healthcare consolidation\u00a0shows no signs of slowing down,\u00a0strong physician leadership within an integrated organization can play a major role in determining that organization's success.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As the\u00a0trend of healthcare consolidation\u00a0shows no signs of slowing down,\u00a0strong physician leadership within an integrated organization can play a major role in determining that organization's success.", "title": "3 ways for hospitals to promote physician leadership", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/3-ways-hospitals-promote-physician-leadership/2015-02-03", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Healthcare Consolidation,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Physician Leadership,Population Health Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfcdc\"", "article_summary": "Here's three ways to promote and manage physician leadership, according to Floro:Prioritize patients and performance.\nBut cultivating effective physician leadership must be a greater priority for organizations that want to thrive in an ever-changing market, Floro argues.\nOrganizations should develop physician leaders who pursue patient-centered models of care as well as \"instill unity of purpose among clinicians,\" Floro wrote.\nAs the trend of healthcare consolidation shows no signs of slowing down, strong physician leadership within an integrated organization can play a major role in determining that organization's success.\nTo learn more:- read the articleRelated Articles:ACPE: Physician leadership linked to organizational successPhysician-led ACOs may save more money3 keys to a successful population health management approach4 healthcare leadership trends for 2015Physicians and business-oriented bosses clash over healthcareConsolidation in healthcare will continue in 2015"}
