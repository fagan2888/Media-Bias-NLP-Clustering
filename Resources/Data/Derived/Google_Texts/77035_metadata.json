The new store would open in March.\n\nIt's not clear what would happen to Belk's space at the mall.\n\nThe mall's general manager tells the Daily Record that it could become part of a proposal to land the new Citizens Property Insurance operations center. The insurer is looking for about 226,000 square feet of office space.\n\nCopyright 2014 by Jacksonville Financial News and Daily Record and News4Jax.com. All rights reserved.
