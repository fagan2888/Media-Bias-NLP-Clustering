A search for her replacement is underway.\n\nExecutive Office of Health and Human Services spokesman Michael Raia says Gifford will stay on the job through October to help with the transition. Raia says Gifford is leaving her position in order to be closer to her husband, who works in Washington, D.C.\n\nGifford has led the state health insurance program for the poor for a little over a year, and worked for EOHHS for about three and a half years. During that time, she helped oversee the expansion of Medicaid eligibility under Obamacare. And Raia says she was instrumental in Governor Gina Raimondo\u2019s effort to trim millions of dollars from the program this year.\n\nHer departure comes at a time when several reform efforts are in progress. Her replacement hasn\u2019t been named yet but will oversee an agency that accounts for more than a third of the state\u2019s budget.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "Rhode Island\u2019s Medicaid director, Dr. Deidre Gifford, is stepping down.
