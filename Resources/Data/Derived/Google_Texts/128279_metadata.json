He returned for the fourth and leaped against the out-of-town scoreboard trying to catch a Ryan Braun line drive. Before the fifth, Gonzalez was pulled.\n\n\u201cI took a couple of dry swings and it was sore, so they decided to take me out of the game,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nX-rays were negative for any significant injury. And he is considered day-to-day, the team said. But his hand was heavily wrapped after the game.\n\n\u201cNo bone problems. They said it\u2019s probably just a sprain,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s nothing bad. We have a day off tomorrow, which is nice. So we\u2019ll see how it is when I come back Tuesday.\u201d\n\nWhen the rain finally went away this month, Gonzalez heated up like the Colorado summer. In June, the Rockies\u2019 right fielder more than doubled his season totals for home runs (from four to 10) and RBIs (from 13 to 27).\n\nMore importantly, Gonzalez was playing regularly. Injuries stunted his 2013 and \u201914 seasons to just 180 games combined. But this season, he\u2019s played in 64 of the Rockies\u2019 69 games.\n\nThe Rockies on Sunday started infielder Rafael Ynoa in left field, to give Brandon Barnes a break. Barnes moved into the starting role after Corey Dickerson (left foot inflammation) went back to the disabled list.\n\nIf Colorado loses Gonzalez, they\u2019ll need another outfielder from Triple-A, possibly Kyle Parker or Drew Stubbs.\n\nBut Gonzalez wasn\u2019t too worried about himself.\n\n\u201cRight now I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a problem,\u201d he said.\n\nNick Hundley avoiding cold snap\n\nNick Hundley was 1-for-8 in this homestand before Sunday. But he can live with it after hitting 4-for-4 with two doubles and three runs in Sunday\u2019s series finale. It was his fifth career four-hit game, tying a career high.\n\nHundley was trending downward \u2014 he hit .317 in April, .292 in May, and .239 in June before Sunday. But his average overall is back to .302.\n\n\u201cThis is as consistent as I\u2019ve been in my career,\u201d He said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been able to get hot, but when I get cold, I get real cold. When I slip away a little bit, I can come back quicker and avoid the 0-for-20s.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead\n\nMonday: Off\n\nTuesday: Diamondbacks\u2019 Chase Anderson (3-1, 2.84 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Kyle Kendrick (2-9, 5.95), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Diamondbacks\u2019 Allen Webster (1-1, 6.55) at Rockies\u2019 David Hale (2-2, 5.28), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Diamondbacks\u2019 Rubby De La Rosa (6-3, 4.96) at Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (4-3, 5.47), 1:10 p.m., no TV\n\nFriday: Rockies\u2019 Chad Bettis (3-2, 3.44) at Giants\u2019 TBA, 8:15 p.m., ROOT", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "X-rays negative on Carlos Gonzalez\u2019s hand, but his status is uncertain", "title": "X-rays negative on Carlos Gonzalez\u2019s hand, but his status is uncertain", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/21/x-rays-negative-on-carlos-gonzalezs-hand-but-his-status-is-uncertain/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150518__rockies-cargop1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150518__rockies-cargop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-21T20:14:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T22:35:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe304c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI took a couple of dry swings and it was sore, so they decided to take me out of the game,\u201d Gonzalez said.\nConcern came rushing at the Rockies on Sunday when Carlos Gonzalez exited a game against the Brewers with what the team called a left hand sprain.\nGonzalez said he injured his hand on a flyball swing in the third inning.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been able to get hot, but when I get cold, I get real cold.\nIt was his fifth career four-hit game, tying a career high."}
