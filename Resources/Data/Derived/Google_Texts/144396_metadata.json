Biggs.\n\n\u201cHere in Amarillo, we\u2019ve demonstrated that patients can get better care and at lower cost, so I think everyone agrees that\u2019s a good idea and we need to make it work,\u201d he said.\n\nALMA entered into a three-year contract with Medicare last year to form an ACO that coordinates care among its five medical groups and created a health information exchange that allows physicians to share patient records. The group serves 10,876 Medicare patients in the area, with average annual cost of $8,183 per patient.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act established ACOs as a way to identify gaps in care, community trends and reduce waste and duplication of services, according to the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.\n\nAbout $940 million in government savings through the program were predicted last year, and ACOs have saved $372 million so far, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nUnder their contracts with Medicare, ACOs receive about 50 percent of their savings that fall above the minimum Medicare savings rate.\n\nThose funds will go toward physician bonuses, the health information exchange, ALMA care managers and back into the organization, he said.\n\nOnly a quarter of ACOs have reported savings during their first year, and those that lose money must pay that back to Medicare, Biggs said.\n\nThe program can be risky, as start-up costs can be expensive.\n\nACOs must invest in\n\ninfrastructure and other resources, according to health care consulting company Premier Inc. Those costs can make medical groups leery of the programs, and a recent Premier poll showed about a quarter of health care providers surveyed don\u2019t plan to participate in an ACO in the future.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very scary thing for a lot of the ACOs out there, particularly the ones that aren\u2019t saving money to begin with,\u201d Biggs said. \u201cThey may not stay in the program because of that.\u201d\n\nBut ALMA physicians, such as Dr. Ako D. Bradford of Amarillo Medical Specialists, are optimistic about the program. Bradford is new to outpatient care, and he\u2019s seeing what it takes to prevent hospitalizations.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things the ACO brings to bare,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just passing medications or writing diagnoses, but it\u2019s educating patients so they are stronger and so we can reduce hospitalizations and help people live better lives.\u201d\n\nDuring ALMA\u2019s first year, the organization has found that preventative care reduces illnesses and costs to the system, Biggs said.\n\nThe health records exchange also is leading to fewer duplicated services and better error prevention, ALMA members said. That process results in better collaboration between health care providers, who can review their patients\u2019 test results from other doctors and better gauge the next step for care.\n\n\u201cThe patient feels better, because they know that as physicians, we\u2019re all trying to sing from the same sheet of music,\u201d Bradford said. \u201cAs physicians, we feel better, because we know that we can trust our colleagues to order certain things, and if the test is there, the lab result is there, we know we can trust it, and we don\u2019t have to do it a second or third time.\u201d\n\nAnd lowering the amount of lab work saves money.\n\n\u201cThe waste that has been reduced has been an impactful situation for us, so our patients don\u2019t have to get stuck for the same blood test,\u201d said Michael Smith, vice president of operations at Family Medicine Center. \u201cThey can have one test and multiple physicians have access to that to see what the results are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local News", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "VIDEO An Amarillo organization designed to improve care and lower Medicare costs has reported $5 million in savings during its first year.
