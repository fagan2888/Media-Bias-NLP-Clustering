He was 82.\n\nThe Major League Baseball commissioner\u2019s office said Torre died today at a hospice in Palm Beach. He had previously received heart and kidney transplants, and had been ill in recent years with cancer.\n\nTorre played seven seasons in the majors with the Milwaukee Braves and Philadelphia Phillies. Though he hit only 13 home runs in 1,482 career at-bats in the regular season, he homered twice in 10 at-bats during the 1957 World Series as Milwaukee beat the New York Yankees for its only championship. In Game 7, he drove in a run at Yankee Stadium during the clinching 5-0 victory.\n\nFrank Torre was nearly nine years older than Joe and guided his signing with the Braves and was long his mentor.\n\nJoe Torre starred as a player, won four titles while managing the Yankees and was inducted into the Hall last summer. He\u2019s now an executive with MLB.\n\nFrank Torre was unable to make the trip to Cooperstown, New York, for the Hall ceremonies in July. Joe previously said that among all the great advice he got his older brother, there was one time he missed \u2013 when Frank offered his opinion on going to become manager of the Yankees.\n\n\u201cFrank said I was crazy to take this job,\u201d Joe joked.\n\nIn his first season with the Yankees, Joe Torre guided them to the World Series title.\n\nFrank Torre was in the hospital recovering from a heart transplant the day before \u2013 Dr. Mehmet Oz assisted on the operation \u2013 when he watched the Yankees clinch the crowd.\n\nEarlier that year, the Torre\u2019s older brother, Rocco, died of a heart attack. When Joe Torre was asked to help design the Yankees\u2019 championship ring, he had the word \u201cheart\u201d inscribed as a tribute to his brothers and the team.\n\nIn 2007, Frank Torre had a kidney transplant, and the donor was his daughter.\n\nTorre was with the Braves as they reached the World Series in 1957 and again the next year. In 1958, they lost in seven games to the Yankees.\n\nTorre signed with the Boston Braves and played in their minor league system in 1951 before serving two years in the military. He hit .273 in 714 games in the majors.\n\nThe Braves sent him to the minors during the 1960 season. He barely missed playing with his brother when the team brought Joe to the big leagues later that year.\n\nAfter finishing as a player, Torre worked for the Rawlings sports goods company. He later became an executive with the Baseball Assistance Team, which helps those who have been in the game and their families in need.\n\nCommissioner Bud Selig grew up in Milwaukee rooting for the Braves.\n\n\u201cI am deeply saddened by the loss of Frank Torre, a close friend for nearly 60 years and a man who marked the start of a great baseball family,\u201d Selig said in a statement. \u201cBefore my career in baseball began, Frank and I formed a friendship that endured for decades, and I was touched to speak with him yesterday.\n\n\u201cSome of the fondest memories of my life involve Frank\u2019s Milwaukee Braves teams from 1956-1960, and his great play in the 1957 Fall Classic was one of the keys to bringing the World Series championship to my hometown,\u201d he said. \u201cFrank\u2019s longtime support of the Baseball Assistance Team ... was an illustration of how much he cared about our game and the people who are a part of it.\u201d\n\nSelig called Joe Torre, who was visiting his brother in the hospital, on Friday. Frank took the phone to talk with his longtime friend and fan.\n\n\u201cFrank and I grew up together in Brooklyn and I always looked up to him as a baseball player and thereafter how he conducted himself as a person,\u201d New York Mets chairman Fred Wilpon said.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 13 Sep 2014 17:56:18 -0400", "Description": "NEW YORK \u2013 Frank Torre, the World Series star who helped put little brother Joe on a path that led to the Hall of Fame, has died.
