As an undergraduate, studying chemistry at a Midwestern university, he was redirected (or was it led astray?) by his first love, a classical cellist, who told him, \u201cPieces pour out of you when you snap your fingers. That\u2019s called a vocation. You don\u2019t get a choice.\u201d Now in his 70s, a retired music professor and one-time avant-garde composer tinkering with mail-ordered lab equipment in rural Pennsylvania, Peter wonders if he hasn\u2019t \u201cmissed his calling,\u201d and \u201cthe age\u2019s real creative venture\u201d: biotechnology and genetic engineering.\n\n\u201cOrfeo\u201d begins with the death of Peter\u2019s beloved dog and a visit from emergency services, called in by the bereft pet owner in a moment of confusion. The two officers get an eyeful of Peter\u2019s home lab, and a few idle comments made by the \u201cquiet older bohemian in the American Craftsman\u201d spook them. The next day, Peter drives to the park for a morning run and comes back to yellow police tape and guys in hazmat suits disassembling and carting off the contents of his house to be scrutinized by Homeland Security. For reasons not entirely clear until (maybe) much later in the novel, Peter decides to get back in his car and go on the lam, visiting various important people from his past, rather than turning himself in and trying to straighten things out.\n\nThis sort of retrospective road trip is far more commonplace among the elderly characters in books and movies than it seems to be among the actually old, but such cavils cannot persist against the abundant charms of \u201cOrfeo\u201d for long. Powers, who once worked as a computer programmer, has specialized in a symphonic form of fiction; an early novel, \u201cGalatea 2.2\u2033 juxtaposed the creation of an artificial intelligence with the imaginative insight of both novelists and lovers, while another, \u201cThe Goldbug Variations,\u201d was underpinned by an extended conceit linking the fractalish iterations of Bach\u2019s harpsichord exercise with the ever-mutating code strands of DNA. Storytelling hasn\u2019t been Powers\u2019 strong suit in the past, but the whirling intellectual energy of his novels has won him many admirers and one National Book Award for fiction (\u201cThe Echo Maker\u201d).\n\nWith \u201cOrfeo,\u201d Powers has conclusively cracked the plot problem, fueling the novel with both the question of Peter\u2019s future and the enigma of his past: Is he or isn\u2019t he a terrorist? Creating a loop in time \u2014 by \u201cpredicting\u201d the past and \u201crecollecting\u201d the future \u2014 is one of Peter\u2019s persistent fixations. His model is the octave, the interval, universal to all musical systems, that creates a sense of wholeness or completion even his poor deceased pooch could recognize and appreciate: \u201cother species heard the pitches double back on themselves, like a color wheel.\u201d Late in life, Peter finds himself in pursuit of \u201csomething in music beyond taste, built into the evolved brain.\u201d Or, to put it another way, he\u2019s trying to answer the question, \u201cHow did music trick the body into thinking it had a soul?\u201d\n\nMaybe the answer to this question is all Peter ever wanted, but he\u2019s a man fond of summing up his life in terms of a single desire, and the lineaments of that ungratified desire keep shifting. We\u2019re told that the sole thing he craved was to \u201cgive back something as fine as he\u2019d been given\u201d or to have \u201ca room of grateful listeners\u201d or to \u201cscribble down the tune that would raise everyone he knew from the dead and make them laugh with remembering\u201d or for \u201cmusic to be the antidote to the familiar\u201d or to \u201ctunnel into forever through the wall of Now.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever met who wants more than I do,\u201d says his intermittent friend and occasional collaborator, Richard. \u201cNot afraid to torch your entire life. Writing for no one.\u201d\n\nThat entire life includes not just chemistry but a family: a wife and daughter exasperated and finally driven off by Peter\u2019s tendency to disappear into experimental projects that consume a year\u2019s worth of work only to evaporate in a single day or performances with \u201cmore people on stage than in the audience.\u201d The central subject of \u201cOrfeo\u201d is the now-exhausted course of modernism in music, a century\u2019s worth of \u201crunaway bonfire,\u201d in which composers \u201cburned through all available innovations, each more fleeting than the last. The accelerating vehicle would one day have to hit the wall, and it was Els\u2019 luck to be alive at the moment of the smash-up.\u201d As a young man at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign during the 1960s, a hotbed of new music, Peter meets Richard at John Cage\u2019s cacophonous happening, the Musicircus. The two young firebrands go on to produce a one-day piece in a New York warehouse, then quarrel, then reconcile and collaborate again on an opera about the siege of Munster in 1534, an \u201cecstatic uprising gone wrong,\u201d much like their own.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Richard Powers' sweeping new novel of ideas, an avant-garde composer flees charges of bioterrorism", "title": "\u201cOrfeo\u201d: Artist or terrorist \u2014 is there a difference?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In Richard Powers' sweeping new novel of ideas, an avant-garde composer flees charges of bioterrorism", "title": "\u201cOrfeo\u201d: Artist or terrorist \u2014 is there a difference?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/19/orfeo_artist_or_terrorist_is_there_a_difference/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/orfeo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Richard Powers' sweeping new novel of ideas, an avant-garde composer flees charges of bioterrorism", "title": "\u201cOrfeo\u201d: Artist or terrorist \u2014 is there a difference?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/orfeo.jpg", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Biotechnology, Books, classical music, Editor's Picks, Fiction, Must-Do, Orfeo, Richard Powers, Terrorism, What to Read", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Biotechnology, Books, classical music, Editor's Picks, Fiction, Must-Do, Orfeo, Richard Powers, Terrorism, What to Read, Entertainment NewsPeter Els, the main character in Richard Powers\u2019 new novel, \u201cOrfeo,\u201d has spent most of his life composing music that hardly anyone has heard.\nWith \u201cOrfeo,\u201d Powers has conclusively cracked the plot problem, fueling the novel with both the question of Peter\u2019s future and the enigma of his past: Is he or isn\u2019t he a terrorist?\n\u201cOrfeo\u201d begins with the death of Peter\u2019s beloved dog and a visit from emergency services, called in by the bereft pet owner in a moment of confusion.\nby his first love, a classical cellist, who told him, \u201cPieces pour out of you when you snap your fingers.\nCreating a loop in time \u2014 by \u201cpredicting\u201d the past and \u201crecollecting\u201d the future \u2014 is one of Peter\u2019s persistent fixations."}
