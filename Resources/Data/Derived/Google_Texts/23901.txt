Michaela and Justen Watts got an extra-special New Year's Day gift when their daughter, Vivian Serenity Watts, became the first baby to be born in the new year at Floyd Memorial Birthing Center.

Vivian certainly made her parents wait for the new year to arrive; she was born at 3:17 p.m. on Jan. 1, after a 34-hour labor, according to a news release from Floyd Memorial Hospital.

Vivian is the first child of her Charlestown, Ind., parents. She was born weighing 7 pounds, 8 ounces and measured 21 inches in length.

Both mother and daughter are healthy, the hospital said.

Congratulations to the Watts family!
