As the midterm elections of 2014 made clear, no one but the fearful, the crazy and the deeply, pathologically Caucasian (overlapping demographics, to be sure) bothers to vote when the presidency is not at stake. Lots of people will turn out in November of next year to vote for or against Hillary Clinton, no doubt, as they did in Barack Obama\u2019s two elections. But the winner will effectively be decided by a few thousand votes one way or the other in Florida, Ohio and Virginia. I was about to throw in a qualifier about how that\u2019s only a slight exaggeration, but forget it: It\u2019s not an exaggeration at all.\n\nUntil the last few days I had largely avoided the toxic tale of the Duggar family and their slow-motion human trainwreck; I\u2019d probably be happier if I still didn\u2019t know who those people were. The Duggars are like some collective punishment we have visited upon ourselves, after deciding that we have reached the lowest levels of Dante\u2019s Hell without bothering to die first. Every second you sink into their story drains away more of your human spirit, and brings you that much closer to morbid despair. When Nietzsche coined his famous maxim about staring into the abyss, he had no freaking clue how dark it would get. Still, even what I have absorbed by osmosis makes it clear that the Duggars have become a flashpoint for cultural debate about the role of religion in American life and the way sexual abuse is often tolerated or minimized or covered up within families, as well as a key battleground in the right-wing media\u2019s increasingly panicky defense of \u201ctraditional values.\u201d\n\nI have only intermittently paid attention to the saga of Caitlyn Jenner and her masterfully managed chrysalis emergence. But whatever you want to say about the reality-TV artificiality of the spectacle, which has alternately resembled the grooming of a prospective movie star and a new-product rollout, Jenner\u2019s reinvention is a watershed moment in American cultural history. Her impact on trans people and their advocates and allies has clearly been enormous, including all the inevitable conversations about issues of race, wealth and privilege. For the rest of us, Jenner\u2019s coming-out party has offered a society-wide teachable moment, from well-meaning liberals forced to realize that they didn\u2019t understand this issue as well as they thought they did to the bewildered floundering and ugly jibes of so many media commentators.\n\nWhen you observe the intense and unfeigned public response to those stories, and the symbolic media warfare they provoke, it becomes not just meaningless but dangerous to insist that such things are inherently trivial, or serve only to distract the citizenry from Serious Issues and Real News. Caitlyn Jenner and the Duggar family speak to America\u2019s changing sense of itself, and to the shifting fronts in the \u201ccultural war\u201d that Pat Buchanan invoked in his famous speech in the Houston Astrodome, 23 years ago. (I was there!) They are in fact the substance of our national conversation, the central narrative of American political and cultural life in our time. What happens inside the Beltway is a footnote, if that.\n\nMind you, there are certain areas of conventional politics people still care about: the areas where it becomes pure spectacle and has nothing to do with policies or legislation or governance. Along with many other Americans, I am morbidly fascinated with the Hillary Clinton campaign and its dysfunctional relationship with the news media. Like a moth drawn back to a dying flame, I can\u2019t resist the noble and/or ridiculous media spectacles staged by the sacrificial Hill-alternatives on the Democratic left: First Bernie Sanders, who is a great guy who has no chance, then Martin O\u2019Malley, who is a pretty good guy who has absolutely no chance, and now Lincoln Chafee, who is from Rhode Island and wants to make the metric system mandatory in America. I don\u2019t even have a sarcastic zinger to throw in after that sentence, because it already contains \u201cRhode Island\u201d and \u201cmetric system.\u201d\n\nOK, nobody cares about Lincoln Chafee; I threw that one in to see if you were awake. I can hear a few of you out there, murmuring grumpily that this would be a better country if Chafee\u2019s super well-intentioned presidential campaign, running on its single liter of petrol, were a more important story than a onetime Olympic athlete\u2019s gender assignment or the news that a crazy Christian family is even crazier than we thought. Well, OK, if you say so. But A) I\u2019m not entirely sure that\u2019s true, and B) it\u2019s so far-fetched and hypothetical as to be utterly useless. I mean, why stop there? If we\u2019ve got a magic lamp, let\u2019s wish for peace in the Middle East, flying solar cars, bringing back the dodo and wine in grocery stores in New York City.\n\nTo complain about the absence of real political debate and the massive vulgarity of American culture \u2013 and mea culpa, dude, I do it all the time \u2013 has the veneer of a reasonable, civic-minded adult perspective. But on a philosophical and epistemological level, it\u2019s also a refusal to reckon with reality. If the only politics we actually have are the politics of culture \u2013 of symbolism and representation and media spectacle \u2013 then we have to fight on that terrain or give up entirely.\n\nThere is indeed a grave risk of distraction within big cultural-politics extravaganzas like the Duggar and Jenner stories, but not because those stories are trivial in themselves. We are always at risk of asking the wrong questions, pursuing the wrong threads and failing to observe connections that arguably should be obvious (but have been intentionally obscured). Exactly the same danger can be found in the grand spectacle of presidential campaigns, which are subjected to reams of arid semiotic analysis and amateur theatrical criticism, while the most important questions \u2013 what can be discussed in public and what cannot, who actually wields power in America and toward what ends \u2013 are not mentioned.\n\nAs my colleagues Jim Newell, Heather Digby Parton and Elias Isquith have variously observed, the political media has a long-term relationship of mutual hatred with Hillary Clinton, and appears determined to cover her 2016 campaign (which is a historic event by any measure, love her or hate her) as a story of low-rent Freudian conflict between the candidate and the press corps. Maybe that\u2019s really how the reporters for Politico and Slate and the big dailies experience their interaction with her campaign; I wouldn\u2019t know. It\u2019s evidently what they believe will be most illuminating and entertaining to their readers. I understand that they are too cynical and too intelligent to be much interested in the question of what Clinton would do as president, since the universe of things that a president might do is well understood (and can be summed up in the phrase \u201cwhatever makes the bankers happy\u201d). And you can\u2019t write stories every day about What This Means for Women. But the permanently jaded and insiderish mode of 21st-century political journalism amounts to a collective decision to change the subject \u2014 or to use Joan Didion\u2019s memorable phrase, a deliberate failure to observe the observable.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why is America so fascinated by Caitlyn Jenner and the Duggars?
