But now they are free now, forever cleared.\n\nThere won\u2019t be any civil trials like in the O.J. Simpson case because, according to Italian penal code, Italy\u2019s high court decision is final across all courts in the country.\n\nAccording to Italian lawyer Nicola Canestrini, who works on extradition and criminal cases between Italy and other countries,\n\n\u201cThe high court decision is seen as the truth for the whole system.\u201d\n\nWhat now for the Kerchers?\n\nFrancesco Maresca, lawyer for the Kercher family, told CNN that his clients are disappointed with the final ruling.\n\n\u201cWe expected more from the Italian judicial system,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a failure to find justice for Meredith.\u201d\n\nMaresca says the Kerchers could try to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights and argue that Italy failed to find those culpable of killing their beloved daughter and sister but they have yet to make that decision.\n\n\u201cIf they think Italy hasn\u2019t fulfilled the duty, they could sue Italy,\u201d Canestrini told CNN.\n\nSuch a claim could be made based on the final conviction handed down to Rudy Guede, a man from the Ivory Coast who was convicted for his role in Kercher\u2019s murder in 2008 in a fast-track trial that is still under seal.\n\nWhen the high court ruled definitively on his case in 2010, they wrote explicitly in their reasoning that he was one of three assailants but did not name who they were.\n\nFalse imprisonment\n\nKnox and Sollecito both spent four years in prison during their initial trial and first appeal. They applied to Italy\u2019s high court to be put under house arrest but because Knox was a foreigner and deemed a flight risk, they were both denied.\n\nSollecito may now have cause to sue Italy for false imprisonment. Italy pays around \u20ac12 million every year for locking up people who are later cleared of charges, according to Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi who is introduced measures to reform the judicial system.\n\nBut, Canestrini says if Sollecito at any time lied to investigators before he was arrested, he may forfeit his right to reimbursement for being held. Sollecito changed his story more than once before finally settling on an alibi with Knox, so a legal battle could focus on whether anything he told investigators led directly to his arrest.\n\nCanestrini also says that Knox could potentially sue Italy for one year of false imprisonment, but because she admittedly lied to investigators early on which led to her arrest, she would likely not have much of a case.\n\n\u201cBecause she initially admitted to a role in the crime, she wouldn\u2019t likely win. If a suspect lies to investigators before they are arrested, it is difficult to prove they were falsely imprisoned,\u201d Canestrini says.\n\nIn one of her initial interrogations in 2007, she told investigators she was in the house when Kercher was killed at which time she accused Patrick Lumumba, her boss at a pub where she worked, of the murder.\n\nShe later recanted that statement, but Lumumba spent two weeks in prison because of her false claim.\n\nIn 2013, Italy\u2019s high court ruled definitively on a slander charge against her for the false accusation and upheld a three-year prison term and ordered her to pay Lumumba $40,000 euro.\n\nNo resentment\n\nKnox\u2019s lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova told CNN that Knox doesn\u2019t feel any revenge or resentment towards Italy. In fact, he said she will go back one day.\n\n\u201cThis has been an nightmare for her, so we finally got the right decision,\u201d he said. \u201cWe always thought this was the only decision possible.\u201d\n\nSollecito\u2019s lawyers were equally pleased with the outcome. \u201cThe verdict that we just received doesn\u2019t prove us partly right, It proves us completely right,\u201d Giulia Bongiorno told reporters outside the court.\n\n\u201cThere were two possible verdicts: (One was to) overturn this verdict, but go back to it later. Instead, the overturn is without any referral. Among all the possible and imaginable overturning options, this is the one which says \u201cbe advised, we won\u2019t ever even make the hypothesis of an implication of Raffaele Sollecito in this case ever. Enough, enough, enough.\u201d\n\nKnox, too, made her own statement from her mother\u2019s home in Seattle after hearing the news.\n\nShe thanked all those who supported her innocence, and said she needed to take time to digest what being free really means.\n\nWhen asked if she had a message to the Kerchers about their daughter, she said, \u201cShe deserved so much in this life. I\u2019m the lucky one.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "47.606209;-122.332071", "description": "ROME (CNN) -- As the dust settles after Italy's high court ruled on Friday to overturn the latest guilty verdicts for Amanda Knox, 27, and her former Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 31, in the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher, many questions still linger in the case.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "b6228bea1d7671a78a13a75050035f3a"}, "og": {"site_name": "Q13 FOX News", "description": "ROME (CNN) \u2014 As the dust settles after Italy\u2019s high court ruled on Friday to overturn the latest guilty verdicts for Amanda Knox, 27, and her former Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito\u2026", "title": "Amanda Knox: The fine line between guilt and innocence", "url": "http://q13fox.com/2015/03/29/amanda-knox-the-fine-line-between-guilt-and-innocence/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/150327200600-erin-intv-amanda-knox-lawyer-discusses-overturned-verdict-00001301-tablet-large.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/150327200600-erin-intv-amanda-knox-lawyer-discusses-overturned-verdict-00001301-tablet-large.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@q13fox", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@q13fox"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Seattle and Western Washington's source for breaking news, weather, and sports.
