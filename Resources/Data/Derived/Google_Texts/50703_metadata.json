Moore's trip on the center-right/right carousel has spun him from Heritage to the Cato Institute to the Club for Growth to the Wall Street Journal, and now to Heritage again, as the think tanker with the most familiarity with Fox News' green room. The immigraton issue only warrants a graf in Rob Bluey's in-house news-break:\n\nMoore has been on this beat for the better part of two decades. In his Cato days, he attacked \"immigration myths\" such as \"immigrants depress wages\" and \"immigrants impose a financial burden on taxpayers.\" At that time, there was no major immigration bill moving through Congress (then run entirely by Republicans). Right now, all the House needs to do is bring up and pass a new bill in order for a conference committee to come up with a comprehensive reform. Unless the \"discussion\" between DeMint and Moore was about why Moore should give himself an electric shock if ever he felt like discussing immigration, this hire marks a big deparature from the Heritage of Jason Richwine.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Heritage Tacks Left on Immigration", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "Actually, the news that Stephen Moore is joining the Heritage Foundation as chief economist can be interpreted in all sorts of ways.
