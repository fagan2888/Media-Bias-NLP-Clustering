Race aside, someplace like Frederick, MD is the logical choice, relatively isolated as it is from the passions that have enflamed the Baltimore area.\n\nMosby\u2019s husband, a Baltimore city councilor, has been very vocal, and could be pointed to as prejudicing her, demanding therefore a special prosecutor, But her lionization by the left could also make her replacement an incitement to the mob. So, too her campaign contributions from the Gray family and their attorney.\n\nShe has also explicitly linked this prosecution to a political agenda:\n\nLast but certainly not least, to the youth of the city. I will seek justice on your behalf. This is a moment. This is your moment. Let\u2019s insure we have peaceful and productive rallies that will develop structural and systemic changes for generations to come. You\u2019re at the forefront of this cause and as young people, our time is now.\n\nA thought experiment: imagine a crime committed against a white person by blacks (or a mixed group, like the Baltimore 6), where the prosecutor spoke to the passions of a white mob as Mosby has done. The denunciations would be instantaneous.\n\nI have no idea what happened the caused the death of Freddie Gray, and I do want any criminal behavior brought to justice. But I detest prosecutions driven by politics, not the facts. And that is clearly what is happening under Marilyn Mosby. Her pandering is creating a set of expectations that likely will be unmet. Instead of joining the Al Sharpton faction, she should have promised equal justice before the law for the defendants as well as the late Freddie Gray.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/05/prosecutor_mosby_sowing_seeds_of_disaster.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2015-05/194508_5_.jpg", "title": "Blog: Prosecutor Mosby sowing seeds of disaster"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I have no idea what happened the caused the death of Freddie Gray, and I do want any criminal behavior brought to justice.\nInstead of joining the Al Sharpton faction, she should have promised equal justice before the law for the defendants as well as the late Freddie Gray.\nAnd that is clearly what is happening under Marilyn Mosby.\nShe has also explicitly linked this prosecution to a political agenda:Last but certainly not least, to the youth of the city.\nLet\u2019s insure we have peaceful and productive rallies that will develop structural and systemic changes for generations to come."}
