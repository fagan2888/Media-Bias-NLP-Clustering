But there are many instances in which you can and should avoid forking over the added fees.\n\nHere\u2019s a guide to circumventing 10 of the most common \u2013 and most hated \u2013 fees:\n\n1. ATM fees\n\nLast year, banks charged non-customers an average of $2.60 to use their ATMS, on top of the $1.53 charge already levied by the consumers\u2019 own bank, according to Bankrate. That brings the cost of tapping a non-network ATM to more than $4, a total that has increased by more than a third since 2008.\n\nThese fees are totally avoidable with some advance planning to use only in-network machines. Use your bank\u2019s app to locate nearby ATMS wherever you are. If you\u2019re still having trouble, switch to an online bank \u2013 many of them will reimburse ATM fees. Or, use your debit card to get cash back with a purchase.\n\nRelated: 10 Ways to Avoid Airline Fees\n\n2. Airline booking fees\n\nA quarter of U.S. leisure travelers still pick up the phone to call their airline to make flight reservations. That could be a costly habit: \u201cJust about every airline will charge a substantial fee for booking flights over the phone with an agent,\u201d says Jeff Klee, CEO of CheapAir.com. \u201cThose can be substantial fees, of around $25 per ticket.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s much better to book online to avoid incurring such charges.\n\n\n\n3. Gift card fees\n\nAlthough consumers prefer to receive general-purpose gift cards that are usable anywhere, such as those distributed by banks and credit card companies, the cards tend to be more expensive for the gift-giver. Upfront purchase fees for such cards averaged $3.95 in December 2013, according to CreditCards.com, and the card companies were also more likely to charge dormancy fees if the cards aren\u2019t used within a certain time period. You\u2019ll dodge these fees by purchasing a retailer-specific gift card instead.\n\n4. Text messaging fees\n\nMany mobile plans include unlimited text messaging, but if yours doesn\u2019t, you could find yourself paying anywhere from 15 to 25 cents per text message, which can definitely add up quickly. Even if you have unlimited text messaging, rates can skyrocket when you\u2019re traveling and your phone is roaming.\n\nKeep such charges off your cell phone bill by downloading text messaging apps like WhatsApp or Viber, which can run over Wi-Fi to avoid data charges as well.\n\nRelated: Beware the Growing Burden of Hidden College Fees\n\n5. Event ticket fees\n\n\u201cService fees\u201d from online ticket brokers like TicketMaster are unavoidable for big-name acts or in-demand sporting events that sell out quickly. For smaller shows, skip the fees (and show some love to your local venue) by visiting the box office to make a purchase directly.\n\n6. Late fees\n\nMissing a bill payment can cost you not only a late fee that can run $20-30, but if you\u2019re more than 30 days late, it can also result in a potentially costly ding to your credit score. Avoid such late payments by setting up auto-pay on any recurring monthly charges that don\u2019t require manual review, such as your mortgage, student loan, or car payments. Bonus: Many banks will drop your interest rate by as much as half a percent when you enroll in auto-pay programs.\n\nIf you miss a payment on other bills, such as credit cards or utilities, pick up the phone and call the providers\u2019 customer service line. If it\u2019s your first time missing a payment, they\u2019ll likely drop the late fee \u2013 if you ask nicely.\n\n7. Overdraft fees\n\nAfter a public outcry in 2009, the Federal Reserve passed a rule requiring consumers to opt in to overdraft protection fees, which will cover a payment for which you don\u2019t immediately have funds; you\u2019re charged $35 for the privilege. The easy way to avoid these fees, of course, is to simply decline to opt in to them. However, some consumer advocates claim that banks are using misleading practices to get consumers to sign up for the potentially costly service. Don\u2019t fall for it: Say no, and check the terms of any existing accounts to be sure you\u2019re not unwittingly enrolled.\n\n8. Baggage fees\n\nChecked bag fees, starting at around $25 for the first bag, have become de rigueur for most airline passengers, but there are ways savvy travelers can get out of paying them. Airlines will waive the fees for their elite travelers (and their traveling companions) as well as for those using an airline branded credit card. If you can, book your ticket with JetBlue, which offers travelers one free checked bag, or Southwest, which extends the offer to two bags.\n\nRelated: The Consumer\u2019s Guide to Breaking Up with Your Bank\n\n9. Checking account fees\n\nIt\u2019s getting harder to find banks that offer free checking accounts. Since 2009, the number of banks providing free checking declined from 74 percent to just 38 percent, Bankrate reports, and often you\u2019ll have to meet minimum requirements, like having direct deposit or having a minimum balance.\n\n\u201cIf your bank is charging you a checking account fee, ask them if you qualify for a free account,\u201d says Jennifer Calonia, a senior editor with GoBankingsRates.com. \u201cIf not, take the opportunity to explore other options, including credit unions or local banks.\u201d\n\n10. Mutual fund load fees\n\nLoad fees are essentially an upfront sales commission paid to a broker upon the purchase of a mutual fund. The average load fee paid in 2012 was 5.13 percent, according to the Investment Company Institute. That puts a hefty hurdle on the required returns needed to make money on the investment. Individual investors might be better off looking for no-load index funds or ETFs, which carry fees of less than 1 percent.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Here\u2019s a guide to circumventing 10 of the most common\u2014and most hated\u2014consumer fees.", "title": "10 Infuriating Consumer Fees to Stop Paying Now", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/19/10-Infuriating-Consumer-Fees-Stop-Paying-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02182014_Luggage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/19/10-Infuriating-Consumer-Fees-Stop-Paying-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02182014_Luggage.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Here\u2019s a guide to circumventing 10 of the most common\u2014and most hated\u2014consumer fees.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40f3\"", "article_summary": "If it\u2019s your first time missing a payment, they\u2019ll likely drop the late fee \u2013 if you ask nicely.\nRelated: 10 Ways to Avoid Airline Fees2.\nThe easy way to avoid these fees, of course, is to simply decline to opt in to them.\nIn some cases (particularly with many of the charges associated with cell or cable service providers), the fees are unavoidable.\nIf you\u2019re still having trouble, switch to an online bank \u2013 many of them will reimburse ATM fees."}
