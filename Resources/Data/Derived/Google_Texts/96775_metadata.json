Martin O'Malley delivers his final State of the State address on Thursday in Annapolis. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nFollowing is the text of Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s State of the State address, as prepared for delivery on Jan. 23.\n\nSpeaker Busch, Senate President Miller, Minority Leader of the Senate, Senator Brinkley, Minority Leader of the House, Delegate Kipke; Lieutenant Governor Brown, Treasurer Kopp, Comptroller Franchot, Attorney General Gansler; Governor Hughes, Governor Glendening, Attorney General Curran, Senator Sarbanes; Chief Judge Barbera; colleagues in city and county governments; Senator Cardin, Congressman Van Hollen, Congresswoman Edwards; Tribal Chair Proctor, Tribal Chair Savoy; and Ambassador Zamora of El Salvador\u2014a country whose sons and daughters are contributing in so many ways to the life of our State.\n\nMembers of the hardest-working cabinet in America; men and women of the Maryland General Assembly.\n\nThere is one more person I would like to especially acknowledge. She is here today as she has been at my side every day for 23 years. She is my best friend, my partner in life, the finest wife and mother any family could want. She is the First Lady of Maryland, Judge Katie Curran O\u2019Malley.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMy fellow Marylanders, over the course of these seven years, you and I have carried with us a commitment\u2026.\n\nIt is a commitment to a better future: the better future our children deserve.\n\nA commitment founded on the belief we share in the dignity of every individual.\n\nA commitment strengthened by the belief we share in our own responsibility to advance the common good.\n\nA commitment sanctified by the belief we hold,\u2026 that we are all in this together, and each of us is needed in God\u2019s eyes.\n\nI have seen this commitment myself, in the eyes of our teachers, firefighters and police officers. In the eyes of our veterans and their brave families. In the quiet fortitude of hard-working moms and dads throughout our State.\n\nIt is a commitment that has been shared by each of you, who have the privilege to represent the citizens of Maryland in this historic place.\n\nI remember the first time I set foot in this building, as a young boy with my father. He was a lawyer and he had a case here in Annapolis at the Court of Appeals.\n\nHe took my hand as we climbed the steps of this Revolutionary building.\n\nHe brought my brother and me to the room down the hall where General Washington gave his authority over the Army, back to the elected representatives of the People.\n\nAnd in that doorway, he leaned down to me and explained the significance of this very House Chamber, the duties of the men and women who are elected to serve here.\n\nI was awed by the fact that this is the place we have come together as a people for more than 200 years, to make a better life. To make this place, our place, a better place.\n\nIt has been a tremendous and humbling honor to serve the people of Maryland\u2014through these difficult and important days\u2014with each of you.\n\nAll of us, together.\n\nThe State of Our State is Strong\n\nOn this occasion, we take time to reflect on the way we have traveled, and where we have come.\n\nThrough the longest wars in American history, and the greatest recession since the Great Depression, our goals as an Administration, have remained constant and true:\n\nTo strengthen and grow the ranks of our middle class, including our family-owned businesses and farms.\n\nTo improve public safety and public education.\n\nTo expand opportunity to more people rather than fewer \u2013 the opportunity to learn and to earn, the opportunity to enjoy our health, to enjoy the health of the people we love, and the health of this land we love\u2014the Chesapeake Bay, the Patuxent, the mountains of Western Maryland, the marshes of the Eastern Shore.\n\nToday, because of the hard work and courage of our people, I can report to you that the state of our State is strong, and growing stronger by the day.\n\nIn fact, not only is Maryland stronger than before \u2014 Maryland is cleaner, smarter, safer, healthier, more entrepreneurial, and more competitive than she was before the recession hit.\n\nFiscal Discipline\n\nThink back: When we took office, Maryland had a $1.7 billion structural deficit. No sooner had we taken action together to address that deficit, than the recession hit.\n\nParents lost their jobs; children lost their homes; families struggled to hold on to their dignity.\n\nEven as we fought to help every family we could \u2013 to save every home and every job we could \u2013 our State revenues took a huge hit, right along with so many family incomes.\n\nSince that time, the O\u2019Malley-Brown Administration has used the challenge of these times to make our government more efficient, and more effective.\n\nWe have cut spending by $9.1 billion dollars.\n\nWe have made more cuts than any administration in modern Maryland history.\n\nToday, we now have the smallest executive branch since 1973\u2014and the budget I presented to you last week puts us on a track to totally eliminate that structural deficit without the need for any new fees or taxes.\n\nWe remain one of only seven states that has maintained a triple-A bond rating all through the recession, and to this day.\n\nWe have built up our Rainy Day Fund to $800 million dollars, and we have placed this year in our general reserve an operating surplus of $37 million dollars.\n\nA Balanced Approach\n\nBut cuts are only part of our story.\n\nNo state has ever cut its way to greater prosperity.\n\nGrowth requires investment.\n\nTogether, we have made those critical investments\u2014investments to educate, to innovate, to rebuild, to grow jobs and create a better economy.\n\nThis is what a balanced approach is all about.\n\nSeven years ago, we were failing to live up to our state\u2019s full potential.\n\nSeven years later, we are not just One Maryland. By many measures, we are Number One Maryland:\n\nJust listen with me for a quiet moment.\n\nMaryland today is number one in our students\u2019 AP success for seven years in a row;\n\nNumber one in education five years in a row;\n\nNumber one in holding down the cost of college tuition;\n\nNumber one in innovation and entrepreneurship for two years in a row, according to the United States Chamber of Commerce;\n\nNumber one in Ph.D. scientists and researchers;\n\nNumber one in businesses owned by women;\n\nAnd number one in median household income.\n\nThis is what the people of our state have achieved together. And together we applaud their hard work.\n\nGoverning in a Different Way\n\nSeven years ago\u2014in response to the desires of our people\u2014we set out to govern in a fundamentally different way.\n\nSetting goals. Measuring performance. Hitting deadlines. Getting Results. Making the work of progress visible for you to see, and for me to see.\n\nEvery day, the test of any policy, action, or expenditure, has been whether or not it is actually working\u2014working to produce the intended results.\n\nIn the past, our states and indeed our country, have been governed by a top-down approach. Hierarchical and bureaucratic. Shouting orders from somewhere above.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the world we live in any more.\n\nThis generation is not about command and control. This generation seeks good ideas on level ground. Everywhere.\n\nIt is fundamentally entrepreneurial, operationally collaborative, it is performance measured, connected, and relentlessly inter-active.\n\nIt is the new way.\n\nThis generation wants its government to be accountable for its action, and accountable for the results we seek.\n\nToday in Maryland, you can go online right now, and see the 16 strategic goals we have set for our State\u2019s progress, in the areas of job creation, education, security, sustainability, and health.\n\nOn some of these, we\u2019ve already exceeded our initial goals. On others, we\u2019re making progress. And on a few, we still have a longer way to go.\n\nProgress requires accountability.\n\nBut accountability means putting your commitment out there, for all of us to know and see, and hopefully to help drive.\n\nOne example: In 2007, one of the goals we publicly set was to drive down our infant mortality rate by 10 percent, by the end of 2012.\n\nA lot of people told us at the time not to make the commitment public.\n\nYou see, the old way of thinking says elected officials should never set measurable goals with deadlines, because you\u2019ll be criticized if you fall short.\n\nWe chose a different path.\n\nWe set real goals with specific, and more immediate, deadlines.\n\nWe publish Plans of Delivery.\n\nWe call upon the public to hold us accountable and to help us achieve our goals.\n\nAnd we use the pressure of public awareness to push for maximum progress.\n\nBy the way, at the end of 2012, together we had driven down Maryland\u2019s infant mortality rate\u2014not by just 10 percent\u2014but by 21 percent.\n\nThat means 164 lives saved just in 2012.\n\nOf course, as you might have guessed, the reward for hitting or exceeding your goal is to set an even higher goal.\n\nSo we have\u2014to save even more lives.\n\nAnd we are in it together.\n\nMeasuring Progress\n\nGoals. Deadlines. Performance measures.\n\nDoing what works, and doing what serves.\n\nThis is how continuous progress is made.\n\nJobs\n\nThis is how we create jobs.\n\nWe are one of only 17 states that has now recovered all of the jobs we lost in the national recession.\n\nAnd since the lowest point of the recession, we have now achieved the fastest rate of new job growth of any state in our region.\n\nPublic Education and Public Safety\n\nThis is how we improve public education. This is how we improve college degree attainment.\n\nThis is how we improve public safety.\n\nToday, with courageous law enforcement officers, we have now reduced violent crime to 30 year lows.\n\nWith our first responders, shock trauma doctors and nurses, traffic deaths have been reduced now to the lowest levels in decades.\n\nWe enacted common sense measures to reduce gun violence.\n\nWe repealed the death penalty and replaced it with life without the possibility of parole.\n\nAnd there are now fewer people incarcerated in Maryland\u2019s prisons today than at any time since 1994.\n\nSustainability\n\nGoals. Deadlines. Performance measures. This is also how we are making our air and our waters cleaner.\n\nWe have planted more trees on public lands in the last seven years than ever before.\n\nWe have added more renewable energy to our grid than any time since the Conowingo Dam was built 85 years ago.\n\nMore farmers are now planting cover crops to reduce nutrient runoff than ever before.\n\nTo protect our farmlands, our forests and our open space for the future, this year Maryland passed the milestone of preserving 1 million acres for our children\u2019s future.\n\nTogether, we have taken the strongest actions in decades to make the Chesapeake Bay cleaner and healthier; strong actions that are restoring our menhaden,[43] our blue crab,[44] and our oyster populations.\n\nAnd we are leading the states of our Bay watershed in cleaning up the Chesapeake\u2014consistently meeting our two-year milestones, allowing less nitrogen and phosphorus to pollute our Bay today than seven years ago.\n\nMeasurable progress, by our hands, in our time, for the long term restoration of the Bay.\n\nChildren\n\nThis is also how we better protect our most vulnerable young people.\n\nTogether, we\u2019ve reduced childhood hunger, and today more children receive healthcare in Maryland than ever before.\n\nWe have reduced juvenile homicides by 44%.\n\nWe have reduced the number of children placed in foster care and group homes by 42%.\n\nDignity\n\nAnd along the way, we have come together, time and again, to protect the dignity of every Marylander.\n\nFor the first time in 350 years, we have now officially recognized our brothers and sisters of the native Piscataway People.\n\nTogether, so that the children of New American immigrants, can realize their full potential,we passed the DREAM Act in Maryland.\n\nAnd, to protect the dignity of every child\u2019s home\u2014and ensure equal rights under the law for all Marylanders\u2014we passed Marriage Equality.\n\nUrgent Work to Do\n\nBut for all of our progress, we still have urgent work to do.\n\nFor all of our achievements, being accountable also means acknowledging when we have fallen short.\n\nThe healthcare website failed to perform as designed when it was launched \u2013 a source of great frustration\u2014especially for those who were trying to obtain healthcare for the very first time.\n\nMy Administration has not succeeded at every first try, but we have never given up.\n\nWe learn from both success and failure.\n\nSometimes failure kicks the deepest spur.\n\nSo we will continue to improve. We will continue helping those seeking healthcare. And we will continue to enroll as many Marylanders as possible by the March 31st deadline.\n\nBut let\u2019s not lose sight of the larger goal.\n\nWe have already, together, extended healthcare coverage to 453,000 people\u2014many of them children\u2014who did not have coverage before.\n\nNow, thanks to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act, not a single person can be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition, and no one can be dropped from their insurance because they get sick.\n\nAnd with the leadership of Lieutenant Governor Brown and Secretary Sharfstein\u2013 and I must add, the support of our Congressional delegation led by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, Senator Cardin, Congressman Van Hollen and Congresswoman Edwards \u2013 earlier this month we embarked on a new and better way to improve wellness and reduce overall healthcare costs.\n\nLet me talk about this for a second.\n\nThe old payment system for health care, encouraged the volume of services instead of the wellness of our people. The more sickness, the more pay.\n\nIt was a system that made it look as if even our hospitals needed hospitals. But not any more.\n\nThis new approach will change our payment system to reward hospitals for actually keeping people well.\n\nIt has been described by healthcare experts as \u201cwithout any question, the boldest proposal in the United States in the last half century.\u201d\n\nTen of our forty-six hospitals in Maryland have already adopted this new approach \u2013 partnering with nursing homes, public health agencies, primary care doctors, wellness professionals and others, to keep their communities well.\n\nIt works. It achieves results. It\u2019s a better way. And it will improve wellness.\n\nFor us here in Maryland, the question has never been whether we move left or whether we move right, it is whether we move forward or whether we move back.\n\nAs One Maryland, we choose to move forward.\n\nAn Economy with a Human Purpose\n\nBecause progress is a choice.\n\nAnd we have important work to accomplish this year.\n\nWith all of the strides we\u2019ve made in education, this session we have the ability to advance universal pre-k in Maryland.\n\nThis session, we have the responsibility to improve our laws to better protect victims of domestic violence.\n\nWe also have the chance, this session, to come together, forge consensus, and raise the minimum wage in Maryland.\n\nTo strengthen and grow our middle class\u2014this has been the North Star of everything that we have done as an Administration. Our fiscal discipline. Our strategic investments. Our different way of governing for results.\n\nTogether, here in Maryland:\n\n\u2022We\u2019ve invested dearly, to improve education as a ladder to success.\n\n\u2022We are investing more than ever in our transportation infrastructure, to get more of our people back to work.\n\n\u2022We raised the Earned Income tax credit. Why? To better reward hard work.\n\n\u2022We became the first state in the country to pass a living wage.\n\n\u2022We put in place for the first time a progressive income tax,\u2026 reducing income taxes for 86 percent of Marylanders.\n\n\u2022Just last calendar year, we moved more people than ever from welfare to work.\n\nBecause of these actions, the Pew Foundation now ranks Maryland one of the top three states for upward economic mobility.\n\nBut we, of course, are part of a larger national economy. And something is still very wrong.\n\nWe\u2019ve lost sight of how our economy works when it is working well.\n\nProsperity doesn\u2019t trickle down from the top.\n\nIt never has.\n\nIt\u2019s built from the middle out\u2014and from the middle up.\n\nHenry Ford understood that 100 years ago, when he doubled the pay of all his workers. His fellow capitalists thought he was crazy. But he understood that America worked best \u2013 and our economy worked best \u2013 if workers could afford to buy the products they were making.\n\nIn other words, in a properly functioning capitalist economy, a thriving middle class is not a consequence of growth and prosperity\u2014it is the source of growth and prosperity.\n\nWhen every worker earns more money, every business has more customers, and \u2013 by the way \u2013 every taxpayer is relieved from funding poverty programs, for workers who are being paid poverty-level wages.\n\nWe have all met the hard-working people who toil away\u2014very often\u2014at not one but two jobs that pay minimum wage.\n\nMost often they are women. Very often they are moms who are trying support a child or two on their own. Leaning on everyone around them for day care. Working 16-hour days, and yet falling further behind.\n\nThis is not how our economy should work \u2013 no person who works full-time and plays by the rules, should be forced to raise their family in poverty. Not in our state.\n\nShould we be satisfied as a people, as a country, as a State, if our corporations are becoming ever more profitable and yet so many of our people are unemployed?\n\nCan we really say that our economy is working, if our stock market is booming, but middle class earnings are declining?\n\nThe economy we seek in Maryland is an economy with a human purpose.\n\nWhere the ranks of our middle class are growing, so our economy itself can grow.\n\nAnd the only way we\u2019re going to grow our economy is to grow our middle class.\n\nIncrease the Minimum Wage\n\nThe minimum wage in Maryland is no longer a wage that anyone can live on.\n\nEven though Maryland has the highest median income in the nation \u2013 21 other states have now set a higher minimum wage than ours.\n\nWe can do better.\n\nRaising the minimum wage to $10.10 is going to create more and better customers for Maryland businesses.\n\nAnd that is why raising the minimum wage in Maryland is not only good for the hundreds of thousands who will see a boost in their paychecks, it is good for every Marylander, because it is good for our economy.\n\nIt\u2019s time to raise the minimum wage.\n\nThe Future We See\n\nI believe in my heart that we are poised for a generation of greatness.\n\nI can see the day on our horizon when the achievement of our students leads not just our nation, but the world.\n\nI can see the day when all of our teachers have the technology to provide personalized learning, tailored to every student\u2019s unique abilities in the classroom.\n\nA day when every high school student in Maryland graduates with a modern technical skill and a year of college credit already earned.\n\nI see Maryland\u2019s children enjoying the benefits of a State that wisely safeguards its waters and woodlands and open spaces, for the 22nd century and beyond.\n\nA State that leads the green economy of the future, creating thousands of new jobs.\n\nI see a time fast approaching when our booming high tech economy is fueled by the talent of an ever more highly-skilled workforce.\n\nAnd yes, I see a rapidly growing middle class whose standard of living is rising \u2013 a growing and diverse middle class that has become the forerunner of a newer, better American economy.\n\nI can see the year that is coming when not a single child in Maryland will die a violent death.\n\nThis is the future that remains to be won. And it will be won.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe are standing at the threshold of a new era of American progress.\n\nAs our world becomes more complex, it is also becoming more personalized and better connected. And no state is better poised to succeed in this new era than Maryland.\n\nThe future is where we look. The past is what we have learned from.\n\nThe only things worth doing are the things that might possibly break your heart.\n\nFor 230 years, we have helped lead our country forward, into the future \u2013 especially through moments of doubt and adversity. When others said it was impossible, that all was lost, or it could not be done, we stood our ground. And we made it happen.\n\nFrom many, one. From one, many.\n\nIt is time for us to do it again.\n\nThank you.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "o'malley", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The text of Maryland Gov.
