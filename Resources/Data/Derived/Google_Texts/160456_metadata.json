Doug Lamborn, the Colorado Republican who represents the district in which both prisons are located, called it \u201coutrageous and unacceptable for President Obama to waste time and taxpayer dollars on a dangerous fantasy that will go nowhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people of Colorado do not want the world\u2019s worst terrorists housed in our own backyard and we will not stand for this,\u201d Mr. Lamborn said in a statement. \u201cI will do everything in my power to resist these unlawful terrorist transfers from taking place.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Moroccan detained at Gitmo for 13 years repatriated\n\nThe heated reaction came after the Defense Department said in a Friday statement that it will conduct site surveys at two Colorado prisons as part of the administration\u2019s plan to shutter Guantanamo.\n\nOne facility under consideration is the Federal Correctional Institution Florence, also known as \u201cSupermax,\u201d a medium-security prison that holds 1,517 inmates, including several notorious terrorists such as 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.\n\nThe other option is the Colorado State Penitentiary II near Canon City, also known as Centennial South Correctional Facility, a 948-cell maximum-security prison that is currently vacant.\n\nSEE ALSO: Bernie Sanders tackles Syria turmoil, rips Hillary Clinton\u2019s no-fly zone plan\n\n\u201cAs part of ongoing efforts to refine the plan to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, the Department of Defense notified Congress today that it will undertake additional site surveys within the next few weeks at Colorado State Penitentiary II and the FCI at Florence, CO, to assess potential locations for holding a limited number of current Guantanamo detainees in the United States, and to assess the costs associated with doing so,\u201d said the Pentagon statement.\n\nEven though the 2015 National Defense Appropriation Act renews the congressional ban on transferring of Gitmo detainees to U.S. soil, the Defense Department has conducted site surveys at highly secure facilities recently in Kansas and South Carolina, meeting in both instances with staunch opposition from GOP governors.\n\nKansas Gov. Sam Brownback said in August that his state will not be part of any \u201cillegal ill-advised action by this administration\u201d to transfer the 52 detainees to U.S. soil, while South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said that \u201cwe are not going to allow South Carolina to become a magnet for terrorists to come here.\u201d\n\nBy comparison, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, was more open-minded. His spokeswoman told The Associated Press that he \u201cwants to have a full understanding of the costs, risk and impacts for Colorado.\u201d\n\nPutting up more resistance was Sen. Michael Bennet, Colorado Democrat, whose spokeswoman told Fox 31 that \u201cthe Department of Defense has no authority to transfer these prisoners or make such modifications, and they have made no case that it makes sense to do so.\u201d\n\nMost of the original detainees at Guantanamo, set up by the George W. Bush administration in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks have been moved elsewhere or returned to their home countries. Critics say the facility has outlived its usefulness and serves as a potent recruiting tool for jihadis.\n\nBut Colorado Republicans warned that bringing in the detainees would endanger the safety of residents by making the state a target for terrorists.\n\nSen. Cory Gardner, Colorado Republican, said that he will \u201coppose absolutely any plan to bring terrorists to Colorado.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Guantanamo facility houses some of the world\u2019s worst international terrorists, and it\u2019s critical that we keep them there,\u201d Mr. Gardner said in a Friday statement.\n\n\u201cThat this reckless and irresponsible idea is being considered at all by officials in the Obama administration shows a careless disregard for the safety and security of Coloradans. I will do everything in my power to ensure it does not happen,\u201d Mr. Gardner said.\n\nRep. Scott Tipton, Colorado Republican, said in a statement that, \u201cTransferring some of the world\u2019s most dangerous terrorists to our backyard places a target on Colorado.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny plan to move terrorists from Guantanamo Bay to Colorado is unacceptable and we will do everything possible to keep it from happening,\u201d Mr. Tipton said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Defense Department's plan to consider two Colorado prisons as possible destinations for Guantanamo Bay detainees is meeting with outrage from the state's Republican congressional delegation, demonstrating the political resistance President Obama faces as he tries to honor his promise to close down the Cuba detainee facility.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Defense Department\u2019s plan to consider two Colorado prisons as possible destinations for Guantanamo Bay detainees is meeting with outrage from the state\u2019s Republican congressional delegation, demonstrating the political resistance President Obama faces as he tries to honor his promise to close down the Cuba detainee facility.", "title": "Cory Gardner, Doug Lamborn reject plan to transfer Gitmo detainees to Colorado", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/4/cory-gardner-doug-lamborn-reject-plan-to-transfer-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/24/8a37a2105cf89c12740f6a7067001f85.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/24/8a37a2105cf89c12740f6a7067001f85.jpg", "description": "The Defense Department's plan to consider two Colorado prisons as possible destinations for Guantanamo Bay detainees is meeting with outrage from the state's Republican congressional delegation, demon", "card": "summary", "title": "Cory Gardner, Doug Lamborn reject plan to transfer Gitmo detainees to"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "article_summary": "The other option is the Colorado State Penitentiary II near Canon City, also known as Centennial South Correctional Facility, a 948-cell maximum-security prison that is currently vacant.\nBut Colorado Republicans warned that bringing in the detainees would endanger the safety of residents by making the state a target for terrorists.\nSen.
