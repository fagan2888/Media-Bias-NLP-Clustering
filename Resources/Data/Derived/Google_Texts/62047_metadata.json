Bloomberg News\n\n\u201cNIM especially improved in the second half year, because the rise in Shibor (Shanghai interbank offered rates) helped our placement in the interbank market as we are a net lender,\u201d said Deputy Chief Executive Brian Li in a press briefing Tuesday.\n\nThe short-term interest rates that banks charge each other abruptly surged to multiyear highs in June and again in December, as Chinese authorities\u2019 efforts to tame the mounting risks of \u201cshadow banking\u201d dried up liquidity in China\u2019s money market. Shadow lenders are a m\u00e9lange of informal funding sources, from traditional banks\u2019 off-balance-sheet lending arms to trust companies, insurance firms and pawnbrokers.\n\nThe squeeze hurt smaller banks that rely heavily on interbank borrowing. China Everbright Bank, for example, in June defaulted on 6.5 billion yuan ($1.07 billion) in of interbank loans.\n\nBy contrast, their larger cash-rich counterparts, like Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.\u2014the country\u2019s top bank by assets\u2014were in a position to provide liquidity to smaller peers and so benefit from the soaring interest rates. Foreign banks, which have conservative balance sheets to meet regulatory requirements, are also net lenders.\n\nBEA Tuesday became the first to pop its Champagne: Its China business last year posted a profit of HK$1.9 billion (US$245 million), up 16%.\n\nBank of East Asia has been more aggressive than its Hong Kong peers in mainland China, opening 128 outlets in 42 cities. Its results are often closely watched by analysts and peer banks to gauge China\u2019s banking environment.\n\nBad loans in its China business surged 85% to HK$840 million, and its nonperforming loan ratio jumped to still-low 0.49% from 0.27%.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about NPLs in China, given a slower economy that hurts exports and manufacturing sector,\u201d said Mr. Li, the younger son of Chairman David Li and brother of fellow Deputy CEO Adrian Li. \u201cBut new NPL formation remains under control so far.\u201d\n\nBank of East Asia is one of the city\u2019s three remaining family-owned lenders, which are under takeover spotlight again following the recent acquisition of Chong Hing Bank by Chinese property conglomerate Yuexiu Group.\n\nAsked whether the Li family, whose stake in the bank is estimated by analysts at 7.6%, is interested in selling, the senior Li said: \u201cIt\u2019s all about shareholders\u2019 value. If someone offers three to four times of book value, I would consider.\u201d\n\nAt the peak of financial boom in 2008, Chinese lender China Merchants Bank Co. paid US$2.47 billion, almost three times book value, for Wing Lung Bank. But Chong Hing went last October for HK$1.5 billion, a more modest 2.4 times book value, and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.\u2019s last offer for Wing Hang Bank, at US$5 billion, was just 1.9 times book value.\n\nBEA is now trading at 1.1 times its forecast 2014 book value.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Hong Kong-based Bank of East Asia , with a larger Chinese operation than its peers, benefited from China's cash crunch last year, its 2013 results show.", "title": "Bank of East Asia: A Winner in China\u2019s Cash Crunch", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/02/18/bank-of-east-asia-a-winner-in-chinas-cash-crunch/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BO443_0218mb_P_20140218045314.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Bank of East Asia: A Winner in China\u2019s Cash Crunch", "description": "Hong Kong-based Bank of East Asia , with a larger Chinese operation than its peers, benefited from China's cash crunch last year, its 2013 results show.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Fiona Law", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Hong Kong-based Bank of East Asia , with a larger Chinese operation than its peers, benefited from China's cash crunch last year, its 2013 results show.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-02-18T10:01:59-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/02/18/bank-of-east-asia-a-winner-in-chinas-cash-crunch/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-16622", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Hong Kong-based Bank of East Asia , with a larger Chinese operation than its peers, benefited from China's cash crunch last year, its 2013 results show.", "title": "Bank of East Asia: A Winner in China\u2019s Cash Crunch", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/02/18/bank-of-east-asia-a-winner-in-chinas-cash-crunch/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BO443_0218mb_P_20140218045314.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-16622", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-02-18T10:04:06-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce725\"", "article_summary": "China\u2019s cash squeeze last year proved a boon for the Bank of East Asia.\nBut Chong Hing went last October for HK$1.5 billion, a more modest 2.4 times book value, and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.\u2019s last offer for Wing Hang Bank, at US$5 billion, was just 1.9 times book value.\nBank of East Asia has been more aggressive than its Hong Kong peers in mainland China, opening 128 outlets in 42 cities.\nChina Everbright Bank, for example, in June defaulted on 6.5 billion yuan ($1.07 billion) in of interbank loans.\nBEA is now trading at 1.1 times its forecast 2014 book value."}
