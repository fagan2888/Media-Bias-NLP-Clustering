Rep. Ann Wagner wasted little time in vowing to continue her efforts to defeat the Department of Laborâ€™s rule to amend the definition of fiduciary on retirement accounts after the omnibus spending bill failed to include riders to stop DOL's plan.

The House passed the bill Friday on a 316-113 vote, and a Senate vote is expected Friday.
