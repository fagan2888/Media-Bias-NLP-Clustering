She\u2019s made few public appearances, save a visit last week to the nonpartisan Oak Cliff Lions Club, where she was warmly received.\n\nStill, the media\u2019s attention in recent weeks has focused on Hawk\u2019s ongoing political and legal troubles.\n\nA former high-ranking prosecutor who Hawk fired \u2013 administrative chief Cindy Stormer \u2013 is giving Hawk fits.\n\nCiting the DA\u2019s mental health issues and prior treatment for prescription drug use, Stormer filed a lawsuit seeking to force Hawk from office.\n\nHawk and her advisers are confident they\u2019ll prevail in court and that she\u2019ll be able to finish out her term.\n\nBut right now, Hawk\u2019s advisers say, it\u2019s time for the DA to reassert herself, rebuild a rapport with the community and remind voters why they elected her in the first place, over ex-DA Craig Watkins, a Democrat.\n\nShe\u2019s eager to turn over a new leaf.\n\n\u201cJudge Hawk is so ready to get back in the saddle,\u201d said Brittany Dunn, an assistant DA recently assigned to Hawk\u2019s communications team. \u201cShe\u2019s really picking up where she left off. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any nervousness or anxiety about that. It\u2019s like, \u2018Let\u2019s get this show on the road.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs political theater goes, this promises to be good.\n\nHawk\u2019s aides said they\u2019ve sent invitations to many dignitaries including the mayor, the city council and county commissioners. They hope to pack St. Paul\u2019s sanctuary.\n\nDallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, who met with the Republican DA last week for the first time since January, said he has a conflict on Monday \u201cso don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I had a good meeting with her and we\u2019re going to be meeting monthly,\u201d said Jenkins, a Democrat. \u201cI wish her the best.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released this week, Hawk hinted at her town hall agenda.\n\n\u201cMy hope is for us to continue connecting with different parts of our community,\u201d she said. \u201cMy job is just to bring everyone to the table, to listen, and to formulate fair, balanced, effective solutions for the challenges we face \u2014 and specifically the challenge of rebuilding trust between law enforcement and our communities.\u201d\n\nThat last part \u2014 rebuilding trust between police and the communities \u2014 is a theme that Hawk\u2019s team knows will play well at St. Paul, a historic black church with deep roots among African-Americans in North Texas.\n\nNot only is the venue rich with symbolism, it\u2019s also a safe spot for Hawk to land on her rebound tour because the church\u2019s pastor, Richie Butler, is a dynamic and charismatic young leader who reached out to Hawk after she sought help for depression. Hawk met with Butler one afternoon and shared what she\u2019d been through.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the people she sat down with first,\u201d a source close to Hawk confirmed, adding that Butler offered to host her town hall meeting at his church \u201cand she said great.\u201d\n\nHawk will try to focus on the work she\u2019s done since returning. She likely will mention that she\u2019s created a new Community Response Team, a group of assistant DA\u2019s charged with targeting habitual criminal offenders.\n\nIt\u2019s an idea that sprang from concerns folks expressed about repeat offenders at a town hall meeting Hawk held earlier in the year.\n\nHawk also is prepared to talk about the uptick in cases her office has filed and disposed of this year \u2014 again, with the goal of showing that her office is running efficiently and resolving problems.\n\nIn addition, like she did at the Oak Cliff Lions Club meeting, Hawk will brag about securing nearly $2 million more in federal grants to prosecute more sexual assault and family violence cases.\n\n\u201cShe does plan on recognizing all the good work we\u2019ve done,\u201d said Dunn.\n\nWill it be enough to give Hawk the fresh start she covets?\n\n\u201cHopefully,\u201d said Dunn, \u201cthere won\u2019t be any questions\u201d along those lines. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else she can say. This meeting isn\u2019t about that. It\u2019s about going forward.\u201d\n\nIf nothing else, it\u2019s a step Hawk needs to take.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL2RhbGxhcy1jb3VudHktZGEtc3VzYW4taGF3ay1pcy1jb21pbmctb3V0LW9mLWhlci1zaGVsbC1zZWVraW5nLXRvLXR1cm4tb3Zlci1hLW5ldy1sZWFmLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "James Ragland", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Dallas County District Attorney Susan Hawk is taking a big step Monday in her journey to repair a political career that, just months ago, seemed doomed.
