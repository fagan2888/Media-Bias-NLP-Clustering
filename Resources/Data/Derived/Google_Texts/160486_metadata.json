Our Founding Fathers enshrined the right to religious freedom in the Constitution.\n\nAnd yet today, we find religious freedom under assault. From political correctness dissuading businesses from saying Merry Christmas to Obamacare forcing religious organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor to pay for abortion-inducing drugs and birth control in their employer-provided health plans, there are countless examples of attacks against the free exercise of religion across our country.\n\nSadly, the fight has come to our doorstep with the filing of a lawsuit in federal court by two ultraliberal Washington, D.C., groups to remove the Bayview Park cross.\n\nThe Cross at Bayview Park is an important part of our community. It has served as a gathering place for countless thousands. The cross has stood for over 50 years without challenge \u2014 until now.\n\nFreedom of religion does not mean freedom from religion, a significant point that liberals constantly confuse. The Bayview cross was not put up by the city of Pensacola or another government entity. It is not a government endorsement of religion. Rather, the cross was placed there by private citizens looking to express their faith, as the Constitution allows.\n\nIt is time we take a stand in defense of religious liberty and protect the cross at Bayview Park. Our country will always be friendly to the cross, and we will not be taking any down here in Northwest Florida.\n\nI am heartened by the overwhelming response of Pensacola families and folks across Northwest Florida in support of the cross. The Keep Religious Freedom Facebook page founded in support of the Bayview Cross has over 5,600 fans. The Pensacola News Journal has published editorials and columns in defense of the cross. And, last week, I hosted a teletown hall in which hundreds of voters expressed their strong support for the cross.\n\nThe extremist groups that filed this lawsuit \u2014 the American Humanist Association and the Freedom from Religion Foundation \u2014 as well as liberal Amanda Kondrat\u2019yev, who is running for the 1st Congressional District, make a mockery of the right to religious freedom. They do not share the values of Northwest Florida. We are a deeply religious people who strongly value the right to freely express our beliefs.\n\nLawsuits like these are one of the many reasons people in our community and across our country are sick and tired of politics as usual. They are another example of why we need to take the fight to Washington to restore America. Defending the Constitution \u2014 which includes defending the right to religious liberty therein \u2014 is of paramount importance for Northwest Florida\u2019s next congressman.\n\nWe need leadership in Washington that understands America is a Christian nation founded on Christian values. And while government may not establish or favor a religion, it also may not squelch the right to express one\u2019s religion.\n\nIt is my firm hope that the courts will toss out this frivolous and dangerous lawsuit, which would diminish Pensacola families\u2019 constitutional rights and deprive the community of a place to gather in support of our faith.\n\nI stand with you in support of the Bayview Park cross. I hope you will join me in praying for the courts to make the right decision and dismiss the lawsuit. The cross is a longstanding pillar of the Pensacola community, and it deserves to remain standing.\n\nAnd with your support, I will always fight to protect religious liberty in Congress so that Northwest Florida families can always enjoy the freedom to express their religious values provided by our Constitution.\n\nMatt Gaetz (R- Fort Walton Beach) is a member of the Florida House of Representatives and a Republican candidate for Florida\u2019s 1st Congressional District. He is an active member of the First Baptist Church of Fort Walton Beach.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1Ti29lT", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Religious liberty is a foundational right in the United States of America.
