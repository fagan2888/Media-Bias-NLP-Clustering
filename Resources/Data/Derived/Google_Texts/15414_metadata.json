They augmented the numbers with additional Medicare administrative data on patient characteristics at the time of admission.\n\nWhen they compared the results for safety-net providers--which treat a disproportionate number of patients with low socioeconomic status--and other providers, they found little difference in penalties between the two classifications. While the risk of a penalty was higher for safety-net institutions, most of them received a 1 percent penalty, the lowest possible, in fiscal 2013 and 2014.\n\nThe researchers also found that readmission odds remained up to 7 percent higher for safety-net providers even after controlling for factors such as income and race, failing to account for about 40 percent of the disparities.\n\n\"Together, these findings suggest the need for a careful evaluation of policy alternatives that factor socioeconomic status into penalty calculations for excess readmissions to determine whether such alternatives could have a significant impact on penalties while remaining consistent with overall objectives for delivery system transformation,\" they wrote.\n\nThe quality of patients' post-discharge care, or whether they receive any at all, is a likely overlooked determinant of readmissions, the authors write, such as patient destination upon leaving the hospital, which is itself likely a combination of factors such as patient/provider preferences and patient access to such services.\n\nThe findings will likely intensify the controversy over CMS' measures for readmission penalties, which groups such as the American Hospital Association argue fail to account for sociodemogaphic factors, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the study abstract\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCMS rolls out plan to reduce healthcare outcomes disparities\n\nAHA calls for changes in hospital readmission penalties\n\nBill would factor demographics into readmission penalties\n\nReadmission penalties reach record high\n\nHospital performance not the driving force in readmissions\n\nReadmission reduction: A losing battle?\n\n3 ways to make readmission policies fair for hospitals\n\nHospitals that reduce readmissions still hit with penalties", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services devotes more and more resources to identifying social determinants of health, but the agency may discount the significance of care quality after discharge, according to new research published in Health Affairs.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services devotes more and more resources to identifying social determinants of health, but the agency may discount the significance of care quality after discharge, according to new research published in Health Affairs.", "title": "Safety-net hospitals at higher risk for readmissions--but not necessarily because of socioeconomic factors", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/safety-net-hospitals-higher-risk-readmissions-not-necessarily-because-socio/2016-01-06", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),health affairs,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,post-discharge care,Racial Disparities,Readmission Penalties,safety net hospitals,sociodemographic factors", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d9b\"", "article_summary": "While the risk of a penalty was higher for safety-net institutions, most of them received a 1 percent penalty, the lowest possible, in fiscal 2013 and 2014.\nThe findings will likely intensify the controversy over CMS' measures for readmission penalties, which groups such as the American Hospital Association argue fail to account for sociodemogaphic factors, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n3 ways to make readmission policies fair for hospitalsHospitals that reduce readmissions still hit with penalties\nThey augmented the numbers with additional Medicare administrative data on patient characteristics at the time of admission.\nWhen they compared the results for safety-net providers--which treat a disproportionate number of patients with low socioeconomic status--and other providers, they found little difference in penalties between the two classifications."}
