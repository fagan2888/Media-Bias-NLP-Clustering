Mike Huckabee, is the Republican presidential candidate who can steer America in the \u201cright\u201d direction.\n\n\u201cIf you do your research, you can see he is one to be trusted,\u201d she said during the Chamber of Commerce luncheon. \u201cI don\u2019t want my grandchildren to grow up and say, \u2018What did you do when we were in such pitiful shape?\u2019 ... We want to give them a better America than we had.\u201d\n\nJanet Huckabee, who was born in Lake Charles, is traveling Louisiana this week in support of her husband\u2019s campaign.\n\nShe\u2019s also making stops in Lafayette, Pineville, Natchitoches and Bossier City.\n\nMike Huckabee, who served as Arkansas governor from 1996 through 2007, is one of 17 Republicans seeking the GOP nomination for president. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal also is running.\n\nBut at Mike Anderson\u2019s in Central, it was all about Huckabee as campaign signs dotted the banquet room and organizers handed out purple and gold \u201cI like Mike\u201d stickers.\n\nCentral Mayor Jr. Shelton presented Janet Huckabee with a golden \u201ckey to the city\u201d during the luncheon, which was attended by about 50 people, including Congressman Garret Graves\u2019 wife, Carissa.\n\nBetsy Barnes, a local radio host who is active in the Central Chamber, said the group was excited to host Huckabee.\n\n\u201cIt is an opportunity that we were not gonna pass up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do have a very powerful voice in voting here in Louisiana.\u201d\n\nLouisiana\u2019s presidential primary will take place March 5, and the state is starting to see some campaign action.\n\nDemocratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign announced last week that she\u2019ll be in Baton Rouge on Sept. 21.\n\nBernie Sanders, who also is seeking the Democratic nomination, had appearances in Baton Rouge and New Orleans earlier this month.\n\nJanet Huckabee\u2019s largely informal speech in Central was peppered with jokes and anecdotes about her husband\u2019s decision to try again for the GOP nomination.\n\n\u201cFor this country, we have to believe the best is yet to come,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can start here in Louisiana.\u201d\n\nMike Huckabee, who ended his Fox News talk show in January to launch his presidential run, also ran in 2008, winning the Iowa Republican caucuses and finishing second overall in the delegate count.\n\nJanet Huckabee touched on several issues, including immigration, the federal Affordable Care Act and taxes. She said her husband\u2019s view is that the country needs to secure the border, repeal \u201cObamacare\u201d and abolish the Internal Revenue Service and adopt a \u201cfair tax\u201d model.\n\n\u201cYou can turn a bass boat around pretty quickly in the water, (but) America\u2019s like turning an aircraft around,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take some time.\u201d\n\nShe also expressed frustration over the Obama administration\u2019s decision to light the White House in rainbow colors after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage this summer.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just turn that on in one day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to do \u2014 that was pre-planned.\u201d\n\nShe said she doesn\u2019t believe that the court\u2019s ruling actually legalized same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are saying, \u2018It\u2019s the law of the land.\u2019 Not really,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Supreme Court cannot make law. There\u2019s no place in the Constitution that says they can.\u201d\n\nFollow Elizabeth Crisp on Twitter, @elizabethcrisp.
