Ted Cruz is taking a stroll down health insurance memory lane. He’s traveling back to the 1960s, when most employers, if they offered health insurance at all to their employees, usually served up a very basic package that would be called catastrophic coverage today. Others might help employees purchase insurance, perhaps facilitating a group discount. But the idea of an employer paying for comprehensive employee coverage was unheard of in all but a few workplaces.

That’s the working world Ted Cruz envisions. Why, he asks, should employers pay for employee health insurance when it binds employees to that employer and can make it tough to change jobs?
