When the recession happened, they all ended up having to go back to work to support their family.\"\n\nZackary Davis always dreamed of becoming a nurse. The 26-year-old graduated from Cal State San Bernardino\u2019s Palm Desert campus in June 2012; he was the first in his family to go to college.\n\nHe estimated that he has applied to more than 100 health-care facilities since. Davis said he has had five interviews\u2014and no job offers. Today, he works as a valet at the Hyatt Regency Indian Wells.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve basically let go of the chance of getting the ER or ICU like I want,\u201d said Davis, who lives in Indio. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are a ton of stories that are just like mine. It\u2019s cruddy, but I\u2019m trying to stay positive about it.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not alone.\n\nA 2011 survey by the National Student Nurses Association found that 36 percent of newly licensed registered nurses did not have jobs four months after graduation.\n\nIt\u2019s worse in California. About 46 percent of newly licensed RNs were without jobs up to eight months after graduation, according to a recent California Institute for Nursing and Health Care survey.\n\nThe survey also found that more than 90 percent of those without a nursing job blame their lack of experience, and nearly one in four were employed in non-nursing jobs.\n\nNew grads say who you know is as important as passing the board exam.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I only got hired because I knew somebody,\u201d said Candice Eckstrom, 33, who graduated from the College of the Desert\u2019s Registered-Nurse Program in May.\n\nShe began working at an Indio rehab center in October.\n\n\u201cWas it my first choice?\u201d Eckstrom said. \u201cNo, but everyone in nursing knows that you have to get experience wherever you can get it, because there are no jobs for new grads right now.\u201d\n\nAfter years of investments in building up the nursing workforce, the challenges new nursing grads face is a growing concern.\n\n\u201cThe valley has spent a lot of money developing these students, and if they don\u2019t get a job, they may drop out,\u201d said Betty Baluski, assistant director of COD\u2019s nursing program. \u201cThat\u2019s our biggest fear\u2014that we lose them in the future.\u201d\n\nThe nursing shortage of 10 years ago that triggered enlistment campaigns and big signing bonuses sent students into nursing programs by the droves, with the promise of secure employment.\n\nAnd then the recession hit. Nurses who might have gotten out of the workforce after having a child decided to keep working. Nurses who might have retired decided to put off retirement.\n\n\u201cThe big thing that happened was the change in the economy,\u201d said Wayne Boyer, COD\u2019s director of nursing. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the throes of that. Ten years ago, they were giving $10,000 incentive bonuses and all kinds of bells and whistles and promotions. You don\u2019t see that any more; they just went away.\u201d\n\nWith the aging of the U.S. population and the graying of the nursing professional\u2014the average nurse nationwide is 46 years old\u2014the recession has masked the demand, at least for now. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 2020, more than 1.2 million RNs will be needed to shore up the workforce.\n\n\u201cWhen times were good, nurses retired,\u201d said Kristin Schmidt, assistant chief nursing officer at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs. \u201cWhen the recession happened, they all ended up having to go back to work to support their families. In the next 10 years or so, we\u2019re probably going to be hurting for a lot of nurses.\u201d\n\nAnn Mostofi, Eisenhower Medical Center's chief nursing officer, agreed.\n\n\u201cWe have really had no need for new nurses coming into the workforce,\u201d Mostofi said. \u201cAs the economy improves, what\u2019s going to happen is we\u2019re going to have a drastic removal of nurses from the workforce.\u201d\n\nNationwide, there are more than 2.6 million nurses practicing in hospitals and other settings. California has about 392,400 working nurses, while Riverside County has 18,500, according to the state Board of Registered Nursing.\n\nHistorically, hospitals have been the largest employer of nurses and new graduates. But that is likely to change when the Affordable Care Act, known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d is fully implemented. As more people have access to health insurance, some nursing jobs will move to clinics, rehab facilities and specialty centers, such as those for diabetes and orthopedic surgery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s challenging to get nurses to think outside a hospital setting for their first job, but I think that\u2019s going to be what\u2019s called for in the future,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nThe valley\u2019s three hospitals\u2014Desert Regional, Eisenhower and JFK Memorial Hospital\u2014employ about 1,800 nurses. Hospitals typically have a 14 percent annual turnover rate, according to national statistics.\n\nIn the past three years, Eisenhower has hired 95 new grads\u2014nearly the same amount as those with experience, Mostofi said.\n\nWith about 100 nursing students graduating each year from COD alone, the competition for local jobs can be fierce. Each of the hospitals has a nursing program designed to give hands-on training to new grads\u2014but it\u2019s difficult to get in to those programs. Desert Regional had more than 300 applicants for its 24 slots this fall.\n\nNext summer, COD will sponsor a mentor program designed to help ease new graduates into the workplace.\n\n\u201cIt might be hard to find their first job, but once they get their first job, they\u2019re pretty golden; they\u2019re very marketable,\u201d Mostofi said. \u201cI would say that even the new grads shouldn\u2019t be too disheartened.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Davis continues his 18-month-long nursing-job search.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a nurse,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen eventually.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Zackary Davis always dreamed of becoming a nurse.
