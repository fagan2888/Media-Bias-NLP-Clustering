Instead, Republicans\u2019 \u201cgoal should be\u2026to form coalitions with as many Democrats as possible to put pro-growth reforms on Mr. Obama\u2019s desk,\u201d while accepting that \u201cthey aren\u2019t likely to overturn his immigration decree unless they take the White House.\u201d\n\nThis is not how our constitutional structure is supposed to work.\n\nCongress isn\u2019t bound to give the president whatever funds he needs for undertaking whatever extralegal actions he desires. Rather, Congress is duty-bound to use its powers to uphold the Constitution. In fact, to govern is to defend the Constitution \u2014 and a party that wants to show it can govern cannot afford to skip over the most crucial aspect of governing.\n\nThe Journal unfavorably quotes Senator Jeff Sessions, who has been a genuine statesman on these matters, for saying, \u201cCongress must respond to the President\u2019s unlawful action by funding the government but not funding illegal amnesty.\u201d The Journal replies, \u201cBut Senate Democrats will kill any bill that defunds Mr. Obama\u2019s order. What happens then? ... That\u2019s the question we never seem to get an answer to.\u201d\n\nFair enough. But another question we never seem to get an answer to is what happens if Congress always buckles to the president\u2019s will when the two reach an impasse on questions of funding. The Constitution explicitly grants Congress power over spending. But if every time a president really wants funding for something \u2014 say, for his lawless executive amnesty \u2014 Congress obliges and gives him that funding, who is really exercising the spending power? By saying that Congress should flinch from any such showdowns, the Journal is effectively saying that the legislature should cede to the executive the power of the purse.\n\nJames Madison had a very different take on this matter. In Federalist 58, he called the power of the purse \u201ca constitutional and infallible resource\u201d for Congress, and specifically for members of the House of Representatives, to use \u201cto accomplish their just purposes.\u201d\n\nMadison wrote, \u201cThe House of Representatives cannot only refuse, but they alone can propose, the supplies requisite for the support of government. They, in a word, hold the purse \u2014 that powerful instrument by which we behold, in the history of the British Constitution, an infant and humble representation of the people gradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance, and finally reducing, as far as it seems to have wished, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government.\u201d\n\nIn other words, by using the power of the purse, the people\u2019s representatives can successfully rein in abuses and reestablish the rightful balance of power. They can check the misadventures of overreaching actors, whether they be kings, presidents, or presidents who act like kings.\n\nMadison added, \u201cThis power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\u201d\n\nNone of this is to say that strategy and timing don\u2019t matter. If Republicans want to have this fight in January, when they have reinforcements in the Senate, that is understandable and perhaps even wise. But the fight must be had, and Republicans must believe they can win.\n\nThe Journal believes otherwise: \u201cAs far as we can tell, Mr. Sessions believes that if Republicans hold firm during a shutdown, the public will eventually side with the GOP, Senate Democrats will roll over, and the President will surrender. Does this sound remotely plausible?\u201d\n\nIn a word, yes.\n\nRepublican consultants and pollsters love to point to the last government shutdown, when the reported position of Republicans (even when it was no longer true) was that they wanted to defund Obamacare \u2014 a strategy that, according to polling, fewer than a third of all Americans supported. Polling suggested that, while Americans hated Obamacare (as they still do), they thought that defunding it was not playing by the rules; that it wasn\u2019t proper; that (as one poll found) \u201c[u]sing the budget process to stop a law is just not the way our government should work.\u201d\n\nIt is quite another thing, therefore, to use the budgetary process to stop a president who is brazenly violating the law. Americans believe in the separation of powers. (Progressives have never succeeded in changing the citizenry\u2019s mind on this point.) Americans believe in the Constitution. They believe in the rule of law. And in this case, they not only oppose Obama\u2019s lawless means but also his policy ends. In the most recent election, ad spending suggested that immigration was the #3 pro-Republican issue (behind only Obamacare and federal spending). All in all, this is a far cry from last year\u2019s defund fight, and there is no reason to believe that Republicans couldn\u2019t prevail.\n\nBut the larger point is that, if Congress is never willing to risk a government shutdown, then it effectively cedes the power of the purse to the president. Again, in Federalist 58, Madison predicts that the power of the purse will prove potent because the House of Representatives will be the last body to flinch. He asks, \u201c[I]f such a trial of firmness between\u2026branches were hazarded, would not the one be as likely to yield as the other?\u201d He answers no, pointing to \u201cthe continual triumph of the British House of Commons over the other branches of the government, whenever the engine of a money bill has been employed.\u201d He expected the same triumphs from our House of Representatives.\n\nThe Journal writes that \u201cObama must be smiling\u201d because he has \u201cinduced Republicans to ignore him and start fighting each other.\u201d In truth, it is the Journal that is advising Republicans to ignore Obama and his lawlessness, claiming that to do otherwise is \u201cto overreact.\u201d But the first obligation of a governing party is to defend the Constitution. Indeed, the first line of every congressional member\u2019s oath of office is, \u201cI, [state name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States\u2026.\u201d\n\nThankfully, that glorious document equips members with the tools they need to do so.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Congress,Constitution,Government,Immigration,Jeffrey H.
