The fourth of July has long been one of Mississippi's deadliest holidays in terms of traveling. Roads across the country are inundated with drivers heading to various places - all to celebrate the nation's independence. For one driver, the drive has been a smooth one so far.

"We were quite surprised that there was hardly any traffic coming out of New Orleans and then once we got onto 59 we thought there would be a little more traffic because of the trucks," traveler Nida Slauter stated. "Everybody is going around 70 and there's no traffic at all."

As more and more people take to the roads through the holiday period, law enforcement is stressing that drivers remain safe on roadways and have a designated driver if you consume alcohol.

"We would like to be more proactive and take preventative measures to let the efforts start at home, not once you get to a party or an event where alcohol may be served," Mississippi Highway Patrol SGT. Andy West said. "You need to have a plan."

That was one reason Slauter and her family left earlier in the day, so as to miss the bulk of traffic in hopes of not running into many accidents, and so far all has been well.

"I am real surprised that we haven't run into a lot of tie ups out on the interstate, but the further north I expect it around Louisville and probably into Cincinnati," said Slauter.
