(The consumer price index rose just 0.1% in 2008 during the worst of the Great Recession.)\n\nThe biggest relief, of course, came at the gas station.\n\nPlunging oil prices drove the average cost of regular gas to $2.14 a gallon by year end from $2.50 at the start of 2015, according to the Energy Information Administration. As measured by the CPI, the cost of fueling up sank 20% in 2015.\n\nLower fuel costs also led to a 3% decline in the price of airfare.\n\nCheap gas helped fuel a car-buying binge in 2015 as Americans bought new vehicles at a record rate. Low interest rates and dealer incentives added a helping hand: prices of new autos were basically flat last year.\n\nThe same could not be said for insuring vehicles. Forget all those funny TV ads about cut-rate plans: auto insurance jumped 5.7% last year.\n\nAnother large household expense, medical care, also accelerated. The cost of going to the doctor\u2019s office or the hospital rose 2.9% in 2015 to mark the fastest increase in three years, the CPI report showed.\n\nHigher health-care costs and the fate of Obamacare are major talking points in the 2016 election season.\n\nAlso on the up and up in 2015 was the cost of renting or buying a home. Rents climbed 3.7%, the biggest increase in eight years.\n\nMoving to your new home was also expensive. Freight costs leaped 13%.\n\nNew home buyers did get small breaks in other ways. Furniture prices slid 2.3% in 2015 and the cost of clocks, lamps, cookware and tableware posted even steeper declines.\n\nOh, and that new big-screen HDTV? Prices of televisions tumbled 15%.\n\nThe cost of putting food on the table also eased after a big runup in the previous year. Food prices rose just 0.8% in 2015 \u2014 the smallest gain since 2009 \u2014 with most of the increase coming early on. Prices had jumped 3.4% in 2014.\n\nEven better, the cost of buying groceries to prepare meals at home actually fell for the first time in six years and only the second time since 1976.\n\nBeef prices finally began to subside last year after soaring almost 20% in 2014 to record highs. Buying a beef roast cost 7% less than the year before.\n\nAmericans were also able to pig out more cheaply, as size of the U.S. pig herd hit the highest level since the government began keeping track in the late 1980s. The cost of pork fell 7%, mainly because of the cheapest ham prices in several years. Shoppers can buy fresh hams for $2 a pound or less in stores now.\n\nJust don\u2019t expect such great deals on bacon, whose cost soared in 2014 after disease wiped out millions of piglets. Americans much prefer bacon to any other cut of pork, so prices only fell slightly last year even though the pig herd increased.\n\nSome staples did post big increases in 2015. Eggs surged 15% because of chicken disease and lettuce prices rose almost 9% owing to funky weather.\n\nIt also cost more to eat out. Prices rose four times faster than the cost of dining at home.\n\nIf you dressed up for the restaurant, however, take heart. The cost of buying a men\u2019s suit dropped 4% and women\u2019s dresses fell almost 10%.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Americans got a big break on gasoline prices in 2015 as well as furnishings for their homes, but they got less relief on some of their largest expenses such as medical care and shelter.", "creator": "@jbartash", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DB694_econ_c_ZG_20141216144259.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Jeffry Bartash", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Americans got a big break on gasoline prices in 2015 as well as furnishings for their homes, but they got less relief on some of their largest expenses such as medical care and shelter.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-cost-you-more-in-2015-and-what-cost-less-2016-01-20", "author": "Jeffry Bartash", "parsely-title": "Here\u2019s what cost you more in 2015 \u2014 and what cost less", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-01-20T13:08:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Americans got a big break on gasoline prices in 2015 as well as furnishings for their homes, but they got less relief on some of their largest expenses such as medical care and shelter.", "title": "Here\u2019s what cost you more in 2015 \u2014 and what cost less", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-cost-you-more-in-2015-and-what-cost-less-2016-01-20", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DB694_econ_c_ZG_20141216144259.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DB694_econ_c_ZG_20141216144259.jpg"}, "article.id": "3706F17E-BF8D-11E5-9931-0AA085C85FA9", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Getty Images The cost of groceries for preparing meals at home fell in 2015, reflecting a low rate of consumer inflation.\nConsumer prices rose just 0.7% last year to mark the second slowest rise in inflation in 54 years, the government said Wednesday.\nFood prices rose just 0.8% in 2015 \u2014 the smallest gain since 2009 \u2014 with most of the increase coming early on.\nFurniture prices slid 2.3% in 2015 and the cost of clocks, lamps, cookware and tableware posted even steeper declines.\nAlso on the up and up in 2015 was the cost of renting or buying a home."}
