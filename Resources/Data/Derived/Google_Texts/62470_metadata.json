Department of Health and Human Services has until Feb. 10 to make significant progress on reducing the backlog of 19,974 untimely applications (over 30 days old) and 11,482 recertifications.\n\nIf DHHS fails to meet the USDA\u2019s goals, financing for the state\u2019s administrative costs of NC FAST could end as soon as March 12. The Associated Press reported that could represent as much as $88 million.\n\nThe NC FAST backlog totals were as of Thursday. A system update was launched July 15.\n\nRobin Bailey Jr., a USDA regional administrator, wrote in his letter to Wos that the agency \u201cis alarmed by the persistent problems despite our extensive technical assistance and repeated communications concerning the severity of the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cCitizens of North Carolina that need help putting food on the table are not receiving the basic level of responsiveness and quality of service that they deserve from their government. Continued delays create undue hardship.\u201d\n\nProminent among the goals is processing all pending applications that are more than 90 days old by Feb. 10. Other goals are completing all background applications subject to seven-day processing and all pending recertifications more than 90 days old.\n\nThe sanctions would not affect federal financing for food stamps. The administrative funds are passed to county Social Services departments to help pay for their food stamp programs, said Rebecca Troutman, director of intergovernmental relations for the N.C. Association of County Commissioners.\n\nWos did not provide a statement in response to the USDA letter.\n\nHowever, Sherry Bradsher, a deputy secretary for DHHS, said in a statement Friday that the agency \u201cstrongly disagrees with the federal government\u2019s threat to withhold Food and Nutrition Service administrative funds.\u201d\n\nProblems with NC FAST \u2014 along with NCTracks, the Medicaid claim processing system \u2014 and other DHHS missteps have prompted several Democratic legislators to recommend that Gov. Pat McCrory ask for Wos\u2019 resignation. McCrory has been steadfast in backing Wos\u2019 performance.\n\nDuring the New Year\u2019s holiday period, DHHS erroneously mailed 48,752 Medicaid ID cards for children to the wrong addresses. That included more than 9,300 children in the Triad and Northwest N.C.\n\nBradsher said that Wos, McCrory and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack have reached \u201ca verbal agreement of our plan to clear up outstanding FNS applications and recertifications.\u201d\n\nAccording to DHHS data, the NC FAST backlog includes 3,978 untimely pending food-stamp applications and 889 total pending recertifications in the 14-county region.\n\nBy comparison, on Jan. 14 there were 3,189 untimely pending food-stamp applications and 720 total pending recertifications in the region.\n\nForsyth County\u2019s untimely pending applications increased from 1,272 on Jan. 14 to 1,708, becoming the third-highest total in the state.\n\nDHHS officials say the backlog is decreasing, in part because they have found at least 9,500 duplicate applications. Advocates say the duplications were caused in large part by individuals not knowing if the initial application was accepted.\n\nHowever, the latest DHHS data did not include pending applications less than 30 days old, which reduced the overall backlog total. According to the USDA, federal law considers 30 days as the maximum time permitted to process most applications.\n\nWayne Black, director of the N.C. Division of Social Services, acknowledged in his letter to county DSS directors that DHHS will be held accountable for resolving all backlogs and meeting all federal processing timelines by March 31.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that we all implement \u2018all hands on deck\u2019 as we would do in the case of an emergency, including working overtime, assigning staff from other areas to assist with this very important work.\u201d\n\nJoe Raymond, director of Forsyth County\u2019s Department of Social Services, said his department \u201cis doing all humanly possible to finish processing these cases, including working overtime this weekend.\u201d\n\nDespite those efforts, Raymond said his staff \u201chas not been able to catch up.\u201d He said other nontechnical factors adding to the NC FAST problems include the highest food and nutrition caseloads and the highest child and family Medicaid caseloads in Forsyth history.\n\nRaymond said Forsyth DSS income support services include 50,000 Medicaid cases and 27,000 food and nutrition households that affect almost 100,000 citizens.\n\nSeveral legislators \u2014 including Sen. Earline Parmon, D-Forsyth, and Sen. Martin Nesbitt, D-Buncombe \u2014 challenged Wos at a Jan. 14 legislative oversight committee meeting to say when problems with NC FAST and NCTracks would be resolved. Wos demurred on providing such a timeline to Nesbitt\u2019s request for a written plan of action.\n\nHowever, Wos said in her Jan. 15 letter to an USDA regional director that she expects all application and recertification processing to meet USDA requirements by March 31. Bailey said the USDA will hold Wos and DHHS to that timeframe.\n\nN.C. Rep. Donny Lambeth, R-Forsyth, said, \u201cDHHS seems to be in reverse and needs to place the highest priority and resources in fixing their problems and work with the federal government to resolve the issues that are in disagreement.\u201d\n\nWos and other DHHS officials have tried to place some of the blame for the NC FAST and NCTracks missteps on previous Democratic administrations and regulatory requirement from the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nBailey wrote that \u201cmany other states have implemented the Affordable Care Act without the dramatic impact on (the food stamp program) that has occurred in North Carolina.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Federal regulators have raised the stakes on state health officials slow to correct the inefficiencies in North Carolina\u2019s food-stamp processing program known as NC FAST.
