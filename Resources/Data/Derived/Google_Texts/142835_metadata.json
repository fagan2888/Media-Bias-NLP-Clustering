This decision stands directly against the voices of millions of Montanans who have made it clear that they do not want more Obamacare.\n\nOf course, in his haste to tweet his outrage about Montana lawmakers supporting healthcare for the working poor, Mr. Lahn got carried away since the entire Montana population is just over one million people. So there cannot be millions of Montanans who oppose Obamacare, simply because there are not millions of Montanans. Furthermore, of the tens of thousands of Montanans (not millions) that actually exist, a significant percentage support Obamacare.\n\nPerhaps we can excuse Mr. Lahn\u2019s ignorance as Montana\u2019s State Director of AFP because the state\u2019s grassroots leader hasn\u2019t actually lived in the state long enough to have roots. He came over from Colorado, where he had his \u201cJoe the Plumber\u201d moment, grilling Barack Obama about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2009, when Lahn was a student at the University of Colorado in Boulder.\n\nAlthough AFP bills itself as a grassroots political advocacy group, it is really an astroturf group, funded by the billionaire Koch brothers to try to pass legislation favorable to their economic interests. They have three field offices set up in Montana, but so far their efforts seem to be stumbling in the Big Sky country, under the direction of Lahn.\n\nThe MillionsOfMontanans hashtag has been trending on Twitter, mocking the AFP Director\u2019s ignorance about the state\u2019s population. Even Montana Governor Steve Bullock and Senator Jon Tester have sent out humorous tweets referencing the gaffe.\n\nBut the group has run into more than just snarky Twitter opposition. In February, a raucous crowd disrupted an AFP-sponsored \u201cHealthcare Town Hall\u201d in Kalispell, Montana, giving Lahn an earful for his efforts to target a Republican lawmaker, who wasn\u2019t dutifully swallowing the party line on voting down Medicaid expansion.\n\nWhat the Koch Brothers don\u2019t seem to realize is that although many red state residents may not be fans of President Obama, they also are deeply suspicious of phony grassroots organizations funded by out of state billionaires. Out of state poseurs pretending to be grassroots advocates are easy to spot, especially when they fail basic facts. If the Koch Industries-funded Americans for Prosperity organization wants to make any headway in Montana, they should probably find a new leader from the millions of Montanans who could replace their current spokesmen. Or rather, from the tens of thousands of Montanans who could.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Montanans may not be fans of President Obama, but they also are suspicious of organizations funded by out of state billionaires.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Keith Brekhus", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Montanans may not be fans of President Obama, but they also are suspicious of organizations funded by out of state billionaires.", "title": "Koch Brothers Astroturf Director Fails Again With \"Millions Of Montanans\" Tweet", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/04/11/koch-brothers-astroturf-director-fails-millions-montanans-tweet.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/koch-brothers-feat.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-11T15:38:38+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Commentary,Featured News,Republican Party,AFP,americans for prosperity,Barack Obama,colorado,Geography of Germany,Jon Tester,Medicaid,Montana,Steve Bullock,twitter,University of Colorado,Zach Lahn,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-04-11T15:12:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-11T15:38:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "AFP, americans for prosperity, Barack Obama, colorado, Geography of Germany, Jon Tester, Medicaid, Montana, Steve Bullock, twitter, University of Colorado, Zach Lahn"}, "article_summary": "So there cannot be millions of Montanans who oppose Obamacare, simply because there are not millions of Montanans.\nThis decision stands directly against the voices of millions of Montanans who have made it clear that they do not want more Obamacare.\nFurthermore, of the tens of thousands of Montanans (not millions) that actually exist, a significant percentage support Obamacare.\nOn Thursday, Americans for Prosperity\u2019s (AFP) Montana State Director, Zach Lahn, responded to the state House passing a Medicaid expansion bill, by tweeting:We are deeply disappointed in the legislature\u2019s decision tonight to expand Medicaid.\nIf the Koch Industries-funded Americans for Prosperity organization wants to make any headway in Montana, they should probably find a new leader from the millions of Montanans who could replace their current spokesmen."}
