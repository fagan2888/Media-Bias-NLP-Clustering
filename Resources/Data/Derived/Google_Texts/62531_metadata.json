But he might.\n\n\"All options are on the table,\" Noble said. \"We haven't talked about that yet.\"\n\nThe Republican's political team formed the PAC, called Babeu for America, earlier this year and launched a website soliciting donations.\n\nBut only recently did the PAC file organization paperwork after meeting the required $5,000 fundraising threshold. The Federal Election Commission records were submitted Nov. 25.\n\nBabeu plans to back like-minded federal candidates who believe in \"securing the border and supporting the rule of law,\" Noble said.\n\nHis state PAC, Paul Babeu for Arizona, was active for Republicans in 2014 races, contributing to Secretary of State candidate Michele Reagan as well as Republicans for state Legislature and Justice of the Peace.\n\nNoble said Babeu wants to capitalize on his \"national presence.\"\n\n\"With him being on the national circuit, he believes we should use that to get some funds,\" Noble said. \"A lot of folks talk a big game\u2026 We're putting our money where our mouth is and helping other folks.\"\n\nThe PAC so far has not backed candidates for 2016. But Noble said it's still too early.\n\n\"We're focusing on getting the PAC where it needs to be,\" he said.\n\nBabeu regularly appears on FOX News and conservative radio to talk about border security, drug cartels and illegal immigration. His fundraising e-mails often blast President Barack Obama and take on national issues, including the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"The President and his allies in Washington continue to do everything in their power to weaken our border and immigration laws,\" reads one. \"Illegals are flooding the country every day because of the lack of leadership in D.C. It's up to us to fight back!\"\n\nBabeu ran for House in 2012 but dropped out after a scandal erupted over allegations from a former boyfriend, who was undocumented and claimed the sheriff threatened him with deportation. Babeu was later exonerated.\n\nHe was talked about as a possible candidate for Congress in 2014 but decided against running.\n\nBabeu recently drew attention for a sheriff's department recruiting video that portrays Pinal County as overrun with drug cartels and crime.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1CORYzK", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu wades into the congressional arena once again by launching a federal PAC.", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu wades into the congressional arena once again by launching a federal PAC.", "title": "Babeu launches federal PAC, silent on run for Congress", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/azdc/2014/12/05/babeu-launches-federal-pac/19976957/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu wades into the congressional arena once again by launching a federal PAC.", "title": "Babeu launches federal PAC, silent on run for Congress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/571f121ce6820c07404e9e1836320be6d1064833/c=0-14-334-348&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/12/05/635534082355540411-babeu.jpg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Paul Babeu", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Paul Babeu", "title": "Babeu launches federal PAC, silent on run for Congress", "author": "Rebekah L.
