The Obama administration claimed to be blindsided by the announcement, but Israel\u2019s government insists they warned the White House last week. Sources reveal that the prime minister decided to forgo the meeting because he was frustrated over a delay in defense aid. Yet, others say he simply didn\u2019t want to visit during the peak of the U.S. presidential campaign.\n\nThe bad blood between Obama and Netanyahu dates back a few years ago following a testy meeting at the White House. The leaders simply did not get along. Now, in a new interview with The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg, Obama is pinning the blame on Netanyahu. During their meeting, Obama claims the Israeli leader lectured him on the dangers Israel faces. Obama responded in annoyance, noting that he didn\u2019t become president without having some knowledge of Middle East affairs. Here\u2019s how their meeting went down, according to the president.\n\n\u201cBibi, you have to understand something,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the African American son of a single mother, and I live here, in this house. I live in the White House. I managed to get elected president of the United States. You think I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about, but I do,\u201d Obama recounted in the interview.\n\nThe president may have accused Netanyahu of lecturing him, but based on the above account, it seems Obama is also guilty of talking down to his guest.\n\nVice President Joe Biden appears to have a better relationship with the Israeli prime minister. He was in Israel this week to discuss military aid, but the discussion shifted to the rampant Palestinian terrorism in the country after an American tourist was stabbed to death and over a dozen others wounded in Tel Aviv. Biden denounced the attacks.\n\n\u201cLet me say in no uncertain terms: The United States of America condemns these acts and condemns the failure to condemn these acts,\u201d Mr. Biden said, adding, \u201cThis cannot be viewed by civilized leaders as an appropriate way in which to behave.\u201d\n\nIsrael needs more of Biden\u2019s rhetoric and less of Obama\u2019s dismissiveness. Our president needs to overcome his tendency to be easily offended and focus on what\u2019s right for our friend in the Middle East. Once he comes to this realization, we need to back up our talk with action and do what we can to help Israel to confront their dangerous neighbors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New attitude, please..05/27/2016 9:00:01AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "New attitude, please.", "title": "Obama: Netanyahu Lectured Me When He Came to the White House", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/03/11/obama-netanyahu-lectured-me-when-he-came-to-the-white-house-n2132170", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/313/2015-11-09T161101Z_1_LYNXNPEBA80UY_RTROPTP_3_ISRAEL-USA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "New attitude, please.", "title": "Obama: Netanyahu Lectured Me When He Came to the White House", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/03/11/obama-netanyahu-lectured-me-when-he-came-to-the-white-house-n2132170", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/313/2015-11-09T161101Z_1_LYNXNPEBA80UY_RTROPTP_3_ISRAEL-USA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama: Netanyahu Lectured Me When He Came to the White House, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The bad blood between Obama and Netanyahu dates back a few years ago following a testy meeting at the White House.\nThe Obama administration claimed to be blindsided by the announcement, but Israel\u2019s government insists they warned the White House last week.\nI live in the White House.\nAmericans sensed there was still a bit of tension between President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when the latter leader cancelled their planned meeting this month.\nDuring their meeting, Obama claims the Israeli leader lectured him on the dangers Israel faces."}
