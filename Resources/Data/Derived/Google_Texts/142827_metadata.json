People could also use it to look up information about the nearest bathroom and find out whether or not it has a long line before getting up to go.\n\nCauseway Media Partners, a fund that focuses on sports technology and media, led the Series A investment in VenueNext with participation from Live Nation Entertainment, Twitter Ventures and Aruba Networks.\n\nAlong with the funding, Mark Wan, managing partner at Causeway Media Partners, joined VenueNext\u2019s board. Mr. Wan is also a co-owner of the San Francisco 49ers, where the VenueNext app was created.\n\nMr. Paul said VenueNext plans to use its Series A capital to expand into a number of new venues. VenueNext has 30 venues in the U.S. signed up to use its technology.\n\nMr. Wan said his firm expects VenueNext to take its technology beyond sports venues, including to theme parks, college campuses, concert venues and hotels, given the new funding.\n\nRead the full article about VenueNext\u2019s funding, including more on investors\u2019 expectations for the company, at Dow Jones VentureWire.\n\nWrite to Lora Kolodny at lora.kolodny@wsj.com.
