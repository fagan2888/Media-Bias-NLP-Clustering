But after splitting a bottle of merlot with your dining partner, do you ever wonder how many calories you just consumed? One of Britain\u2019s leading public health physicians, Dr. Fiona Sim, the chair of the Royal Society for Public Health, argued of the importance for calorie labels on alcoholic beverages and their role in the worldwide obesity epidemic.\n\n\"Most women, for example, do not realize that two large glasses of wine, containing 370 calories, comprise almost a fifth of their daily recommended energy intake, as well as containing more than the recommended daily limit of alcohol units,\" Sim wrote in an editorial published in the British Medical Journal. \"To what extent do the calories consumed in alcohol contribute to the obesity epidemic?\"\n\nFor drinking adults, more than 10 percent of their daily calories come from their alcohol, and a majority of adults have no idea just how many calories they\u2019re drinking. When thousands of adults were asked how many calories were in common alcoholic beverages, 80 percent of them didn\u2019t know, Sim says. People for the most part are playing pretend and drinking \u201cinvisible\u201d calories. They\u2019re not counting how much that 150-calorie beer or mixed drink costs their daily expenditure, letting them consume in a kind of denial.\n\nAlcohol is a big contributor to weight gain. When it\u2019s digested, the body realizes it can\u2019t store alcohol, so it prioritizes metabolizing it and stops processing other fats and sugars properly. Ultimately, your whole metabolism slows, and the more you drink, the more you\u2019re training your body to slow its processes down. Take some of these translations to heart: a glass of wine has nearly the same amount of calories of an average slice of cake. Fan of beer lager? It has about the same amount of calories as a slice of pizza, and frozen margaritas measure up to a cheeseburger.\n\nNot only are the consumers responsible, she adds, but also the physicians who need to take the next step and start asking their patients\u2019 drinking habits in addition to their general diet and exercise regimen. It\u2019s difficult, though, for patients to assess their own caloric intake when they have no nutrition labels to base their count on. The European Commission is overdue in publishing a report that outlines the reasons alcoholic calories need to be counted just like any other food or non-alcoholic drink is consumed.\n\nThankfully, many Americans won\u2019t have to wonder any longer. Last month, the world\u2019s biggest distiller Diageo PLC announced it will be voluntarily labeling calorie content and other ingredient information on its products, including whisky, vodka, and beer.\n\nSource: Sim F.
