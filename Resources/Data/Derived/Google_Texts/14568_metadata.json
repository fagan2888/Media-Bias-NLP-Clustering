It\u2019s as fake as an Obamacare update.\n\nLook how fake this picture is. pic.twitter.com/eS0zAlrJwZ \u2014 RB (@RBPundit) April 11, 2014\n\nSee how the \u201cbooks\u201d have been duplicated to make the shelf in the background looked stuffed with weighty learning?\n\nBut there are even more.\n\nUpdated with more duplicated books. pic.twitter.com/riXC3SsSSx \u2014 RB (@RBPundit) April 11, 2014\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the books. Look closely, and there seems to be an errant finger floating loose.\n\nLOL RT @seanmdav: OMG. They even forgot to erase the kid\u2019s finger in the fake book Photoshop. pic.twitter.com/g8uvMLdFEM \u2014 Matthew (@Matthops82) April 11, 2014\n\nSome Twitter users noted (sarcastically) there really might be an innocent explanation.\n\nPfft!

And the Carney-Shipmans can\u2019t really be held responsible for what happens in newsrooms or offices outside their own.\n\nBut this kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. With a combination of propaganda and hackery such a big part of this administration \u2014 and more or less the definition of Carney\u2019s day job \u2014 Washingtonian\u2019s photo staff probably thought nothing of the deliberate distortion they committed here; that they were just reflecting reality as well as anyone else in the Washington of the Obama Age.\n\nThey were right.\n\n\u201cNo problem at all Mr. Carney. We can just photoshop the 5 books you own to fill these shelves and make you appear literate.\u201d \u2014 Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) April 11, 2014\n\nNo problem at all.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "That Washingtonian MOM puff piece about life in the household of White House spokesman Jay Carney and his wife, Claire Shipman, has some credibility problems.
