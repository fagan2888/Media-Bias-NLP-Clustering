And in a response, former state Senate President Kevin Raye says Poliquin is a \u201cWall Street millionaire\u201d who just moved to the district himself.\n\nPoliquin\u2019s Attack\n\nPoliquin\u2019s announcer says, \u201cHe says he\u2019s like us, but Kevin Raye made thousands working for Washington lobbyists, and didn\u2019t sell his Virginia home before running for Congress.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all technically accurate \u2014 and yet misleading. The ad\u2019s artful phrasing could easily lead a viewer to think that Raye just recently moved to Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District after living in Virginia while working for a Washington lobbying firm. In fact, Raye has lived in the district nearly his entire life.\n\nTechnically, it\u2019s true that Raye worked \u201cfor\u201d one Washington-based lobbying group \u2013 but he worked for it in Maine, drumming up local opposition to an Affordable Care Act tax on medical devices. And it\u2019s true that he made at least $2,000 doing that \u2014 he\u2019s required to report sources of income over $1,000, and he did so in both 2009 and 2010. So he did make \u201cthousands\u201d for his brief stint, but exactly how much isn\u2019t public knowledge.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also true that he lived in Virginia for six years \u2013 while working as chief of staff to Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe \u2013 and sold that home and moved back to Maine before his first run for the House. But that was back in 2001. The ad shows a date of \u201cMay, 2014,\u201d but that\u2019s the date of a newspaper story about the issue, not the move.\n\nRaye\u2019s Counterattack\n\nRaye responded to the attack by questioning Poliquin\u2019s hometown credentials \u2014 calling him a \u201cWall Street millionaire\u201d and claiming that a 10-month-old baby has \u201clived in the 2nd district longer than Poliquin.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s also technically accurate (assuming the baby in the ad \u2014 which the campaign says is Raye\u2019s great-great nephew \u2014 is really 10 months old and really born in the district, something we can\u2019t verify independently). But it\u2019s still misleading.\n\nPoliquin did indeed make millions on Wall Street, but he\u2019s no stranger to the district. He grew up in Waterville \u2014 just outside the 2nd District \u2014 and in nearby Oakland, which is just inside the district, and where his family has owned a lakeside summer camp for half a century. To be sure, he moved to his current residence in Oakland only in August, from an ocean-side home in the southern part of the state where he has lived for a number of years. But the current home is one built by his parents, and Poliquin was a co-owner with them as far back as 2007. He became sole owner when his parents moved to a retirement home recently.\n\nLegally, none of this has any bearing. A U.S. representative doesn\u2019t have to reside in the district he or she represents. The U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 2) requires only that a House member be an \u201cinhabitant\u201d of the state from which he or she is elected, on the day elected.\n\nWhat the candidates are vying for is the emotional high ground on the us-versus-them divide. An earlier Raye TV ad concluded with the slogan, \u201cFrom Here, For Us.\u201d That\u2019s what this Poliquin attack ad was responding to when the narrator says Raye \u201csays he\u2019s like us, but \u2026\u201d Raye\u2019s newest ad concludes with the claim that Poliquin is \u201cNot from here, definitely not for us.\u201d\n\nOther Poliquin Attacks\n\nNeither ad stops with merely questioning residency. We\u2019ll go over the other attack points in order:\n\n\u201cTrue Stimulant\u201d \u2014 The Poliquin ad\u2019s narrator says, \u201cRaye said Obama\u2019s $800 billion spending spree was a true stimulant.\u201d But Raye never said that, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act wasn\u2019t all spending in the first place. An estimated $211 billion of the stimulus was in the form of tax cuts.\n\nWhat Raye actually said in 2009 about the $900 million that Maine was expecting under the bill \u2014 as quoted directly in the very Bangor Daily News story that the ad cites as its source \u2014 is this:\n\n\u201cI think we have a responsibility to make sure as a Legislature we are doing everything we can to make sure that this funding will have the impact that it\u2019s intended to have.\u201d The reporter wrote: \u201cThe goal, Raye added, is that the money is spent as a true stimulant.\u201d But the phrase \u201ctrue stimulant\u201d was a paraphrase, not a direct quote.\n\nFor the record, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that, at its peak point of effectiveness in the first half of 2010, the stimulus \u201cincreased the number of people employed by between 1.4 million and 3.3 million,\u201d compared with what would have occurred without the stimulus program. Most economic studies agree that the stimulus had a positive effect, despite the partisan skepticism reflected in the Poliquin ad.\n\n\u201cDeath Tax\u201d and hunting fees \u2014 The Poliquin ad claims that Raye \u201cvoted to keep Maine\u2019s death tax and to increase boat and hunting fees.\u201d That\u2019s another statement that is technically accurate but misleading. What Raye voted for in 2009 was a state budget that retained and amended the state\u2019s existing estate tax to cover gifts made prior to death, and also raised fees for certain in-state hunting, fishing and other licenses by $4. There was no stand-alone vote on the estate tax, which Raye says he has voted against in the past. All but two Republican senators supported the budget that year.\n\n\u201cCostly new regulation\u201d \u2014 The narrator states that Raye \u201cwas the only state Senate Republican to support a costly new regulation on small businesses.\u201d In fact, the 2008 measure cost nothing because it never became law. It would have required retailers hawking extended warranties to tell their customers that state law puts an automatic four-year warranty on defective products.\n\nObamacare \u2014 The ad says Raye \u201cvoted yes on a plan to implement Obamacare in Maine.\u201d That\u2019s fairly accurate. There was no formally recorded vote, but Raye did serve in 2010 on a bipartisan committee on the Affordable Care Act that made \u201cconsensus\u201d recommendations, including urging the state to set up its own insurance exchange (which it ultimately did not do). There was no dissent to the report.\n\nIn summary, the Poliquin ad misstates some facts and strains others to make a case that his opponent is \u201cliberal.\u201d\n\nOther Raye Attacks\n\nRaye\u2019s response ad doesn\u2019t engage on issues such as taxes or health care. It attacks Poliquin on several grounds, mostly accurately.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s at it again\u201d \u2014 The Raye ad reaches back four years to show accurate snippets from a newspaper ad-watch story criticizing a Poliquin attack ad in an earlier race as \u201cnasty,\u201d \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cjust plain wrong.\u201d That was during Poliquin\u2019s unsuccessful run for governor in 2010, and his target then was another Republican primary opponent, Les Otten. The Lewiston Sun Journal\u2019s ad-watch story (available online only to subscribers) concluded: \u201cOur view: The attack ad is nasty. It\u2019s dramatic. It\u2019s riveting. And, it\u2019s only partly true.\u201d Ultimately, Poliquin lost the nomination with 5 percent of the vote, but so did Otten, who got 17 percent. Winner Paul LePage went on to defeat his Democratic opponent in the general election and has been serving as governor since taking office in 2011.\n\n\u201cHe got caught\u201d \u2014 Raye\u2019s ad recycles a tale familiar to Maine voters, saying Poliquin \u201cgot caught abusing the Tree Growth program to avoid paying property taxes on his ocean-side estate in southern Maine.\u201d And it\u2019s true that Poliquin managed to reduce taxes on his $3.4 million ocean-side estate in Georgetown, Maine, by taking advantage of a program that is supposed to promote commercial tree harvesting, even though his deed mostly restricts him from cutting down timber on the 12-acre property. Poliquin took his property out of the program in 2012 after being criticized for violating the law\u2019s intent, but paid no penalty.\n\n\u201cDonated money to handgun control, attacking our gun rights\u201d \u2014 The ad criticizes Poliquin for a $500 donation he made in 1989 to what is now the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. But more recently, he has written a May 3 op-ed article promising to defend the Second Amendment and saying that \u201cI do not support, and never have, the extreme objectives of national gun control groups, such as a federal directory of gun owners or expanded background checks.\u201d\n\nVoting in the Maine primary is set for June 10. If the GOP winner goes on to victory in November, it would represent a pick-up for House Republicans; incumbent Democrat Mike Michaud is not seeking reelection and is running for governor instead.\n\n\u2014 Brooks Jackson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf44e\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare \u2014 The ad says Raye \u201cvoted yes on a plan to implement Obamacare in Maine.\u201d That\u2019s fairly accurate.\nMost economic studies agree that the stimulus had a positive effect, despite the partisan skepticism reflected in the Poliquin ad.\nThe Lewiston Sun Journal\u2019s ad-watch story (available online only to subscribers) concluded: \u201cOur view: The attack ad is nasty.\nTechnically, it\u2019s true that Raye worked \u201cfor\u201d one Washington-based lobbying group \u2013 but he worked for it in Maine, drumming up local opposition to an Affordable Care Act tax on medical devices.\nIt may be true that all politics is local, but in Maine the contenders in a Republican congressional primary are positively wallowing in locality \u2014 while making dubious claims about each other\u2019s address."}
