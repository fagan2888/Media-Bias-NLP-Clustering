(AP) - The latest version of the Obama administration\u2019s plan to fight climate change won\u2019t work as promised and instead will drive up electricity rates and cost jobs, Wyoming\u2019s governor and congressional delegation said Monday.\n\nWyoming - the nation\u2019s top-producing coal state - would need to cut carbon dioxide emissions about 37 percent from 2012 levels by 2030, or from about 50 million to 31.6 million short tons per year under the plan by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nWyoming Gov. Matt Mead vowed to keep fighting regulations that are \u201cfundamentally bad for Wyoming\u201d and that he said exceed the federal government\u2019s regulatory authority.\n\n\u201cThe Clean Power Plan is scientifically flawed and if implemented will not achieve minimum reductions,\u201d Mead, a Republican, said in a release. \u201cIt is in fact damaging - not just to Wyoming, but the nation.\u201d\n\nSen. John Barrasso and Rep. Cynthia Lummis, also Republicans, joined the criticism of the plan that Obama administration officials praised as the single biggest step the U.S. could take to reduce greenhouse emissions.\n\nNationwide, the plan seeks to achieve a 32 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 2005 levels by 2030. That\u2019s up from a 30 percent goal announced last year over the same period.\n\nMandatory reductions would begin in 2022 and continue gradually over the next eight years.\n\nWyoming has much at stake with climate-change regulation. The state supplies about 40 percent of the nation\u2019s coal, more than any other state by far, and coal-fired power plants are a major source of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe plan would cause demand for Wyoming coal to slacken in the U.S. while the state itself would have to burn less of the stuff to meet its targets.\n\nMeanwhile, Wyoming exports nearly two-thirds of the electricity produced within its borders to other states. Burning coal supplies close to 90 percent of that power.\n\nCritics say Wyoming would have to do more than many other states to meet the EPA rules, despite its relatively small population and electricity use.\n\n\u201cThis rule will face significant challenges in court and states are right to reject it,\u201d Barrasso said in a release. \u201cThe president, in full legacy-seeking mode, is choosing again to go around Congress and the American people.\u201d\n\nThe plan ultimately will have a barely discernable effect on global temperatures and sea levels, and it\u2019s reckless for the government to go ahead with it, Lummis said in a release.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take for granted the communities and families in coal country who produce the stable electrical supply that is crucial to our way of life and our aspirations for national prosperity. But that is exactly what the EPA is doing today,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The latest version of the Obama administration's plan to fight climate change won't work as promised and instead will drive up electricity rates and cost jobs, Wyoming's governor and congressional delegation said Monday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/3/resistance-to-obama-co2-plan-in-wyoming-the-top-co/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The latest version of the Obama administration\u2019s plan to fight climate change won\u2019t work as promised and instead will drive up electricity rates and cost jobs, Wyoming\u2019s governor and congressional delegation said Monday.", "title": "Obama climate change plan criticized by Wyoming leaders"}, "twitter": {"description": "The latest version of the Obama administration's plan to fight climate change won't work as promised and instead will drive up electricity rates and cost jobs, Wyoming's governor and congressional del", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama climate change plan criticized by Wyoming leaders"}, "Author": "MEAD GRUVER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b4b\"", "article_summary": "Nationwide, the plan seeks to achieve a 32 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 2005 levels by 2030.\nBurning coal supplies close to 90 percent of that power.\nThe plan would cause demand for Wyoming coal to slacken in the U.S. while the state itself would have to burn less of the stuff to meet its targets.\n(AP) - The latest version of the Obama administration\u2019s plan to fight climate change won\u2019t work as promised and instead will drive up electricity rates and cost jobs, Wyoming\u2019s governor and congressional delegation said Monday.\nThe state supplies about 40 percent of the nation\u2019s coal, more than any other state by far, and coal-fired power plants are a major source of carbon dioxide emissions."}
