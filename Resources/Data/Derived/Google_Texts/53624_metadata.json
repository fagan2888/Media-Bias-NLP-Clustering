It\u2019s really interesting. That\u2019s where I loved it the most, when he\u2019s in high school, struggling to keep his grades up and being bullied by Flash Thompson.

The campy horror show, which premieres Oct. 31, is set after Raimi\u2019s original \u201cEvil Dead\u201d movie trilogy and features Campbell\u2019s chainsaw-wielding, trash-talking Ash battling bloody things that go bump in the night.\n\nThe \u201cEvil Dead\u201d writer-director, who is serving as executive producer on the 10-part series and is directing the first episode, is pumped for fans of the cult classic to witness Ash\u2019s return.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Raimi looks forward to teenage Spider-Man and middle-age Ash", "title": "Raimi looks forward to teenage Spider-Man and middle-age Ash", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Raimi looks forward to teenage Spider-Man and middle-age Ash", "title": "Raimi looks forward to teenage Spider-Man and middle-age Ash", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/12/raimi_looks_forward_to_teenage_spider_man_and_middle_age_ash/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/2015-comic-con-quotash-vs.-evil-deadquot-panel.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Raimi looks forward to teenage Spider-Man and middle-age Ash", "title": "Raimi looks forward to teenage Spider-Man and middle-age Ash", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/2015-comic-con-quotash-vs.-evil-deadquot-panel.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Derrik J.
