People can walk into a massive, free health clinic at Seattle Center in October and get all kinds of services.\n\nLast year, the four-day clinic opened for the first time and about 3,400 patients showed up. Seattle Center Project Coordinator Julia Colson says it takes about 650 volunteers every day to make it happen and she\u2019s hoping more people will sign up for this year\u2019s clinic.\n\nShe\u2019s looking for health care professionals in medical, dental and vision, but she\u2019s also looking for volunteers without that experience, people who will do all kinds of things, like register patients or escort them to the proper newly-transformed medical exam room in KeyArena.\n\nVolunteers can sign up here.\n\nColson says when she first set out to plan the clinic, people assumed she was talking about homelessness. They\u2019re welcome, too, she says, but that doesn\u2019t really describe who comes.\n\n\u201cWe find a lot of working poor: people who are struggling to make ends meet,\u201d she said, \u201cHaving to make a decision in life about whether to eat or get medication or whether to go and have an additional service or be able to pay for transportation to get to a job.\u201d\n\nLast year, Colson says she met all kinds of people who were beside themselves about the chance to get eye exams, teeth cleaning, x-rays they had all but given up on.\n\nShe remembers one woman who sought her out to thank her. The woman explained that she had hesitated to attend but then changed her mind.\n\n\u201cSo she went to the clinic and got a ticket for dental and, indeed, managed to get two crowns, which was amazing,\u201d Colson said. \u201cShe was over the moon about it.\u201d\n\nBut the woman told Colson that wasn\u2019t the whole story. She was going to leave the clinic when someone pulled her aside and said she looked the right age for a mammogram and asked if she wanted one.\n\nThe woman explained to Colson that she had health insurance through her husband, but it\u2019s basic coverage and she\u2019d been skipping mammograms because they were too expensive.\n\nColson says the woman told her she debated it because she was already in a little bit of pain from the crowns but ultimately decided to do it.\n\n\u201cShe went and had a mammogram and shortly thereafter discovered, at the clinic, that there was an abnormality,\u201d Colson said. \u201cSo Seattle Cancer Care alliance immediately got her in for a biopsy, which they paid for. And it happened to be the same day her husband lost his job and on that day, she learned she had stage 3 breast cancer.\u201d\n\nColson says, almost a year later, the woman is doing OK.\n\nNow, Colson hopes more volunteers will sign up for this year\u2019s clinic, particularly since there were quite a few no-shows last year, not from the health care providers but the general support crew.\n\n\u201cWe had a 50 percent no-show rate, which amounted to about 100 people a day,\u201d Colson said.\n\nThat\u2019s why this year she\u2019s planning for extra volunteers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Seattle Center Project needs hundreds of volunteers to help \"the working poor\" get free medical exams, x-rays and dental work.", "og": {"site_name": "MyNorthwest.com", "description": "The Seattle Center Project needs hundreds of volunteers to help \"the working poor\" get free medical exams, x-rays and dental work.", "title": "Hundreds of volunteers needed for giant free health clinic", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/14/1476/147621.jpg", "height": 370}, "updated_time": "2015-08-10T05:42:06-07:00", "url": "http://mynorthwest.com/12595/hundreds-of-volunteers-needed-for-giant-free-health-clinic/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/14/1476/147621.jpg", "creator": "@sjlerner", "description": "The Seattle Center Project needs hundreds of volunteers to help \"the working poor\" get free medical exams, x-rays and dental work.", "card": "summary", "title": "Hundreds of volunteers needed for giant free health clinic"}, "robots": "noodp", "keywords": "MyNorthwest.com - Seattle news, sports, weather, traffic, talk and community., Home,MyNorthwest.com", "article": {"section": "Local News", "published_time": "2015-08-07T15:25:59-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-10T05:42:06-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kiroradio"}, "verify-v1": "XrJiQDsWmPaoqGKN0EHKs7ult0rBB0W9zj4cWkAPRVI=", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc770\"", "article_summary": "People can walk into a massive, free health clinic at Seattle Center in October and get all kinds of services.\n\u201cWe had a 50 percent no-show rate, which amounted to about 100 people a day,\u201d Colson said.\nSeattle Center Project Coordinator Julia Colson says it takes about 650 volunteers every day to make it happen and she\u2019s hoping more people will sign up for this year\u2019s clinic.\n\u201cShe went and had a mammogram and shortly thereafter discovered, at the clinic, that there was an abnormality,\u201d Colson said.\nColson says when she first set out to plan the clinic, people assumed she was talking about homelessness."}
