John Kasich had a surprise for first-in-the-nation voters Wednesday night \u2013 a cake in celebration of his 50th town hall meeting in New Hampshire.\n\nClick here to view News 9\u2019s report.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, Kasich participated in a panel on human trafficking in Concord. Then he held a meeting at the American Legion post in Hooksett.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for fracking,\u201d Kasich said when asked by a person in the crowd. \u201cYeah, but I have the toughest rules in the country on fracking. We know who puts what materials in the ground.\u201d\n\nKasich was asked why he accepted federal funding for Medicaid in Ohio if he wants to repeal Obamacare and what, specifically, he opposes in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like the mandates that have driven up the cost of insurance. And you have to remember, Ronald Reagan expanded Medicaid, I think five times. And so by expanding Medicaid, we\u2019re not only saving lives, but saving money because we\u2019re keeping people out of prison,\u201d Kasich said.\n\nThe latest polls show an average of 10 percent of New Hampshire voters support Kasich.\n\n\u201cTo get prosperity then, leave no one behind. If they\u2019re drug addicted, or if they\u2019re mentally ill, or working poor, or the developmentally disabled or the autistic, everyone should have a chance to rise,\u201d he said.\n\nKasich said he plans to hold 50 more town hall meetings in the state before Feb. 9.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Thu, 07 Jan 2016 05:41:15 EST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Stephanie Woods", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Ohio Gov.
