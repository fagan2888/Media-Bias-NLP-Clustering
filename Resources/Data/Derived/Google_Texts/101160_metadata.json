Parade magazine devoted a Sunday cover to the trend. Dover plans a national coloring book day on Aug. 2.\n\n\u201cPeople are stressed and anxious all the time,\u201d said Jeannine Dillon, Quarto\u2019s publisher. \u201cColoring is a way to calm down and unwind at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nBut art therapy is not the only reason coloring has taken off. As hobbies go, coloring books are incredibly simple: portable, easy to pick up and put down, old-school analog pursuits with no batteries or messages, no calorie-counting, skill-building, classes or scores.\n\nAnd the finished product is perfect for minimalists. Pottery and paintings demand shelf and wall space; knitted scarves cry out to be worn or bestowed as gifts. But a colored-in page takes up almost no space at all (unless you frame it).\n\nI can attest to the trend\u2019s allure. I\u2019ve been spending my spare moments coloring a book called \u201cSplendid Cities: Color Your Way to Calm.\u201d\n\nNot that I\u2019ve got much to show for my work. It took me more than two months to complete a single page of \u201cSplendid Cities\u201d because I never spent much time on it in one sitting. I\u2019d color during a stressful moment at the office or at home, or use it as a break from a complicated or boring task, or to transition between tasks.\n\nMy longest stretch coloring was an hour while awaiting delivery of time-sensitive documents that I feared were lost. Coloring distracted me from worrying about something I couldn\u2019t control or fix. I channeled the book\u2019s subtitle, \u201cColor Your Way to Calm,\u201d and could feel anxious thoughts waning as I concentrated on the picture. Coloring required just enough attention to disrupt the obsessive loop playing in my mind. It wasn\u2019t so much relaxation as immersion in something else.\n\nThe page I completed depicts a San Francisco streetscape of Victorian row houses with geometric patterns forming gabled roofs and arched windows. I limit my equipment to just four crayons and three colored pencils, preferring not to complicate my palette with too many choices, and I enjoyed deciding which of my seven colors to fill the template\u2019s tiny spaces with. Blue or yellow? Crayon or pencil? Finish the window or start the roof?\n\nWhen every space was colored in, I started over, rubbing crayon over pencil, pencil over crayon, mixing colors to make new ones and layering for a mottled effect.\n\nJason Keyser, 42, a stay-at-home dad from a suburb of Sacramento, California, picked up the hobby a year ago in a program to help him with anxiety and depression after a friend passed away. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it ever since,\u201d said Keyser, who placed third in a coloring contest for a picture he completed from Dover\u2019s \u201cAsian Tattoo Designs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really relaxing,\u201d he said. \u201cTakes your mind away from stressful things in life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Adult coloring books are giving Harper Lee a run for the money on best-seller lists this summer.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Adult coloring books are giving Harper Lee a run for the money on best-seller lists this summer.", "title": "Trendy but calm: Adult coloring books selling like crazy", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/15/trendy-but-calm-adult-coloring-books-selling-like-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/15/8ebf4507621d211f7c0f6a7067006a4a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/15/8ebf4507621d211f7c0f6a7067006a4a.jpg", "description": "Adult coloring books are giving Harper Lee a run for the money on best-seller lists this summer.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Trendy but calm: Adult coloring books selling like crazy"}, "Author": "BETH J.
