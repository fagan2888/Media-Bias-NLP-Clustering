Pledges from donors to fund even that basic work have fallen short by at least $700,000, Mr. Cassar said.\n\n\u201cUnesco\u2019s position is that restoration is a case of putting the cart before the horse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to save all options for future generations.\u201d\n\nProfessor Petzet argues that rebuilding the Buddhas would be no different from past efforts to reassemble parts of the Roman Forum \u2014 another project criticized by some archaeologists \u2014 or repair damaged mosaics after the earthquake in Assisi, Italy. \u201cIt\u2019s something human to want to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIn France, whole cathedrals were reconstructed in Gothic style after they were blown up by Protestants in the 1600s.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019ve talked with many Afghans, and they do not want that their children and grandchildren are forced by the Taliban to see only ruins.\u201d\n\nPeople who knew little else about Afghanistan knew that there was something amazing in this high mountain province, where the ancient Silk Road crossed the Hindu Kush, and where a sprawling Buddhist monastic complex flourished in the sixth century.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe monks sculpted cliffs hundreds of feet high, flattening their faces in order to build a network of monastic and ceremonial chambers within, with more than 1,000 of them in the area of the destroyed Buddhas. The larger standing Buddha was 174 feet high \u2014 the world\u2019s tallest and taller than the Statue of Liberty. The smaller one still towered at 115 feet.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConnecting the caves and the niches where the Buddhas stood was a network of tunnels, staircases and passageways hollowed out of solid rock, much of which remains intact.\n\nThe Taliban were not the first Muslim visitors to savage the monuments; Islam forbids any form of idols, and successive conquerors turned their artillery on the niches. By the 20th century the Buddhas were heavily damaged and both were missing their wooden faces, said to have once had jeweled eyes with huge lanterns burning behind them at night.\n\nDuring the war against Soviet occupation, mujahedeen commanders obliterated a sitting Buddha in the cliff with heavy artillery and looted many of the caves. Domed ceilings in some caves were desecrated; the fighters built scaffolding that allowed them to leave their muddy footprints on the ceiling, a move highly offensive to Buddhists.\n\nThe Taliban, however, brought a more systematic destruction to the approximately 1,500-year-old statues, planting high explosives throughout the niches in 2001, reducing the remaining statues to rubble and leaving the niches and many passageways unstable.\n\nPhoto\n\nProfessor Petzet maintains that his conservators have managed to preserve, identify and catalog as much as 30 percent of the surface of the smaller standing Buddha, enough, he says, to restore it persuasively.\n\nBut Unesco says other experts are not so sure of that figure, putting the amount of material recovered at about 10 percent.\n\n\u201cThe point is, a very small percentage of the surface remains,\u201d Mr. Cassar said. \u201cSome pieces are the size of a car and some a grain of sand.\u201d In addition, the type of sandstone from which the Buddhas were carved is highly unstable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster that can never be put back together,\u201d he said.\n\nAbdul Ahad Abassi, head of monuments for the Afghan culture ministry, said the government formally requested that the smaller Buddha be rebuilt, and Unesco\u2019s World Heritage Committee is studying the issue.\n\n\u201cIn 10 years, the Expert Working Group has come to no final decision,\u201d said Muhammad Asir Mubaligh, the Bamian deputy governor. \u201cI know they have achieved some small things, but 10 years? The main problem is there hasn\u2019t been a donor country to say, \u2018We will pay for it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSouth Korea recently announced a $5.4 million grant for the site, but it is earmarked to build a museum dedicated to Bamian\u2019s ancient culture and to train Afghan staff. Rival Japanese and Italian proposals call for other museum and conservation projects in Bamian. None of the proposals include money for rebuilding the Buddhas.\n\n\u201cI say rebuild one of them to attract tourists, and one should remain like that to remind people what the Taliban did,\u201d said Abdullah Mahmoodi of the Bamian Tourism Association. \u201cThe best way to protect our monuments is to make them valuable again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ad-sponsor": "Buddhas of Bamiyan",
