Undecided voters might not get excited about GOP accusations regarding the IRS and Benghazi, said Dan Schnur, a former Republican consultant who teaches political science at the University of Southern California. But given the administration\u2019s questionable behavior in both areas, he said, \u201cThey certainly don\u2019t line up on the other side.\u201d GOP strategist Terry Holt agrees. The Benghazi assault, he said, was \u201cthe phone call Hillary Clinton warned us about in 2008 when she was running against Obama. They both blew it.\u201d\n\nRepublicans never learn. Manufactured scandals such as the IRS and Benghazi don\u2019t work. Most people can smell the bull coming a mile away. The fact that Republicans can\u2019t explain what exactly the scandal is in the Benghazi scandal has led the media, and the vast majority of people, to ignore it. The basis for the Republican Benghazi and the IRS allegations is their belief in a White House cover-up.\n\nThe right is fond of comparing Benghazi to Watergate, but the problem with this comparison is that the Watergate break-in took place in June 1972. By July 1973, evidence of wrongdoing was growing, and Nixon resigned in August 1974. Benghazi happened in September 2012, and despite seven previous investigations, there is no evidence that the White House did anything wrong.\n\nThere is no similarity between Watergate and Benghazi. Watergate was a real scandal. Benghazi is a cooked up sideshow that exists for partisan political gain. If Republicans don\u2019t think that their refusal to discuss jobs and the economy will hurt them in November, they are more delusional than anyone could have imagined.\n\nWith Obamacare working, and Democrats feeling empowered, Republicans have nothing to run on. This is why they have revived the widely discredited Benghazi and IRS conspiracy theories. Republicans are all but admitting that Benghazi and the IRS are distraction issues.\n\nThe Benghazi gambit has been a total disaster for Republicans. The media and the American people both aren\u2019t buying it. Republicans are admitting defeat on Obamacare, and watching their Benghazi and IRS conspiracies blow up in their faces.\n\nDemocrats are gaining confidence because the outlook for November is getting better by the day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans are openly admitting that they have given up on bashing Obamacare, and are now trying to distract voters with Benghazi.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Republicans are openly admitting that they have given up on bashing Obamacare, and are now trying to distract voters with Benghazi.", "title": "Republicans Admit Their Failure on Obamacare Hope to Distract Voters With Benghazi", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/05/26/republicans-admit-failure-obamacare-hope-distract-voters-benghazi.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mcconnell-boehner-worried.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-05-26T15:28:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Benghazi,benghazi fake scandal,irs scandal,Obamacare,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-05-26T15:28:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-26T15:28:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Benghazi, benghazi fake scandal, irs scandal, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e92\"", "article_summary": "Republicans are openly admitting that they have given up on bashing Obamacare, and are now trying to distract voters with Benghazi.\nRepublicans are admitting defeat on Obamacare, and watching their Benghazi and IRS conspiracies blow up in their faces.\nThe basis for the Republican Benghazi and the IRS allegations is their belief in a White House cover-up.\nIf Republicans don\u2019t think that their refusal to discuss jobs and the economy will hurt them in November, they are more delusional than anyone could have imagined.\nManufactured scandals such as the IRS and Benghazi don\u2019t work."}
