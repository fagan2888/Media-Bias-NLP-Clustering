Until recently, the famously tiny store never failed to give me a lift: The happy candy-cane stripes of the awning; the sugary contents; the widely beloved centenarian, Ethel Weiss, who held court inside, dispensing bits of wisdom along with Chuckles and comic books.\n\nIrving\u2019s meant \u201ctreat.\u201d\n\nBut now, the red-and-white awning is crumpled by the winter winds, and the sight of the dark storefront stabs my heart, a merciless reminder of mortality.\n\nNow, to me, Irving\u2019s means \u201cnothing lasts.\u201d\n\nIrving\u2019s is one of those places you know won\u2019t last forever but you still hope it does.\n\nEthel Weiss died on Dec. 10 at age 101, after running Irving\u2019s for an astonishing 77 years.\n\nFor weeks, the front window was covered with a blizzard of post-it notes, post-mortem tributes from children and former children from the nearby elementary school, all grateful for her kindness and her candy.\n\nIn the careful letters of a new writer, one read simply, \u201cI love your candy shop,\u201d signed Markus. Alexa wrote: \u201cTo Ethel, I loved your toys.\u201d\n\nIn the more controlled writing of older children were more complex messages: \u201cYou brought so much joy to me and my friends. Thank you for your generosity. You are missed. \u2665 Lara.\u201d\n\nAnd then there were the much older writers: \u201cMade elementary school much better for me! 1980-1988!\u201d And \u201cWe will really miss you! Thought you\u2019d make it to 120! Dr. Jack Porter.\u201d\n\nOn our neighborhood Facebook group, we school parents shared our sorrow and talked about ways to memorialize Ethel. A mom posted, \u201cMy father, my daughter, and I all bought our very first purchases with our own money as little kids at Irving\u2019s.\u201d A dad wrote: \u201cIrving\u2019s is one of those places you know won\u2019t last forever but you still hope it does.\u201d Later, he added, \u201cI\u2019m so glad she had a chance to do what she loved until she passed. I would hate to see that shop go away.\u201d\n\nI felt the same, but I also had the grim feeling of a spell broken.\n\nWBUR\u2019s Bruce Gellerman wrote a feature about Irving\u2019s in 2013 \u2014 he even measured the store\u2019s 15-by-40-foot dimensions \u2014 and analyzed my sense of magic lost: \u201cThe magic was the connection between your childhood and your children\u2019s childhood \u2014 the continuity,\u201d he said.\u201dIt was a portal back to your own childhood. It was timeless. It was tangible \u2014 not just a symbol \u2014 it was tangible evidence of your perpetual youth. The feeling that you walked in there and you were special. You knew Ethel was going to be there, and she was. For almost 102 years. How much better does it get?\u201d\n\nAnd, he said, everybody needs a penny candy store.\n\nI found myself telling Bruce about the masses of post-it notes on the Irving\u2019s window, and how the grown-up approach is surely to accept that after a certain point, life is no longer just about us getting treats. The outpouring of love prompted by Ethel\u2019s death shows that what matters is not raking in the good stuff but rather giving it to others, leaving a positive mark on the world.\n\nRight, he said. \u201cThe essence of life is what you leave in others. You don\u2019t die as long as other people remember you.\u201d\n\nOr even if they don\u2019t remember you. I imagine Ethel Weiss sitting in that 15-by-40-foot box for year after year \u2014 what to many of us would have been an oppressive prison \u2014 but turning it into a dispenser of good feelings. Irving\u2019s was her purpose in life, and all her customers knew that she loved being there for them. (Hard to miss, when she wore a little sign saying \u201cI love my customers.\u201d)\n\nNot to get too woo-woo, but her positive energy emanated out into the world. Whether she\u2019s remembered or not, those ripples continue outward, carried by all the people she affected.\n\nShe left a mark; she left the world better. We can all hope to do that.\n\nShe also created an institution, and these days, it\u2019s unclear what will become of it. There\u2019s talk in the neighborhood of finding a way to keep Irving\u2019s running, perhaps as a non-profit managed by a nearby senior center, but the store belongs to Ethel\u2019s daughters and they are selling it together with the apartment building next door.\n\nEthel\u2019s daughter Anita Jamieson emailed me that she doesn\u2019t have an answer yet to the question of what will become of Irving\u2019s: \u201cOf course, a dream would be to sell the property to someone who would continue the store on some level. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if the senior center could organize people to staff it?! The trouble is, dreams and reality often conflict.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI do expect that we will sell the property in the next few months. No answer for you yet. Only dreams.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t help but hope that the dream of resurrecting Irving\u2019s as a beloved neighborhood institution can be fulfilled, even with Ethel gone. As Bruce says, everybody needs a penny candy store.\n\nAnd I think if the store were lit again, its awning straightened, for me it would come to mean, \u201cYes, we all die. But we can do a lot of good before we go \u2014 and some of it may even last a long, long time.\u201d\n\n[Also posted on WBUR\u2019s Cognoscenti blog]\n\nFurther reading: Happy 100 To You, And You \u2014 Centenarians Multiply, At Forefront Of Age Wave\n\nAs Stores Open Early For Black Friday, Irving\u2019s Toy And Card Shop Remains Unchanged", "article_metadata": {"description": "For generations of schoolchildren, Irving's was the magical tiny toy and candy store where they bought after-school treats -- but now the beloved centenarian owner has died and the store's fate is unclear.
