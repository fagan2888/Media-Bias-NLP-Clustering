Harris sent over his MRI and progress notes from years of failed treatments, and a week later he was approved for ADR surgery.\n\n\u201cThe hard part of it was we knew my insurance company was going to refuse payment, because they don\u2019t acknowledge it for being anything but experimental,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to scrape together money out of savings to pay for it, but they did their job and they did it really well. I flew to Dallas [from Santa Fe, NM.] on July 29, had surgery and woke up about an hour later in recovery. All the pain was gone. \u2026 To be honest, I was just hoping to get rid of some of the pain. I\u2019m literally pain-free and completely off pain pills. I wake up every day and I\u2019m amazed at the quality of life. It\u2019s worth every penny.\u201d\n\nHarris, who believes experiencing near crashes and hard landings in helicopters during combat and being broadsided in his squad car on duty with Dallas PD contributed to his pain, said he\u2019s grateful Blumenthal was willing to work with him to get the expensive surgery into an affordable range.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should, as patients, have to choose between our savings and a procedure that we\u2019re paying insurance premiums for that they really ought to pay for and refuse,\u201d Harris said. \u201cEven though other insurance companies are paying, some are balking, thinking this is experimental. I so believe in this product and this group of doctors and nurses \u2026 that I wanted to get the message out.\u201d\n\nAlthough Blumenthal performed the first ADR surgery on U.S. soil in 2000, it was on an experimental basis until it gained FDA approval in 2004. While initially performed in the lower back and lumbar spine, Blumenthal said the cervical, or neck area of the spine, has gained popularity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done over 2,000 of these ADR surgeries with various types of discs, and with the cervical I favor LDR\u2019s Mobi-C Disc for the one and two levels,\u201d said Blumenthal, who serves as spine consultant for the Dallas Mavericks. \u201cIf someone told you that you needed cervical fusion for a disc problem in your neck, you kind of owe it to yourself to see if you\u2019re a candidate for the ADR, because the long-term results are really proving to be superior to the fusion.\u201d\n\nThe Mobi-C Disc, which Harris received, is the only artificial cervical disc that is FDA approved for both one and two level cervical disc replacements. And while more and more insurance companies are including cervical ADR in their coverage, most will only cover one disc.\n\n\u201cGetting an FDA approval for a two-level disc replacement is a huge deal because half the patients we see with herniated discs in the neck are at two levels,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cThis [would] allow us to expand the ADR to the two-level patients as well.\u201d\n\nTwo-level patients, like Harris, have disc problems at two places in the spine or neck. Candidates for ADR typically experience neck pain that radiates into one or both arms and is often associated with weakness or numbness.\n\n\u201cThis disc replacement technology has allowed us to help so many more people than we could have previously, and results like [Harris\u2019] are not surprising anymore,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cWe can do this complicated disc surgery and most [patients] do exquisitely well, like Mr. Harris is doing. It\u2019s very satisfying and humbling.\u201d\n\nAnd Harris couldn\u2019t be more satisfied. \u201cThe thing I didn\u2019t expect is that within a month, I would be living my life as if the condition I had had never occurred,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m looking forward to doing immediately is getting back on the hiking trails [in New Mexico]. I live at the end of the [mountains] and there are amazing hiking and camping opportunities. I\u2019m also hoping to be able to get back into scuba diving. I\u2019m a scuba dive master and I love to be doing that.\u201d\n\nWhile he ponders what he\u2019ll do now that he\u2019s pain-free, Harris cannot thank Blumenthal and his team at the Texas Back Institute enough for giving him his life back.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was the most important person on the planet from the time that I first contacted them until I flew to Dallas,\u201d he said. \u201cThe nurses, anesthesiologists, assistant surgeons \u2026 everything about this team is about making you feel comfortable and cared for and that they\u2019re going to take care of you.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been told that you need a spinal fusion you owe it to yourself to contact somebody like Dr. Blumenthal that is offering another option. It\u2019s a game changer. \u2026 Even if your insurance won\u2019t pay for it, consider spending the money because it\u2019s worth it. I\u2019m sitting here and I\u2019m living proof that it is.\u201d\n\nFor information, visit texasback.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brittany Feagans, bfeagans@starlocalmedia.com In 2000, Plano spine surgeon Dr. Scott Blumenthal made history by performing the first artificial disc", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mobiloud.android.OrthoSpineNews", "author": "OrthoSpineNews", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=990583391", "keywords": "artificial disc,disc,tdr,spine", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A neurosurgeon scheduled a spinal fusion, but a snafu with Harris\u2019 insurance company forced him back to square one.\nIn 2000, Plano spine surgeon Dr. Scott Blumenthal made history by performing the first artificial disc replacement (ADR) surgery in the United States, a procedure previously only available overseas.\n\u201cWe can do this complicated disc surgery and most [patients] do exquisitely well, like Mr. Harris is doing.\nWhile initially performed in the lower back and lumbar spine, Blumenthal said the cervical, or neck area of the spine, has gained popularity.\n\u201cI actively investigated artificial disc replacement, and the benefits of a disc replacement became very obvious over a fusion, so I shifted my focus,\u201d he said."}
