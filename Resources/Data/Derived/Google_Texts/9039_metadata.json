About 94 percent received financial subsidies and about 78 percent signed up with CareFirst BlueCross Blue Shield. Kaiser Permanente enrolled 16 percent. The remaining 6 percent signed up for Evergreen Health Co-op and others.\n\nThe gains drove down the rate of uninsured people in the state to about 7 percent this year from about 13 percent in 2013, according to a recent poll.\n\nThe next open enrollment period is slated to begin Nov. 1, and exchange officials said during their monthly meeting Tuesday that they would launch a pilot program to steer consumers electronically to a pool of 25 brokers who could help them choose a plan.\n\nPeople would access brokers through the state's call center, which at times has been overrun by callers needing help choosing a plan. Exchange officials believe the broker program could better serve consumers with expert advice, while saving the state money on its call center and giving brokers business.\n\nBrokers would get a commission from the insurers. In the first year the state plans to cover a software licensing fee of almost $1,700 for each broker to give them access to the system. If the pilot is successful, the program would expand to more brokers.\n\nmeredith.cohn@baltsun.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "More than 600,000 enroll in health insurance through the state's online marketplace", "date": "2015-08-18", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Baltimore Sun", "author": "Baltimore Sun", "og": {"site_name": "baltimoresun.com", "description": "The Maryland health exchange enrolled more than 600,000 people in public and private insurance for coverage in 2015, exchange officials said Tuesday.", "title": "More than 600,000 enroll in health insurance through the state's online marketplace", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-health-exchange-meeting-20150818-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55d3a926/turbine/bs-hs-health-exchange-meeting-20150818", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.15", "twitter": {"site": "@baltimoresun", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=496681035, app-argument=http://www.baltimoresun.com/deeplinkid/84235594", "fb": {"page_id": 9299179711, "app_id": 310302989040998}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "Maryland health exchange, enrollment, Affordable Care Act", "news_keywords": "Maryland health exchange, enrollment, Affordable Care Act", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "The Maryland health exchange enrolled more than 600,000 people in public and private insurance for coverage in 2015, exchange officials said Tuesday."}, "article_summary": "The Maryland health exchange enrolled more than 600,000 people in public and private insurance for coverage in 2015, exchange officials said Tuesday.\nPeople would access brokers through the state's call center, which at times has been overrun by callers needing help choosing a plan.\nExchange officials said 123,673 bought private plans and 482,553 people signed up for Medicaid, which also enrolls people year-round.\nIn the first year the state plans to cover a software licensing fee of almost $1,700 for each broker to give them access to the system.\nExchange officials believe the broker program could better serve consumers with expert advice, while saving the state money on its call center and giving brokers business."}
