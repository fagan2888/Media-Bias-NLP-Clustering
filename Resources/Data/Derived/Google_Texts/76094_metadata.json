Some 75 percent of the land will remain rural meaning one building or less per 25 acres. The rural qualities of the area are shown here on the Old Jacksonboro Road.\n\nThousands of acres along U.S. Highway 17 near Ravenel could become the site of new neighborhoods, a retail center and an industrial park if Charleston County Council OKs the latest proposal from a developer.\n\n\u201cWhat they are trying to do is a big deal,\u201d said Dan Pennick, county planning director.\n\nThe effort could shape the future of the western part of the county for the next 50 years, he said.\n\nThe project, dubbed Spring Grove, would be governed by a proposed development agreement that 75 percent of its 14,500 acres remain rural, meaning one building per 25 acres, officials said.\n\nKen Seeger, president of WestRock Land and Development, said Spring Grove is envisioned as a place where residents will live, work and play rather than a bedroom community of commuters.\n\n\u201cYou are not creating housing where people have to drive to get everything. The people that live there can stay for the most part in that area,\u201d Seeger said.\n\nHe noted the proximity of a rail line and the newly expanded four-laned U.S. 17 south from Jacksonboro to Interstate 95. Those things make the location logical for a business park, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is seen by Charleston County and their economic development folks as a viable job center and that\u2019s why we included the business park in the plan,\u201d he said.\n\nOpen space\n\nCounty Council Chairman Elliott Summey said Spring Grove is a positive for the county.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s transformed over time. I think it\u2019s gotten better,\u201d he said.\n\nThe project includes a lot of open space, he said.\n\n\u201cI know they are really working hard with the conservation community.\u201d\n\nRavenel Town Councilman Curtis Inabinett said that Spring Grove sounded like a good thing for the area.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a plus. Obviously we do need more manufacturing and business out in lower Charleston County. Hopefully with this development, it may be a way of jump-starting a few things,\u201d Inabinett said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying to the county for a long time we kind of felt that we\u2019ve been neglected in a lot of areas as far as growth in Charleston County,\u201d he said.\n\nMyles Maland, project manager for the Coastal Conservation League, said the group has been in negotiations with WestRock about the project and been encouraged by the conversations. However, Maland said he had just received the latest proposal on Friday and had not had time to study it.\n\nNearly 11,000 acres of Spring Grove will be subject to restrictive covenants limiting density to one dwelling unit per 25 acres. About 740 acres will be a business park and about 40 acres would be a regional retail district, according to the applicant.\n\n\u201cThe remainder of Spring Grove will be developed as interconnected mixed-use communities that provide residential and employment opportunities,\u201d the applicant states.\n\nThe residential portion of the development would be split into \u201csettlements\u201d ranging from 1,400 dwellings to 150 homes. Overall, the project would have 7,500 dwelling units in a \u201ctown,\u201d \u201cvillage\u201d or \u201ccorner.\u201d\n\nSummey said Spring Grove is a good site for a business park.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to see them market it and get something going out there. There\u2019s no reason why a Volvo supplier or a Daimler supplier couldn\u2019t locate out there just as easy as Jedburg. I think it\u2019s a viable site. It\u2019s got rail, it\u2019s got water, it\u2019s got sewer,\u201d he said.\n\nDesignating the land\n\nWhen first proposed, the project was on 31,000 acres, but the footprint has shrunk by about half. The remaining 17,000 acres will remain rural in perpetuity, Seeger said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our goal in the end that at least 75 percent of the East Edisto planning area be permanently rural, which means have a density restriction on it,\u201d Seeger said.\n\nThe developer, MWV-East Edisto Spring Grove LLC, has filed applications with the county seeking comprehensive plan and zoning map amendments as well as a development agreement. The applicant seeks designation of the project as a development of county significance that is compatible with the surrounding rural and agricultural character.\n\nSpring Grove officials will give an overview of the proposed project to the County Council Planning and Public Works Committee on Aug. 20. The county Planning Commission will review and make recommendations on the applications at its meetings on Aug. 24, Sept. 14 and Sept. 28. County Council will hold public hearings on the project Aug. 25 and Sept. 29.\n\nDocuments filed with the county describe the project as having 8,849 acres of highland and 4,659 acres of freshwater wetlands. Much of the development would be clustered near U.S. 17.\n\nA development agreement with the county will spell out WestRock\u2019s obligation to the county in terms of utilities, infrastructure and other issues, Seeger said.\n\nRural preservation\n\nAbout 700 acres of highland adjacent to a CSX rail line has been designated an economic development area in Charleston County. The developer believes companies would have an interest in locating there.\n\nThe developer held more than two dozen public meetings on the project.\n\n\u201cWhat we heard was that people in this area needed (nearby) employment. This area could become sort of the local destination for jobs and goods and services and housing in a variety of price ranges some of which would be affordable to local people,\u201d Seeger said.\n\n\u201cIn the process we would be preserving the surrounding area as rural land so that the character of the area would not be significantly impacted,\u201d he said.\n\nZoning and the development agreement for the project should be finalized with the county by the end of the year, he said.\n\nThe business park will be the first part of Spring Grove. Depending on market conditions it could have its first tenants in about five years, he said.\n\nOverall, WestRock\u2019s East Edisto development covers 72,000 acres across Charleston and Dorchester counties. Dorchester County Council has approved its part of the project, which is underway near the Legend Oaks subdivision. As in Charleston County, 75 percent of the land will remain rural, with deed restrictions into perpetuity.\n\nReach Prentiss Findlay at 937-5711 or Twitter.com/prentissfindlay.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Homes, retail and business park envisioned for Spring Grove near Ravenel, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston County,East Edisto,WestRock", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Thousands of acres along U.S. Highway 17 near Ravenel could become the site of new neighborhoods, a retail center and an industrial park if Charleston County Council OKs the latest proposal from a developer.", "title": "Homes, retail and business park envisioned for Spring Grove near Ravenel", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150801/150809920/homes-retail-and-business-park-envisioned-for-spring-grove-near-ravenel", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC16/150809920/AR/0/AR-150809920.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC16/150809920/AR/0/AR-150809920.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thousands of acres along U.S. Highway 17 near Ravenel could become the site of new neighborhoods, a retail center and an industrial park if Charleston County Council OKs the latest proposal from a developer.", "title": "Homes, retail and business park envisioned for Spring Grove near Ravenel", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC16/150809920/AR/0/AR-150809920.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150809920}}, "keywords": "Homes, retail and business park envisioned for Spring Grove near Ravenel , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston County,East Edisto,WestRock", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-01T13:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-07-31T18:13:00Z", "author": "Prentiss Findlay"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Thousands of acres along U.S. Highway 17 near Ravenel could become the site of new neighborhoods, a retail center and an industrial park if Charleston County Council OKs the latest proposal from a developer."}, "article_summary": "Spring Grove developers plan thousands of residences, a number of retail outlets and a business park on 14,000 acres along U.S. Highway 17 near Ravenel.\n\u201cThe remainder of Spring Grove will be developed as interconnected mixed-use communities that provide residential and employment opportunities,\u201d the applicant states.\nNearly 11,000 acres of Spring Grove will be subject to restrictive covenants limiting density to one dwelling unit per 25 acres.\nThe business park will be the first part of Spring Grove.\nKen Seeger, president of WestRock Land and Development, said Spring Grove is envisioned as a place where residents will live, work and play rather than a bedroom community of commuters."}
