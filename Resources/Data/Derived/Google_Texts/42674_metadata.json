At issue is the act\u2019s provision of federal tax subsidies to make health insurance affordable for the less-well-off. The plaintiffs are four Virginia residents who say they can\u2019t afford coverage but claim they want to be ineligible for subsidies. If that seems like an odd position, well, ordinarily it would be. The stance becomes more understandable, though, when one peeks beneath the legal papers and sees that the plaintiffs are backed by a range of conservative and libertarian interest groups whose real goal is to cripple, if not kill, Obamacare.\n\nWe\u2019ll return to the larger agenda behind the challenge. But first, a quick observation about interest groups that aren\u2019t urging the destruction of Obamacare.\n\nLarge corporate lobbying outfits, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, often file \u201cfriend of the court,\u201d or amicus, briefs in Supreme Court cases affecting business and the economy. This time, they haven\u2019t joined the assault on Obamacare. The reason can be inferred from the amicus briefs of more narrowly focused insurance and health-care interests that have filed to support the White House. With a significant portion of its constituency urging the justices to leave Obamacare in place, the Chamber couldn\u2019t very well join the attack. (In response to my inquiry, the Chamber promised to comment on its non-filing but hadn\u2019t done so as of publication).\n\nAmong those filing amicus briefs defending health reform are HCA, the American Hospital Association, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the National Alliance of State Health Co-ops, the Catholic Health Association of the United States, the American Cancer Society, and the National Association of Community Health Centers. The insurance and medical industries share the administration\u2019s goal of seeing millions more people covered because that translates into millions more customers seeking the services of carriers, hospitals, and doctors.\n\nBeyond additional customers, health-care businesses argue that they also care about consumer welfare. \u201cWe will not mince words,\u201d the American Hospital Association declares in its brief. The plaintiffs\u2019 position, \u201cif accepted, would be a disaster for millions of lower- and middle-income Americans. The ACA\u2019s subsidies have made it possible for more than 9 million men, women, and children to have health coverage\u2014some for the first time in years; some, no doubt, for the first time in their lives. That coverage allows them to go to the doctor when they are sick, and to do so without fear that the resulting bill could leave them in financial distress.\u201d\n\nOn the other side, the challenge to Obamacare is a production of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a well-known anti-regulatory advocacy group. Procedural questions have arisen over whether the four plaintiffs recruited by the CEI are appropriate choices. Leaving those issues to one side, the motives of the challengers can easily be discerned from the briefs backing the plaintiffs. They include the conservative advocacy groups Judicial Watch, American Center for Law and Justice, Mountain States Legal Foundation, Pacific Research Institute, Cato Institute, Washington Legal Foundation, Missouri Liberty Project, and Landmark Legal Foundation.\n\nThe Obamacare opponents focus less on the practical consequences of sweeping aside health reform and more on principles of government. \u201cExecutive lawmaking\u2014which has alas become commonplace\u2014poses a severe threat to the separation-of- powers principles that undergird the Constitution and ultimately the rule of law itself,\u201d argues the libertarian Cato Institute in its amicus brief. \u201cAccordingly, this Court should vacate the IRS rule that provides subsidies in states that did not establish exchanges. This rule violates Congress\u2019s limitation of such subsidies to insurance bought through exchanges \u2018established by the state.'\u201d\n\nThe last two sentences take us to the statutory intricacies of the case. In the first Supreme Court challenge to the ACA three years ago, justices voted 5-4 that Congress possessed constitutional authority to require that people buy health insurance. This time around, the assault concerns the subsidies meant to make that mandated coverage affordable.\n\nThe ACA law has three pillars: banning insurers from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions; mandating that everyone buy insurance to assure that healthy people participate; and subsidizing less-well-off consumers. The current Supreme Court case addresses who can get those critical tax subsidies, without which the mandate would collapse, probably causing the entire program to unravel.\n\nRead literally, the law provides subsidies for policies purchased via an \u201cexchange established by the state.\u201d The problem with that language is that only 16 states and the District of Colombia have set up their own exchanges. Most Republican politicians refused to go along with Obamacare, meaning that residents of 34 states have to seek insurance on exchanges set up by the federal government.\n\nCharged with interpreting Obamacare, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded that Congress couldn\u2019t have intended to gum up the statutory machinery with this state-versus-federal distinction. The IRS established a rule that everyone, regardless of their state residency, was eligible for the subsidies. The justices will rule on the reasonableness of that interpretation. In the normal course of judicial business, courts defer to agency readings of ambiguous statutory verbiage. The challengers insist there\u2019s nothing ambiguous about the words \u201cexchange established by the state.\u201d\n\nBusiness interests, or at least health-related business interests, are siding with the IRS. Now it\u2019s up to the justices.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "The Supreme Court briefs are in, and we can now say that big business backs Obamacare.
