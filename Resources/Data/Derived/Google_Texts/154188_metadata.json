More than one in seven, says Victor Matheson, professor of economics and accounting at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. If everyone\u2019s ticket included only randomly-selected numbers, then there is a 15.2 percent chance that the winning combination won\u2019t appear on the estimated 550 million tickets that will have been sold for the drawing.\n\nRelated: The Other Powerball Numbers You Need to Know\n\nThe actual possibility of no winner is even higher than that, Matheson says, because people who choose their own numbers don\u2019t select random ones. (Powerball allows people to select their own numbers or have a computer pick their numbers, which is considered random.)\n\n\u201cPeople will disproportionately choose numbers 31 and under because they choose birthdays, anniversaries, or ages of their kids,\u201d he says. Or, they pick combinations with lucky numbers, which often are lower numbers.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many lucky numbers that are 47,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know from experience that hundreds of people pick 7-14-21-28-35.\u201d\n\nThat means other, mostly higher numbers won\u2019t be chosen at the same rate as the lower ones. A Powerball winning combo with those less frequently picked numbers would increase the likelihood of having no winners.\n\nTo lower the odds of a no-winner drawing to one in 20 (or 5 percent), 875 million tickets would have to be sold, Matheson calculated. How many tickets would guarantee a winner?\n\n\u201cAn infinite number,\u201d says Matheson. But even that wouldn\u2019t change your odds of winning tonight\u2019s Powerball. That chance remains at 1 in 292,201,338, no matter how many tickets are sold.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Powerball is a game of chance, and despite the more than half-billion tickets out ther", "title": "What\u2019s the Chance There Will Be No Powerball Winner Tonight?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/13/What-s-Chance-There-Will-Be-No-Powerball-Winner-Tonight", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-powerball_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/13/What-s-Chance-There-Will-Be-No-Powerball-Winner-Tonight", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-powerball_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Powerball is a game of chance, and despite the more than half-billion tickets out ther", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPeople will disproportionately choose numbers 31 and under because they choose birthdays, anniversaries, or ages of their kids,\u201d he says.\nA Powerball winning combo with those less frequently picked numbers would increase the likelihood of having no winners.\n(Powerball allows people to select their own numbers or have a computer pick their numbers, which is considered random.)\nRelated: The Other Powerball Numbers You Need to KnowThe actual possibility of no winner is even higher than that, Matheson says, because people who choose their own numbers don\u2019t select random ones.\nOr, they pick combinations with lucky numbers, which often are lower numbers."}
