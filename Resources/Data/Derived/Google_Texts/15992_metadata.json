Rand Paul, R-Ky., took on a mission to help the poor a world away.\n\nPaul, an ophthalmologist, conducted dozens of eye surgeries at no charge over three days in Salama, Guatemala, joining a team of other doctors from the John A. Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah.\n\n\u201cOver 200 people received cataract and other sight-restoring surgeries,\u201d Paul spokeswoman Eleanor May told The Daily Signal.\n\nIn many of the procedures last week, Paul removed cataracts from his patients\u2019 eyes and replaced them with plastic lenses.\n\nNBC News accompanied the Kentucky Republican on the trip, and produced a video report that aired Saturday night and Sunday morning. Paul told correspondent Chris Jansing:\n\nI don\u2019t know the politics of any of the ophthalmologists in there and we don\u2019t care. We just want people to see better.\n\nAlthough Paul traveled to Central America to complete this latest charitable mission (he has brought his expertise to poor areas of America, too, for years), he didn\u2019t try to hide his ambition for a run at the White House.\n\nHis political advertising team accompanied Paul to Guatemala \u2014 source of many of the unaccompanied minors who crossed the Mexico-Texas border in recent months \u2014 and the conservative group Citizens United shot a documentary of the mission.\n\nPaul, in his interviews with NBC News, spoke about hot political topics such as immigration, the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., following the police shooting of a black youth, and the \u201cmilitarization\u201d of police there and elsewhere.\n\nReferring to Department of Homeland Security grants to police agencies to buy military-style equipment to fight terrorism, Paul said:\n\nHomeland security gave $8 million \u2026 to fight terrorism in Fargo, North Dakota, and I say, if the terrorists get to Fargo we might as well give up.\n\nIn remarks about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic prospect for president in 2016, Paul called her a \u201cwar hawk.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
