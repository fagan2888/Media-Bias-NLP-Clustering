Russian economy minister Alexei Ulyukayev said on Friday that the European aerospace company was interested in the privatization of the state-owned Russian Helicopters for which Russia is looking for a strategic partner.

"Airbus Group naturally follows potential changes in the competitive environment, and as such, has informally inquired about the announced sale of a part of Russian Helicopters," the spokesman said.

"Airbus Group has not, however, expressed any intention in making an offer for such stakeâ€Ž," he said.
