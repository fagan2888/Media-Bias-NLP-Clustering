Then it became an insult. With Obamacare, it is an ethic.\n\nOn Cyber Monday, the federal government was the only entity on the planet touting a commercial website with the promise that it would work most of the time, provided people visiting during peak hours were willing to take a number and come back later.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAlthough HealthCare.gov was still plagued by what used to be known as \u201cglitches,\u201d it was working better. In fact, it appears to be well on the way to being fixed\u2014except for the part where people pay for and actually get insurance. That is called the \u201cbackend,\u201d or the payment system without which any other business would go bust. To be charitable, it is still a work in progress.\n\nThe line in the administration\u2019s progress report about the technical team working \u201cwith private sector velocity and effectiveness\u201d said it all. No one would ever brag about working \u201cwith public sector velocity and effectiveness.\u201d Certainly not anyone who works in the private sector.\n\nYet it is the government that is vastly increasing its reach via Obamacare. Explaining away the troubles of his signature initiative, President Barack Obama pledged on Tuesday, \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep on working to fix whatever problems come up in any startup, any launch of a project this big that has an impact on one-sixth of our economy.\u201d\n\nStartups don\u2019t ordinarily affect one-sixth of the economy. Usually, no one hears about them unless they prove successes, and by then they are reliably functional. The president is surely correct that any vast experiment affecting one-sixth of the economy will inevitably have pitfalls\u2014which is why it is foolhardy to undertake one.\n\nObama is confident his law will work because, as he repeatedly says, \u201c The product is good.\u201d The leader of the free world is now a glorified insurance salesman. At times he sounds like a poor man\u2019s Billy Mays\u2014you may be eligible, he enthused on Tuesday, for tax credits \u201cthat can save you hundreds of dollars in premium costs every month.\u201d He said everything but \u201cOrder Now!\u201d\n\nRich Lowry is editor of National Review.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Opinion: The president's health reform has succeeded only in lowering our expectations.", "title": "Obamacare Is Good Enough for Government Work", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/12/obamacare-is-good-enough-for-government-work-100684.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/12/04/131204_lowry_obamathumbsup_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "HealthCare.Gov (186),Obamacare (1129),Opinion (2624),Barack Obama (11771)", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Opinion: The president's health reform has succeeded only in lowering our expectations.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0bd7\"", "article_summary": "Opinion Obamacare Is Good Enough for Government WorkThe phrase \u201cgood enough for government work\u201d used to be a boast.\nThe line in the administration\u2019s progress report about the technical team working \u201cwith private sector velocity and effectiveness\u201d said it all.\nNo one would ever brag about working \u201cwith public sector velocity and effectiveness.\u201d Certainly not anyone who works in the private sector.\nObama is confident his law will work because, as he repeatedly says, \u201c The product is good.\u201d The leader of the free world is now a glorified insurance salesman.\nYet it is the government that is vastly increasing its reach via Obamacare."}
