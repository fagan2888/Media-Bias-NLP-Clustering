Growing revenues, strong market share boost IU Health's finances

Indianapolis-based Indiana University Health's finances have bounced back after briefly heading south in 2013.

A sudden decrease in patient volume at its hospitals in 2013 caused IU Health some financial concern. However, as more people gained health coverage through the Affordable Care Act, the health system began to bounce back by mid-2014, according to the Indianapolis Business Journal.

IU Health's finances have continued to improve, and Fitch Ratings recognized that when it assigned an "AA" rating to the health system's bonds last week. The rating assignment was based on IU Health's leading market position, broad operating platform and strong operating profitability, according to Fitch.

Although inpatient admissions at IU Health's hospitals remained almost flat in the first nine months of 2015, the health system is well positioned for future growth.

"The integrated delivery system, with a health plan, should position IU Health well for healthcare reform and population health managed related initiatives," according to Fitch.
