Accepting the best comedy trophy for \u201cModern Family,\u201d producer Steven Levitan said, \u201cWell, this may be the saddest Emmys of all time, but we could not be happier.\u201d\n\nAnd they really were! With tributes to deceased TV stars studded throughout the ceremony, a host who was practically absentee, and some truly bizarre choices \u2014 including deeply sincere musical numbers about Liberace and the Beatles \u2014 the 2013 Emmys were a master class in how not to produce an awards ceremony.\n\nIt\u2019s a class that we can only hope NBC took. The awards, airing on the peacock network tonight, cannot go anywhere but up \u2014 but here are a few specific things we hope to see tonight.\n\nAn engaged host: It wasn\u2019t really Neil Patrick Harris\u2019 fault, last year, that his involvement in the ceremony was so limited and that he seemed to disappear after a short filmed segment at the top of the show. He\u2019d given so much of himself to hosting the Tonys early in the summer, and was in the process of filming the final season of \u201cHow I Met Your Mother.\u201d But CBS\u2019s comedy bench was not robust (David Letterman wouldn\u2019t deign to do it, and Craig Ferguson\u2019s time on the network, we\u2019ve since learned, was to be limited).\n\nNBC, by contrast, has a few potential hosts on its air, and seems to have chosen wisely with Seth Meyers; the \u201cLate Night\u201d host has his limitations, but does straightforward observational humor well. Where the Emmys have fallen short in recent years, consistently, is in deviating from the obvious fact that an awards show host needs to be funny. Ryan Seacrest hosted or co-hosted two years in a row! And both times it was deadly boring. The same was true of 2011 host, evidently nice person and non-comedian Jane Lynch. The show needs a host who\u2019s willing and, more important, able to let a little air out of the balloon. Which brings us to the next point \u2026\n\nA little less gravity: It is right and good to honor stars who passed away the previous year \u2014 among them, this year, Robin Williams. But the ceremony, last year, sank under the cumulative weight of various tributes; the show ought to, by and large, be a fun celebration of the great work happening on TV right now. That doesn\u2019t just mean keeping the \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d segment to its own appointed section of the show \u2014 it also means much less talk about the history of the medium and slow musical numbers about completely random topics. Emmys viewers already know TV is important, and are watching to see their favorite stars wearing gowns and giving speeches, not a momentum-halting song only tangentially related to TV.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From a tighter \"In Memoriam\" section to a more engaged host, here are a few tips to inject some life into the Emmys", "title": "Lighten up, Emmys: How to fix the worst awards show on TV", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From a tighter \"In Memoriam\" section to a more engaged host, here are a few tips to inject some life into the Emmys", "title": "Lighten up, Emmys: How to fix the worst awards show on TV", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/25/lighten_up_emmys_how_to_fix_the_worst_awards_show_on_tv/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/seth_meyers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From a tighter \"In Memoriam\" section to a more engaged host, here are a few tips to inject some life into the Emmys", "title": "Lighten up, Emmys: How to fix the worst awards show on TV", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/seth_meyers.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Modern Family, NBC, Neil Patrick Harris, robin williams, Seth Meyers, seth meyers emmys, The Emmys, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Editor's Picks, Modern Family, NBC, Neil Patrick Harris, robin williams, Seth Meyers, seth meyers emmys, The Emmys, TV, Entertainment NewsThe Emmys are in dire need of a comeback.\nLast year\u2019s ceremony, on CBS, may well have been the most universally derided awards ceremony in memory, with even the winners criticizing the show from the podium.\nEmmys viewers already know TV is important, and are watching to see their favorite stars wearing gowns and giving speeches, not a momentum-halting song only tangentially related to TV.\nWhere the Emmys have fallen short in recent years, consistently, is in deviating from the obvious fact that an awards show host needs to be funny.\nThe awards, airing on the peacock network tonight, cannot go anywhere but up \u2014 but here are a few specific things we hope to see tonight."}
