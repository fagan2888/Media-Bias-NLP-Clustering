He called the deal a first important step and promised to work closely with lawmakers to achieve a stronger and more lasting agreement with Iran.\n\nBut while the administration touted the deal as a path toward a safer world, a number of Republican pols and pundits were loath to recognize any measure short of a full dismantling of Iran\u2019s nuclear program as a victory.\n\n\n\nAmong the most cynical responses came from Republican Rep. John Cornyn of Texas, who suggested in a tweet Saturday night that the nuclear deal was a ruse meant to distract attention away from the botched rollout of the administration\u2019s health care website.\n\nRep. Peter King, the New York Republican, called the agreement \u201ca victory for Iran and a defeat for the United States and our allies in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe deal, which is set to last six months, stipulates that Iran halt the enrichment of uranium above 5% and neutralizes stockpile of 20% enriched uranium. It also gives the international community unprecedented access to the Islamic Republic\u2019s nuclear sites, so that U.N. inspectors can verify Iran\u2019s compliance with the deal. In return, the U.S. will ease crippling economic sanctions to the tune of $6 to 7 billion, including over $4 billion of the country\u2019s oil revenue which has been tied up in foreign banks.\n\nSen. Saxby Chambliss, the Georgia Republican, expressed regrets about the easing what he said were stern and effective sanctions: \u201cWe\u2019ve got all the leverage in the negotiations, and we\u2019ve let them out of the trap,\u201d he said during ABC\u2019s This Week.\n\nChambliss said that he and his fellow senators were ready to move forward on even tougher sanctions, but recognized that any new measures would have to square with the administration\u2019s deal. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said in a statement Sunday that further sanctions were \u201cmore likely\u201d given the \u201cdisproportionality of this agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am disappointed by the terms of the agreement between Iran and the P5+1 nation because it does not seem proportional,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIran simply freezes its nuclear capabilities while we reduce the sanctions. It was strong sanctions, not the goodness of the hearts of the Iranian leaders, that brought Iran to the table, and any reduction relieves the psychological pressure of future sanctions and gives them hope that they will be able to gain nuclear weapon capability while further sanctions are reduced.\u201d\n\nEven the harshest domestic responses paled in comparison to those by Israeli leaders who see Iran as a major threat to the Jewish state.\n\n\u201cWhat was concluded in Geneva last night is not a historic agreement,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday, \u201cit is a historic mistake\u2026this agreement has made the world a much more dangerous place.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu made plain that Israel is not bound to the deal, and asserted the Jewish nation\u2019s responsibility to defend itself \u201cby itself\u201d if need calls for it.\n\nPresident Obama called Netanyahu Sunday to reaffirm his commitment to a comprehensive solution, and to reiterate his promise of keeping Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Obama told the Netanyahu that he wants to open consultations between Israel and the US immediately to craft a framework for a lasting agreement, which both countries can endorse.\n\nAgainst cool reaction and criticism, Secretary of State John Kerry appeared on a number of Sunday morning talk shows to defend the agreement.\n\n\u201cThis negotiation is not the art of fantasy, or the art of the ideal,\u201d he said. It\u2019s the art of the possible, which is verifiable and clear in its capacity to be able to make Israel and the region safer.\u201d\n\nKerry said he had no illusions about the stopgap measure, stressing that more had to be accomplished, but \u201cyou can\u2019t always start where you want to wind up.\u201d The Secretary of State sees the agreement as the beginning of a long relationship with Iranian leaders; specifically the country\u2019s new, more moderate president Hassan Rouhani\n\nDismantling centrifuges is \u201cthe next step,\u201d Kerry said. For now, the international community has \u201ca mechanism put in place whereby you know exactly what you\u2019re getting and you know exactly what they\u2019re doing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Reaction to the Iranian nuclear accord came swiftly Sunday morning, with some touting the deal as an accomplishment and others nothing more than a stopgap.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/critics-blast-iran-deal-us-defeat", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Reaction to the Iranian nuclear accord came swiftly Sunday morning, with some touting the deal as an accomplishment and others nothing more than a stopgap.", "title": "Critics blast Iran deal as US 'defeat'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/critics-blast-iran-deal-us-defeat", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/rtx15r02.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/critics-blast-iran-deal-us-defeat", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/rtx15r02.jpg?itok=BPcEck6h", "height": 553}, "title": "Critics blast Iran deal as US 'defeat'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Reaction to the Iranian nuclear accord came swiftly Sunday morning, with some touting the deal as an accomplishment and others nothing more than a stopgap."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-24T14:00:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "evanpuschak1", "title": "Critics blast Iran deal as US 'defeat'", "tags": "benjamin-netanyahu,iran,israel,john-kerry,national-security,nuclear-policy,the-last-word", "published": 1, "date": "11/24/2013 14:00:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/critics-blast-iran-deal-us-defeat"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Reaction to the Iranian nuclear accord came swiftly Sunday morning, with some touting the deal as an accomplishment and others nothing more than a stopgap.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "National Security, Benjamin Netanyahu, Iran, Israel, John Kerry, Nuclear Policy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bb8\"", "article_summary": "He called the deal a first important step and promised to work closely with lawmakers to achieve a stronger and more lasting agreement with Iran.\nPresident Obama called Netanyahu Sunday to reaffirm his commitment to a comprehensive solution, and to reiterate his promise of keeping Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nIt also gives the international community unprecedented access to the Islamic Republic\u2019s nuclear sites, so that U.N. inspectors can verify Iran\u2019s compliance with the deal.\n\u201cIran simply freezes its nuclear capabilities while we reduce the sanctions.\nAgainst cool reaction and criticism, Secretary of State John Kerry appeared on a number of Sunday morning talk shows to defend the agreement."}
