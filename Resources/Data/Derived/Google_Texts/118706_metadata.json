Kenny Yuko, would increase the state minimum wage to $10.10.\n\n\u201cThe bill is modeled on the Ohio Constitution which already provides a minimum wage of $8.10 tied to inflation,\u201d Yuko, a Democrat, said in an email to Ohio Watchdog. \u201cThe state minimum wage applies to businesses with gross annual receipts of greater than $297,000 \u2014 a threshold that is also adjusted for inflation annually.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would be open to an increase for all employees, but the bill follows the model of the Ohio Constitution to improve conditions for workers without unduly burdening smaller businesses,\u201d he said.\n\nYuko\u2019s proposal is cosponsored by all nine of his Democrat peers in the 33-member Ohio Senate.\n\nMinimum-wage hikes are strongly supported by union-funded groups including think tank Policy Matters Ohio.\n\n\u201cIncreasing the federal minimum wage would reduce inequality, keep workers out of poverty, reward work, create jobs and help our economy,\u201d Policy Matters asserted in 2013 after President Obama began pushing for a $10.10 federal minimum wage.\n\nIn a phone interview, Macpherson told Ohio Watchdog labor unions and their allies have two reasons for supporting increases to the state minimum wage.\n\n\u201cThey might feel that they\u2019re helping low-wage workers, but another reason they might do that is because it raises the cost of nonunion labor,\u201d Macpherson said. \u201cIt lowers the cost differential and makes the union premium smaller, which makes this advantageous for union firms.\u201d\n\nThere are several flaws in the widespread assumption minimum-wage mandates help the poor and boost the economy by giving low-income workers more money to spend on goods and services, Macpherson said.\n\n\u201cOne of two things has to happen: profits have to go down, and if profits go down then employers have less money to spend,\u201d he said. \u201cSecondly, to the extent that employers pass it on through higher prices, that affects consumers and they have less money to spend on goods and services that way.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that workers are laid off, that would reduce their consumption, as well,\u201d Macpherson said.\n\nWhat, then, should Ohio\u2019s minimum wage be if not $10.10 or the even higher $15 minimum called for by Service Employees International Union?\n\n\u201cZero, because it costs jobs,\u201d Macpherson said. \u201cBecause it\u2019ll lower employment, and it hurts the people with the least skills the most. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are competing schools of thought regarding the minimum wage,\u201d Yuko said in response to Ohio Watchdog questions about Even and Macpherson\u2019s research. \u201cAccording to data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2014, the 13 states that increased their minimum had higher job growth than states that did not.\n\n\u201cThe number of jobs grew an average of 0.85 percent from January through June 2014 for the 13 states that boosted their minimum wage, while the average for the other 37 states was 0.61 percent,\u201d Yuko said.\n\n\u201cThe same CBO study used as a basis for Professor Even\u2019s research found that a $10.10 minimum wage would lift 900,000 people out of poverty and (result in) a $2 billion rise in real income overall. Raising the minimum wage will result in significant savings for businesses through reduced employee turnover and increased productivity. By increasing the pay of low-wage jobs, which more families are relying on than ever, a stronger minimum wage will allow individuals to spend more in our local businesses and help stimulate the economy.\u201d\n\nSenate Bill 25 awaits consideration in the Senate Transportation, Commerce and Labor Committee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A proposal to increase Ohio's minimum wage to $10.10 would cost 21,886 low-skill workers their jobs, according to a study from two economists.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A proposal to increase Ohio's minimum wage to $10.10 would cost 21,886 low-skill workers their jobs, according to a study from two economists.", "title": "Minimum wage hike to $10.10 could cost Ohio 22,000 jobs - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/obama-raise-the-wage.gif", "url": "http://watchdog.org/203677/minimum-wage-ohio/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A proposal to increase Ohio's minimum wage to $10.10 would cost 21,886 low-skill workers their jobs, according to a study from two economists.", "title": "Minimum wage hike to $10.10 could cost Ohio 22,000 jobs - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/obama-raise-the-wage.gif"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "published_time": "2015-03-04T09:09:14+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "minimum wage, Ohio minimum wage, state minimum wage, minimum wage mandates, David Macpherson, Kenny Yuko, Policy Matters Ohio, William Even"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd375f\"", "article_summary": "What, then, should Ohio\u2019s minimum wage be if not $10.10 or the even higher $15 minimum called for by Service Employees International Union?\nBy Jason Hart | Ohio WatchdogA proposal to increase Ohio\u2019s minimum wage to $10.10 would cost 21,886 low-skill workers their jobs, according to a study from two economists.\nRaising the minimum wage will result in significant savings for businesses through reduced employee turnover and increased productivity.\nSenate Bill 25, 128 pages of proposed changes to Ohio employment law introduced in February by state Sen.
