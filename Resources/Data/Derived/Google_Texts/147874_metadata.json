Scott Pelley is the correspondent. Robert G. Anderson and Aaron Weisz, producers.\n\nThis past week, before Friday's tragedy in Paris, Scott Pelley went to Wisconsin, for a far-ranging conversation with the new speaker of the House.\n\nCongress discovered new depths of dysfunction in September when the speaker of the House unexpectedly resigned, his designated successor refused the job and, Paul Ryan, the only leader Republicans could agree on, turned them down. Ryan didn't want the thankless job of leading a fractured majority that can't keep its promises. Besides, he preferred his house in Janesville, Wisconsin, to the people's house in Washington. But tonight, much to his surprise, Ryan is speaker, at 45, the youngest in more than 140 years and on his terms. He's an expert on the budget, Mitt Romney's running mate in 2012. And we met him, in his hometown, on his second week in the job.\n\nREUTERS\n\nScott Pelley: Have you spoken to the president?\n\nPaul Ryan: Yeah, a number of times.\n\nScott Pelley: Since you became speaker?\n\nPaul Ryan: Uh-huh (affirm).\n\nScott Pelley: And the substance of those conversations has been what?\n\nPaul Ryan: Varied on a number of different issues. And much of it discussed about things we can get working together on, things that we have to get done by the end of the year. And just, you know, courtesy issues. We talk about having teenage daughters too.\n\nScott Pelley: But you found a man you can work with?\n\nPaul Ryan: Sure. Yeah, look, this is the job. Absolutely.\n\nScott Pelley: Well, it hasn't been--\n\nPaul Ryan: He's president of the United States, my president too.\n\nScott Pelley: It hasn't, the job hasn't been getting done these last several years--\n\nPaul Ryan: I agree with that. But nevertheless this government does have to work.\n\nScott Pelley: On your first day as speaker, you said you were going to wipe the slate clean.\n\nPaul Ryan: Uh-huh (affirm).\n\nScott Pelley: And then in your very first news conference, you said the president has quote, \"proven himself untrustworthy on immigration.\" That's not wiping the slate clean. That's blowing chalk dust in the president's face.\n\nPaul Ryan: Well, I think wiping the slate clean was about wiping the slate clean in Congress and getting Congress, the House functioning again. But on this particular issue, he tried to go around Congress and write the law unilaterally.\n\nScott Pelley: But when people hear this they think, \"Here we go again, nothing's going to change.\"\n\nPaul Ryan: I think you can walk and chew gum at the same time. I think you can oppose the president on some issue that you fundamentally disagree with, but also work with the other party on issues you do agree with. That's what I've been doing. Look, if we can find common ground, we can on highways, we will on funding the government, hopefully we can on tax policy. Those are three things that will produce certainty in this economy in the next few months. Let's go do that.\n\nScott Pelley: There was a time on Capitol Hill when the other guy had a bad idea. And now on Capitol Hill the other guy's a bad guy.\n\n\"Somewhere in this we got into impugning people's character and motives if we didn't like their ideas. We gotta get back to just debating ideas.\"\n\nPaul Ryan: Yeah, I think that's right.\n\nScott Pelley: How do you heal that animosity? It's your job now.\n\nPaul Ryan: Leadership by the example is the way I look at it. Somewhere in this we got into impugning people's character and motives if we didn't like their ideas. We gotta get back to just debating ideas. And also I think we need to sort of, you know, we have two ears and one mouth. We gotta use those in that proportion.\n\nHis mother, Betty, taught him to listen more, and speak less. We met her, his wife Janna, and cousin Adam in a favorite neighborhood restaurant.\n\nScott Pelley: Janna, how did you first hear that Paul was being asked to be speaker of the House?\n\nJanna Ryan: I am a big thrift store shopper and I was in my car in front of the Salvation Army here in Janesville when the phone rang. And he said \"Well, this is coming our way. And you think I should say no, right?\" And I said, \"Oh yeah, you should say no.\" And that's how it started.\n\nScott Pelley: And it's speaker of the House, I mean, how do you say no?\n\nJanna Ryan: For our family, for the rhythm of our life, for what we saw our path it just seemed like too much. It seemed like the pressure for him to travel, to be in so many places, to be so much to so many people would leave too little of him for his role as father and husband.\n\nScott Pelley: Mr. Speaker, how did you get from no to yes? You said hell no.\n\nPaul Ryan: Yeah, I see myself as more of a policy maker than a political leader. I do politics in order to do policy. I came into it no. Then I realized the situation in our caucus was fairly dire and that I sort of had an obligation and a duty to step up and do it. And then the question was, can I redesign the job so that I can do it well, so I can be happy and successful? And the fact that we live here in Janesville, we don't live in Washington. And our kids are 10, 12 and 13 years old. It's mostly an empty-nester that gets this job who spends his or her weekends flying around America fundraising. I'm not gonna spend my Saturdays and Sundays flying around America fundraising. I'm gonna spend 'em here-- where I need to be. And so once I learned I could redesign the job, then I decided to do it. And now that I'm doing it I feel it's a great honor. I'm actually excited about it.\n\nJanna Ryan: And now it's one of those things that I can't imagine that it wouldn't have happened. I'm not saying that there aren't moments that you think, \"Wow, how did this happen? You know, how am I on 60 Minutes right now talking about Paul being speaker?\" But it was, it just, it felt right.\n\nScott Pelley: Mr. Speaker, I--\n\nPaul Ryan: I go by Paul. So if it's OK with you.\n\nScott Pelley: Would you prefer that? Because people aren't going to call you that.\n\nPaul Ryan: Yeah, well, I prefer it if I--they are--\n\nScott Pelley: What adversity in your life has made you the person you are today?\n\nPaul Ryan: Probably losing my dad when I was 16.\n\nScott Pelley: What happened?\n\nPaul Ryan: He died of a heart attack. My mom was off with my aunt visiting my sister in Denver. I worked the late shift at McDonald's the night before. And I was gonna sleep in, wake up, mow the lawn. And my dad's office called asking where he was. And I went to find him and he was, you know, he had died over-- in his sleep-- of a heart attack.\n\nScott Pelley: What did you learn from it?\n\nPaul Ryan: I learned tragedy. I learned perseverance. And I learned a lot about myself and about my mom and about my family.\n\nScott Pelley: Your father, your grandfather, your great-grandfather all died in their 50s. Does that put a fire under you?\n\nPaul Ryan: It does. So I focus on just being healthy. I don't want this to happen to my kids, to Janna. And it does. It gave me the other sense that life is short, you better make the most of it.\n\nScott Pelley: Janna, this is an extremely rare opportunity for a reporter, you don't do interviews. I wonder why that is. Why not?\n\nJanna Ryan: Because I've always wanted our family to be a refuge from politics, to be seen-- when people to see us as a family, to think of us as Janna and Paul and Charlie, Liza and Sam. Not as here comes the speaker of the House or here comes that guy who has those votes I don't like. Or whatever it would be. I want to be as a family here in Janesville a very included, normal, whatever that means, regular family.\n\nScott Pelley: Mr. Speaker, or Paul, if you insist, you don't have a home in Washington.\n\nPaul Ryan: No, we live here in Janesville.\n\nScott Pelley: Where do you sleep?\n\nPaul Ryan: For about a decade I've been sleeping on a cot in my office. It's very efficient to me.\n\nScott Pelley: You sleep every night in Washington on a cot in your office?\n\nPaul Ryan: Yeah, I work a lot. All I do is work there. I get up very early in the morning, I work out. And then I work 'till about 11:00, 11:30 at night, do the same thing the next day.\n\nScott Pelley: Where do you get cleaned up?\n\nPaul Ryan: In the gym. I work out every morning and I shower in the gym and I go on with my day.\n\nScott Pelley: One of the things that you said during this period of time that you were telling the Republican caucus that you didn't want the job was that you were concerned that the job would open up your children to ridicule.\n\nPaul Ryan: Well, they're coming of age.\n\nScott Pelley: What does that say about politics in our country?\n\nPaul Ryan: Yeah, that's a good point. Politics has become a blood sport that goes beyond just the person whose name is on the ballot. Basically our kids are getting to the age where they start paying attention and they're gonna see things about their dad that, you know, won't be flattering because I'll take controversial positions on policy issues and I just wanted to make sure our kids have a normal upbringing, a normal life like we had here in Janesville.\n\nJanesville, southern Wisconsin, is getting on pretty well even though the GM plant closed after 90 years. 64,000 people mostly German and Irish.\n\nPaul Ryan: We have 67 cousins, is our last count here in Janesville, and we all live within about eight blocks of each other.\n\nHis party's frontrunner for president proposes to deport all illegal immigrants.\n\nScott Pelley: What's your immigration plan?\n\nPaul Ryan: I think it starts with border enforcement. I think it starts with enforcing the rule of law. But you need to have a vibrant, legal immigration system. Legal immigration is America. My name's Ryan.\n\nScott Pelley: But some sort of a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants...\n\nPaul Ryan: I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that. I think you could have a pathway to legal status. That's been what I have proposed in the past is a pay--a way to make amends with the law, effectively go on probation and earn your way to legal status, but not to citizenship.\n\nScott Pelley: I take it you don't advocate rounding up 11 million illegal immigrants and deporting them.\n\nPaul Ryan: I do not.\n\nScott Pelley: That's not going to happen while you're speaker of the House.\n\nPaul Ryan: I can't imagine how it could happen. So no.\n\nScott Pelley: You have proposed having only two tax brackets, 10 percent and 25 percent. That still your position?\n\nPaul Ryan: Yeah, I've always liked that plan. And our tax code really punishes our small businesses, which is where most of our jobs come from. I mean, look, we're sitting here in Wisconsin, overseas, which to us means Lake Superior. You know, the Canadians are taxing their businesses at 15 percent. The top tax-rate on successful small businesses in America, here in Wisconsin, is 44.6 percent. How can you compete like that? How can you have jobs? How can working families get ahead with a tax system like that?\n\nScott Pelley: Give me three things you would do on tax reform. Very specifically.\n\nPaul Ryan: Well, I'd simplify the code dramatically. I would collapse the rates down to two or three. And I would change the way we tax ourselves internationally, so businesses can take their money and bring it back home so American businesses stay American businesses. And we have to drop our rates on our businesses. I think those three things right there are what I would do.\n\nScott Pelley: With this new job what are the stakes of failure?\n\nPaul Ryan: The country stays on the path it is on, deep poverty, flat wages, working families falling behind, a wreck of national security, oh, followed up by a debt crisis.\n\nScott Pelley: And what is the elephant in the room?\n\nPaul Ryan: Well, I think it's our entitlement programs, it's our budget deficits--\n\nScott Pelley: Social Security?\n\nPaul Ryan: It's Social Security, it's Medicare, it's Medicaid. And the good news on these issues is that if we reform them for the next generation now, we can guarantee, guarantee that people in or near retirement don't have any changes in their benefits.\n\nScott Pelley: Most people don't realize that two-thirds of the federal budget is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Pentagon. The U.S. government is an insurance company with an Army.\n\nPaul Ryan: That's right.\n\nScott Pelley: So in terms of Social Security, in your view, we're gonna have to raise the retirement age?\n\nPaul Ryan: We haven't as a caucus decided this issue yet. So as speaker of the House, I help manage and bring to a consensus, I'm not dictator of the House. But I have always believed, and I've been public about this for many years, for younger people, when they age, we should change the retirement age to reflect longevity. Because that just to make the program finances work.\n\nNot dictator of the House, but he did start with an ultimatum to about 40 conservatives called the Freedom Caucus. If he was going to leave his dream job, chairman of Ways and Means, the tax committee, he demanded their support by the end of the week. They agreed. And Ryan promised to open the process to their ideas and amendments. But when it comes to a vote he expects their support.\n\nScott Pelley: Do you work for the Freedom Caucus or do they work for you?\n\nPaul Ryan: We work for the American people. That's a nice, clever question. But you know who I work for? I work for the first district from Wisconsin.\n\nScott Pelley: But those people are generally happy with you. And the Freedom Caucus is not generally happy with you all the time. And I just wonder how you're going to keep them corralled.\n\nPaul Ryan: I think you try to lead people. Lead people to consensus, lead people to laying a positive agenda and a vision out there, and that is what I intend to do. And I think that's not corralling, but that's leading.\n\nScott Pelley: How long do you imagine you might be speaker?\n\nPaul Ryan: I have no idea. Fourteen months for now is what I know. For the rest of this term.\n\nScott Pelley: Do you think of this as a long-term occupation for you?\n\n\"You have to take risks on policy. You can't be a politician, wringing your hands, worried about what the public opinion polls are saying or worried about the negative attacks. If you believe in something, go fight for it.\"\n\nPaul Ryan: I really haven't. I was just planning on serving out my tenure at Ways and Means chair and then going finding out something else to do with my life.\n\nScott Pelley: Leaving the Congress?\n\nPaul Ryan: So yeah. I really don't know how long this is gonna last. This wasn't something I was planning on doing in the first place.\n\nBut to do the job, he told us, you have to be willing to lose the job.\n\nPaul Ryan: You have to take risks on policy. You can't be a politician, wringing your hands, worried about what the public opinion polls are saying or worried about the negative attacks. If you believe in something, go fight for it. If you think you have a good idea and a good reform and you're going to get criticized for it, do it anyway because I think that's what people in this country want to see. And so, yes, you have to be willing to lose these jobs-- meaning you have to be a political leader, willing to lose an election if you want to do what's right. That's the way the founders envisioned this in the whole first place.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Newly-elected Speaker Paul Ryan discusses his plans for the job he almost turned down and says a true political leader is one who takes risks", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/speaker-of-the-house-paul-ryan-60-minutes/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/11/12/b1c2354c-dc80-425a-950c-dbb8cf871624/thumbnail/1200x630/77cf5da536dfc48d3f116497daa2d467/previewryannew466415640x360.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Newly-elected Speaker Paul Ryan discusses his plans for the job he almost turned down and says a true political leader is one who takes risks", "title": "The Speaker of the House"}, "twitter": {"description": "Newly-elected Speaker Paul Ryan discusses his plans for the job he almost turned down and says a true political leader is one who takes risks", "title": "The Speaker of the House", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbs60minutes://news/speaker-of-the-house-paul-ryan-60-minutes/", "iphone": "cbs60minutes://news/speaker-of-the-house-paul-ryan-60-minutes/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/speaker-of-the-house-paul-ryan-60-minutes/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "60 Minutes", "iphone": "60 Minutes", "googleplay": "60 Minutes"}, "id": {"ipad": 997500692, "iphone": 997500692, "googleplay": "com.cbsnews.sixtyminutes"}}, "site": "@CBSNews", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/11/12/b1c2354c-dc80-425a-950c-dbb8cf871624/thumbnail/1200x630/77cf5da536dfc48d3f116497daa2d467/previewryannew466415640x360.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/speaker-of-the-house-paul-ryan-60-minutes/"}, "android": {"url": "sixtyminutes://cbsnews.com/news/speaker-of-the-house-paul-ryan-60-minutes/", "app_name": "60 Minutes", "package": "com.cbsnews.sixtyminutes"}, "ios": {"url": "cbs60minutes://news/speaker-of-the-house-paul-ryan-60-minutes/", "app_name": "60 Minutes", "app_store_id": 997500692}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 853709411376038}, "keywords": "paul ryan, 60 minutes, speaker of the house", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/60minutes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "paul ryan, 60 minutes, speaker of the house"}, "article_summary": "So as speaker of the House, I help manage and bring to a consensus, I'm not dictator of the House.\nScott Pelley: That's not going to happen while you're speaker of the House.\nScott Pelley: Janna, how did you first hear that Paul was being asked to be speaker of the House?\nScott Pelley: And it's speaker of the House, I mean, how do you say no?\nNot as here comes the speaker of the House or here comes that guy who has those votes I don't like."}
