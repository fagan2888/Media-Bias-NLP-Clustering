One court said residents of states that purchase health insurance through the federal marketplace may not receive government subsidies for their premiums. Then later the same day, another court ruled they could.

Antoinette Kraus, director of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network appears on Friday’s Smart Talk to shed light on the situation.
