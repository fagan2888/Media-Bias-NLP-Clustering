A New Town Buffet is back open after it was evacuated due to an SUV that entered the restaurant parking lot and hit a gas line.

According to Marana Police, the 69-year-old driver was going a little too fast and hit the line, causing it to break and spray gas everywhere at 8500 N. Cracker Barrel Road in Marana.

About 25 to 30 people had an early finish to their meals when the restaurant was evacuated as a precaution.

Northwest Fire shut off the gas, so it no longer poses a threat.

The elderly driver of the vehicle was transported to Banner-University Medical Center with minor injuries and is in stable condition, according to Capt Adam Goldberg, of the Northwest Fire District. His wife, who was a passenger in the SUV, was not injured.

The restaurant reopened on Sunday, Oct. 18 at 7 p.m.
