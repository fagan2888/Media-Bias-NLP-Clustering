We were just sitting on the balcony.\"\n\nVacationers enjoying the Panama City Beach sunset say they knew something was wrong.\n\nWilliams said, \"We heard a woman screaming, hollering over and over again. We looked and said, \"Something's wrong, something's happening, it's bad.\"\"\n\nPeople staying at the Continental Condo's across the street from Gulf World say they saw the swimmer lifeless in the water.\n\n\"There was a bunch of people that came out from the ocean running from everywhere and they actually pulled him out onto the sand,\" Williams said.\n\nThree firefighter EMT's on vacation from Nashville, Tennessee heard the screams for help and sprung into action.\n\nNashville firefighter EMT, Roy D. Johnson said, \"Some lady come running down on the beach hollering, \"Save him, Save him!\" So I took off. I had my wife go get the other firefighters\"\n\nThat's when Johnson called for his friends.\n\nJohnson said, \"I told the wife, \"Go get the crew! We gotta get to work!\"\"\n\nOne of the EMT's just so happened to have his medic bag.\n\nCarey Stribling a Nashville Firefighter EMT said, \"We used oral air way and got his airway open and after that he started breathing.\"\n\nJohnson tells me that his medic bag is like a credit card. He doesn't leave home without it.\n\n\"I'm a medic firefighter 24/7. So, I carry my gear with me,\" he said.\n\nWhen I told the men that they are heroes, they quickly corrected me.\n\nStribling said, \"No, we're not heroes. We do it all the time; we do it every day. We're not heroes. We are just here to be on vacation and just happened to be here.\"\n\nThe man in his 30's was taken to the hospital.\n\nOfficials say he suffered a seizure in the water.\n\nHe is recovering at Bay Medical Hospital.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A man drowning in the Gulf Sunday is rescued by three firefighter EMT's on vacation.", "language": "english", "author": "Morgan Kyrklund", "og": {"description": "A man drowning in the Gulf Sunday is rescued by three firefighter EMT's on vacation.", "title": "EMT's on Vacation in PCB Save Drowning Man", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/EMTs-on-Vacation-in-PCB-Save-Drowning-Man-226694501.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/963/B3C/963B3CB32CF842AD9203D51CA256FAEC", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/CBF/ABC/CBFABC98F01B40AA8711DF9463E84FFA.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "A man drowning in the Gulf Sunday is rescued by three firefighter EMT's on vacation.", "title": "EMT's on Vacation in PCB Save Drowning Man", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/EMTs-on-Vacation-in-PCB-Save-Drowning-Man-226694501.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/WATERRESCUE2.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "EMT's on Vacation in PCB Save Drowning Man", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "EMTs on Vacation in PCB"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a06\"", "article_summary": "A man drowning in the Gulf Sunday is rescued by three firefighter EMT's on vacation.\nThree firefighter EMT's on vacation from Nashville, Tennessee heard the screams for help and sprung into action.\nNashville firefighter EMT, Roy D.
