(AP) \u2014 Republican front-runner Donald Trump on Friday joked, \u201cNow I know how the great Billy Graham felt\u201d as he addressed the largest crowd yet of his thriving presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cI would like to have the election tomorrow,\u201d Trump crowed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d\n\nTrump evoked Graham \u2014 the evangelist who packed stadiums around the world \u2014 as he brought his message to the Deep South. The 40,000-seat Ladd-Peebles Stadium was about half-full when he began his speech.\n\nTrump was welcomed by an array of Alabama politicians, including Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, who praised him for the attention he\u2019s drawn to immigration issues. And Trump led off his speech with more criticism of immigrants living in the country illegally, drawing loud cheers when he repeated his promise to build a wall on the US-Mexico border.\n\nHe reiterated his intention to end \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d for children of illegal immigrants.\n\nTrump also attacked the Obama administration\u2019s deal with Iran to restrict that country\u2019s nuclear program, calling it \u201cso sad.\u201d\n\nAnd he again promised to \u201crepeal and replace Obamacare\u201d \u2014 the health care law that\u2019s President Barack Obama\u2019s defining domestic achievement.\n\nThe South will be strategically important because a group of states in the region, including Alabama, hold their primaries on March 1, 2016, right after the early voting states.\n\nBefore Trump arrived, his fans \u2014 some carrying signs, others wearing T-shirts supporting the billionaire businessman \u2014 spoke of his outsider status in a crowded field dominated by former and current elected officials as the song \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d blared from loudspeakers.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is telling the truth and people don\u2019t always like that,\u201d said Donald Kidd, a 73-year-old retired pipe welder from Mobile. \u201cHe is like George Wallace, he told the truth. It is the same thing.\u201d\n\nWallace, a fierce opponent of civil rights, served as governor of Alabama and sought the presidency multiple times.\n\nKidd said Trump is a \u201cbreath of fresh air,\u201d and praised him as a businessman with common sense.\n\nSavannah Zimmerman, a 27-year-old registered nurse from Mobile, agreed. \u201cI think he appeals to us Southerners because he tells it like it is and he has strong opinions. That is the way we are here in the South,\u201d she said.\n\nMary Anne Bousenitz, 59, a retired psychiatrist from Tuscaloosa, said she isn\u2019t offended by the insults Trump has directed at women, like \u201cdog\u201d and \u201cbimbo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not married to the man and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to have to sit across a turkey at the table with him,\u201d she said.\n\nInterest in the candidate forced organizers to move a planned rally from the Mobile Civic Center, which holds about 2,000 people, to Ladd-Peebles Stadium, a 40,000-seat football stadium.\n\nBefore the rally, Trump tweeted: \u201cWe are going to have a wild time in Alabama tonight! Finally, the silent majority is back!\u201d\n\nDuring the height of the Vietnam War, Richard Nixon sought the backing of the \u201csilent majority,\u201d widely considered to be Americans who stood behind the Republican president and weren\u2019t getting the attention that protesters attracted. Trump has derided elected officials and cast his candidacy as an outsider\u2019s bid.\n\nRepublican rival Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign e-mailed thousands of supporters in Alabama on Friday night, denouncing Trump as a Republican presidential candidate. The campaign statement said Trump favors partial-birth abortions, supports restrictions on gun rights and backs laws that infringe on states\u2019 land rights.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s positions are deeply out of step with the Alabama way of life,\u201d the campaign said in the email. \u201cWe know Alabama cherishes life, especially the life of the unborn.\u201d\n\nRight to Rise USA, the super PAC supporting Bush, tweeted photos of a plane, with a banner ad bashing Trump and promoting Bush, flying over the stadium before Trump\u2019s rally.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate promises to repeal Obamacare, calls Iran nuclear agreement 'so sad'", "og": {"site_name": "The Times of Israel", "description": "Republican presidential candidate promises to repeal Obamacare, calls Iran nuclear agreement \u2018so sad\u2019", "title": "In Alabama, Trump draws biggest crowd yet", "url": "http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-alabama-trump-draws-biggest-crowd-yet/", "image": "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2015/08/GOP-2016-Trump_Horo-e1440255404434.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2015/08/GOP-2016-Trump_Horo-e1440255404434.jpg"}, "description": "Republican presidential candidate promises to repeal Obamacare, calls Iran nuclear agreement \u2018so sad\u2019", "site": "@timesofisrael", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "In Alabama, Trump draws biggest crowd yet"}, "fb": {"pages": 151159641657421, "app_id": 123142304440875}, "keywords": "Donald Trump, 2016 US presidential elections, Republican Party, Republican primaries, Republicans, Alabama", "viewport": "width=1024", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, 2016 US presidential elections, Republican Party, Republican primaries, Republicans, Alabama,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a52\"", "article_summary": "Before the rally, Trump tweeted: \u201cWe are going to have a wild time in Alabama tonight!\n\u201cTrump\u2019s positions are deeply out of step with the Alabama way of life,\u201d the campaign said in the email.\nRepublican rival Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign e-mailed thousands of supporters in Alabama on Friday night, denouncing Trump as a Republican presidential candidate.\nTrump was welcomed by an array of Alabama politicians, including Republican Sen.
