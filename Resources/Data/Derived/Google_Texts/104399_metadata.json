Money began to phase out in 2006. A pilot program slated to end in December allows Maryland, 10 other states and Washington, D.C., to use Medicaid funds for psychiatric care only in these treatment centers.\n\nMaryland has added about 300,000 people to its Medicaid rolls since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act, expanding the population covered to about 1.3 million. McMahon said they have a higher prevalence of substance-abuse and behavioral health issues.\n\nState officials held a series of public meetings and said the effort has received a lot of support, including from the Sheppard Pratt Health System, which would be limited in its funding without the federal waiver.\n\n\"The notion that Medicaid adults should not have access to the same community-based settings for treatment of either psychiatric or addiction conditions as adults covered by other payors is discriminatory and outdated,\" said Bonnie Katz, vice president of business development and support operations at Sheppard Pratt.\n\nThe Maryland Hospital Association, under pressure to reduce health care costs, also supports a waiver that would reduce the burden on its emergency departments and medical units.\n\n\"Maryland's hospitals are working to improve the health of communities, and key to this effort is making sure Marylanders have access to the behavioral health services they need in both institutional and community-based settings,\" said Jim Reiter, an association spokesman. \"This waiver can be a critical part of the state's broad-based population health improvement strategy.\"\n\nThere is no timeline for federal officials to act on Maryland's request for a waiver. McMahon said there could be a funding gap and the state would have to decide if it would pay or use other grants to provide care in community facilities, as it has done in the past.\n\nMcMahon couldn't say how many more people would enter treatment through busy emergency rooms \u2014 or how many would forgo treatment \u2014 without an available treatment bed. \"We think we are well positioned to make the case\" to federal officials to pay, she added.\n\nmeredith.cohn@baltsun.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Maryland seeks to expand access to drug, mental health treatment in the community", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Baltimore Sun", "author": "Baltimore Sun", "og": {"site_name": "baltimoresun.com", "description": "Maryland health officials are seeking permission to use federal dollars to pay for Medicaid patients to get substance-abuse and mental-health treatment outside the state's general hospitals.", "title": "Maryland seeks to expand access to drug, mental health treatment in the community", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/health-care/bs-hs-treatment-waiver-20150728-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55b80d3d/turbine/bs-hs-treatment-waiver-20150728", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.15", "twitter": {"site": "@baltimoresun", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hospitals, substance abuse, mental health", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=496681035, app-argument=http://www.baltimoresun.com/deeplinkid/84094196", "fb": {"page_id": 9299179711, "app_id": 310302989040998}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-07-28", "Description": "Maryland health officials are seeking permission to use federal dollars to pay for Medicaid patients to get substance abuse and mental health treatment outside the state's general hospitals.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hospitals, substance abuse, mental health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0838\"", "article_summary": "Maryland health officials are seeking permission to use federal dollars to pay for Medicaid patients to get substance-abuse and mental-health treatment outside the state's general hospitals.\n\"We think we are well positioned to make the case\" to federal officials to pay, she added.\nThe Maryland Hospital Association, under pressure to reduce health care costs, also supports a waiver that would reduce the burden on its emergency departments and medical units.\nThe funding exclusion \"is creating a barrier in our ability to pay for treatment outside of acute-care general hospitals,\" McMahon said Tuesday.\nMcMahon couldn't say how many more people would enter treatment through busy emergency rooms \u2014 or how many would forgo treatment \u2014 without an available treatment bed."}
