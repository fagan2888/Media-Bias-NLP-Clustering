John Fleming, R-La. \u201cWe are not optimistic they will be put in place while Obama is president, but we still need to be doing them to provide a contrast to the American people so they see the right way to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be honest,\u201d he added, \u201cI am optimistic about a post-Obama world. The day he leaves office, the sun will rise, and the clouds will part, and we will see the sunlight once again, and this will be a different world.\u201d\n\nPoetics aside, Freedom Caucus members, in interviews with The Daily Signal, insist they do say yes to things, and they took Obama\u2019s plea to \u201cfix our politics\u201d as more a reflection of his own approach to Congress than anything they\u2019ve done wrong.\n\n\u201cThe thesis of his talk was the idea of new politics, that we should all be full of kindness and unconditional love after he provides body blows and jabs to Republicans all night, and calls us angry, and implies we are uncompassionate,\u201d said Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, we are a \u2018yes\u2019 party. We are \u2018yes\u2019 to two things: the rule of law and the constitution,\u201d Brat continued. \u201cIf you are yes to the rule of law, you are no to illegal immigration. And if you are yes to free markets and fiscal discipline, you are against busting spending caps. It\u2019s about who controls the narrative. We are the party of \u2018yes\u2019 for the two principles that made the U.S. the envy of the world.\u201d\n\nThe ideas they want to pursue in 2016 are familiar. House Speaker Paul Ryan has talked all about enacting a new health care law, reforming the tax code, and reining in entitlement programs, proposals the Freedom Caucus supports.\n\nMost Freedom Caucus members are also on board with other, less mainstream, Ryan priorities.\n\nA vast majority of Freedom Caucus lawmakers want to heed Obama\u2019s request for Congress to vote for an authorization of military force this year, although the language they seek would look very different from what the president has asked for.\n\nAccording to Politico, Ryan is engaged in an aggressive campaign to gauge support in the House to formally authorize a military campaign against the Islamic State, or ISIS.\n\nRyan should consider the Freedom Caucus a \u201cyes,\u201d although the group is not ready yet to take a formal vote as a group that, if 80 percent of members approved, would make their support of an AUMF an official position.\n\n\u201cThe clear majority of the Freedom Caucus believes we need to lead on this issue,\u201d said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz.\n\nIn a slight surprise, some Freedom Caucus members also say they could put aside their distrust of Obama to support his push for criminal justice reform.\n\nA Freedom Caucus board member, Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador, R-Idaho, is a conservative leader on the issue, and the group is especially sympathetic to the views of their ally in the upper chamber, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who is a major proponent of reducing prison sentences of drug offenders.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s just rational, good policy, I would be in favor of it,\u201d Brat said of criminal justice reform.\n\nAnd Brat referred to Ryan\u2019s agenda to combat poverty as \u201csuper.\u201d\n\nMembers know that few, if any, of their efforts this year will result in bills becoming law, but that misses the point, they say.\n\n\u201cWe need to take out our frustration and focus it on making change,\u201d said Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga. \u201cI\u2019ve been part of the conservative movement for a long time. I was pushing Tea Party-type ideas before there was a Tea Party. It\u2019s gotten to the point where we define conservatism by how many times we push a no button. Let\u2019s start bringing more and more good things to the table. Let\u2019s give the conservative base something to vote for.\u201d\n\nThe open-minded, proactive outlook expressed by Ryan contrasts with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s preferred cautious approach to 2016.\n\nMembers from the House and Senate will have a chance to reconcile those dueling methods beginning Thursday, when the GOP begins its annual retreat in Baltimore.\n\nIt\u2019s clear what strategy the Freedom Caucus prefers.\n\n\u201cPaul Ryan is saying, \u2018I want to make the country better,\u2019\u201d Brat said.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell is all political. He doesn\u2019t want to make politicians nervous; he doesn\u2019t want to lose seats or his job. It looks to me like his reference point is off.
