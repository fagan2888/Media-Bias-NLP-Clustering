A multi-agency investigation is underway in Walton County after a Panama City Beach resident's stolen car was found in the Choctawhatchee Bay.

Walton County Sheriffs Deputies say the owner didn't know his 2013 Ford Mustang was missing until authorities knocked on his door Saturday morning.

Officials say the car was found around 5:00 a.m., 14 feet underwater at the Thomas Pilcher Landing near the Clyde Wells bridge.

The mustang was still in drive with the keys in the ignition.

No one was inside.

Walton County Deputies ran the car's registration and found out the car was registered to a man in Panama City Beach.

Then they turned the case over to Bay County Deputies.

The owner of the car reportedly lost his keys to the Mustang a week ago in his apartment, but he didn't officially report it stolen until Saturday.

The Bay County Sheriff's office will be assigning the case to the criminal investigations team on Monday.

So far, no arrests have been made.
