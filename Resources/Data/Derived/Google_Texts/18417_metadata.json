Williams, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, told ULI Trustees and Foundation Governors during the Institute\u2019s Fall Meeting in San Francisco on October 6. While Williams noted that he speaks only for himself and not the Federal Reserve, he said that when members of the Federal Open Market Committee most recently decided to put off a rate increase, \u201cin my mind, it was a close call.\u201d\n\nHe cited several signs of a U.S. economy that continues to grow, despite \u201csignificant headwinds from abroad,\u201d such as the slowing economies in Europe and China, and the anti-inflationary effects of low oil prices. \u201cWe are closing in on what I consider full employment,\u201d he said. He pegs at 5 percent the naturally occurring unemployment rate, which accounts for things such as people moving between jobs and is thought to be a level that does not fuel inflation. \u201cAt 5.1 percent [unemployment], we are essentially at full employment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. economy is entering the seventh year of economic expansion, making it one of the longest expansions in U.S. history, and it is showing good momentum. The economy also experienced more than 3 percent growth in consumer spending last year. \u201cThe consumer is on a good trajectory now and will continue to be going forward,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cI do see some emerging signs of imbalances,\u201d he noted, \u201cspecifically in asset prices and very specifically in real estate prices.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the lessons of 2005, when the housing bubble was building, he said there were no good options for how to deal with the developing bubble at that time. \u201cWe would have had to act well before then, when the problem was still manageable,\u201d Williams said.\n\nWhen he considers today\u2019s rapidly increasing housing prices, which are on a trajectory similar to that in the early 2000s, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at a tipping point yet, and I\u2019m not trying to argue that we are in some danger of a crash. But what I\u2019m looking at is what path we\u2019re on and what are the potential potholes that we want to avoid further down the road.\u201d\n\nLow interest rates are one reason why housing prices are elevated, he said, and he expects prices to ease when rates increase.\n\nWilliams told the trustees, \u201cI think it does make sense to start removing some of the monetary accommodation.\u201d He said he expects the U.S. inflation rate, now 1.7 percent, to get back to 2 percent\u2014the Fed\u2019s target rate\u2014in the next couple of years.\n\nOne of the reasons he outlined in favor of raising interest rates sooner rather than later is that it gives the Fed the option to increase rates gradually. If the Fed were to wait too long, it might have to implement more rapid increases that could roil financial markets and disrupt the economy, he noted.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Urban Land Magazine", "description": "By most measures, the U.S. economy remains strong, and the Federal Reserve is likely to begin increasing interest rates before the end of the year, John C.
