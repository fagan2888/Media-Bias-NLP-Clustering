The administration has asked for an expedited appellate review.\n\nAs reported by Breitbart Texas, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling on November 9th effectively putting the brakes on President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty program.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTexas led the way in suing the President to block his November 2014 executive amnesty order and 26 other states joined in the lawsuit. Texas was joined by the states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit ruled in early November that the lower federal district court did not err in granting a halt to Obama\u2019s executive amnesty program. Federal Judge Andrew Hanen previously issued the order stopping the president\u2019s actions, as reported by Breitbart Texas.\n\nAfter the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling, Texas Governor Abbott said, \u201cThe court\u2019s decision is a vindication for the Rule of Law and the Constitution.\u201d Abbott initially filed the lawsuit in 2014 during his final months as Texas\u2019 Attorney General.\n\nAbbott continued, \u201cThe President\u2019s job is to enforce the immigration laws, not rewrite them. President Obama should abandon his lawless executive amnesty program and start enforcing the law today.\u201d\n\nThe Fifth Circuit opined, \u201cReviewing the district court\u2019s order for abuse of discretion, we affirm the preliminary injunction because the states have standing; they have established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their procedural and substantive APA claims; and they have satisfied the other elements required for an injunction.\u201d\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton released a statement after the ruling stating, \u201cToday, the Fifth Circuit asserted that the separation of powers remains the law of the land, and the president must follow the rule of law, just like everybody else.\u201d He added, \u201cThroughout this process, the Obama Administration has aggressively disregarded the constitutional limits on executive power, and Texas, leading a charge of 26 states, has secured an important victory to put a halt to the president\u2019s lawlessness.\u201d\n\nAs reported by Breitbart News, Obama ordered the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to implement a federal program in November 2014 called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). The program enlarged a 2012 executive program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) which gave approximately 1 million foreign-born children and young adults of illegal immigrants \u201cdeferred action\u201d status. The program was designed to keep the children from being deported. Approximately 4.3 million individuals who are in the country could be affected by the DAPA program.\n\nMoreover, as reported by Breitbart News, the opinion of the Fifth Circuit noted that:\n\nDeferred action, however, is much more than nonenforcement: It would affirmatively confer \u201clawful presence\u201d and associated benefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens. Though revocable, that change in designation would trigger \u2026 eligibility for federal benefits\u2014for example, under \u2026 the Social Security Act\u2014and state benefits\u2014for example, driver\u2019s licenses and unemployment insurance\u2014that would not otherwise be available to illegal aliens.\n\nLana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.
