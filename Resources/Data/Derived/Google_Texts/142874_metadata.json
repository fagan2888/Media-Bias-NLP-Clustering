A Prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded.\u201d \u2014Abraham Lincoln\n\nThe only thing surprising about the rising wave of Republican support for the loosening of cannabis laws is that it\u2019s taken this long. Ever since conservative stalwarts like Milton Friedman and William F. Buckley famously declared prohibition to be antithetical to conservative values, the intellectual cover has been available to young Republicans, but only in the last decade did their support swing sharply upward.\n\nEven as leaders in the national Grand Old Party like Jason Chaffetz make threats against the District of Columbia\u2019s loosening of cannabis laws by saying \u201cmove forward at your own peril,\u201d a recent poll found that 63 percent of young Republicans of the millennial generation support marijuana legalization.\n\nI found a ready example of a pro-legalization Republican at the Drug Policy Alliance conference recently in DC when I met Jason Vaughn of Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition (RAMP), a pro-life gay Texan and the only known paid Republican activist for cannabis legalization. Vaughn\u2019s start in the movement began after David Simpson, the state representative in Texas who wrote the Christian case for drug law reform, introduced a bill for full legalization with no restrictions, the so-called \u201ctomato bill.\u201d Vaughn\u2019s first exposure to the nuts and bolts of legislation fascinated him and he sat down with Simpson to learn more.\n\nVaughn explained that \u201cbecause I worked in various pro-life legislation but had always been supportive of cannabis, I had been quiet because I didn\u2019t want it to ruin my other life. But then David Simpson made a comment that I now use all the time: \u2018Pray that the legislators will have the faith of their convictions instead of the fear of their constituents.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis phrase gave Vaughn the impetus to write, \u201cA Pro-Life Defense of Marijuana Legalization,\u201d an essay that went viral and got him invited to several cannabis panels. He impressed the audiences with his knowledge of the legislative bill and caught the eye of someone with RAMP. They soon hired him to be their membership coordinator.\n\nAt this Republican cannabis legalization organization, Vaughn got to work with their founder, Ann Lee, a powerhouse octogenarian activist and mother of Richard Lee, the founder of Oaksterdam University. Inspired by her wheelchair-bound son, she now tells fellow Lone Star Republicans to \u201cJust say grow.\u201d She makes quite a stir at the drug conferences, an outspoken grandmother helping to lead the conservative wing of the cannabis movement. As she told the Washington Post, \u201cIt disturbs me greatly that Republicans would distort the principles of small government, fiscal responsibility and personal liberty in such a way that they could support the failed principle of marijuana prohibition any longer.\u201d\n\nThis Drug Policy Alliance conference was Jason Vaughn\u2019s first of this kind. His sign read Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition, which prompted remarks from the left-leaning attendees like, \u201cNormally I hate Republicans, but I\u2019m glad you guys are here.\u201d\n\nSuch comments are a reminder that close-minded partisanship exists on both sides of the aisle and that this movement is more diverse than just liberals and medical patients. Money against prohibition flows in from sources as far apart on the political spectrum as George Soros and the Koch brothers. As Vaughn observes, \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how vast it is. If they only pay attention to a certain media that leans a certain way, either right or left, you\u2019ll miss the other side.\u201d\n\nVaughn\u2019s first field of ministry began by working at a drug recovery center. \u201cMarijuana was not the reason for anybody to be there. Alcohol was considered the gateway, but the black market is the real gateway drug. A market principle is that if I\u2019m going to Walmart, it\u2019s their job and duty to try and to get me to buy me other things. That\u2019s a basic principle. A drug dealer will act in the exact same manner.\u201d\n\nOne of the points he\u2019s found that most resonates with fellow conservatives is that the black markets cause our communities to be more unsafe. In addition, there are negative consequences like the rise of spice, the synthetic cannabinoid(s) increasingly seen at harm reduction centers across the country as well as often being used as a hammer by city cops looking to clear streets in a manner similar to the enforcement of the crack laws. As Vaughn repeats often, \u201cStop putting people in jail for a plant.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost people want some form of restriction on who gets access to medical marijuana but we believe in medical freedom and doctor-patient rights.\u201d He believes the easiest bill to pass in his state\u2019s current political climate would be a clear and easy piece of legislation allowing moderate medical access and a decriminalization of possession with $100 fines that steadily increase until a third strike sends the violator to jail.\n\nRAMP wants to go further than that by advocating for full legalization. However, in the fisticuffs of state politics, \u201cwhen you\u2019re talking about bills, what actually matters is what voters actually show up.\u201d Usually that\u2019s only 10 percent of the potential electorate \u2014 so with only 5 percent support, you can probably get a bill through. Most representatives in Texas don\u2019t need to worry about the general election because gerrymandering already decided that part.\n\n\u201cYou only care who votes in your primary and some people are crazy,\u201d Vaughn says. \u201cWe have a candidate being attacked because at 18, he posted on a forum about wanting a smoke buddy. He will still win handily because he\u2019s the second most conservative candidate in Texas, but it shows we still have long way to go.\u201d\n\nIn a state where a joint can land you a 180-day sentence, many conservative politicians agree that the cannabis restrictions represent a misuse of government resources and are patently offensive to civil rights. But even with 55 percent support within the state for some kind of loosening of the laws, most Republican politicians will still only state their agreement behind closed doors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The generation gap looms large, with the old guard GOP against any drug-law changes.
