Saturday night at Intrust Bank Arena, the home standing Wichita Force (4-1) fell to the visiting Texas Revolution (4-1) 74-42. It was the Force’s first loss of the season after a 4-game winning streak to begin the year.

In the first quarter, Wichita used consistent defense and a steady ball control offense to get out to an early lead. With 7:44 remaining in the first quarter, Force Quarterback Stephen Panasuk hit wide receiver Ronald Davis for a 5-yard score to give the Force a 7-6 advantage. Following that, defensive back Kendrick Harper made a phenomenal one-handed interception off Texas Quarterback Robert Kent Jr to hold that lead.

Unfortunately for the Force, the second quarter was a different story. After Panasuk hit wide receiver Brett Soft for a 5-yard touchdown to give the Force a 20-18 lead, the Revolution answered with 14 straight points to head into the locker room with a 32-20 halftime advantage. One of those scores, a 13-yard touchdown completion with 17 seconds left in the half, proved especially deadly as it gave the Revolution momentum heading into the break.

In the second half, the Revolution’s high-powered offense proved too difficult to overcome. Texas started the second half the same way they ended the first half, with two consecutive touchdowns to extend their lead to 47-20 with 7:11 remaining in the third quarter.

The Force, however, had no plans of caving in. Panasuk hit wide receiver Clarence Anderson for two touchdowns in the second half, one to cut the deficit to 47-27, and another with 7:34 remaining in the fourth quarter that almost spurred a Force comeback. But, two final Texas touchdowns put the game out of reach and the Force suffered a feeling they haven’t yet felt this season: defeat.

Your Wichita Force will next be in action Saturday, April 16th as they travel to Omaha to take on the home standing Omaha Beef. They look to score their third road win of the season and improve to 5-1.
