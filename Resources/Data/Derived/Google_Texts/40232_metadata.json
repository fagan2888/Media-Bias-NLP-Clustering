Tonight was the warm-up for Thursday.\"\n\nJuliet Seskind, Shull's co-conspirator and the zombie the helped initiate the \"Thriller\" dance, developed the Ayre Dance class at the North Boulder Recreation Center, and said the mob grew out of her desire to do something fun with her class.\n\n\"It's a fun way for us to do something together and a bunch of strangers showed up for rehearsal today and that was fun too,\" she said.\n\nOne highly visible mob participant was Boulder's Chris Macor, also known as Mu, the master of the universe. Macor stood out in his long, white wig, and homemade wizard's robe.\n\n\"I like to dance,\" the self-described comrade of Merlin said when asked why he took part in the flash mob.\n\nMacor said donning his costume also presented an outlet for expression.\n\n\"It's important for me to come up with this costume because this is a character within myself,\" Macor said. \"I discovered him in my bathtub.\"\n\nThe event, which will be repeated on Halloween night this Thursday, is a mellower tradition than the Halloween mall crawl, which, according to its Facebook page, was also taking place Saturday and again Thursday.\n\nBy 6:30 p.m. Saturday, 230 people had confirmed they planned to take part in the mall crawl on the Facebook page but only a few costumed revelers were on the mall early on in the evening, perhaps because the University of Colorado football team was playing on the Boulder campus.\n\nThis is the fifth year since the mall crawl was resurrected following a two-decade ban that started in 1991. During it's peak in the 1980s, the event was known to draw tens of thousand of people to Boulder, and cost the city tens of thousands in security, traffic control and cleanup costs.\n\nEmma Mackoy and Caleb Pilon, of Littleton, came to Boulder dawning costumes to go bar hopping with friends.\n\nThe couple, dressed as a masquerade ball attendee and \"death himself,\" commented on how quiet the mall seemed.\n\n\"It's usually pretty crazy, but it is still early,\" Pilon said. \"I used to come up here when they used to do the naked pumpkin run. That was a whole different scene.\"\n\nThe mall crawl was a family affair for Jane and Dave Roberts and their 7-month old daughter, Ava. The trio dressed up in matching head-to-toe dairy cow outfits.\n\n\"We're promoting vegetarianism,\" Dave Roberts said with grin.\n\n\"We love costumes and we love Halloween,\" Jane Roberts said, noting the family also took part in 2012 when Ava was still in the womb. \"Last year there was such and energy and buzz in the air. It's just fun.\"\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Joe Rubino at 303-473-1328, rubinoj@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/JoeCarmenRubino.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_24396210/boulder-flash-mob-kick-starts-halloween-pearl-street", "sailthru.author": "By Joe Rubino  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:24396210:view"}, "startDate": "2013-10-26T22:18:20-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "The anticipation was palpable Saturday night as a crowd gathered in front of the Boulder County Courthouse on the Pearl Street Mall just before 8:30.", "title": "Boulder flash mob kick starts Halloween on Pearl Street Mall", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_24396210/boulder-flash-mob-kick-starts-halloween-pearl-street", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1026/20131026_101637_Cow&hatterphoto.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "modificationDate": "2013-10-26T22:24:03-0600", "endDate": "2023-10-26T22:18:20-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Joe Rubino", "pubDate": "2013-10-26T22:25:02-0600", "sailthru.date": "2013-10-26T22:18:20-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder flash mob kick starts Halloween on Pearl Street Mall", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1026/20131026_101637_Cow&hatterphoto_300.jpg", "description": "The anticipation was palpable Saturday night as a crowd gathered in front of the Boulder County Courthouse on the Pearl Street Mall just before 8:30.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_24396210/boulder-flash-mob-kick-starts-halloween-pearl-street", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "The anticipation was palpable Saturday night as a crowd gathered in front of the Boulder County Courthouse on the Pearl Street Mall just before 8:30.", "title": "Boulder flash mob kick starts Halloween on Pearl Street Mall"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1026/20131026_101637_Cow&hatterphoto.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6d7\"", "article_summary": "Revived Boulder Mall Crawl has quiet startThe anticipation was palpable Saturday night as a crowd gathered in front of the Boulder County Courthouse on the Pearl Street Mall just before 8:30.\nThe budding tradition brought some early life to a relatively quiet Pearl Street Mall, despite a Facebook page urging people to dress up and hit the mall as part of the revived Halloween mall crawl tradition.\nThis is the fifth year since the mall crawl was resurrected following a two-decade ban that started in 1991.\n\"We love costumes and we love Halloween,\" Jane Roberts said, noting the family also took part in 2012 when Ava was still in the womb.\nThe mall crawl was a family affair for Jane and Dave Roberts and their 7-month old daughter, Ava."}
