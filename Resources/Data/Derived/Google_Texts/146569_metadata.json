But did you know some residents of Pennsylvania and New York were given versions of the Constitution that differed from the one approved in Philadelphia?\n\nA new study from four researchers picks apart the German- and Dutch-language printed versions of the Constitution that were provided to residents of the two states as the adoption of the founding document was publicly debated.\n\nChristina Mulligan, Michael Douma, Hans Lind and Brian Quinn examined the rare documents, which were originally printed in 1787 and 1788, and later republished in collected volumes.\n\n\u201cThe translations also provide evidence of the original public meaning of the U.S. Constitution, as reflected in the translators\u2019 interpretive choices and in how the translations would have been understood by Dutch and German speakers,\u201d the authors state.\n\nOne week after the Constitutional Convention approved a document on September 17, 1787, the Pennsylvania Assembly ordered 3,000 versions printed in English and 1,500 printed in German, and the documents distributed to the public. At the time, about 37 percent of Pennsylvania\u2019s population was German in origin. The authors stated that Michael Billmeyer was hired to print the German-language version, but the translator wasn\u2019t named.\n\nThe Dutch version was created and printed in 1788 at the request of pro-Federalist groups who wanted residents in the Albany area, who spoke Dutch, to have access to the Constitution during the pitched public debate in New York state. The translator was a minister, Lambertus de Ronde, and the printer, Charles Webster, owned the Albany Gazette and Albany Journal.\n\nThe Dutch-language version may have impressed older leaders in upper New York, but the region was carried by the anti-Federalists, who opposed the Constitution, in the state delegation voting process.\n\nSo how do the two documents differ from the standard English-language Constitution that was circulated among the residents of other states in the late 1780s?\n\nOne issue, the authors identify, is the ability of the unknown German translator and de Ronde to understand the native language equivalents of English words that had a precise legal meaning. Another is that the translators made simple mistakes. And in some cases, the translators used English words in the translations when there wasn\u2019t a native-language alternative.\n\n\u201cDiscovering a slippage of meaning in the translation of the English to the Dutch or German versions is just half the battle; a researcher would need to analyze the original public meaning of the Dutch or German terms of interest as well, requiring specialized knowledge and research,\u201d the authors say.\n\nStill, the differences in translation offer a unique look at how Dutch and German speakers were presented with some concepts, in a way that varied from the English version of the Constitution.\n\nFor example, there are different versions of the Commerce Clause in Article 1, Section 8, of the Constitution. The German version uses a word to define \u201ccommerce\u201d that indicates \u201cthe larger scope of actions and interactions of persons involved in business.\u201d The Dutch version defines commerce as activities among merchants.\n\nThe authors also argue that German translation \u201cappears to allow the government to establish commerce where it might not have previously existed,\u201d which would have made an interesting argument as part of the 2012 Supreme Court decision over the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThey also believe that a strict interpretation of the German and Dutch words used for the Necessary and Proper Clause in Article 1 (which directs Congress to make laws needed for the country\u2019s good) would restrict some powers of Congress in passing \u201csweeping laws.\u201d\n\nIn an appendix that accompanies the research, a quick look shows some interesting word choices from the two translators.\n\nFor instance, amendments to the Constitution are called \u201cimprovements\u201d in the German translation. The Dutch version considers felonies to be \u201ccrimes worthy of death,\u201d while the German translation considers felonies to be serious crimes.\n\nThe term \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d in the Impeachment Clause have different meanings in the Dutch and German translations. The word \u201cmisdemeanors\u201d is translated to misconduct or misdeeds. And the word \u201ctrial\u201d is translated to \u201cinterrogation\u201d in German.\n\nAs a bonus, the authors include an 1807 translation of the Bill of Rights into German to illustrate other cultural differences.\n\nIn the Second Amendment, the right \u201cto keep and bear arms\u201d is translated as the right \u201cto carry arms.\u201d And in the Fifth Amendment, the words \u201ccriminal case\u201d are translated to the words \u201cpainful case,\u201d a stricter definition based in Latin.\n\nScott Bomboy is the editor-in-chief of the National Constitution Center.\n\nRecent Historical Stories on Constitution Daily\n\n10 fascinating birthday facts about President John F.
