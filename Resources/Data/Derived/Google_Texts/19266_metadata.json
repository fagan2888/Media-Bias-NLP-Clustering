Bernie Sanders is trying to demonstrate fresh momentum heading into the upcoming Democratic debate, announcing Thursday the largest labor endorsement of his presidential campaign.\n\nHe\u2019s also touting new fundraising numbers, demonstrating his ability to raise millions of dollars online at a pace comparable to President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nThe Communications Workers of America formally backed Sanders after a vote by their 700,000 telecommunications and technology members showed a \u201cdecisive majority\u201d supporting his primary bid. They vowed to pour resources into his campaign, including funds from their Super PAC \u2014 a type of campaign contribution Sanders has vowed not to accept.\n\n\u201cTheir endorsement is not just a paper endorsement,\u201d said Sanders, at a joint Washington press conference with CWA \u2014 the third union to support his bid. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have thousands of people on the ground knocking doors, making phone calls and helping us.\u201d\n\nSanders has sought to project new energy behind his campaign, as national polls show him trailing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton by double-digits. His team announced Thursday it had received 2 million financial contributions from supporters \u2014 underscoring Sanders\u2019 online fundraising successes. Sanders\u2019 campaign said it has raised more than $3 million since Monday.\n\nThe union endorsement was widely expected. The organization\u2019s former president, Larry Cohen, has been an unpaid labor adviser to Sanders\u2019 campaign and the CWA has been a vocal opponent of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Sanders has assailed as detrimental to middle-class jobs and wages.\n\n\u201cWe will use whatever we need\u201d to drive the campaign, said President Chris Shelton. \u201cWe will use our PAC money. If Bernie doesn\u2019t want to take it, ok, I respect that, but we\u2019ll use it to make sure we\u2019ll do everything we can to get the vote out.\u201d\n\nThe group decided to back Sanders based solely on a vote by its members, rather than a decision by their leader. Unlike many other unions, CWA did not ask Sanders to answer a questionnaire or sit for interviews with their executive board. Their leadership instead helped develop questions for a live interview conducted at the AFL-CIO summer meeting.\n\n\u201cIt would have been an empty endorsement coming from me,\u201d said Shelton. \u201cHe could have gotten 22 votes from our executive board. This way, he will have 700,000 votes.\u201d\n\nShelton would not release the exact percentage of members who backed his campaign in the vote.\n\nWhile many union leaders have declared their support for Clinton, in some cases, rank-and-file members have been more drawn to Sanders.\n\n\u201cWhat I would have hoped is that unions who believe in democracy would have done what the CWA did, which is really create a wide-open process,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cWe would have a lot more national union support than is currently the case.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, tens of thousands of CWA volunteers in 38 states worked on national and state campaigns, including in presidential battleground states like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and Ohio.\n\nClinton has locked up nearly 20 labor endorsements accounting for about 11 million members, including influential unions, such as the National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union. Last month, she announced \u201cHard Hats for Hillary,\u201d a coalition organizing support for Clinton from millions of construction, building, transportation and other labor industry professionals.\n\n\u201cShe shares their commitment to fighting for an economy that works for every single American, not just those at the top,\u201d said Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson.\n\nSanders was also endorsed by Democracy for America, a liberal grassroots organization that grew out of former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 presidential bid.\n\nThe group attempted to draft Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the presidential campaign earlier this year and many of its backers migrated to Sanders\u2019 campaign after Warren opted not to run. DFA said nearly 90 percent of its membership backed Sanders \u2014 its first presidential primary endorsement.\n\nThe organization is chaired by Jim Dean, the ex-governor\u2019s brother. But Howard Dean has endorsed Clinton and has been an active surrogate for her campaign in the early voting states.\n\nDFA, which cites a membership of 1 million, said it would run a \u201c100 percent positive campaign\u201d in support of Sanders and would back any candidate who secures the Democratic nomination.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, picked up the support of the Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Linda Sanchez, of California, in a Spanish-language op-ed.\n\n\u201cLasting change was bound to take more than a single presidency,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt will take a multi-generational effort, led by someone with the skills and the scars that making real progress often demands.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThomas reported from Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: Get the analysis of Mark Shields and David Brooks delivered to your inbox every week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Vermont Sen.
