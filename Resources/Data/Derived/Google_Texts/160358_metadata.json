(Walt Disney World International Program/Creative Commons)\n\nAs workers prepare to negotiate new labor agreements at Walt Disney World, some union members are wondering whether the magic has disappeared from the \u201chappiest place on earth.\u201d\n\nThe resort\u2019s largest labor contract, which covers some 35,400 workers, is due to expire at the end of March. Though formal negotiations toward a new agreement haven\u2019t yet begun, says Ed Chambers, president of Lakeland, Fla.-based United Food & Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 1625, there are already signs of difficulties ahead.\n\nChambers leads a coalition of six different union locals known as the Service Trades Council, which will hammer out new contracts with Disney in the coming months. According to Chambers, the council saw its first clear signs of unrest in August 2013, when resort managers offered to extend the existing contract for another 16 months and raise wages 3.5 percent. Though the council ultimately declined the offer, he says, some union leaders are now unsure whether Disney can be convinced to improve on it.\n\nJeremy Cruz-Haicken, president of hospitality union Unite Here Local 737\u2014also a member of the Service Trades Council\u2014argues that Disney\u2019s offer just didn\u2019t do enough to protect workers. The proposed wage hike was better than unions have gotten from Disney in other recent contracts, he tells Working In These Times, but it\u2019s still less than what workers deserve.\n\nAngela McKenna, a local 737 officer who spent 30 years working for the company, agrees. \"Disney doesn\u2019t pay enough\" for working families to support themselves, she says. \u201cWhere is the magic in my paycheck? Where is the magic for my kids and grandkids?\u201d With some jobs paying starting wages of less than $9 an hour, many members of Local 737 are at the very bottom of Disney\u2019s wide-ranging compensation scale.\n\nFor its part, the company maintains that its proposal was not unprompted. Disney spokesperson Bernadette Davis tells Working In These Times via email, \"As part of our ongoing conversations with the Council, there was a mutual interest in a contract extension, so we shared an offer with them. It's disappointing that union members weren't given the opportunity to vote on the offer.\"\n\nMuch of that \u201cmutual interest,\u201d Chambers explains, came from uncertainty about the impact of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, on future negotiations. Initially, he says, representatives from both management and the union were leaning toward extending the contracts rather than undertaking a major overhaul of Disney\u2019s healthcare coverage system. However, he says, those fears proved to be largely unfounded.\n\n\u201cThe contract is not going to be about Obamacare. The contract is going to be about wages \u2026 it\u2019s always about wages,\u201d Chambers says.\n\nSome union members are restless right now, Chambers suggests, because Disney appears to have rebounded nicely from the downturn in business associated with the Wall Street panic that began in 2008. With the return of strong profitability, some believe Disney can afford to raise the general level of wages throughout the resort, particularly for those at lower end of the pay scale. Chambers isn\u2019t optimistic, though, that Disney will feel the same way.\n\n\u201cThis [sentiment] is perfectly understandable, but I\u2019m not sure how realistic it is. [Disney] already pays better than most of the [other employers], so they will only take so much pushback\u201d from the unions, he says.\n\nBut as Cruz-Haicken points out, even the best employers of central Florida are setting a low bar. After all, he says, a recent analysis of census statistics by the Orlando Sentinel found that central Florida has the lowest median income wage of the country\u2019s 50 largest metro areas. So even though Disney may pay well compared to other local employers, he argues, that\u2019s not adequate considering the regional standard.\n\nMcKenna agrees. What Disney fails to understand, she says, is that \u201cthe economy has changed\u201d in central Florida since Disney World was built 40 years ago. The cost of living\u2014including housing, transportation and education\u2014has risen tremendously, she observes.\n\n\u201cListen, we have whole families [of Disney workers] living in hotels. They\u2019re packed into one room with the parents working full time. You can\u2019t ask people to live that way\u201d while Disney managers enjoy large profits, McKenna says.\n\nPlus, Cruz-Haicken says, there are other issues at stake beyond wages. A good pay increase is crucial in the next contract, he allows, but the unions must also address other concerns, such as extreme housekeeper workloads at Disney-owned hotels.\n\nGiven the disagreement among council members, neither Cruz-Haicken nor Chambers is optimistic that a new contract with Disney will be reached easily. But Cruz-Haicken says he is convinced that the conditions are right this year for a breakthrough on the wage issue. As far as Unite Here is concerned, he says, members are ready to fight for a better contract. And he thinks Disney is certainly profitable enough to afford it.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc955\"", "article_summary": "Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom Losing Its Sparkle For WorkersThe Service Trades Council, an association of six union locals representing over 35,400 Disney employees, is negotiating a new contract with the resort.\n\u201cListen, we have whole families [of Disney workers] living in hotels.\nIt's disappointing that union members weren't given the opportunity to vote on the offer.\"\nGiven the disagreement among council members, neither Cruz-Haicken nor Chambers is optimistic that a new contract with Disney will be reached easily.\nThe contract is going to be about wages \u2026 it\u2019s always about wages,\u201d Chambers says."}
