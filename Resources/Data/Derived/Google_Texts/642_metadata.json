See if you can guess who spoke them.\n\n''From my faith, I derive the values of loving kindness, justice and righteousness, to act with compassion and kindness, acknowledging our common humanity and to consider the welfare of others; to fight for a fair go for everyone to fulfil their human potential and to remove whatever unjust obstacles stand in their way, including diminishing their personal responsibility for their own wellbeing. And to do what is right, to respect the rule of law, the sanctity of human life and the moral integrity of marriage and the family.\n\n''We must recognise an unchanging and absolute standard of what is good and what is evil. Desmond Tutu put it this way: 'we expect Christians \u2026 to be those who stand up for the truth, to stand up for justice, to stand on the side of the poor and the hungry, the homeless and the naked. And when that happens, then Christians will be trustworthy, believable witnesses.' ''\n\nAny idea yet? The speaker is a minister in Tony Abbott's cabinet. Here's more. ''My vision for Australia is for a nation that is strong, prosperous and generous. Strong in our values and our freedoms, strong in our family and community life, strong in our sense of nationhood and in the institutions that protect and preserve our democracy; prosperous in our enterprise and the careful stewardship of our opportunities, our natural environment and our resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n''And, above all, generous in spirit; to share our good fortune with others, both at home and overseas, out of compassion and a desire for justice.''\n\nYes, you're right. Step forward Immigration Minister Scott Morrison, whose loving, kindness and generosity of spirit shine as a guiding star to your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\n\nThe words are from his first speech to Parliament as the new Liberal member for the Sydney seat of Cook in 2008. Are you thinking what I'm thinking, B2?\n\nIcon or Ikon. n. 1) A devotional painting of Christ or another holy figure, typically executed on wood and used ceremonially in the Byzantine and other Eastern Churches. 2) A small picture on a computer screen that represents a program or function.\n\nIf I hear Qantas called an icon just once more I'll scream. The entire cast of Q&A wouldn't shut up about it on Monday night - yammer, yammer, yammer - to the point where I was thinking wistfully of the famous Elvis Presley solution to annoying television: you empty the magazine of a handgun into the screen.\n\nIt's an airline, OK? That's all. And while we're on the subject, here's yet another heartfelt plea for an end to those cloddish aviation puns so beloved of headline writers and TV graphics designers. ''Stormy skies for Qantas. Flying kangaroo in tailspin, etc.'' Don't write crap. Can't be that hard, as dear Julia used to say.\n\nWe learnt this week that Labor's wicked carbon tax is the source of much of Qantas' troubles. Then again perhaps it isn't. On Monday, the airline's hugely well-staffed spin-doctoring division pumped out a statement announcing that its problems were ''not related to the carbon tax''.\n\nAhem. That was not the smartest line to take if you are trying to screw an unsecured loan of $3 billion from a government which believes the tax is the root of all evil, and by Wednesday someone had wised up. Suddenly this impost was ''among the significant challenges we face''.\n\nAny suggestion there was back-door pressure for this switcheroo from the Prime Minister's office is, of course, absurd. The tax is wreaking havoc around the nation, as Tony Abbott warned during the election campaign. Whyalla must now be a ghost town, as he predicted; the sheriff's office barred and cobwebbed, the bat-wing doors of the Golden Nugget Saloon hanging drunkenly from broken hinges, tumbleweed blowing down the deserted Main Street.\n\nAt our place, the tax has blistered the paint on the veranda, caused the hens to stop laying, and dried up the cow. It might even be the reason we mislaid the Foxtel remote on Tuesday.\n\nA lot of nonsense has been written about the supposed loss of 5000 Qantas jobs, too. Many of these roles will not go at all, they'll simply be relocated to Mexico or Bangladesh or wherever 747s get serviced these days. Qantas engineers will be free to reapply for them.\n\nAnd as any economist will confirm, while some jobs disappear, others are created. Abbott's exciting new commitment to cutting down 74,000 hectares of World Heritage-listed forest in Tasmania will give heart to thousands of redundant Qantas employees. They can retrain as lumberjacks.\n\nJudging by my emails, readers are intrigued and amused by last week's item about the nickname Soapy, conferred upon Queensland's finest legal mind, Attorney-General George Brandis, QC.\n\nAs I explained, it's a nod to Soapy Sam Ballard, QC, the magniloquent head of chambers in the Rumpole books. Labor senator John Faulkner bestowed it upon Brandis a few years ago.\n\nLearned readers offer more. The original Soapy Sam was one Samuel Wilberforce, a cleric of the Church of England in the high Victorian era who rose to be dean of Westminster and lord bishop of Oxford. Renowned as a spellbinding orator in his day, any lingering fame hangs on his ferocious opposition to Darwin's theory of evolution. I am indebted to Wikipedia for this. In a public debate at Oxford in 1860, Wilberforce supposedly asked the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley whether it was through his grandfather or his grandmother that he claimed his descent from a monkey.\n\nHuxley is said to have replied he would not be ashamed to have a monkey for his ancestor, but would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used his great gifts to obscure the truth.\n\nBenjamin Disraeli nailed it better. Wilberforce was ''unctuous, oleaginous, saponaceous,'' he said. Now there's a word: saponaceous. Adj. Soapy, slippery, evasive. But how could anyone connect this to George Brandis?\n\nsmhcarlton@gmail.com\n\nTwitter: MikeCarlton01", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Comment", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "A friend of mine, a committed Catholic who cares for refugees in this country, sent me these inspiring words.
