Sioux Falls, SD

The City of Sioux Falls is launching an effort to make the city roads better for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists alike.

Mayor Mike Huether is holding a press conference Monday, July 6 at 2 p.m. at West Russell Street and North Western Avenue to announce plans to participate in a challenge issued by the US Department of Transportation for safer people and safer streets.

Mayor Huether will discuss strategies to designing road projects that are safe and efficient for anyone, on foot or on wheels.

The conference is being held at Russell Street because it serves as an example of a "complete street." If weather is poor, the news conference will be at City Hall.
