Ted Cruz said Thursday, laying out a muscular foreign policy that would target that terrorist army and reassert American leadership on the world stage.\n\nCruz, R-Texas, recalled Ronald Reagan\u2019s decisive role in dismantling Soviet communism during the Cold War, saying that a similar track should be taken in the fight against today\u2019s enemy: Islamic terrorism. Its bloodiest practitioner, he said, is the Islamic State, or ISIS.\n\n\u201cThis is an enemy that can and will be defeated,\u201d Cruz said during an hour-long speech at The Heritage Foundation in which he called President Obama \u201can apologist\u201d for terrorism.\n\n\n\nThe massacre that left 130 dead in Paris last month and the recent attack in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 underscore the need for American \u201cvigilance\u201d against terrorists, the Texas Republican said.\n\nHis foreign policy proposal included securing the nation\u2019s southern border with a wall and preventing refugees who come from \u201cterror-ridden countries,\u201d particularly Syria, from entering the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt only takes one in a sea of millions to destroy our safety and to take unknown numbers of innocent lives,\u201d he said, noting reports confirming one of the Paris attackers Nov. 13 had entered the country using a fake Syrian passport.\n\nCruz advocated ramping up the U.S. bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS maintains a stronghold. But he stopped short of pushing for U.S. combat troops to put boots on the ground.\n\nIn an effort to strike middle ground between the Republican Party\u2019s national security hawks and non-interventionists, Cruz fought against reauthorizing the federal government\u2019s mass data collection program housed at the National Security Agency under the post-9/11 Patriot Act.\n\nHe told his Heritage audience:\n\nThere are some on both the right and the left who want to exploit the current crisis by calling on Americans to surrender our constitutional liberties as the only way to ensure our safety. Hoarding tens of billions of records of ordinary citizens didn\u2019t stop Fort Hood, it didn\u2019t stop Boston, it didn\u2019t stop Garland[, Texas,] and it failed to stop the San Bernardino plot.\n\nCruz was referring to four of the most notorious attacks on American soil by Islamic terrorists.\n\nThe senator instead called for a narrowed phone surveillance program, highlighting his role in co-sponsoring the USA Freedom Act, which ended bulk data collection and instead required law enforcement to obtain evidence that targeted phones and other devices are tied to terrorist activity.\n\nCruz also repeatedly hit the Obama administration for ignoring the threat of Islamic terrorism, charging that Obama has acted as an \u201capologist\u201d who is focused more on advancing politically correct rhetoric than on destroying ISIS.\n\n\u201cThe problem has been festering unattended for the entire Obama administration,\u201d he said:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIt only takes one in a sea of millions to destroy our safety and to take unknown numbers of innocent lives,\u201d the Texan said at The Heritage Foundation.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIt only takes one in a sea of millions to destroy our safety and to take unknown numbers of innocent lives,\u201d the Texan said at The Heritage Foundation.", "title": "Ted Cruz Outlines Fight Against ISIS", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151210_CruzTerrorism_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-10T18:24:04+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1SQNJYw"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIt only takes one in a sea of millions to destroy our safety and to take unknown numbers of innocent lives,\u201d the Texan said at The Heritage Foundation.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151210_CruzTerrorism_Johnson.jpg"}, "title": "Ted Cruz Outlines Fight Against ISIS", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-12-10T16:47:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-10T18:24:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ted Cruz, Islamic State, ISIS, radical Islamic terrorism, Barack Obama, San Bernardino, terrorists"}, "article_summary": "Hoarding tens of billions of records of ordinary citizens didn\u2019t stop Fort Hood, it didn\u2019t stop Boston, it didn\u2019t stop Garland[, Texas,] and it failed to stop the San Bernardino plot.\nCruz, R-Texas, recalled Ronald Reagan\u2019s decisive role in dismantling Soviet communism during the Cold War, saying that a similar track should be taken in the fight against today\u2019s enemy: Islamic terrorism.\nCruz advocated ramping up the U.S. bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS maintains a stronghold.\nCruz also repeatedly hit the Obama administration for ignoring the threat of Islamic terrorism, charging that Obama has acted as an \u201capologist\u201d who is focused more on advancing politically correct rhetoric than on destroying ISIS.\nCruz was referring to four of the most notorious attacks on American soil by Islamic terrorists."}
