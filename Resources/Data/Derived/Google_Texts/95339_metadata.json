Saying you think too many black people vote, or that Democrats give too much free stuff to poor people, really isn\u2019t the way to win elections these days. Just ask Mitt Romney, one of the few national politicians who didn\u2019t grasp the need to conceal his actual views on these questions.\n\nBut, of course, we all want to believe that we\u2019re acting in good faith. And so the obsession with proceduralism runs much deeper than crass political self-interest. Take, for instance, the Tea Party\u2019s obsession with the Constitution, which, according to its idiosyncratic reading, prohibits everything from the direct election of senators to the progressive income tax to federal spending on highways. It\u2019s not that Tea Partiers hate redistribution per se (though they do). It\u2019s that, in their telling, the rules of the game simply forbid it. \u201cI will not vote for a single bill that I can\u2019t justify based on the text and the original understanding of the Constitution,\u201d the Tea Partier Mike Lee announced during his successful Senate campaign. (For that matter, even latter-day defenders of the Confederacy tend to favor procedural arguments\u2014states' rights!\u2014over substantive ones\u2014like, yay slavery!)\n\nWhat does all this have to do with immigration? Well, it turns out to be the one issue on which the right is least capable of maintaining the pretense that its objections are procedural rather than born of some deeper, darker suspicions.\n\nIntellectually, of course, conservatives understand the importance of sticking to procedural objections even here. They can read polls as well as the rest of us. And the polls say that while Americans overwhelmingly favor the substance of Obama\u2019s preferred immigration reforms, they also oppose enacting the reform by way of executive fiat.\n\nNo surprise then that the conservative message machine has gone on at length about the \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d the president is instigating. The right has compared Obama to a monarch (see here and here), a Latin American caudillo, even a conspirator against the Roman Republic. (Ever melodrama much?) The rhetoric gets a little thick. But if you boil it down, the critique is mostly about Obama\u2019s usurpation of power and contempt for democratic norms, not the substance of his policy change. Some Republicans no doubt believe it.\n\nAnd yet, try as they might to stick to the script, there\u2019s something about dark-skinned foreigners that sends the conservative id into overdrive. Most famously, there\u2019s Iowa Congressman Steve King\u2019s observation last year that for every child brought into the country illegally \u201cwho\u2019s a valedictorian, there\u2019s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and they\u2019ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\u201d\n\nWhile King tends to be especially vivid in his lunacy, he\u2019s no outlier. Just yesterday departing Congresswoman Michele Bachmann opined that \u201cthe social cost [of Obama\u2019s order] will be profound on the U.S. taxpayer\u2014millions of unskilled, illiterate, foreign nationals coming into the United States who can\u2019t speak the English language.\u201d (Not to worry, GOP leadership\u2014King and Bachmann are graciously slinking off stage. They\u2019re traveling to the Mexican border today to inspect the problem first-hand.)\n\nThe problem with drawing these crazy relatives down from the attic isn\u2019t just that it exposes the GOP\u2019s soothing proceduralism as a sham when it comes to immigration reform. It\u2019s that it exposes the GOP\u2019s proceduralism as a sham more broadly. It simply defies logic to believe that Mexicans (and maybe Muslims, the other minority group Bachmann et al feel comfortable hounding) are the only group of non-white or non-affluent Americans the GOP\u2019s conservative wing disdains. And the longer the immigration debate goes on, the more damage will be done to that fiction.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "There are several reasons why Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration has put Republicans in a terrible bind.
