Big questions about God aren\u2019t necessarily on their minds. Big questions about ethics are. \u201cI began to notice that students were less interested in debating the question of whether God exists than in discussing what to do and how to live,\u201d Figdor writes in \u201cAtheist Mind, Humanist Heart,\u201d a new book that he co-authored with Lex Bayer.\n\nIn step with many millennial atheists, Figdor and Bayer are looking for principles by which to live. In \u201cAtheist Mind, Humanist Heart,\u201d they rewrite the Ten Commandments. Like the original set, Figdor and Bayer\u2019s commandments are more than moral rules; they\u2019re statements about cosmic order. Commandment IV: \u201cAll truth is proportional to the evidence.\u201d Commandment V: \u201cThere is no God.\u201d\n\nThe book launched at the end of October, and no divine being struck down Figdor and Bayer, a Bay Area entrepreneur and Airbnb executive who\u2019s active in humanist circles. At its core, their book is a manual for ethical self-reflection in a secular age. The pair want readers to come up with their own sets of commandments.\n\nTo encourage that reflection, they\u2019ve offered $10,000 in prizes to people who come up with their own sets of beliefs. Depending on your theological stance, the contest tag line \u2014 \u201cCrowd Sourcing the Ten Commandments for the 21st Century\u201d \u2014 will either give you great hope for our open-source ethical future, or encourage you to build a bunker in your backyard.\n\nOver the phone, John Figdor spoke with Salon about religious law, crowdsourced dogma and the experience of sharing an office with two rabbis.\n\nYou\u2019re essentially rewriting the Ten Commandments, and you\u2019re calling on others to do the same. That takes some chutzpah. Were you nervous?\n\nNot particularly. We\u2019re crowdsourcing alternatives to the Ten Commandments. Many people have done this in the past, and almost every revision of the Ten Commandments that I\u2019ve seen has been better than the first draft. I think almost anyone can do better than the original 10.\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem with the original 10?\n\nWell, for secular people, people who don\u2019t believe in God \u2026 there\u2019s a significant number of the commandments that don\u2019t actually relate to human morality that relate to human relationships with God. And those are kind of missed opportunities, the way that I see it, to add in more moral commandments.\n\nThe original Ten Commandments was written before the invention of modern scientific knowledge and the scientific method. We wrote the original Ten Commandments without understanding psychology, neuroscience \u2014 with a very antiquated view of philosophy, without understanding evolutionary biology. We think that you ought to base your beliefs on the evidence, and as we have access to more information and more evidence, our beliefs ought to change.\n\nYou specifically call them \u201cTen Commandments for the 21st Century.\u201d What is it about this particular historical moment that invites a rewrite? Or what is it about your version of the Ten Commandments that\u2019s specifically adapted to the 21st century?\n\nAgain, we\u2019re trying to point out that the original Ten Commandments were written in, like, very early history. We\u2019re talking Stone Age texts. There\u2019re many points at which we probably should have updated the Ten Commandments. When we understood the germ theory of disease, we probably should have reworked the Ten Commandments. When we figured out the printing press, we probably should have worked them out. When we figured out basic evolutionary biology, all of these moments where we learn something new, we ought to reflect on our previous beliefs and say, \u201cDo these still seem true? Do these still seem valid to us?\u201d\n\nBut doesn\u2019t that already happen within the religious context? Reading your book, I felt like you had set up a straw man, in which religious laws were described as static, rigid dogma that hasn\u2019t changed in thousands of years. But certainly, if we look at, say, Jewish law, there\u2019s a constant process of evolution and legal wrangling, as people apply ancient laws to a new world. How do you account for that dynamism?\n\nI think that you\u2019re seeing the dynamism in the liberal version of those religions. I don\u2019t think you see it in the conservative interpretations of those religions, first of all. And second of all, it\u2019s right to think they changed, but they evolved so slowly. Take, for example, modern evangelicals and their objection to both deep time \u2014 say, that the Earth is older than 6,000 years old \u2014 and to evolutionary biology.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that religions evolve, and I come from the liberal church tradition where I see that completely. My church was pastored by an atheist at one point, or at minimum, a deistic agnostic. I certainly don\u2019t want to give you the view that I have a straw man view of religion. I mean, so frequently in the atheism discussion, religion just gets translated into following beliefs, following commandments directly \u2014 taking orders \u2014 and that\u2019s not actually how many people practice their faith. But it also is how around 40 percent of the American public practice their faith. So it\u2019s not a total distortion. But you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not the full picture.\n\nCould this book be applicable for people who consider themselves believers?\n\nYeah, I think it absolutely is relevant to believers as well. Look, I may not agree with your starting assumption, if one of your starting assumptions is that God exists and that he sets truth and logic into existence. That\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t believe that, but if you still want all of your other beliefs to follow science and philosophy and rational thought and critical thinking, then absolutely you can apply the method to all your other beliefs.\n\nThe people that we\u2019re really targeting this to are people who have given up their belief in God and are wondering what\u2019s next. It\u2019s not our belief that everyone needs a secular Ten Commandments, or that everyone even needs to read a discussion about secular ethics. But it is our belief that over the years, a number of students have come up to me and said, \u201cJohn, I\u2019ve given up my belief in God, I don\u2019t believe in supernaturalism, but I want to figure out what I do believe in, what values are worth believing in.\u201d\n\nI cannot stress enough that this is not our attempt to come up with a list of 10 that atheists just follow and then they\u2019re going to be good people. That\u2019s not at all the point.\n\nWhat methods do you encourage people to use?\n\nWe think that you ought to follow a broadly scientific, critical-thinking methodology in thinking about your beliefs.\n\nDo you agree with Sam Harris\u2019 argument that science can give us a set of absolute moral codes?\n\nHe says that science can give you objective morality, and I disagree.\n\nSo how do you differ from Harris\u2019 approach?\n\nI have huge respect for Sam Harris, and my position is actually extremely similar to Sam Harris\u2019. We just come to two different conclusions. Sam Harris\u2019 position is, broadly, that we can look at something called the neurotypical behavior of human beings, and we can understand that when you have serotonin in a certain volume, or you have dopamine in a certain volume, this means that there\u2019s something positive going into your brain. So he has this standard for valuing things. A neurotypically derived version of utilitarianism.\n\nSam Harris has this view where we\u2019re able to generate an objective answer out of this. [Lex Bayer and I] don\u2019t think that it\u2019s objective, because ultimately it\u2019s based on the beliefs, experiences and preferences of individuals.\n\nThose opinions are based on people\u2019s subjective experiences, and so you can\u2019t call them objective at the end of the day. But it is the closest possible thing we can get to objective ethics, which is that you take everyone\u2019s viewpoint into consideration.\n\nI interviewed Rabbi Jonathan Sacks a couple months ago. He argues that it\u2019s actually pretty easy to figure out the right thing to do. The hard part is getting people to do it. For Sacks, that\u2019s where religion comes in. Do you feel like you\u2019ve addressed that criticism?\n\nWell, if his criticism is that moral problems are not difficult, and we need to just shut up and follow the conventional answers, that seems like a bad answer. When we\u2019re asking questions like, is A.I. consciousness real? Should computers have moral value? Or when we\u2019re talking about the idea of genetic engineering. These are enormously complex problems, and what I would say to the rabbi is that it\u2019s very difficult to have realistic and rational conversations about these problems with Stone Age beliefs operating in the background for about 40 percent of people.\n\nMy view is religion comes in and introduces a bunch of moral problems that wouldn\u2019t exist otherwise. There is a wonderful emergent religious left that\u2019s coming out, that\u2019s having really authentic and serious conversations about religion. But, unfortunately, they aren\u2019t the people having the conversation, and making it so that we can\u2019t really have a discussion about stem-cell research or abortion access or evolution.\n\nI think that Sacks would say that part of the battle is figuring out what\u2019s right, but the more difficult part is building social structures that motivate people to do what\u2019s right.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Let's start with this one: \"There is no God\"", "title": "Humanist chaplain John Figdor: \u201cReligion introduces moral problems that wouldn\u2019t exist otherwise\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Let's start with this one: \"There is no God\"", "title": "Humanist chaplain John Figdor: \u201cReligion introduces moral problems that wouldn\u2019t exist otherwise\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/07/humanist_chaplain_john_figdor_religion_introduces_moral_problems_that_wouldnt_exist_otherwise/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/charlton_heston_moses.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Let's start with this one: \"There is no God\"", "title": "Humanist chaplain John Figdor: \u201cReligion introduces moral problems that wouldn\u2019t exist otherwise\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/charlton_heston_moses.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Schulson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Atheism, Books, Editor's Picks, John Figdor, Religion, Sam Harris, Stanford", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Atheism, Books, Editor's Picks, John Figdor, Religion, Sam Harris, Stanford, Life NewsWhen students come to John Figdor, the humanist chaplain at Stanford, they\u2019re often comfortable with their atheism.\nOr what is it about your version of the Ten Commandments that\u2019s specifically adapted to the 21st century?\nMy view is religion comes in and introduces a bunch of moral problems that wouldn\u2019t exist otherwise.\nI don\u2019t think you see it in the conservative interpretations of those religions, first of all.\n[Lex Bayer and I] don\u2019t think that it\u2019s objective, because ultimately it\u2019s based on the beliefs, experiences and preferences of individuals."}
