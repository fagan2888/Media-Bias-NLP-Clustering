How Millennials Will Change the Office\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to change the thermostat to something that pleases everybody,\u201d says Rosemary Haefner, CareerBuilder\u2019s chief human resource officer. \u201cBut what you can do is look at what employees need to be productive and accommodate where you can.\u201d\n\nThe study found that office temperatures can impact worker productivity, with 71 percent of employees saying that warm temperatures had a negative impact on their work; 51 percent said the same thing about a cold environment.\n\nWomen were more likely than men to be negatively affected by the temperature. The top actions taken by workers hoping to keep warm in the office during winter were wearing layers (44 percent), drinking hot beverages (36 percent), and wearing a jacket all day (31 percent).\n\nDiscomfort at work can also lead to disputes between employees. One in five workers has argued with a coworker about the thermostat setting, and 18 percent have secretly changed the temperature.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There\u2019s another gender gap that\u2019s dividing the workplace these days, and it revolves a", "title": "Is Your Workplace Too Hot or Too Cold?
