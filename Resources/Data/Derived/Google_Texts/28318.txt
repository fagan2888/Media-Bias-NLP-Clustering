Josh Reddick and Stephen Vogt homered to back Sonny Gray's solid effort, and the Oakland Athletics ended a four-game losing streak with a 5-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Saturday.

Gray (2-1) pitched through trouble, lasting six innings to earn his first victory against the Royals in four starts, leaving the Boston Red Sox as the only AL team he has not yet beaten.

Gray gave up two runs and seven hits, walking one and striking out six. He stranded six runners, four in scoring position.

Reddick, who hit the ball hard in every at bat, erased the Royals' early lead with a three-run shot in the bottom of the first off Chris Young (0-3), who failed to get through five innings for the second straight start.
