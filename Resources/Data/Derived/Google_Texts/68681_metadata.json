And does anyone care?\n\nThat\u2019s sort of what Ray Eisenring, of Spring Hill, was asking for days; only in his case a tree fell and made a sound, but it remained where it fell \u2014 on his neighbor\u2019s roof.\n\nAnd he said he couldn\u2019t find anyone who seemed to care. Eisenring said he called Hernando commissioners, county staffers and others to no avail. That\u2019s when he notified Hernando Today, which tried to get to the root of the problem.\n\nThe result: On Friday afternoon, a representative from the lending institution which owns the unoccupied, foreclosed home on 5124 Juliet Court, hired a contractor to remove the tree.\n\nThe pine tree fell two weeks ago during a bad storm. Eisenring is upset because he wants to sell his house. But who, he asks, would want it if after seeing a 60-foot pine tree atop his neighbor\u2019s house?\n\nEspecially when it\u2019s about 5 feet from his property line.\n\nHe said the fallen tree was a potential safety hazard; Eisenring and his wife have seen children climb it to reach the roof.\n\nBuilding official Jim Friedrichs went to the house Friday afternoon at about the same time the tree was being removed. Except for possibly a broken truss, the home had minimal damage, Friedrichs said.\n\nAfter looking at the tree, Friedrichs said he believed the downed tree was a safety hazard and, if the lender had not removed it, the county likely would have stepped in.\n\n\u201cA good scenario all the way around,\u201d Friedrichs said, adding that taxpayers did not have to pay for any of the procedure.\n\nFriedrichs said such situations don\u2019t always end so amicably.\n\n\u201cWe take it seriously and we understand (Eisenring\u2019s) concern,\u201d Friedrichs said.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 22 Jun 2014 14:03:54 -0400", "Description": "SPRING HILL \u2014 If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it, does it make a sound?
