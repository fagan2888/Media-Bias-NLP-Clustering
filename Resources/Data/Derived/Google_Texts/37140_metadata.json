Prater was too ill to practice with the team Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\n\n\u201cI got some kind of flu or something,\u201d Prater said. \u201cIt started to come on Tuesday night. When I woke up Wednesday morning, I felt like I got run over by a truck.\u201d\n\nIncluding the playoffs, Prater has made 30 of his 32 field-goal attempts (93.8 percent) this season and produced 93 touchbacks on 124 kickoffs (75 percent).\n\nPractice preference. Coach John Fox would prefer to have the Broncos practice outdoors on grass fields this week. But the grass fields at Jets headquarters in Florham Park were covered by snow over the weekend.\n\nSo the Broncos will practice on the Jets\u2019 artificial-turf practice field outdoors, or they will practice at the Jets\u2019 indoor facility.\n\nThe forecast for Super Bowl Sunday in East Rutherford has improved to a high of 37 degrees with a 30 percent chance of rain mixed with snow.\n\n\u201cI heard it\u2019s a phenomenal facility and, really, until we look at the fields, test the fields \u2014 we brought our grounds people,\u201d Fox said. \u201cI\u2019d prefer grass. It saves our players\u2019 legs.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. The Broncos will take their Super Bowl team picture Monday. \u2026 Players and coaches are on their own until Thursday, when they\u2019re joined by their wives and family members.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos kicker Matt Prater finally well enough to practice Monday", "title": "Broncos kicker Matt Prater finally well enough to practice Monday", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/26/broncos-kicker-matt-prater-finally-well-enough-to-practice-monday/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140126__20140127_B6_SP27FBNBROBRIEFSp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140126__20140127_B6_SP27FBNBROBRIEFSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-26T22:58:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T02:43:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe4f97\"", "article_summary": "So the Broncos will practice on the Jets\u2019 artificial-turf practice field outdoors, or they will practice at the Jets\u2019 indoor facility.\nCoach John Fox would prefer to have the Broncos practice outdoors on grass fields this week.\n\u201cHopefully, in another day or two, I\u2019ll be back to normal,\u201d Prater said Sunday in the lobby of the Hyatt, the Broncos\u2019 hotel for Super Bowl week.\nThe Broncos will take their Super Bowl team picture Monday.\nBut the grass fields at Jets headquarters in Florham Park were covered by snow over the weekend."}
