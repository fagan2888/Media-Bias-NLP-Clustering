Rick Scott's office.\n\nScott released the list of 31 hospitals that either did not comply or did not submit information by the August 1 deadline.\n\nThe deadline was imposed by Elizabeth Dudek, secretary for the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. In a July 17 letter, Dudek expressed what she said were \"grave concerns that hospital contractual arrangements may have ballooned to unreasonable proportions and higher than what is allowed by state law.\"\n\n[Also: CMS proposes changes to Medicaid managed care, targets rate setting]\n\nDudek requested hospitals receiving payments and health plans reimbursing hospital providers to certify none of the contractual arrangements are above 120 percent of the Medicaid fee schedule, the allowable limit.\n\nHospital profits, with the exception of those of government-owned hospitals, have risen over the past 10 years, Dudek wrote.\n\n\"It is clear that the Florida Legislature did not intend for the creation of MMA \u2026 to be a windfall for hospitals,\" she said.\n\nMost Medicaid beneficiaries are required to enroll in managed-care plans, as lawmakers and Scott have sought to better control the costs of the program, according to published sources. However, increases in prescription drug prices have caused private health plans in Florida serving Medicaid beneficiaries to seek a 12 percent rate increase.\n\nThe following hospitals are on the list to be audited by the Office of Medicaid Program Integrity: Cleveland Clinic Hospital; Baptist Hospital Physicians Regional Medical Center \u2013 Collier Boulevard; Physicians Regional Medical Center \u2013 Pine Ridge; Flagler Hospital; Venice Regional Bayfront Health; Bay Medical Center; Sacred Heart Health System; Bayfront Health Punta Gorda; Calhoun-Liberty Hospital; Campbellton-Graceville Hospital; Doctor's Memorial Hospital; Healthmark Regional Medical Center; Kindred Hospital in Melbourne, Ocala, The Palm Beaches, Bay Area \u2013 St. Petersburg, Bay Area \u2013 Tampa, Central Tampa, North Florida, South Florida, Coral Gables, South Florida \u2013 Ft.
