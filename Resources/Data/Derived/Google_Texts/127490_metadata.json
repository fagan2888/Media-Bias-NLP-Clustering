He got the internal memo.\n\nLis, in his so-called \"off event,\" finished in 1 minute, 42.13 seconds to earn a spot at the top of the podium and was nearly a second better than D'Evelyn senior Jake Sbarbaro.\n\n\"It was a hard choice between the 200 free and the 200 IM and ultimately I chose the free because I was just more excited about it,\" Lis said. \"It is an event I don't swim as often and I was just excited to go out and see what I could do.\"\n\nOne day after getting touched at the wall by Thompson Valley freshman Liam Gately in the prelims, Lis used that moment as motivation Saturday at the Edora Pool Ice Center. He went out quick and 150 meters in had opened up a full body length on the field.\n\n\"I wanted to go a little faster and there was great competition, and I'll admit I was a little scared of the freshman (Gately) in Lane 5,\" said Lis, who finished fourth in the 100 butterfly final. \"It feels awesome. It's a nice reward and all that hard work, that I've put in on all those days, paid off.\"\n\nMoments after he cleared the awards stand, Lis watched his childhood friend Sam Willett try and keep the 200 IM title at Silver Creek.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Raptors sophomore fell behind D'Evelyn's Daniel Graber early and was unable to reel him in during the breaststroke portion of the race and ended up finishing third in 1:55.35.\n\nIt was a disappointing Friday for Willett in his other race, the 100 breaststroke, but he came back strong on Saturday. Swimming in the consolation heat, Willett's winning time of 59.48 would have placed him third overall.\n\n\"I kind of didn't follow my own advice yesterday, I said you can't hold anything back at prelims in state, and something didn't click yesterday and it just didn't happen, it didn't work,\" Willett said. \"Luckily I was able to come back today and swim that time (59.48) and I'm happy with it even though I'm not on the podium.\n\n\"It was a great race and I learned a lot from it.\"\n\nWillett and Lis teamed with Noah Jepson and Morgan DuBois on both the 200 medley and 400 free relay teams that swam in the final, finishing sixth and fourth respectively.\n\n\"I think that we had a great state meet, we had a huge team coming into it and we were really close as a team,\" said Lis of his team's seventh place finish. \"Broomfield's Alex Prins is one of the most inspirational and loving kids you will ever meet and him bringing our teams together brought so much to our team and set everyone up for a great meet.\"\n\nLongmont diver Nick Vaughan knew it was going to take something special to win the 1M diving event, what with two nationally ranked divers \u2014 Mullen's David Hoffer and Pueblo East's Vitalii Shestakov \u2014 in the field.\n\nThe Trojans junior vastly improved on last year's ninth place finish, vaulting to third with a score of 395.75 points.\n\n\"I'm totally happy with that,\" Vaughan said. \"I was pretty much settling for third. All in all, they were solid dives and I'm glad I didn't fail.\"\n\nAll Broomfield coach Emily Austin wanted her team to do was to have a short memory.\n\n\"They turned things around from yesterday and they did what they could today,\" said the veteran Eagles coach. \"There were time improvements, a couple of place improvements and ultimately, I am proud of these guys.\n\nLongmont's Nick Vaughan finished third in the Class 4A state diving finals. ( Steve Stoner )\n\nThe one chance Broomfield had to continue its three-year run of winning at least one gold medal at the state meet was senior Blake Logan in the 100 backstroke.\n\nHe would have to overcome the defending champion and state record holder, Thompson Valley's John Thorne, in the process. In the end, Thorne's underwater prowess was too much for Logan and the rest of the field to overcome, and he settled for second in 52.49 seconds. Thorne beat his own state mark, winning in 4A record time 48.24.\n\n\"That's the fastest time I've ever gone, even in club, so I'm going to take it,\" said Logan, who began his meet with a sixth-place finish in the 500 free. \"It's been a quite successful meet.\n\n\"The 500 hurt more than I was expecting it to be, but once I saw that I was going to get sixth, and with the pain, I didn't want to push it so I could save it up for the (backstroke).\"\n\nThe only other Broomfield individual swimmer in the championship finals on Saturday was freshman Austin Crump in the 100 freestyle.\n\nDespite his eighth place finish, Crump was thrilled with his 47.98 time, a mark he had been waiting a long time to break.\n\n\"I'm elated, I wanted to go 47, so it was a great race,\" Crump said. \"I'm happy with my freshman year, I'm happy with my whole team and we had a really good run.\"\n\nBroomfield made the finals in all three of the relay events. Seniors Logan, Kris Kerr, Sam Henehan and Andy Hahn finished fifth in the opening 200 medley relay.\n\nHaving to reshuffle the deck after a minor incident forced Kerr out of the rest of the meet, Crump, Colin Peterson, Alex Prins and Hahn went 1:31.44 in the 200 free relay to finish sixth in that event.\n\nFollow Jon on Twitter: twitter.com/JonEYunt\n\nClass 4A State Swimming and Diving Championships\n\nAt EPIC\n\nTeam scores \u2014 Air Academy 280, Thompson Valley 244, D'Evelyn 204, Discovery Canyon 196, Cheyenne Mountain 193, Estes Park 142, Silver Creek 136, Coronado 135, Broomfield 130, Montrose 127, Mullen 85, Valor Christian 72, Greeley Central 61, Wheat Ridge 61, Glenwood Springs 57, Green Mountain 56, Conifer 45, Mountain View 22, Pueblo East 17, Longmont 16, Moffat County 13, Northridge 9, Pueblo South 9, Pueblo West 9, Pueblo County 3, Thomas Jefferson 2.\n\n200 medley relay \u2014 1.
