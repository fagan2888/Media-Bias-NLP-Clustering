The ban would not apply to naturally occurring trans fats, such as those found in meat and dairy products. Adoption of the proposal, which is open to public comment until Jan. 7, 2014, would mean that food producers who want to use partially hydrogenated oils would first have to prove to the FDA the safety of the ingredient.\n\nConsidering that the FDA\u2019s announcement this week declared preemptively \u201cthat there is no safe level of consumption of artificial trans fat,\u201d the burden of proof for future trans fat use would appear to be quite high.\n\nWhat does trans fat research say?\n\nStudies on artificial trans fats have found generally that they raise the amount of bad cholesterol (LDL) and lower the amount of good cholesterol (HDL) in the blood. (More here on HDL and LDL generally.)\n\nBut a recent meta analysis, Effect of Animal and Industrial Trans Fatty Acids on HDL and LDL Cholesterol Levels in Humans\u2014A Quantitative Review, published in the open-access, peer-reviewed journal PLOS ONE in 2010, concludes that those negative effects may also be shared by natural trans fats. The study looked at the results from twenty-nine human studies in which subjects were fed artificial trans fats and six studies in which subjects were fed natural trans fats derived from milk fat. It found the impact of artificial and natural trans fats on HDL and LDL levels to be roughly equivalent.\n\nLike the 2010 PLOS ONE study, a 2005 book by the Institute of Medicine that appears to form much of the basis for the FDA\u2019s action (the agency went so far as to link to it in yesterday\u2019s FDA press release) appears to make no distinction between artificial and natural trans fats.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the IOM appears torn over trans fats. On the one hand, it refers to them as \u201cnot essential\u201d and says they \u201cprovide no known health benefit.\u201d The FDA cites these points, of course. But the IOM also concludes in the same paragraph \u201ctrans fatty acids are unavoidable in ordinary, nonvegan diets.\u201d\n\nHow much trans fats do we eat?\n\nThanks to the fact many food producers have responded to consumer demand and removed trans fats from their foods in recent years, the FDA\u2019s press release noted that \u201ctrans fat intake among American consumers has declined from 4.6 grams per day in 2003 to about 1 gram per day in 2012.\u201d\n\nThe American Heart Association, meanwhile, suggests Americans consume \u201cless than 2 grams of trans fats a day.\u201d So if the FDA and AHA are correct, then current consumption levels\u2014prior to and without any ban\u2014are well within safe levels. Still, that didn\u2019t stop the AHA from endorsing the FDA\u2019s suggested ban.\n\nAnd what about natural trans fats? According to the USDA, a pound of ground beef contains more than 8g of trans fat.\n\nWhat is the FDA doing?\n\nThe FDA has required food labels to list trans fat content since 2006. As I\u2019ve written before, though, where a warning will suffice, a ban is inappropriate. Here, it\u2019s also exceptional.\n\nAttorney Mark Itzkoff told Politico that the FDA\u2019s move against trans fats was \u201cvirtually unprecedented.\u201d\n\nVirtually, indeed.\n\nRecall that the FDA forced Four Loko and other beers containing caffeine from the market in 2010, though the agency\u2019s procedural machinations were slightly different with Four Loko than they are with trans fats.\n\nMore recently, as I wrote about here, the FDA has been rattling its saber in the direction of caffeine, which could face a similar fate if the agency\u2019s move against trans fats is successful.\n\nWhat would be the impact on food?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "We may soon have to say goodbye to many doughnuts, crackers, frozen pizza, coffee creamer and other goodies\u2014whether or not we agree.", "title": "The FDA's Ill-Conceived Proposal to Ban Trans Fats", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2013/11/09/the-fdas-ill-conceived-proposal-to-ban-t", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13839437977217.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Thursday the FDA made the surprise announcement that it would\nmove to \nban artificial trans fats, which are found in foods containing\npartially hydrogenated vegetable oils.
