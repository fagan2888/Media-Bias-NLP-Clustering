The experts were right when they predicted a big 2015 for healthcare mergers and acquisitions. According to Thompson Reuters, the total deal value for the year is already at $395.8 billion. In 2014, the industry booked $392.4 billion in deals.

According to Thompson Reuters, Wednesday's announcement that device maker St. Jude Medical would buy rival Thoratec for $3 billion put the total over the top.

Many of this year's biggest deals are among drug and device makers, though several hospital operators have announced takeovers of rival systems and other medical groups.
