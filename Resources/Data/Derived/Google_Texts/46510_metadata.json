U.S. Government\n\nThe suicide rate for young military veterans has risen dramatically by 44 percent for men and 11 percent for women, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) says. Every day, nearly two-dozen young men and women who\u2019ve served in the military commit suicide, even as the rate for older veterans holds steady.\n\nThe spike in suicides coincides with a 16.1 percent drop between 1999 and 2010 for older veterans receiving care from VA, who somehow resisted a national trend among older American men with a 27.3 percent increase in suicides. For whatever reason, older veterans experienced a lower than average suicide rate while younger veterans committed suicide at the highest rates.\n\nGovernment officials remain unsure what is driving the spike in the suicide rate, but point to a high prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder following military service in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cTheir rates are astronomically high and climbing,\u201d Janet Kemp, the VA\u2019s national mental health director for suicide prevention, told Stars and Stripes. \u201cThat\u2019s concerning us.\u201d\n\nYoung veterans are committing suicide at a rate three times higher than active-duty troops in recent years. Among veterans ages 18-24, the suicide rate jumped from 46 per 100,000 veterans enrolled in VA medical care to 80 per 100,000. By comparison, young civilians committed suicide at a rate of 20 per 100,000, or roughly one-fourth the rate of young military veterans, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nLikewise, the overall suicide rate for active-duty soldiers in the Army remained fairly static at 22 per 100,000 during recent years, according to the Department of Defense. The number of suicides among Army soldiers \u2014 the military\u2019s largest service \u2014 peaked in 2012 at 185 total deaths, at a rate of 30 per 100,000.\n\nThe VA conducted a preliminary analysis of the new suicide data, showing that although many of the suicide victims had received VA care, they had not been receiving mental health therapy. \"They're young. They've just gotten out of the service,\" Kemp said. \"They're more concentrated on going home, getting jobs, for the most part. They're not coming in for mental health care.\"\n\nA similar pattern was found among veterans of past foreign wars, according to VA epidemiologist Robert Bossarte.\"There were were several studies after Vietnam that showed increases in suicide and other forms of injury/mortality for about the first five years following return from service,\" he told USA Today. \"Those rates [eventually] came down to be about the same as the rest of the population.\"\n\nKemp said VA would like to bring more young veterans into the system in an effort to ease the suicide rate into the future.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "army suicides, suicide, va, veterans, therapy, veteran suicides, young veterans, post-traumatic stress disorder", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Suicide rates have risen substantially among young men and women who've served in the U.S. military, and experts are blaming post-traumatic stress disorder, among other factors.", "title": "What's Causing More Young War Vets to Commit Suicide?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/young-war-veterans-see-44-spike-suicide-rates-266893", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/11/suicides-spike-among-young-military-veterans.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Suicide rates have risen substantially among young men and women who've served in the U.S. military, and experts are blaming post-traumatic stress disorder, among other factors.", "title": "What's Causing More Young War Vets to Commit Suicide?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/young-war-veterans-see-44-spike-suicide-rates-266893", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/11/suicides-spike-among-young-military-veterans.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/11/suicides-spike-among-young-military-veterans.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-11T14:15:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-11T14:15:30-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Suicide rates have risen substantially among young men and women who've served in the U.S. military, and experts are blaming post-traumatic stress disorder, among other factors."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd065\"", "article_summary": "For whatever reason, older veterans experienced a lower than average suicide rate while younger veterans committed suicide at the highest rates.\nU.S. GovernmentThe suicide rate for young military veterans has risen dramatically by 44 percent for men and 11 percent for women, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) says.\nKemp said VA would like to bring more young veterans into the system in an effort to ease the suicide rate into the future.\nAmong veterans ages 18-24, the suicide rate jumped from 46 per 100,000 veterans enrolled in VA medical care to 80 per 100,000.\nEvery day, nearly two-dozen young men and women who\u2019ve served in the military commit suicide, even as the rate for older veterans holds steady."}
