It had considered as many as 600 names before finally landing on Northwell.\n\n[Also: Northwell to spend millions on rebranding, chief says]\n\nOfficials said its marketing campaign tagline is \"Look North,\" representing the first campaign in what will be a months-long, multimillion-dollar marketing blitz to raise awareness for the new name.\n\nNone of Northwell's 21 hospitals will see a name change, though the phrase \"a member of Northwell Health\" will be added to all facility signage.\n\nNorthwell pulls in $9.5 billion in revenue annually. In addition to hospitals, physician practices, and ambulatory centers, it runs its own health plan as well as a venture fund.\n\nTwitter: @HenryPowderly", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/northwell-rebranding-kicks-new-years-baby-stars-marketing-video", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/baby-hfn-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "When Northwell Health officially replaced the former North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System brand name on January 1, officials got an extra marketing boost when the first baby born in New York on New Year's Day was delivered at a Northwell hospital.", "title": "Northwell rebranding kicks off, New Years baby stars in marketing video"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/baby-hfn-feature.jpg"}, "description": "When Northwell Health officially replaced the former North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System brand name on January 1, officials got an extra marketing boost when the first baby born in New York on New Year's Day was delivered at a Northwell hospital.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Northwell rebranding kicks off, New Years baby stars in marketing video"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "When Northwell Health officially replaced the former North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System brand name on January 1, officials got an extra marketing boost when the first baby born in New York on New Year's Day was delivered at a Northwell hospital.&#13; According to Northwell, Daniella and Eli Malakov of Forest Hills delivered a baby boy at the stroke of midnight at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens, marking the first baby born in the city in 2016.
