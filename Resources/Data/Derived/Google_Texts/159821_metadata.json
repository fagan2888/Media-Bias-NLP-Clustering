It is Pope Francis who wants this, and those of us who are close to him in this venture are honored and highly motivated to make this possible,\u201d Archbishop Konrad Krajewski, the papal almoner, said Feb. 29, according to Vatican Radio.\n\nLucia Ercoli, director of the Supportive Medicine Association, said, \u201cWe are grateful to Pope Francis for having wanted, once again, to give a concrete sign of mercy in St. Peter\u2019s Square for persons without a fixed residence or who are in difficulty.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur doctors, along with those of FAS and the Policlinico (hospital) Tor Vergata, have accepted with great passion this new challenge that ideally combines the work done in recent years in the suburbs with the heart of Christianity.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere still much work to be done, especially in the suburbs of our city, but I think this new clinic in St. Peter\u2019s is a sign of great hope.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first initiative on Vatican grounds to be directed at offering concrete aid. Since early 2015, the Vatican has provided persons in need access to showers and even a barbershop run by volunteers. Many barbers have volunteered with enthusiasm, including two barbers from the national Italian organization that transports the sick to Lourdes and other international shrines.\n\n\u201cIt seemed right to also provide free medical visits,\u201d Archbishop Krajewski added, saying it is \u201can indispensable service to the health of the poor who live among us.\u201d\n\nAnd in October 2015, Pope Francis and his fellow Jesuits converted an old travel agency into a dormitory for the homeless.\n\nResidents in the new \u201cGift of Mercy\u201d house are welcome to stay for up to 30 consecutive days, and a schedule is set by the Missionary of Charity sisters who help keep things running smoothly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Located near the colonnade, the new \u201cclinic for the poor\u201d opened Monday.
