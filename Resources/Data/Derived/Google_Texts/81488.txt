“It’s 2015: Why Are We Still Debating Torture?” is the title of the lecture former U.S. Sen. Mark Udall will deliver Monday evening at the University of Arizona.

Udall, who has lived in Colorado for several decades, was born and raised in Tucson, the district his late father, Mo, represented for nearly 30 years in Congress. Democrat Mark Udall served in the Colorado Legislature, Congress and as a U.S. senator before losing in November to Republican Cory Gardner of Yuma.

Udall served on the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and led the bipartisan effort to rein in the NSA’s dragnet collection of Americans’ personal data. He was one of the leading advocates for releasing the Senate Intelligence Committee’s study of the CIA’s detention and interrogation program.
