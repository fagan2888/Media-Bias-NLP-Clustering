It also monitored racial disparities.\n\nThe group gave Massachusetts the top ranking, followed by Connecticut, Hawaii, Vermont and Minnesota. Massachusetts ranked first in access to care, second in coverage and fifth in health outcomes.\n\nMassachusetts, under Republican Gov. Mitt Romney, was the first state to institute universal health care so Massachusetts tends to rank highly in measures related to health insurance coverage. Under Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick, the state accepted an expansion of Medicaid as part of the federal Affordable Care Act, which was another metric measured by the study.\n\nHowever, Megan Amundson, executive director for NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts, noted that there are a few measures where Massachusetts does not measure up. The state ranks 20th in the country in the percentage of black women who have received pap smears, part of routine gynecological care, in the last three years. Massachusetts ranks 32nd in the percentage of need met among women who require publicly funded contraceptive services or family planning clinics. The state has high asthma rates for all women, and particularly white women.\n\nThere were also disparities in health outcomes by ethnicity. Massachusetts reported particularly high rates of hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, infant mortality and poor mental health among Latina women.\n\n\"Despite a high overall ranking, Massachusetts is still leaving women of color behind in our health care system,\" Amundson said.\n\n2014.10 Womens.health National", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@homepage','health-care','health-insurance','megan-amundson','women'", "title": "Study: Massachusetts ranks #1 in women's health", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Study: Massachusetts ranks #1 in women\\u0027s health \", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/10/massachusetts_ranked_1_in_wome.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/breakingnews/photo/2011/03/9430743-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14187136\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-14T14:42:02Z\", \"author\": \"Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com\", \"tags\": [\"@homepage\",\"health-care\",\"health-insurance\",\"megan-amundson\",\"women\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.masslive.com/breakingnews/photo/2011/03/9430743-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@#!/shiraschoenberg", "site": "@masslivenews", "card": "summary", "description": "The study also found racial disparities in Massachusetts, with high rates of hypertension, diabetes and mental health problems among Latina women."}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, October 14, 2014, 10:42 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.masslive.com/breakingnews/photo/2011/03/health-care-generic-ap-d9253882567a835b.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"sschoenberg\", \"author_nickname\": \"Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com\", \"author_id\": \"10164552\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Politics - MassLive.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "The study also found racial disparities in Massachusetts, with high rates of hypertension, diabetes and mental health problems among Latina women.", "title": "Study: Massachusetts ranks #1 in women's health", "url": "http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/10/massachusetts_ranked_1_in_wome.html", "image": "http://www.masslive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "masslive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, October 14, 2014, 10:34 AM", "article_author": "Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com", "Description": "The study also found racial disparities in Massachusetts, with high rates of hypertension, diabetes and mental health problems among Latina women."}, "article_summary": "The 2014 Women's Health Report Card measured every state in terms of health coverage for women, women's access to health care, and women's health outcomes.\nMitt Romney, was the first state to institute universal health care so Massachusetts tends to rank highly in measures related to health insurance coverage.\n\"Despite a high overall ranking, Massachusetts is still leaving women of color behind in our health care system,\" Amundson said.\nMassachusetts ranks number one in the nation when it comes to women's health, according to a report released Tuesday by the Alliance for a Just Society, an advocacy group focused on racial and economic justice.\nMassachusetts ranks 32nd in the percentage of need met among women who require publicly funded contraceptive services or family planning clinics."}
