It\u2019s only five steps so I figured why not?\n\nStep 01: Consider your judgments of what people wear, their hairstyles, headscarves, etc. Are these thoughts negative or justified?\n\nGiven the fact that I\u2019m middle aged and balding I\u2019m fairly conscious slash jealous of anyone with a full head of hair, I\u2019m not sure I fare well on this question. I think that you can tell a bit about a person by the way they dress, at least what subculture they are attempting to identify with. It\u2019s pretty easy to pick out the hipster\u2014skinny jeans, tight fitting shirt, dark rimmed glasses, maybe a bow-tie or some leather boots. Or the soddy\u2014Stetson, ropers, crease in down the front of their jeans.\n\nStep 02: Gauge your fear of being around people who are not of the same race as you.\n\nI mostly have a fear of saying or doing something that makes me sound like or appear to be stupid. Race is only one in a long list of things that can trip that particular neurosis.\n\nStep 03: Note the frequency of your racial slurs and jokes.\n\nStep 04: Think about your upbringing. Are your parents racist or extremely prejudiced? Many racists learned their behavior in childhood from the influence of relatives.\n\nThese two are tricky.\n\nI confess that I told racist jokes when I was young, or even not that young. I wish I hadn\u2019t, but the truth is that I did. It was acceptable. The small town Kansas\u2019s world in which I grew up wasn\u2019t exactly cosmopolitan. Everyone was very aware of race, but among my good-hearted relatives, especially those from the South I can\u2019t remember a single strident racist. Though rarely explicit, and never programmatic, racialized thinking was still customary.\n\nRacism mostly came out through racial jokes. African Americans, Vietnamese, Polish, Jews, Red-necks, and the Irish were all targets of some kind of humor. I don\u2019t think I realized until I was much older than most of my people were farmers and oil-field workers. I come from a long line of rednecks and roughnecks, which is possibly why those jokes got the most laughter.\n\nTo be sure, humor was a subtle way of reinforcing racial stereotypes and class distinction. The jokes were told as if to say, \u201cWe might be poor rednecks, but we\u2019re better than those\u2026\u201d fill in the blank with whatever socially unacceptable racial circumlocution was common to the person\u2019s vernacular and particular prejudice. All of it was wrong. All of it seemed harmless at the time. It doesn\u2019t anymore.\n\nRacism was a normal part of my world. Nobody openly challenged those underlying beliefs until high school. I say beliefs but that might not be right. Racism wasn\u2019t so much a belief as it was a habit of the mind. In fact, when it was couched as a belief and held before me to consider I immediately rejected the premise and slowly began to change the behavior and thought patterns.\n\nThe truth is, however, that once those neural pathways are formed, it\u2019s easy to go there, even if it\u2019s only in your mind. Firing is wiring, and my brain was wired from a young age by generations of folks who saw race very differently. It\u2019s important to tell the truth about the ghostly echoes of racist thought, the leftover relics of an early stage of development that still exist in my mind.\n\nStep 05: Consider the following questions:\n\nDo you think of all people of any particular race act in the same way?\n\nDo you always refer to people\u2019s race in your description of them or do you deliberately leave out the obvious so as not to offend?\n\nDo you ascribe certain negative behaviors to people of certain races and insist that only they do this?\n\nDo you think all people of a particular race look alike\n\nDo you dislike other races, or do you just love your own?\n\nWhat are you asking me? Do I think white men can\u2019t jump, or don\u2019t have rhythm? Do I think women make less than men and this isn\u2019t fair? Do I think poverty, crime, drugs, and violence in my hometown of Kansas City are, to a high degree, concentrated among Spanish speaking immigrants and African Americans, while rich white suburbanite seem univocally vine with this arrangement? Do I think Yankees fans are obnoxious? Do I think all Muslims are terrorists? Do I wish the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses would stop ringing my doorbell?\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of step five. Race, gender, ethnicity, religion, these qualifiers complicate our lives because they expose the selfishness that lives at the heart of all people. But there\u2019s always the possibility that, when it comes to race I am hopelessly stunted. Am I a racist? No, I don\u2019t think so. But I\u2019m a white, middle-class, educated, heterosexual, American, male. Can you think of any segment of society less qualified to determine whether or or not somebody is racist? I know that at some point I was. And in some unredeemed part of my consciousness, at some level, I have to say I am. Or at least I was, and it still plagues my memory. All this to say that in my experience, it is not effortless to think about race. And, I\u2019m aware that, unlike my life, race is constantly on the mind of those for whom it poses significant challenges.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m also a Christian. I have been taught to put myself last in the pecking order, to consider everyone else as above me in some way. Humility is a kingdom virtue. I\u2019m taught to move toward \u201cthe other\u201d in love, no matter what the attribute may be that makes them \u201cthe other\u201d in the first place. Christianity isn\u2019t a belief system, it\u2019s a way of being human, a way Jesus taught and continues to empower.\n\nYou want to lead the way? One leads through humility in this kingdom. You want to strive to be first? Then you will be last in the kingdom of God. You try to grasp for the life you want, it will slip through your fingers and you\u2019ll lose it. You want to control others by oppressing them for whatever reason, you will find yourself on the business end of a universe that was designed to resist this. The Christian must be willing lay down their life for others, consider them better, higher, above. One must spend their life and time & energy serving those to whom we have been given.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/paperbacktheology/2014/08/are-you-a-racist-five-easy-steps-from-wikihow-can-help-you-figure-it-out.html", "site_name": "Paperback Theology", "image": "http://media.patheos.com/Images/PChPT/PChPT_TimSuttle_bio.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Are You a Racist?
