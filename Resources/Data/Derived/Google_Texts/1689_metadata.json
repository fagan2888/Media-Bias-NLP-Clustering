Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at USC, believes the law will remain unchanged, though not entirely unaffected.\n\n\u201cNothing will happen to Obamacare from a fiscal perspective,\u201d she anticipated. \u201cThat said, with the shutdown, some attention is diverted away from information about the exchanges and enrollment.\u201d\n\nEric Bauman, L.A. County Democratic Party Chair and Vice Chair of the Democratic Party of California, agrees with that sentiment, noting the law\u2019s implementation will continue as normal.\n\n\u201cWhat [Republicans] seem to miss is that the Affordable Care Act is already funded,\u201d Bauman said. \u201cThe government shutting down does not in any way, shape or form slow or stop the roll out of [the healthcare law].\u201d\n\nJonathan Wilcox, Communications Director for the Republican Party of Los Angeles, says that Obamacare has been \u201ca nightmare in implementation from the beginning.\u201d However, he also foresees no change in the law because of the government shutdown, since that would entail cooperation from Obama. \u201cI do not believe there is any likelihood the President will repeal his own law,\u201d he said.\n\nWith that in mind, the fight over the healthcare law is likely to continue.\n\n\u201cSome Republicans have shown a remarkable willingness for making preposterous demands in order to defund Obamacare and will likely continue to do so,\u201d Zissimopolous said.\n\nWilcox also points to significant controversial aspects of the law\u2014including the law\u2019s partisan passage, as it was signed into law without a single republican vote\u2014as reason to believe the discussion will continue.\n\nALSO SEE: Obamacare Launches, Nobody Even Knows\n\nThere is less consensus, though, about whether the law will be untouched down the road.\n\nGeoffrey Joyce, a member of the Senior Research Faculty at the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center, expects no imminent changes to the law but refuses to ignore the ambiguity that exists about the future.\n\n\u201cIf the fight in Washington [D.C.] persists, I think that will add chaos and uncertainty that could affect ACA implementation down the road,\u201d said Joyce.\n\nOthers are more certain.\n\n\u201cThey will not find success [in repealing the Affordable Care Act],\u201d Zissimoplous said. \u201cThey have tried and failed.\u201d\n\nReach Staff Reporter Ben Kraus here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What's in store for Obamacare following the government shutdown?", "author": "Ben Kraus", "og": {"url": "http://www.neontommy.com/news/2013/10/obamacares-future-likely-unchanged-shutdown", "image": "http://www.neontommy.com/sites/default/files/obamacare-logo_full.png?1380677653", "type": "article", "description": "The government shutdown may not heavily affect Obamacare's future.", "title": "Obamacare's Future Likely Unchanged By Shutdown"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 19560893}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "p": {"domain_verify": "4f67b85b5e96bc75e43aefc386ed9fb0"}, "google-site-verification": "Gd7gRPMvk-fLgqZF-yo5Ax5NmoCw6MBzipcz9xhUGgk"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7cf5\"", "article_summary": "With that in mind, the fight over the healthcare law is likely to continue.\n\u201cThey will not find success [in repealing the Affordable Care Act],\u201d Zissimoplous said.\n\u201cWhat [Republicans] seem to miss is that the Affordable Care Act is already funded,\u201d Bauman said.\n\u201cSome Republicans have shown a remarkable willingness for making preposterous demands in order to defund Obamacare and will likely continue to do so,\u201d Zissimopolous said.\nALSO SEE: Government Shutdown: Tea Party Members Speak OutJulie Zissimopolous, Associate Director of the Leonard D.
