In California, voters who do not want to register with any party must check a box on a registration form for \"no party preference.\"\n\n\"I just blew it,\" Deborah Silva, 64, of Point Arena in Mendocino County, told the Times. \"There were a number of choices. I just checked the box that said 'independent.'\"\n\nOf people surveyed in the Times poll, fewer than 4 percent could correctly identify their own registration as a member of the American Independent Party.\n\nMoore was among Hollywood celebrities with known Democratic leanings listed as members. She has contributed money to and campaigned for President Barack Obama. Her registration as an AIP member is wrong, a representative said.\n\n\"Demi Moore is not, nor has ever been, a member of the American Independent Party,\" the representative told the Times.\n\nWhen Patrick Schwarzenegger, son of former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, registered to vote in 2013, he selected the American Independent Party. A family spokesman said Schwarzenegger, 22, plans to change his registration.\n\nAccording to the Secretary of State's Office, the party has about 472,000 members, or 2.7 percent of the statewide total.\n\nThe American Independent Party's roots date to 1967 when George Wallace, a segregationist, launched his ?second? run for the White House. Wallace, ?who had run as a Democrat in 1964, helped create the party and ran on its ticket.? Today, that party exists only in California.\n\n\"We're not segregationist anymore,\" said Markham Robinson, who serves as chairman of the American Independent Party's executive committee. \"What we are now is a conservative, constitutionalist party.\"\n\nSome voters who mistakenly registered with the party said they found the state's official registration materials confusing.\n\nThe survey of members of the American Independent Party was conducted by telephone Feb. 9-11. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Los Angeles Times, http://www.latimes.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of voters, celebrities, register to wrong party - AP News: LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A survey has found that tens .05/27/2016 7:55:38AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A survey has found that tens of thousands of voters, including", "title": "AP News - Thousands of voters, celebrities, register to wrong party", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/17/thousands-of-voters-celebrities-register-to-wrong-party-n2149946", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A survey has found that tens of thousands of voters, including", "title": "AP News - Thousands of voters, celebrities, register to wrong party", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/17/thousands-of-voters-celebrities-register-to-wrong-party-n2149946", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Thousands of voters, celebrities, register to wrong party, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "In California, voters who do not want to register with any party must check a box on a registration form for \"no party preference.\"\n\"Demi Moore is not, nor has ever been, a member of the American Independent Party,\" the representative told the Times.\nArnold Schwarzenegger, registered to vote in 2013, he selected the American Independent Party.\nThe survey of members of the American Independent Party was conducted by telephone Feb. 9-11.\n\"We're not segregationist anymore,\" said Markham Robinson, who serves as chairman of the American Independent Party's executive committee."}
