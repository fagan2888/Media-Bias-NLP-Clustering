A year later he jammed lawmakers with the approaching holiday in the third week in December.\n\nAnd last year, Reid complained he had twice in his career had to leave the Senate on Christmas Eve \u2014 and hoped he wouldn't have to do so again.\n\nFor the record, Reid has only kept the Senate open on Christmas Eve once in his eight years as majority leader.\n\nOn Monday, Reid renewed his annual seasonal tradition by warning his colleagues \"there are things we have to get done,\" before they get to go home for the holidays.\n\nNext year won't be quite the same without Reid's annual Christmas cheer, as the Democratic Majority leader will cede control of the Senate to Republican Mitch McConnell in January.\n\nWill you be a mean one Mr. McConnell?", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.", "pubdate": "2014-12-03T20:55:12Z", "author": "By Stephen Collinson, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.", "pubdate": "2014-12-03T20:55:12Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/03/politics/politics-christmas-reid/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/141203154757-harry-reid-christmas-00000000-t3-entertainment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/03/politics/politics-christmas-reid/index.html"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "source": "CNN", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "keywords": "politics, How Reid, the Grinch, threatens to steal Christmas - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2014-12-03T21:55:37Z", "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/141203154757-harry-reid-christmas-00000000-t3-entertainment.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfdb9\"", "article_summary": "\"Last year, we were here at this time \u2014 up until Christmas Eve, I hope we don't have to do that this year.\"\nThe next year, Reid actually had his troops hard at work and voting on Christmas Eve as the Senate passed Obamacare.\nFor the record, Reid has only kept the Senate open on Christmas Eve once in his eight years as majority leader.\nAnd up on Capitol Hill, a familiar Grinch is threatening to steal Christmas again.\nReid delivered his annual warning of fast-approaching Christmas early, on November 28, in 2011."}
