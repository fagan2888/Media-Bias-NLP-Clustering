Future development should focus on housing, but there needs to be commercial space for local companies to grow. Redeveloping strip shopping centers into mixed-use projects would serve both those needs. Boulder needs to preserve existing affordable housing and allow more housing choices, such as accessory units, cooperative housing and smaller units.\n\nJan Burton: Boulder's planning processes need more creativity. We should draw on the experiences of other cities that have created sustainable urbanism and develop \"breakthrough strategies.\" Boulder should support business expansion and look for ways to improve transportation and housing options. Boulder should encourage more density within neighborhoods through accessory units, multi-family housing, cooperatives and tiny homes.\n\nCindy Carlisle: Residents need to be involved in planning policy at early stages, not just reacting to projects they don't like. There should be \"no surprises.\" The policies in the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan need implementation plans. Boulder has too many jobs, with in-commuting creating huge traffic problems, while local businesses feel squeezed out. Any new development needs to provide adequate affordable housing for its workers, but Boulder cannot build or densify its way out of the affordable housing shortage because land prices are too high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon Cote: Boulder's planning vision is already unattainable. The city should focus on working with neighboring communities to provide transit between communities and within Boulder that goes where people need to go, so that they can leave their cars behind. Jobs are important to the city's economic vitality, and Boulder needs to remain attractive to new companies. Boulder should have workforce and senior housing throughout the city, and the Boulder Community Health Broadway campus provides a good opportunity to develop a new mixed-use community.\n\nEd Jabari: Boulder's land-use regulations should be guidelines and not set in stone. Many small businesses have folded because they didn't have the flexibility they needed to pursue innovative ideas. The planning department needs to work more cooperatively with businesses and property owners, especially when their proposals offer community benefit, and community-oriented businesses should be able to appeal to the City Council for a decision that incorporates social and environmental considerations, not just economic ones. Boulder doesn't have too many jobs, but jobs with community value need to pay more. It's too hard for artists, hospitality workers, healers, teachers and non-profit staff to get by in Boulder. Boulder should ease the occupancy limit and allow for more accessory units, and large developments need to pay for community infrastructure.\n\nSuzanne Jones: Boulder needs to come to consensus about future growth and development and adjust its land-use policies to reflect that vision. Where neighborhoods are amenable, Boulder should change land-use policies to allow more \"gentle infill,\" such as accessory units and cooperative housing options. Form-based code has potential to create better buildings and public space. Boulder also needs to define \"community benefit\" and make sure new projects are providing it. Boulder doesn't have too many jobs yet, but the city needs to create more balance between jobs and housing. The affordable housing requirements probably should be higher, and the city needs to allow for smaller units. Community-wide Eco Pass could reduce the traffic from in-commuting.\n\nJared Kaszuba: Ordinary people need to be more involved in planning decisions from the beginning. Boulder doesn't have too many jobs, but the city needs to support keeping existing businesses and providing jobs for people who already live here over recruiting new businesses and importing workers. Easing the occupancy limit would help with affordable housing.\n\nMichael Kruteck: Boulder needs more predictability in its approval process for new projects. More predictability will make decisions seem fairer and improve the city's relationship with the development community. Boulder does not have too many jobs. Jobs are a sign of economic vitality and produce the tax revenue that support other important community priorities. Boulder should look for ways to reduce the traffic impact of commuting. Boulder needs to do an assessment of its current housing stock and how that compares to demand and develop affordable housing policies that address the shortfalls. Raising fees or demanding developers build more affordable housing may not be the right solution.\n\nLeonard May: Boulder should develop models, including three-dimensional images, of what the city will look like if it's built out according to current zoning and look at how those models conform to the city we want. Boulder should then make changes to land-use policy that bring the future modeling in line with our goals. Whether Boulder has too many jobs should be part of that discussion. To create affordable housing, the city needs to buy up land and develop it for that purpose, as well as buying up existing housing to keep it affordable. Having enough affordable housing will be key to preserving any diversity in Boulder.\n\nJulianne McCabe: Boulder's planning decisions have a \"zig-zag\" quality as the city responds to competing interests. The city needs to find consensus to have more consistent policies. Saying whether Boulder has too many jobs requires speculation, but if we reduced the dominance of the single-occupancy vehicle, we could reduce congestion associated with commuting. There are no new, great ideas out there for affordable housing. Public-private partnerships could be used to build some affordable housing. Private business operating with a profit motive should produce housing in Boulder.\n\nLisa Morzel: Boulder needs to include everyone at the start of a planning process and embrace resident concerns while addressing broader community needs. City staff should not take on an advocacy role in promoting certain policies. Overlay zones could be used to allow new uses in areas that desire them without changing zoning in the rest of the city. Boulder shouldn't seek to roll back jobs, but the city should reconsider its jobs projections and seek more balance with housing. Boulder should re-examine its zoning and look for ways to get more housing and create more market-rate affordable housing. Boulder may need to increase the inclusionary housing requirements and consider new fees to support housing.\n\nComrade Keith Percy: Boulder needs to move beyond efficiency and beauty and welcome a socially, racially, economically and culturally diverse group of residents. Boulder doesn't have too many jobs, but jobs need to be more than two minimum wage for each worker. They need to provide living wages. Housing vouchers and dropping the occupancy limit would make housing more affordable. Boulder needs to look at tiny houses, cooperative housing and other options, as well as open camping and Housing First projects for the homeless. Housing also needs to be accessible and welcoming to those with disabilities.\n\nTim Plass: Area planning would give developers and residents alike more certainty about the type of development in each neighborhood. Boulder should focus more on the public realm, with form-based code and smaller streets in some areas to create a more human scale. It's a good thing that Boulder is a regional jobs center, and the city can reduce the impacts with aggressive transportation policies and more fees on new development. Boulder should increase its goals for permanently affordable housing, but the city also needs to enable market solutions to the shortage of affordable housing, through smaller units, cooperative and co-housing and rezoning some commercial and industrial areas for housing.\n\nJyotsna Raj: Neighborhood planning that encourages resident input early in the process would give certainty to residents and address specific challenges and concerns in each area. Early community engagement might generate support for density and mixed-use with neighborhoods. Boulder needs a vibrant economy, but the imbalance between jobs and housing creates significant problems. Boulder should require that 40 percent of all residential developments be permanently affordable and buy land for mobile home parks to provide an affordable option that isn't an apartment.\n\nBill Rigler: Boulder should improve dialogue and outreach to key stakeholders and eliminate red tape in the planning process when possible. The Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan reflects the community's values, and the city should put \"teeth\" into the implementation of its policies. Boulder doesn't have too many jobs, and its status as an employment center produces that tax revenue that supports city goals. It is unacceptable that a family that earns $100,000 cannot afford to live and work in Boulder. The city should look at direct purchases of affordable units and allowing more housing in commercial and industrial zones.\n\nCha Cha Spinrad: Boulder should have more mixed-use development and 15-minute neighborhoods where people can meet their needs close to home. Boulder doesn't have too many jobs but needs higher wages and more housing. Removing barriers to shared housing, such as the occupancy limit, would help with the affordable housing shortage.\n\nBob Yates: Boulder should explore form-based code to create more predictability in the planning process, leading to fewer surprises and disappointments in new buildings. While Boulder doesn't need to actively recruit large employers, the city needs to have space for existing businesses to expand and should welcome those who want to move here. Adjusting the occupancy limit would provide more affordable housing within the existing housing stock as the city looks for more comprehensive solutions.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28951340/boulders-17-city-council-candidates-growth-development-and", "sailthru.author": "By Erica Meltzer \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28951340:view"}, "startDate": "2015-10-10T16:18:50-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "The Daily Camera asked the  17 candidates for Boulder City Council what planning policies they would change, whether Boulder has too many jobs and what they would do to increase affordable housing.", "title": "Boulder's 17 City Council candidates on growth, development and more", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28951340/boulders-17-city-council-candidates-growth-development-and", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-10-10T16:19:21-0600", "endDate": "2025-10-10T16:08:10-0600", "news_keywords": "boulder,colorado,boulder county,louisville,lafayette,superior,longmont,candidates,city council,ballot,ballot issues", "byline": "By Erica MeltzerStaff", "pubDate": "2015-10-10T16:20:53-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-10T16:18:50-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder's 17 City Council candidates on growth, development and more", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Election", "description": "The Daily Camera asked the  17 candidates for Boulder City Council what planning policies they would change, whether Boulder has too many jobs and what they would do to increase affordable housing.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28951340/boulders-17-city-council-candidates-growth-development-and", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Daily Camera asked the  17 candidates for Boulder City Council what planning policies they would change, whether Boulder has too many jobs and what they would do to increase affordable housing.", "title": "Boulder's 17 City Council candidates on growth, development and more"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "article_summary": "Related Stories Boulder City Council election: Meet the 17 candidatesThe Daily Camera asked the 17 candidates for Boulder City Council what planning policies they would change, whether Boulder has too many jobs and what they would do to increase affordable housing.\nBoulder's code creates too many incentives for large homes and should instead encourage smaller, more affordable housing.\nBoulder needs to preserve existing affordable housing and allow more housing choices, such as accessory units, cooperative housing and smaller units.\nThe affordable housing requirements probably should be higher, and the city needs to allow for smaller units.\nSuzanne Jones: Boulder needs to come to consensus about future growth and development and adjust its land-use policies to reflect that vision."}
