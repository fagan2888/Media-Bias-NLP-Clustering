Jonathan Welsh\n\nWith the Daytona 500 just about a month away, racing fans are asking whether driver Danica Patrick could possibly match her performance in the 2013 edition of stock-car racing\u2019s biggest event.\n\nPatrick, who last February was embarking on her rookie season as a full-time driver in Nascar\u2019s Sprint Cup series, grabbed the pole position in qualifying, led the Daytona race and finished 8th in an impressive debut. But the 31-year-old driver who has been racing since elementary school told Speakeasy she is looking for ways to top what she did last year, not match it.\n\n\u201cAs soon as you do well there is pressure to do it again, and to do it better,\u201d she said. And this year, new rules could help.\n\nNascar changed certain measurements for Sprint Cup cars in an effort to increase downforce that helps keeps the cars firmly planted on the track. New rules include a wider radiator pan, a part on the front end that should now generate more downward pressure. The cars\u2019 rear spoilers will rise to eight inches high from 7.25 inches previously.\n\nAfter completing pre-season test laps in the new racer, Patrick said the revised spoiler and front-end bodywork seem to make the cars more stable and should keep them from generating aerodynamic turbulence that can lead to loss of control when the cars are racing in tight packs. However, she has yet to drive the car \u201cin traffic,\u201d to see exactly how it will handle with others racing close by.\n\nIn the past, she said, many drivers have been known for getting their front fenders close enough to a rival\u2019s rear spoiler that the resulting turbulence causes the car in front to become unstable and slow down.\n\nThe new spoiler should make it more difficult to do that, Patrick said.\n\nThe run-up to the Daytona 500 begins February 14 with practice for the Sprint Unlimited, a 75-lap invitational race that runs the next day. Racers will also compete in the two Budweiser Duel races Feb 20 before officially kicking off the season with the Daytona 500 on Feb 23.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Stock-car driver Danica Patrick says new Nascar rules could help her in this year's Sprint Cup series, which begins with the Daytona 500 on Feb. 23.", "title": "Will New Nascar Rules Help Danica Patrick Win in 2014?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/01/21/will-new-nascar-rules-help-danica-patrick-win-in-2014/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BE233_patric_G_20140121074933.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Will New Nascar Rules Help Danica Patrick Win in 2014?", "description": "Stock-car driver Danica Patrick says new Nascar rules could help her in this year's Sprint Cup series, which begins with the Daytona 500 on Feb. 23.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Jonathan Welsh", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Stock-car driver Danica Patrick says new Nascar rules could help her in this year's Sprint Cup series, which begins with the Daytona 500 on Feb. 23.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-01-21T21:00:43-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/01/21/will-new-nascar-rules-help-danica-patrick-win-in-2014/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-79348", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Stock-car driver Danica Patrick says new Nascar rules could help her in this year's Sprint Cup series, which begins with the Daytona 500 on Feb. 23.", "title": "Will New Nascar Rules Help Danica Patrick Win in 2014?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/01/21/will-new-nascar-rules-help-danica-patrick-win-in-2014/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BE233_patric_G_20140121074933.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-79348", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-01-21T18:33:56-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Racers will also compete in the two Budweiser Duel races Feb 20 before officially kicking off the season with the Daytona 500 on Feb 23.\nDanica Patrick describes how racing drivers use aerodynamics to slow down their rivals.\nJonathan WelshWith the Daytona 500 just about a month away, racing fans are asking whether driver Danica Patrick could possibly match her performance in the 2013 edition of stock-car racing\u2019s biggest event.\nThe run-up to the Daytona 500 begins February 14 with practice for the Sprint Unlimited, a 75-lap invitational race that runs the next day.\nNascar changed certain measurements for Sprint Cup cars in an effort to increase downforce that helps keeps the cars firmly planted on the track."}
