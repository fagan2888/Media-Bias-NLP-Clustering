But a pair of second-year players carried out the game plan Friday, relentlessly attacking the Seahawks\u2019 offense and holding it to only 181 net yards in the Broncos\u2019 preseason-opening win in Seattle.\n\nDefensive end Kenny Anunike led the team with eight total tackles (six solo) to go along with one sack and two quarterback hurries. Outside linebacker Shaquil Barrett turned in three total tackles (one solo), one sack and four quarterback hurries.\n\nThey were just two members of a Denver defense that got seven sacks from as many players Friday night. But their performances were, in part, due to significant physical transformations during the offseason.\n\nBarrett, who signed with the Broncos as an undrafted free agent out of Colorado State last year, took cues from Miller in changing his diet.\n\nMiller told local media in April that he altered his eating habits to slim down and get in the best shape of his life, a claim that would be hard to dispute based on his work in training camp and in Friday\u2019s win.\n\nBarrett followed suit \u2014 to a certain extent \u2014 in shedding body fat and drinking more water.\n\n\u201cI just started eating differently and had my wife prep meals for me, trying to change my body shape,\u201d he said. \u201cI came here at probably like 18 percent body fat and I got it down to 11 right now. I\u2019ve lost a couple of pounds, so I\u2019m more explosive off the edge, quicker first step. It\u2019s helped me out a lot.\u201d\n\nAnunike\u2019s dietetic focus and training was perhaps even more strict. But he was headed in the opposite direction. The 6-foot-5 undrafted lineman out of Duke has packed on 15 pounds of \u201cgood weight\u201d this offseason to help him fend off double teams and hold back offensive linemen in Wade Phillips\u2019 3-4 defense.\n\nAdding weight on a big frame while doing two-a-days in training camp is no easy feat.\n\nAnunike downed six meals a day \u2014 a lot of lean meats, a lot of rice \u2014 with shakes in between.\n\n\u201cI used to love eating,\u201d Anunike said. \u201cI stopped. I didn\u2019t like it anymore. I was just inhaling it. But it was something I had to do.\u201d\n\nHe is now hovering at 275 pounds, and the added bulk has provided a noticeable difference.\n\nIt showed Friday.\n\n\u201cI was able to maintain that weight \u2014 get heavier, get faster, get stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt good out there.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Shaquil Barrett\u2019s, Kenny Anunike\u2019s physical changes showed for Broncos", "title": "Shaquil Barrett\u2019s, Kenny Anunike\u2019s physical changes showed for Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/15/shaquil-barretts-kenny-anunikes-physical-changes-showed-for-broncos/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150815_042954_shaquil-barrett.jpg", "height": 424}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150815_042954_shaquil-barrett.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-15T16:28:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T11:39:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb74\"", "article_summary": "Outside linebacker Shaquil Barrett turned in three total tackles (one solo), one sack and four quarterback hurries.\nDefensive end Kenny Anunike led the team with eight total tackles (six solo) to go along with one sack and two quarterback hurries.\n\u201cI just started eating differently and had my wife prep meals for me, trying to change my body shape,\u201d he said.\nThey were just two members of a Denver defense that got seven sacks from as many players Friday night.\nBarrett, who signed with the Broncos as an undrafted free agent out of Colorado State last year, took cues from Miller in changing his diet."}
