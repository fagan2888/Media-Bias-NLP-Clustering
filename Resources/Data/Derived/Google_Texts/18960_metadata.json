Those stories, and how they unfolded in both political parties, is the subject of a new book from Politico reporter Kenneth Vogel, Big Money: 2.5 Billion Dollars, One Suspicious Vehicle, and a Pimp\u2014on the Trail of the Ultra-Rich Hijacking American Politics.\n\nHere are the juiciest bits of this lurid tale about the purchase of the nation\u2019s highest offices.\n\nDonors are, quite frankly, childish.\n\nOn both sides of the aisle, big-dollar donors are a who\u2019s-who of industry and finance. And yet, for all that business acumen, the book documents just how na\u00efve and ignorant many of them are when it comes to the political game.\n\nIn fact, their approach to politics is so emotional that the author bitingly compares their methods to \u201cthe Washington cabbie whose radio is glued to NPR, or the uncle at Thanksgiving dinner who can\u2019t stop quoting Bill O\u2019Reilly.\u201d\n\nDonors also apparently have a lot in common with kindergarteners who need to be bribed into napping. For example, Vogel reports that based on the amount of their contributions, Romney campaign donors reached levels like \u201cFounding Partners,\u201d \u201cFounding Members,\u201d and, you guessed it, \u201cStripes\u201d and then \u201cStars.\u201d To go with the different levels, they got swag (from Vineyard Vines, of course), trips with the campaign, and invites to parties at the convention.\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, the author once overheard the best piece of advice from handler to donor: \u201cMy advice to donors: throw a fit. You\u2019ll get whatever you want.\u201d\n\nThere are cringe-inducing moments. One donor complains about the takeout chicken pot pies served at a Karl Rove-hosted confab. The security guy who throws Vogel out of a Democratic fundraiser has resigned from the police force for running a prostitution ring from his car while on the clock.\n\nRecently deceased Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons made news for his seven-figure checks to 2012 flameout Rick Perry, but his less-famous wife found herself interested more and more in the message Rick Santorum was promoting. She decided that the best way to figure out whether she actually liked him was to call Karl Rove to find out \u201cDoes he have a chance?\u201d Apparently the words \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count him out\u201d from Rove were worth a $1 million to a Santorum Super PAC.\n\nSome saw their donation as a ticket to a theme park roller coaster ride. Foster Freiss, the multi-millionaire who funded Rick Santorum\u2019s run, got a thrill from going on the trail with the former Pennsylvania senator. The author describes it as his self-funded \u201cpolitical fantasy camp.\u201d Freiss became famous for his quip about birth control that \u201cBack in my days, they used Bayer aspirin for contraceptives. The gals put it between their knees and it wasn\u2019t that costly.\u201d And while that remark hurt Santorum, Freiss told Vogel, \u201cAll my older friends\u2014the people who weren\u2019t in D.C. or San Francisco\u2014they gave me high-fives and chuckled and thought it was a great joke.\u201d\n\nThe end result, was that while many of these men and women\u2014mostly men\u2014pouring in gargantuan gobs of money kept up to date on politics, they were in many ways ignorant and \u201cdidn\u2019t know whose advice was solid and who was merely calculating profit margins.\u201d\n\nBoy, were those profit margins big.\n\nAbout the only group that looks smart in the book are political consultants, who made out like bandits in the election. It should be noted, in fairness, that many work 20-hour days, seven days a week for two years for a campaign.\n\nMost made their money through commission-based contracts on television advertisement buys, direct mail, and fund-raising. Basically the consultants and their companies got a cut, sometimes as high as 15 percent, of whatever was raised or spent. And as any resident of Florida, Colorado, or Ohio can attest, there was no shortage of ads or direct mail.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Another firm, founded by Alex Gage (husband of Romney deputy campaign manager Katie Packer Gage), called TargetPoint, got $5.1 million in payments from the campaign. Another, founded by Katie Packer Gage herself, WWP Strategies, pulled in $5.5 million that election. These groups were all based in the same building, 66 Canal Center, Alexandria, Virginia. Another firm in that building was Tony Feather\u2019s FLS Connect, which brought in $68 million. Vogel reports that Zac Moffatt, the former digital director for Mitt Romney, had a firm, Targeted Victory, with Feather and Carl Forti that sucked up $114 million.\n\nThere is so much drama on the GOP side.\n\nWhat becomes apparent pretty quickly is that with all that money on the Republican side, things inevitably become more about who has access to it, rather than winning races.\n\nThat issue, combined with a generally more fractured party ideologically, left the GOP exceptionally prone to outright civil war between Super PACs. On the GOP side, everybody wanted their own shiny Super PAC. Petulant billionaires singlehandedly funded rivals to Mitt Romney. Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor each had their own Super PAC. Lowly freshman congressmen could now buck the speaker, as one rich guy could fund their next campaign. The Republican National Committee lost control over the party messaging and finances. Candidates made pilgrimages to billionaire Sheldon Adelson, and not state party chairs, seeking his endorsement and open wallet.\n\nThe Koch groups, notably Americans for Prosperity, which dropped $179 million, would give presentations after the 2012 election debacle that left little doubt about how it saw itself as a rival to the Karl Rove-operated American Crossroads. Rove, of course, would make headlines for his Conservative Victory Project, which was seen as a rejoinder by establishment Republicans to keep \u201cunelectable\u201d conservatives out of the primaries.\n\nThe net effect, notes Vogel, was that in the Super PACs attempts to take control of the party, \u201cthere was a very real possibility that they would instead cancel each other out\u201d and leave the Democrats in power.\n\nDemocrats were both a joke, and a model.\n\nThe Democrats, on the other hand, started out as a laughingstock. Their president was famous for ridiculous big money in politics. The two aides delegated to launch a pro-Obama Super PAC seemed to get their jobs almost by accident. And the hired gun they brought in, Paul Begala, admits to the author, \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever raised money.\u201d\n\nAs the election progresses, however, the Dems not only managed to raise money, but their game plan was far more effectively businesslike, in all likelihood because of the lack of rival PACs.\n\nDems have their own big money, too.\n\nWhile not as significant, progressives have their own \u201cKochtopus\u201d known as the Democracy Alliance. It has put roughly $500 million into liberal causes since 2005, and is a vital source of cash for prominent politicians like Elizabeth Warren, Nancy Pelosi, and even President Obama. They hold secretive, no-press-allowed confabs and retreats much like their conservative foils, and politicians and consultants come calling looking for cash.\n\nAmong the more prominent members, featured throughout the book, were Houston trial lawyers Steve and Amber Mostyn, who gave millions to Super PACs supporting Democrats in 2012.\n\nThe Kochs were NOT Republicans.\n\nAt least part of the mayhem on the Republican side stems from the Koch brothers and their outfits seeing themselves both today and historically as something separate from the Republican Party. It wasn\u2019t until August 2012, Vogel writes, that Americans for Prosperity, the Koch-backed political group, gathered its directors and voted to openly oppose the reelection of Barack Obama. Some AFP members Vogel talked to were shocked by how close that move aligned them with the GOP, unlike the rest of the country bombarded with their anti-Obamacare ads.\n\nPart of the reason is historical. The Kochs for decades were Libertarians, and focused more on think tanks and political groups that promoted that ideology. They generally stayed away from social issues (which became public when David Koch admitted he was in favor of gay marriage), and were not in favor of the neoconservative version of foreign policy. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t come near the Republican side,\u201d disgraced former super-lobbyist Jack Abramoff tells Vogel.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "williamoconnor5"}, "keywords": "books", "publicationDate": 201406091808, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/books", "news_keywords": "Books", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Speed Read: Kenneth Vogels Big Money Shows How PACs Control Politics", "tags": "topic:culture/books", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Read highlights of Kenneth Vogel\u2019s \u2018Big Money,\u2019 an exhaustive look at how PACS influenced the 2012 elections\u2014and wreaked endless mischief, especially for the GOP.", "title": "Speed Read: Kenneth Vogel\u2019s \u2018Big Money\u2019 Shows How PACs Control Politics", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/09/speed-read-kenneth-vogel-s-big-money-shows-how-pacs-control-politics.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/06/09/speed-read-kenneth-vogel-s-big-money-shows-how-pacs-control-politics/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1402507473982.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "Read highlights of Kenneth Vogel\u2019s \u2018Big Money,\u2019 an exhaustive look at how PACS influenced the 2012 elections\u2014and wreaked endless mischief, especially for the GOP.", "sectionTaxanomies": "books", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "William O\u2019Connor", "article": {"section": "books", "published_time": "2014-06-09T18:08:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/william-o-connorhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/06/09/speed-read-kenneth-vogel-s-big-money-shows-how-pacs-control-politics", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Speed Read: Kenneth Vogel\u2019s \u2018Big Money\u2019 Shows How PACs Control Politics\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/09/speed-read-kenneth-vogel-s-big-money-shows-how-pacs-control-politics.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/06/09/speed-read-kenneth-vogel-s-big-money-shows-how-pacs-control-politics/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46750249.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/06/09/speed-read-kenneth-vogel-s-big-money-shows-how-pacs-control-politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-09T18:08:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Books\",\"author\":\"William O\u2019Connor\",\"tags\":[\"books\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/w/william-o-connor", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca715\"", "article_summary": "Cash MoneyRead highlights of Kenneth Vogel\u2019s Big Money , an exhaustive look at how PACS influenced the 2012 elections\u2014and wreaked endless mischief, especially for the GOP.\nAt least part of the mayhem on the Republican side stems from the Koch brothers and their outfits seeing themselves both today and historically as something separate from the Republican Party.\nThat issue, combined with a generally more fractured party ideologically, left the GOP exceptionally prone to outright civil war between Super PACs.\nOne Republican firm, run by Michael Dubke, called Crossroads Media, reportedly collected $248 million in payments for the 2012 cycle.\nThe Kochs for decades were Libertarians, and focused more on think tanks and political groups that promoted that ideology."}
