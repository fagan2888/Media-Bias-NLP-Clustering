Story highlights The former Florida governor doubled down on calling Trump a "jerk"

He knocked the businessman repeatedly during a swing across Iowa

Grinnell, Iowa (CNN) Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush Tuesday argued that front-runner Donald Trump, if elected president, would create a "global depression" because of his proposal to impose high tariffs on Chinese goods.

The former Florida governor also doubled down on calling Trump a "jerk," knocking the businessman repeatedly during a swing across Iowa.

Bush mentioned Trump by name at least 17 times at his first two events, focusing on the Trump's plan to slap a 45% tariff on Chinese exports.

It's an idea -- aimed to crack down on trade imbalances with the country -- which Bush described as "really idiotic" and would have a tremendous impact in a state like Iowa, which trades heavily with China.

"Donald Trump doesn't know what he's talking about. And you know who'd be hurt the most? Iowa agriculture," Bush said at a town hall in Coralville. "What does a country do when it gets thrown a 45% tariff? It retaliates. And who would it retaliate with? Agriculture, and the equipment and the technology that this great state has developed and has been sold to China. All of that is foolhardy."
