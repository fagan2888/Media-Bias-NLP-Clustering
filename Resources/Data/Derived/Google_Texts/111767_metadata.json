The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that implementing an abstract idea using a computer does not make an invention patent eligible. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\n4291550\n\nAttorneys who just won a court case arguing that Obamacare restricts premium subsidies to state-run exchanges are asking a federal court not to rehear the case at the Obama administration\u2019s behest.\n\nThe plaintiffs in Halbig v. Burwell won the case in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia with a standard three-judge panel, which determined that the text of the Affordable Care Act allows taxpayer subsidies to go only to customers of state-run exchanges. The Obama administration quickly asked the appeals court to rehear the case with all the judges participating.

As Democratic presidents have appointed a majority of D.C. court\u2019s judges, the administration is optimistic about its chances with the full court.

Burwell. The surprising split in the circuit court decisions makes it even more likely that the Supreme Court will take the case.\n\n\u201cEn banc reconsideration by the full Circuit would only delay a final resolution of this incredibly important issue,\u201d said Sam Kazman, general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonprofit that is coordinating both cases. \u201cWe submit the D.C. Circuit should either deny the government\u2019s request for en banc reconsideration or else delay acting on that request until the Supreme Court decides on whether to review the King case, which we have already appealed to that court.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of Obamacare customers have signed up in federally-run exchanges with the expectation that they\u2019re eligible for taxpayer subsidies. Were the Supreme Court to side against the Obama administration, it\u2019s not clear whether Congress would be able to easily restructure subsidies or whether millions of Americans would be liable for the full cost of their health coverage.\n\n\n\nBut the question grew even more controversial after the two court decisions were released, when bloggers discovered several tapes of the Obama administration\u2019s chief Obamacare architect, MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, admitting that only state exchanges were eligible to give out premium subsidies and reasoning that this was a strategy to convince states to build their own exchanges.
