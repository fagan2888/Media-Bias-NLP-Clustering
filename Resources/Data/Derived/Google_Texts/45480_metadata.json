Scott Walker on Tuesday, she\u2019ll owe tremendous thanks to a union group fighting for an increase in the state minimum wage.\n\nBut some political and legal experts say there\u2019s no guarantee Wisconsin will see a higher minimum wage if Burke is elected.\n\nAlthough Burke has said she supports raising the hourly minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 in three steps, Wisconsin\u2019s governor generally can authorize a pay hike only if the legislature first passes a bill that calls for it, according to Marquette University political science professor John McAdams.\n\nBut the legislature, under a Republican majority for the past several years, hasn\u2019t been receptive to overtures about increasing the minimum wage. The GOP is expected to keep control of the Assembly and Senate after Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cUnless the Democrats take the Assembly and the Senate and Burke wins the governorship \u2026 the state is not going to have a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum wage,\u201d McAdams said.\n\nBut Wisconsin Jobs Now, which has received at least $2.5 million from Service Employees International Union organizations since 2011, is trying to skirt the legislature by claiming the Walker administration is violating a 1913 state law that requires the minimum wage to be \u201cnot less than a living wage.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Jobs Now and three low-wage workers filed a lawsuit, Oct. 27, against Walker in Dane County Circuit Court to try to force him to unilaterally raise the minimum wage. Walker repeatedly has said he\u2019s opposed to an increase and instead wants to focus on creating jobs that pay two or three times $7.25 an hour.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development on Oct. 6 rejected complaints for a higher minimum wage from the SEIU front group and close to 100 workers because the state agency found \u201cno reasonable cause to believe that the wages paid to the complainants are not a living wage.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the complainants who are arguing the minimum wage is not a living wage are making more than the minimum wage\u2014up to $15.07 an hour,\u201d DWD spokesman John Dipko said.\n\n\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Mary Burke defeats Republican Gov.
