1. You watch movies with the grandkids on your iPad while entertaining them with stories about the "old days," when you drove to a video store to choose a VHS.

2. You introduce them to Elvis Presley and Aretha Franklin, but dance with them to Justin Timberlake and Katy Perry.

3. You praise the heroine of The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen, while you emphasize (and demonstrate) that real girls and boys can be strong and amazing too.

4. You are up on the modern kids' favorite books like Dork Diaries, but you read them classics such as A Wrinkle in Time.
