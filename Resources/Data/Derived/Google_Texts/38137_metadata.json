The only deals being announced in the Oil Patch, they say, are getting done mostly because of necessity.\n\n\u201cMany are mergers that involve two companies with financial challenges trying to see if two plus two could possibly equal five,\u201d said Steve Davis, an energy M&A partner at Akin Gump in Houston. \u201cThere are a lot of companies that have a lot of money and kept their powder dry but are now looking for good buying opportunities.\u201d\n\nBogged down in details\n\nLawyers and bankers say the oil and gas deals that are closing are significantly more complex and taking more negotiations to get both sides to agree.\n\n\u201cSellers are finally willing to consider transactions at these lower prices as long as they eventually get to share some of the upside,\u201d said Vinson & Elkins partner Steve Gill. \u201cI think the fall is going to be red hot. We are going to see a lot of deal proposals after Labor Day.\u201d\n\nThe oil and gas pipeline market, however, has not been affected by the downturn in prices.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot of infrastructure that needs to be built, and these companies have access to a lot of cash to make acquisitions,\u201d said David Taylor, a partner at Locke Lord in Houston.\n\nThe largest transaction of the year so far came in January when Dallas-based pipeline giant Energy Transfer Partners acquired Regency Partners, another Dallas master limited partnership, for $18 billion.\n\nBoth ETP and Regency were already controlled by Dallas billionaire Kelcy Warren, who merged the companies to bring them under one corporate umbrella.\n\nThe top 20\n\nLast year, more than half of the 20 largest corporate deals involved Texas oil and gas exploration and production companies \u2014 compared with just four of the top 20 transactions this year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a strong belief that when the hedges that oil companies currently have in place roll off and the banks complete their fall redetermination of the value of oil companies\u2019 borrowing bases, we are going to see a lot of activity,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe oil companies will need capital and to lower their debt, and private equity firms will move in making strategic acquisitions.\u201d\n\nSome oil and gas companies need to either raise money soon through a joint venture with a private equity firm or face bankruptcy, said William Snyder, who heads the national bankruptcy and restructuring practice group at Deloitte in Dallas.\n\n\u201cThere are several companies that can either kick the can down the road or kick the bucket,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cThe banks are going to bend over backwards to extend debt because the same banks are holding the hedges, and, in many cases, the hedges are more valuable than the looming liabilities.\n\n\u201cThe private equity firms have billions and billions and billions of dollars, but the deals just aren\u2019t there yet,\u201d he said.\n\nPrivate equity firms\n\nTom Harris, a corporate partner at Haynes and Boone in Dallas, said private equity firms are flush with cash and eager to put the money to work.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a lot of private equity firms that are based here in Texas but are looking for good deals in Texas but also outside the state,\u201d Harris said. \u201cMost of the private equity funds seek good management teams and solid growth potential.\u201d\n\nThe best example came in June when Dallas-based Lone Star Funds purchased New York real estate firm Home Properties for $7.6 billion. It is the fifth-largest deal of 2015 involving Texas-based businesses.\n\nScott Parel, a corporate partner at Sidley Austin in Dallas, said non-energy M&A is keeping lawyers and bankers busy in Texas and across the country.\n\n\u201cEveryone agrees that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding the Affordable Care Act will lead to a significant number of mergers and acquisitions in the health care space,\u201d Parel said. \u201cWe are also seeing a ton of consolidation in the semiconductor and chip space.\u201d\n\nParel points to NXP Semiconductors\u2019 purchase of Austin-based Freescale Semiconductor for $15.9 billion in March.\n\nThe biggest deals\n\nThe 10 largest M&A deals involving Texas companies announced in the first half of 2015\n\nValue (billions of dollars) Buyer (headquarters) Seller (headquarters) Law firms involved 18 Energy Transfer Partners (Dallas) Regency Energy Partners (Dallas) Latham & Watkins; Baker Botts; Akin Gump 7.6 Lone Star Funds (Dallas) Home Properties (Rochester, N.Y.)
