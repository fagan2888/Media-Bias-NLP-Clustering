They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention, saying each letter aloud: \u201cR-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r.\u201d The words \u201creactive attachment disorder\u201d are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith, my neighbor who is a psychiatrist, offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages, and she mentioned the disorder. She wasn't suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs, but she\u2019d said it was a well-known problem with children who\u2019d been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the '80s and '90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking, Shut up, Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldn't be an issue. Then, when I raised concerns with Dr. Traister about Julia\u2019s elusive but controlling behavior when she was a toddler, he also mentioned reactive attachment disorder. Did I want a referral to a therapist, he wanted to know.\n\nNo, I wanted to be like the other mothers sitting in his waiting room, worrying about a sniffle. Strangers tell me I have the most adorable, precocious, confident child. How can I explain that at home this child is elusive, emotionally closed off, and defiant? Now I remember something he said: The signs of reactive attachment disorder usually reveal themselves fully when a child reaches five- or six-years-old and they start having trouble in school settings. But when is it too late for a relationship to establish or to reestablish? My daughter was cut off at birth from nurturing and love. There was no one there to soothe her. Just because I want to love her doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll let me\u2014or let anyone. I retrain my eyes on the computer screen. There are scores of hits on \u201creactive attachment disorder.\u201d I could scroll for days and there would still be things to read. I click through to the Mayo Clinic website. It says: Reactive attachment disorder is a rare but serious condition in which infants and young children don\u2019t establish healthy bonds with parents or caregivers. A child with reactive attachment disorder is typically neglected, abused, or orphaned. Reactive attachment disorder develops because the child\u2019s basic needs for comfort, affection, and nurturing aren't met, and loving, caring attachments with others are never established. This may permanently change the child\u2019s growing brain, hurting the ability to establish future relationships. Another source says, \"The core feature [of reactive attachment disorder] is severely inappropriate social relating, which can manifest in two ways: 1. Indiscriminate and excessive attempts to receive comfort and affection from any available adult, even relative strangers. 2. Extreme reluctance to initiate or accept comfort and affection, even from familiar adults, especially when distressed.\" Bingo. I've often seen this behavior in Julia: She wants to be in control, and she\u2019s more interested in manipulating than in truly relating. In public, Julia is the waving beauty queen, the mayor of wherever, the cheerful, friendly, squeezable, adorable mascot. She runs to adult strangers, hugs them, works the room. She solicits their attention and wraps them around her tiny, agile fingers. She\u2019s good at it. As for children, she shows little interest in them.\n\nStrangers or fleeting caretakers tell me I have the most adorable, delicious, precocious, confident child. Some say she\u2019s the most adorable, delicious, precocious, confident child they've ever encountered. I nod and smile and pretend to share their sentiment, but I keep my thoughts to myself. How can I explain to a stranger that at home this child is distant, elusive, emotionally closed off, and defiant? What stranger will not say, or at least think silently, Really? I don\u2019t see that. It must be you because she\u2019s not like that with me. But the list I\u2019m looking at is uncanny. If I had been asked to describe Julia, this is the list I would have come up with independently. The child is \u201csuperficially charming and engaging, particularly among strangers she feels she can manipulate.\u201d Next, the lists say the child \u201cdoesn't have close friends.\u201d One day, my husband Ricky saw I was trying to play \u201cdolls\u201d with Julia, but I couldn't get her to role-play. He\u2019d casually said, \u201cMaybe she doesn't know how to play with someone else.\u201d At the time I thought it must be me. Maybe I didn't have my heart in it and Julia sensed it. I realize now Ricky\u2019s was a brilliant observation. Julia can keep herself entertained, perhaps longer than a \u201cnormal\u201d four-year-old, but the only way she can \u201cplay\u201d with someone else is to direct or orchestrate. It is never give-and-take, never back-and-forth. Ricky thinks Julia chatters constantly to soothe herself. She manufactures noise because she fears her inner world. \u201cDoesn't make eye contact. Has a severe need to control everything and everyone. Is hypervigilant. Is hyperactive. Is lazy performing tasks. Has trouble understanding cause and effect. Has poor impulse control. Chatters incessantly.\u201d Uncanny. I\u2019m often asked by a teacher or babysitter, \u201cDoes she ever stop talking?\u201d I smile because they think Julia is simply a chatty, precocious child. But it\u2019s not like that. She chatters from the moment she wakes to the moment sleep steals her from her worn-out vocal chords. She chatters incessantly at the table, in the car, while she\u2019s playing. She escalates the chatter when Ricky and I start to have a conversation or when the phone rings and I answer it. She uses the chatter to control her environment.\n\nRicky has a theory about it. He thinks Julia chatters constantly to soothe herself, to make herself feel present. He thinks silence and stillness scare her because she\u2019s afraid of her internal thoughts. Afraid to be, not by herself, but with herself. She manufactures noise because she fears her inner world. Then, when Ricky and I try to have a pointed conversation with Julia, she will say \u201cWhat? What?\u201d and avert her eyes. She pretends not to hear the question. She turns the exchange into a power play. I return to the list on my screen. So far, the first 18 traits are a perfect match. But then I see other characteristics that absolutely don\u2019t describe Julia. She is not \u201ccruel to animals.\u201d She has not shown any \u201cfascination with fire, blood, and gore or an interest in weapons.\u201d She is not \u201cself-destructive,\u201d and even though she does not take care of her possessions herself, nor shows any affection or pride of ownership for a favorite toy or teddy bear, she\u2019s not intentionally destructive in our house. Nobody has suspected she has any \u201cdevelopmental or learning delays\u201d and she doesn't \u201csteal or lie.\u201d Some psychologists believe that reactive attachment disorder is a legitimate dysfunction that affects children whose maternal bonds were severed or grossly compromised early on. Others debunk it and say it\u2019s a made-up diagnosis. But those who treat it as a viable disorder say a child\u2019s brain gets rewired when her basic needs have not been met or are screwed with. They say the brain actually changes physiologically when children suffer this kind of deprivation. Parents going through the adoption process are warned that a child who has begun life in an orphanage may be delayed. Ricky and I had steeled ourselves for the likelihood that Julia would need extra time to sit, crawl, walk, speak, potty train. But Julia, a Lilliputian Olympian, hasn't missed a cue. She sat up on her own days after we brought her home. She crawled shortly after that. She walked at 12 months, ran a minute later. She started making words at one year.\n\nShe potty trained herself\u2014and I mean herself\u2014within a week of her second birthday. Her teeth grew in before many of the other toddlers\u2019 teeth did in her playgroup, though the front ones were rotten from decay and lack of calcium. She has never been challenged in motor skills or coordination or cognitive ability. Julia\u2019s been on the fast track. The only \u201cdelay\u201d she had was growing in her silky, wheat-colored mop. She was bald until 18 months, but I wasn't too worried. I bought her cute hats. At every turn, I told myself that this child is okay\u2014she must be okay. She\u2019s met every milestone. At the same time, she was detached. When I\u2019m sick like the dickens, Julia shows no concern or empathy. As she got older, she showed constant opposition to everything, anything. She has a dire need to be in control. If I ask Julia to bring me something, say a book, she makes me wait and wait. She enjoys hearing a second request and then a third, more impatient one. When I lose patience and get up and get the book myself, she smirks. Children like Julia don't feel punished during a time-out\u2014they are relieved. It vindicates their belief that they are alone in this world. Now I understand. Kids with RAD are extremely challenged when it comes to connecting cause and effect, but there\u2019s another explanation, too. Julia has a history of hurt we can\u2019t erase. She\u2019s been with us for three years and four months, but she subconsciously knows what it\u2019s like to slip permanently from her mother\u2019s arms. She understands the dizzying tumble from warmth and security. She remembers, no doubt, what it\u2019s like to lie in a crib and wonder who, if anyone, will attend to her needs and when. Then, one day, a man and a woman showed up, put her in a yellow snowsuit, spirited her away in the dark night, and then took her on something called a plane. And although these people who took her away had the very best intentions and thought this little child must realize how lucky she is to have escaped life in an orphanage, she must have been lying in that unfamiliar crib contemplating, What will happen next?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Learning how to bond with my daughter, who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone, has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder.", "author": "Tina Traster", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Learning how to bond with my daughter, who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone, has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder.", "title": "The Elusive, Manipulative Adopted Child", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/06/RTR3L3GR/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/reactive-attachment-disorder/372259/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb693\"", "article_summary": "Then, when I raised concerns with Dr. Traister about Julia\u2019s elusive but controlling behavior when she was a toddler, he also mentioned reactive attachment disorder.\nI hold down the shift key and type the words with intention, saying each letter aloud: \u201cR-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r.\u201d The words \u201creactive attachment disorder\u201d are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace.\nThere are scores of hits on \u201creactive attachment disorder.\u201d I could scroll for days and there would still be things to read.\nA child with reactive attachment disorder is typically neglected, abused, or orphaned.\nAnother source says, \"The core feature [of reactive attachment disorder] is severely inappropriate social relating, which can manifest in two ways: 1."}
