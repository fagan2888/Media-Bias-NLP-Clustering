In Utah, one of few states where the issue remains in play, the legislature adjourned empty handed, but is still holding discussions.\n\nIn Montana, all bets are off after a week of wild politics.\n\n\"This will be the last chance,\" said Dick Brown, president of the Association of Montana Health Care Providers, noting that when legislators in his state go home in a few weeks, they will not return for two years.\n\n\"Who knows what happens then,\" he said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Bill Cotterell in Tallahassee, Fla.; Editing by David Adams and Andre Grenon)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Letitia Stein", "Author": "Letitia Stein", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "A legislative push in Montana to extend Obamacare health coverage to the working poor advanced on Thursday after a last-minute reprieve thanks to a procedural play by supporters, even as similar efforts in other conservative states are flagging.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150410&t=2&i=1039259624&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEB39031", "title": "Obamacare push powers ahead in Montana, fading in other states", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
