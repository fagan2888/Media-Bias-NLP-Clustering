In the spirit of bipartisanship, let us conservatives work hard to help Maddow, Sharpton, Matthews, et al. enjoy a similar ratings boost in 2016.\n\nAnd for us conservatives, it looks like we no longer need to ask even most Democrats \u201chow the hope-changey stuff is working out\u201d for them. By now, with the apparent exceptions of Obama, Reid, Pelosi, and the talking heads at the aforementioned cable network, they know.\n\nPity, then, the Democrats (but please, not too much; remember how they treated us over the past six years), for 2014 was the year that none of their go-to tactics or issues worked for them. Not the vaunted Democratic get-out-the-vote ground game\u2026\n\n\u2026 not immigration\u2026\n\n\u2026 not even the \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nAnd all of which failures have left a lot of Democrats scratching their heads and asking each other, \u201cWha\u2019 happened?\u201d\n\nWhat happened was a second Obamaesque \u201cshellacking,\u201d even more severe than the first one, in 2010. Apparently, someone forgot to tell the electorate that the fist is supposed to go inside the velvet glove, not the other way around.\n\nAs for what caused such shellacking, the explanation, for this writer, is a simple one of supply and demand \u2013 namely, in this case, a surplus of shellac and a shortage of tar and feathers.\n\nLiberals, of course, will disagree, and indeed, it did not take long, as Tuesday night progressed, the election results came in, and the true dimension of the beating increasingly became known, for the liberal blogosphere to erupt into a cacophony of rationalizations, recriminations and lamentations \u2013 your basic circular firing squad, but this time with Barack Obama in the middle.\n\nWhat one should not expect from our dear friends on the left is the truth, which is that, on Tuesday, the voters rejected not just President Obama or any individual candidate, but liberalism itself \u2013 statism, political correctness, and multiculturalism at home; peace through appeasement abroad; big government, \u00e0 la Reagan, as the solution to, not the cause of, our problems \u2013 the whole philosophical enchilada. Obama ran as a centrist, he\u2019s governing as a hardcore ideological leftist, and Tuesday\u2019s election results should be read as nothing less than a collective cry of no m\u00e1s.\n\nNot that most Americans\u2019 aversion to liberalism and the resultant problems for Democrats is anything new. Does anyone remember the Democratic Leadership Council? For those who don\u2019t:\n\nThe Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) was a non-profit 501(c)(4) corporation founded in 1985 that, upon its formation, argued the United States Democratic Party should shift away from the leftward turn it took in the late 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The DLC hailed President Bill Clinton as proof of the viability of Third Way politicians and as a DLC success story.\n\nOr to state the matter more plainly, a group of moderate Democrats created the DLC in order to \u201cmove the party to the center\u201d and convince the American people that not only that the DLC\u2019s founders and members had rejected liberalism, but that most of the Democratic Party had, too.\n\nAnd it worked. Bill Clinton was, indeed, a \u201cDLC success story,\u201d right up until the moment, shortly after taking office, when he betrayed the voters who had just elected him, by governing from the left. Conversely, he reclaimed the centrist mantle when, after his liberal policies, including Obamacare\u2019s predecessor, Hillarycare, cost him the House and Senate in the \u201994 midterms, he retuned to the center. And stayed there.\n\nThe same strategy worked for Barack Obama, for a brief, shining moment, until he, too, governed as a liberal. But, unlike Bill Clinton, not only did Obama not move to the center, after being \u201cshellacked,\u201d in his words, in the 2010 midterms. He doubled down on his liberal proclivities, with predictable results: the implosion of his presidency and the tarnishing, perhaps for generations to come, of the Democratic brand. The question of why the American people re-elected such a flawed and incompetent president I leave to the reader. But that Obama is a flawed and incompetent president is undeniable, as is the damage he has done to his party.\n\nHubert Humphrey, Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern, and Michael Dukakis lost their presidential bids and, Humphrey excepted, lost badly, for no other reason than that they were/are liberals. Bill Clinton was elected precisely because he ran as a centrist and remained a political force to be reckoned with whenever and as long as he governed that way. Obama, on the other hand, because he refused to move to the center, was an effective president only for the brief period that he had a House majority and a filibuster-proof Senate majority.\n\nAssuming, then, that the predicted Democratic debacle comes to pass, the question, \u201cpost-shellacking,\u201d becomes this: where does the Democratic Party go from here?\n\nIt goes back to square one. America has rejected liberalism. Repeatedly. Only when Democrats were able to convince the American people that the party had rejected liberalism and moved to the center were they able, once more, to win a presidential election. Only by actually governing from the center was Bill Clinton able to win a second term and to govern effectively.\n\nMost important, only by receiving the American people\u2019s message, loud and clear, when he strayed from the centrist path, was he able to enjoy a successful presidency, despite several scandals, and \u2013 most important \u2013 set the stage for the election of future Democratic presidents. Sadly, the statement for which Bill Clinton will be most remembered is, \u201cI did not have sex with that woman.\u201d But the most important thing he said \u2013 astounding, coming from a Democrat \u2013 was, \u201cThe era of big government is over.\u201d\n\nOne would be hard-pressed to understate what Bill Clinton, Joe Lieberman, and the Democratic Leadership Council did for the Democratic Party \u2013 to restore the brand to the point where Democrats would, once more, be viable presidential candidates.\n\nAnd now, thanks to Barack Obama, the Democrats must start all over. For the Democratic Party, it\u2019s back to square one, where Democrats must, once again, convince the American people that they are not the party of Obama, Reid, and Pelosi, but the party of\u2026well\u2026whom?\n\nAnd any Democratic presidential candidate, going forward, who campaigns as a centrist will have to convince the American people that he will govern that way if elected.\n\nCan it be done? Time will tell. But one thing is certain: the task, the second time around, will be much, much harder.\n\nFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice\u2026\n\nFollow Gene Schwimmer on Twitter.
