More than 1,000 patients from eight National Council of La Raza affiliated organizations in several states took surveys between June and August 2013. Patients were between 18 and 64 years old and self-identified as Hispanic/Latino.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\n\u2022 Sixty percent of those who responded were told by a doctor that they have a chronic disease.\n\n\u2022 Of those surveyed, 25 percent had visited a hospital emergency room for a chronic related disease in the last 12 months.\u2022\n\n\u2022 About 75 percent of survey respondents were either overweight or obese.\n\n\u201cThe participants of the survey are accessing health care but to manage a chronic disease is a complicated or complex problem that needs more than 15 minutes of interaction with a provider,\u201d said Manuela McDonough, associate director of the Institute for Hispanic Health at the National Council of La Raza. \u201cOur affiliates are doing the best job they can. But they are understaffed and underfunded and can\u2019t meet the demands of this growing population.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of those surveyed were patients of the Southern California-based AltaMed, which runs a network of federally funded community clinics in Los Angeles and Orange counties.\n\nThe community clinics are geographically located in underserved areas, but income, poverty and cultural beliefs about mammograms, for example, contribute to the disparity gaps, regardless of health insurance coverage, said Dr. Martin Serota, chief medical officer at AltaMed.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t close the gap, but it means we have to work harder to close the gap,\u201d Serota said.\n\nSerota and others agreed that even as more Latinos attain health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, it won\u2019t make a difference if they can\u2019t or won\u2019t access care. At the same time, community centers need to meet the demands.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to staff accordingly, but whether we\u2019ll be able to keep up with demands is unclear,\u201d Serota said. \u201cThere are certain positions that are hard to fill. We struggle to find bilingual RNs, bilingual social workers.\u201d\n\nHowever, providers are optimistic about the Affordable Care Act, despite the challenges, he said.\n\n\u201cAt our clinics every day, we have patients with insurance who are newly engaged in their health care,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the recommendations made in the report is to encourage and support the work of promotoras, or health promoters in communities that can offer education and find services for those who need helping managing chronic conditions, Serota said.\n\nThe report and other issues will be among the topics discussed at the National Council of La Raza\u2019s annual conference, which begins on Saturday at the La Convention Center. A town hall discussion on the uninsured will begin at 3 p.m. Tuesday at the Los Angeles Convention Center, 1201 S.
