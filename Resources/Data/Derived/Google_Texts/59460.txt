OLATHE, Kan. -- You wouldn't expect to find your primary care doctor, dentist and a psychologist all in the same office, but that model of care is catching on.

Call it a "one-stop shop." Health Partnership Clinic in Olathe has long provided dental care along with medical care for the under-insured and uninsured. Now a third type of care has seamlessly been added.

Dr. Danielle Johnson sits just outside the exam rooms. She's a psychologist who can help patients dealing with a variety of mental health issues. She said being in the medical clinic reduces the stigma.

"And it's not a big deal to say hey, Dr. Johnson's gonna come in and talk to you next about some of the stress you've been going through. It's such an easy hand-off. Patients seem really open to it," said Dr. Johnson.

The psychologist can also see dental patients.

"We're able to contact Dr. Johnson and have her come in on the spot to help with anxiety issues," said Dr. Ellen Berry, the chief dental officer.

Dr. Johnson isn't just helping people who are afraid of the dental drill.

"They may complain of a toothache over and over, and it turns out it's anxiety or depression, stress management issues that manifest itself physiologically," she said.

Dr. Johnson knows that by addressing mental health, physical health can improve. It's a model of care that the federal government is supporting. Health Partnership Clinic just received funds through the Affordable Care Act to hire two more behavioral health consultants.

Anthony Dillard, a patient of the clinic, said the concept sounds good to him.

"I'm grateful for that. Maybe not for myself, but for somebody else who might need it," said Dillard.

It's care for the whole person in one place.

Dr. Johnson said this model of care is spreading to private practices, too. She said the office of her child's pediatrician now has a psychologist.
