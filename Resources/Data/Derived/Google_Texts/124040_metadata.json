A newcomer might have thought they would come to blows, but Claire knew better. She wiped a faded linoleum counter. The only thing that would lead to violence was the tip.\n\n\u201cKnow this,\u201d Chet Bjertle said, sticking a finger in his opponent\u2019s face. \u201cYou ignore the worker at your own risk. Look what happened to the Romanovs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe who?\u201d asked Charles.\n\n\u201cThe Romanovs! The rich swine who were butchered by the decent working people of Russia!\u201d\n\n\u201cDecent? I have an answer for all you \u2018decent people\u2019.\u201d Charles Hathaway pointed his own finger. \u201cMachine guns!\u201d\n\n\u201cMolotov cocktails!\u201d\n\n\u201cTanks!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe guillotine!\u201d\n\nSo it would continue, Claire knew, until one or the other brought up Obama. Then the fur would fly. Because Obama represented all that was holy to Progressives. And to Charles, a devoted Republican, he represented the grinning embodiment of pie-in-your face liberalism. America\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cOh, Miss,\u201d Charles Hathaway called. (Miss? Miss? She was no \u201cMiss\u201d. She was Claire Kitsme, waitress, lover, student of life, and most of all, Poet. What she hadn\u2019t given for art! What she hadn\u2019t\u2026 oh, it was all too much.) \u201cOh, Miss, could you settle a little bet between us?\u201d\n\nClaire walked over. \u201cTell me something,\u201d Charles asked. \u201cDid you buy your health insurance through Obamacare?\u201d\n\nShe hesitated. This man would ask that, this Republican. He dressed in a new suit, sans tie. He also went without something else: A job. \u201cTell me,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou\u2019re a waitress. You make, what? Ninety, a hundred thousand a year? Obamacare is now the law. You would be breaking the law if you failed to buy insurance. I would have to turn you in. So would Chet. Admit it, Chet. You would have to turn her in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Chet conceded. \u201cBut Obama care is a good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBear with me. She would be breaking the law. She would be a criminal. They would arrest her, and frisk her.\u201d Charles began to warm to his subject. \u201cShe would be dressed into an orange jumpsuit, and made to remove her jewelry. Then she would be placed in a cell with tattooed hardened criminals who \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Claire said. \u201cI have insurance. I went on the exchange and bought it. So there.\u201d\n\nCharles seemed disappointed. Chet grinned like a Cheshire cat. \u201cYou see? Obamacare works!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Charles said. \u201cBut are you happy with it?\u201d\n\nClaire frowned. Happy? Well, she had immediately gone to a doctor, presenting her new insurance card. Migraines. Artists have migraines. After being poked and prodded, X-rayed and CT scanned, the doctor suggested rest, yoga, and more spinach in her diet. And please pay this amount: $4,890.34.\n\nBut what is this? she protested. I have Obamacare!\n\nYes. And you also have a $5,000 deductible. Pay at the desk.\n\nA $5,000 DEDUCTIBLE!\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for your answer, Miss,\u201d Charles said. But Chet, apparently not wanting to take any chances, carefully palmed a twenty under the table. \u201cYou really Like Obamacare, don\u2019t you?\u201d he said, rolling the bill between his fingers.\n\nBack at the clinic Claire had demanded an explanation: What would Obamacare actually pay for? What malady would cost more than five grand?\n\nThe doctor thought carefully. \u201cAn amputation?\u201d he suggested.\n\nClaire was still paying off the bill. It was like her current boyfriend, disappointing and omnipresent. She watched Charles\u2019s hand. The twenty he fingered looked pretty good. Good enough. \u201cI love Obamacare!\u201d, she quipped, and marched away.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Chet announced, triumphantly, standing. Their voices faded as they took the argument outside, to Chet\u2019s Range Rover. Claire picked up their plates.\n\nTwenty-eight cents, she sighed. It seemed they had both won.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pagosadailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16LogoPDP_120.jpg"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOh, Miss,\u201d Charles Hathaway called.\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for your answer, Miss,\u201d Charles said.\n\u201cMachine guns!\u201d\u201cMolotov cocktails!\u201d\u201cTanks!\u201d\u201cThe guillotine!\u201dSo it would continue, Claire knew, until one or the other brought up Obama.\nBack at the clinic Claire had demanded an explanation: What would Obamacare actually pay for?\nTwo men sat shouting at each other and pounding a table in The Electric Owl, a crowded Twenty-Third Avenue coffee bar."}
