The nation\u2019s transportation and pedestrian infrastructure \u201cis generally ill-suited to those who cannot or choose not to drive, isolating older adults from friends and family.\u201d\n\nNot only that, \u201cdisconnects between housing programs and the health care system put many older adults with disabilities or long-term care needs at risk of premature institutionalization.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, many older adults simply can\u2019t afford to be old. Some stats and facts:\n\nThe typical homeowner over 65 can afford in-home assistance for roughly 6 to 9 years of assisted living\n\nThe typical renter over 65 can only afford two months of support\n\nIn 2012, one-third of adults age 50 and older paid more than 30 percent of their income for housing, including nearly 9.6 million who paid more than 50 percent of their income for housing\n\nHigh housing costs cause low-income older adults to cut back significantly on food, health care and retirement savings\n\n\n\nRead the full report (PDF), checkout \u201c5 Essential Facts\u201d from the report, see the infographic up close and visit an interactive map showing how the U.S. population has aged significantly over the past two decades. Following are a few examples of county data for people age 50 and older. You can look up the information for where you live.\n\nCheyenne County, Kan. (41.4 percent in 1990 vs. 50 percent in 2010)\n\nShelby County, Ill. (33 percent in 1990 vs. 40.5 in 2010)\n\nChoctaw County, Ala. (27.8 in 1990 vs. 40.2 in 2010)\n\nSuffolk County (Long Island), N.Y. (25.1 in 1990 vs. 33.3 in 2010)\n\nMendocino County, Calif., 26.7 in 1990 vs. 39.4 in 2010)\n\n\n\nAlthough aging is inevitable, a dour outlook needn\u2019t be. Explains the report: \u201cWhile there are significant challenges ahead, the potential is there for older adults to have a higher quality of life than ever before, and for communities to be increasingly livable and vibrant as a result. But effective action will require concerted efforts at all levels of government as well as by the private and nonprofit sectors, and through the advocacy of older adults themselves.\u201d\n\nAdds Lisa Marsh Ryerson, president of AARP Foundation: \u201cAs the report points out, promising approaches have already emerged, and they are giving us a path for moving forward. This report is far from doom and gloom. Yes, we have serious issues to tackle, but there is still time to do so, if we begin acting now.\u201d\n\nVisit aarp.org/livable and aarp.org/age-friendly to learn how AARP is working to help towns, cities and even states become more age-friendly and livable for people of all ages.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nMelissa Stanton is a project manager and editor on the AARP Livable Communities Team.\n\nSubscribe to the Livable Communities Great Places Blog by email or RSS feed\n\nFollow us on Twitter @LivableCmnty\n\nLearn more about livable communities at AARP.org/livable\n\nStay Informed: Sign up for the Livable Communities Newsletter", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "We\u2019ve known for a long time that the U.S. population is rapidly aging due to increased longevity and the boomer population (all of whom will be 50-plus this year).
