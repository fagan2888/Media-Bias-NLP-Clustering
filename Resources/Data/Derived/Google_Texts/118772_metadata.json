The first games to be dropped from a team's record are non-conference losses, followed by non-conference wins. Under no circumstances can conference games be dropped.\n\nThere are numerous ties in these projections. We do not try to project the winner of ties because it is impossible to accurately project the winner of a coin flip. Instead we believe it is best to show you all the possible scenarios. That is why you will see multiple teams listed in some seeds and some teams listed in multiple places.\n\nTo report errors, please email Nick Stevens at nstevens@wral.com.\n\nUpdated: Feb. 20, 3:35 PM\n\n4-A East\n\n(1) Millbrook (22-0)\n\n(32) East Chapel Hill/Overhills/New Bern/South Central (11-11)\n\n(16) Lumberton/Broughton/East Wake (17-5)\n\n(17) Apex (16-6)\n\n(8) Scotland (16-6)\n\n(25) Leesville Road/Laney (14-8)\n\n(9) D.H.
