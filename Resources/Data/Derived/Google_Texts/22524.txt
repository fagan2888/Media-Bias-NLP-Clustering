In something of a surprise, Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, one of the longest-serving Republican senators, announced Friday that he will run for re-election next year.

The senator first shared the news in an interview with Gannet.

The move sets up a contentious re-election fight between Cochran and conservative groups that have made him a prime target in the Republican primary. Cochran, who turns 76 this weekend, will face 41-year-old rising conservative star and state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who has already snagged endorsements from the Club for Growth and the Senate Conservatives Fund.

"Republicans in Mississippi have a real choice for the United States Senate this year. They can vote for Senator Cochran, or they can vote for a more fiscally conservative alternative who is dedicated to limited government and passing policies that will increase economic growth," Club for Growth President Chris Chocola said in a statement.

"The Club for Growth PAC believes that State Senator Chris McDaniel is a constitutional conservative who will fight to repeal ObamaCare, cut spending, and stop President Obamaâ€™s reckless agenda. The Club for Growth PAC looks forward to strongly supporting his candidacy for the United States Senate."

According to the latest campaign filings, Cochran has raised less than $1 million for his re-election campaign, prompting speculation that he was leaning toward retirement.

Now, he becomes a huge target for conservatives, and joins Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and at least five other GOP incumbents facing a primary challenge.

Before the practice was banned in 2010, Cochran was known in the Senate as someone who steered a lot of federal money to Mississippi through earmarks. Part of McDaniel's campaign will be to emphasize the anti-spending attitude that has prevailed in the Tea Party since its inception.

Right after news broke of Cochran's announcement, McDaniel's official account tweeted this:
