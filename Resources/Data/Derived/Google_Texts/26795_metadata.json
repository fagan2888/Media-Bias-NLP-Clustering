Instead of taking the affordable 7-inch tablet route a la Samsung and Google, LG have tried their best to create the best compromise possible in such a device. With an 8.3-inch display, the G Pad is both larger than most tablets yet also very portable. With better specs than a lot of tablets out there, the G Pad 8.3 seems pretty impressive on paper. With a Google Play Edition of the tablet now available, LG\u2019s vision of the hardware is a stark contrast from Google\u2019s approach with the tablet. The question is however, can LG\u2019s first tablet in a long time help them stride back into town, or is it just another device to get lost in the sea of slates available? Read on to find out in the Android Headlines review of the LG G Pad 8.3\n\nSpecs\n\nBefore we go any further, let\u2019s take a look at how the G Pad 8.3 shapes up on paper, shall we?\n\n8.3-inch 1920 x 1200 IPS Display (273 PPI)\n\n1.7 Ghz Quad-Core Snapdragon 600\n\n2GB RAM\n\n16GB of Storage, with MicroSD card slot (up to 64GB)\n\n5-megapixel rear-facing camera, 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera\n\nAndroid 4.2.2 (with update to Android 4.4 coming)\n\n216.8 x 126.5 x 8.3 mm (8.54 x 4.98 x 0.33 in)\n\n338g\n\n4,600 mAh Battery\n\nDesign\n\nOne of the more impressive things about LG\u2019s tablet is that it\u2019s not only built well, but that it looks quite nice. We\u2019re reviewing the white version of the device here and the two-tone steel/white back reminds us a lot of the HTC One\u2019s silver design. It\u2019s tasteful and LG have clearly thought about what to put where. The stereo speakers are placed in such a way that you won\u2019t cover them holding the device in either portrait or landscape or when watching a movie or YouTube, the speakers aren\u2019t covered. Unless you have massive hands, of course. When it comes to buttons and ports, LG haven\u2019t taken after the G2 and everything is in traditional places. The power and volume buttons are on the right-hand side of the device towards the top, with the headphone jack at the top of the device to the left, opposite the IR blaster. The microSD card slot is tucked away neatly at the top of the device and the microUSB port is placed sensibly at the bottom of the device in a center position. All of this is pretty boring really, but it makes the G Pad instantly usable and familiar to anyone that\u2019s used a smartphone or tablet in recent years.\n\nWe\u2019re impressed with the build of the G Pad as well, it feels solid in your hands and is nice and svelte at 8.3mm thick. The aluminum section that covers up most of the back is good-looking and it gives the device a premium edge, but it can make the device fairly slippery. It\u2019s fine as long as you\u2019re not a butterfingers and once you get used to it it\u2019s great, but this is certainly not the grippy Nexus 7. I can\u2019t speak for the black version of the G Pad, but the white version I\u2019ve been testing seems to stay clean and repel fingerprints \u2013 aside from the display, more on that later. Overall, the G Pad is an impressively built device, it looks good, feels good in your hands and LG have definitely stood out from the crowd with the build quality here.\n\nDisplay\n\nThe 8.3-inch 1920 x 1200 display on the G Pad takes up most of the display and looks brilliant doing it. It\u2019s an IPS panel and if you\u2019ve ever taken a look at LG\u20192 G2, you\u2019ll notice a similarity. Colors aren\u2019t exactly eye-popping, but they feel warm and realistic. With 273 ppi density, it\u2019s a great display for reading text and browsing the web, especially when you consider you\u2019ve got quite a bit more real estate to play with, too. Browsing desktop versions of sites looks good and watching a full movie doesn\u2019t feel terrible thanks to the display\u2019s size. As with any larger display, apps built for smartphones do tend to look a little out-of-place, but that\u2019s a minor issue and for the most part everything looked good. That includes games, which run at a fair clip thanks to the Snapdragon 600 CPU under the hood.\n\nIt\u2019s not all good however, as the display isn\u2019t overly bright. It\u2019s bright enough, and I spent most of my time with the display at 70 \u2013 80% brightness and felt it pretty bright. However, cranking the display up to 100% won\u2019t get you much more out of the display. On the white model, there\u2019s also a sort of extra bezel at work, a black \u201cgap\u201d you can see around the edges of the display. Again, this is a minor issue and we\u2019re assuming an unavoidable one for LG. For those with oily hands or just have OCD about clean gadgets \u2013 like me \u2013 then the G2 can be a little annoying as its display tends to attract fingerprints more than most.\n\nDisplays are what makes tablets, tablets and if all you\u2019re looking for is a good display, then the G Pad won\u2019t disappoint you at all.\n\nSoftware\n\nIf you\u2019ve used LG\u2019s G2, you can simply skip this part of the review as the software stack is pretty much identical. However, there are some nice touches here, some welcome, some not so much. LG\u2019s skin seems to suffer from an identity crisis. On one hand it\u2019s brilliantly customizable, yet on the other it\u2019s needlessly overwrought and clunky. Things start off pleasantly with the overall look, which you can customize to your liking in the settings.\n\nFrom changing the font, to changing the lock screen effect, changing the animations on the homescreen, the overall theme of the homescreen \u2013 you get the idea. For the most part, the G Pad can become your tablet, it\u2019s just unfortunate that these tweaks feel more like you\u2019re taming the skin than you are customizing it. No matter though, as there\u2019s a lot of options on tap to be able to customize things and change the way things act. All of the same sort of features from the G2 are here as well, such as small floating apps and quick memo, they\u2019ve all come along for the ride. Not all of them make all that much sense, but they\u2019re simple little things that can help. Sadly though, LG have taken the same baffling approach with Android\u2019s onscreen buttons as they did on the G2. You can change the order, add in a button to bring the notification shade down and more. However, there\u2019s no option to bring in the multitask button. You know, that standard button we\u2019ve been using for years now.\n\nThis bizarre shunning of standard Android practices is pretty baffling and wholly annoying. Especially if you\u2019re coming from a Nexus 7 or any other tablet that used the standard button layout. Holding the home button gets you to the multitasking menu, but it feels a little foreign at this point. Hopefully, LG will be righting this wrong when it comes to the Android 4.4 update. Still, there are some pretty nice additions to LG\u2019s skin, such as the lockscreen, which I particularly liked. Not just for its cool unlock animations but for the customizable shortcuts and overall look.\n\nSlide Aside\n\nAs with the G2 Review, we thought that slide aside was one of the better inclusions here with the LG G Pad. You can swipe with a three-finger gesture to store an app to the side to bring out quickly later on. The gesture makes more sense on a tablet and is much easier to do. It\u2019s easily the best thing about LG\u2019s skin and it\u2019s an attractive way of getting to your most used apps at any given time.\n\nPerformance\n\nWe\u2019re not huge fans of Benchmarks here at Android Headlines, or at least I\u2019m not anyway. Real world performance is far more important than some figures in a screenshot. Speaking of which, LG\u2019s G2 is one speedy tablet in general. Everyday tasks such as browsing the web, using apps and such was as fast as any high-end smartphone out there and there\u2019s little to no lag when going about such tasks. Gaming performance is, on the whole, pretty good however, there are times where the tablet stutters and frame rates drop. They soon pickup afterwards, but it\u2019s no less annoying and we\u2019re hoping the update to Android 4.4 will fix that. The Snapdragon 600 and 2GB of RAM really help put this guy above the rest and for switching from app-to-app, the G Pad is a great tablet.\n\nOverall, the G Pad 8.3 is one speedy tablet and it\u2019s definitely one of the smoothest tablet experiences we\u2019ve had with a slate to date. The lag that creeps in while gaming is somewhat annoying, but it\u2019s not terribly noticeable and the vast majority of games I tried were largely unaffected by said issue. Even with LG\u2019s fairly modified build of Android, the Snapdragon 600 here kept things running along smoothly and HD video was a pleasure to watch especially coupled with the Full HD display.\n\nBattery Life\n\nA subjective topic, battery life is what you make of it. My usage case is perhaps completely different to yours, dear reader. As such, you should take whatever I say here about battery life with a pinch of salt. After all, how I use my tablet, is not how you use your tablet. With moderate to heavy use, all on WiFi, with the brightness around 80% I only had to charge the G Pad every other night. Obviously, the less I used it, the longer it lasted. In contrast, I don\u2019t think the battery life is as good as the Nexus 7\u2019s, which is probably down to the larger display sucking up power. I wasn\u2019t displeased with the battery life here on the G Pad, but I was hardly blown away either. Looking for something that\u2019s easily manageable? The G Pad will do that for you, those looking for a real road warrior tablet though should invest in battery packs or a different tablet, sadly.\n\nCamera\n\nTablets and cameras have never been a good match and the G Pad is no exception. With no flash, there\u2019s not all that much you can do with the camera, even if you wanted to. However, it\u2019s good enough for the most part. If it\u2019s the only camera you have, and you\u2019re patient enough, it\u2019d do in a pinch. The front-facing camera is perfectly usable for 720p video calls and is better suited to real-world use than the one at the rear.\n\nSound Quality\n\nThese devices are primarily content consumption devices and the G Pad 8.3 is well-suited to such a task. Watching movies, cat videos, perverted device unboxings \u2013 whatever it is, it all sounds good with the G Pad. The speakers are really quite loud for a device of this size and as long as you don\u2019t push them to their limit, music retains a little depth to it. There\u2019s not much in the way of bass here, but you won\u2019t feel the wrath of tinny speakers here, either. It\u2019s not going to fill a sizable room, but for use with small groups or whatever, you can get some decent tunage using LG\u2019s 8.3-incher. When it\u2019s time to plug in however, things get a lot better. I tested a variety of headphones, earbuds etc with the G Pad and they all had depth, clarity and a decent amount of bass. Movie-watching is a great experience here with headphones and it\u2019ll definitely make long flights and commutes a lot easier.\n\nThe Good and The Bad\n\nGood\n\nOutstanding build quality and good looks.\n\nGreat display, with a high-resolution and brilliant viewing angles.\n\nSpeedy experience throughout Android.\n\nGood quality speakers that are louder than most.\n\nBad\n\nStill running Android 4.2.2 \u2013 c\u2019mon LG, you can do better!\n\nOccasional lag while playing games.\n\nNo multitasking button included.\n\nOverwrought UI that needs holding back.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nThe time I\u2019ve been spending with G Pad has been a lot of fun, and an overall pleasant experience. With a great build quality and a speedy Android experience, there\u2019s very little to dislike about the G Pad. Even if skins aren\u2019t your deal, I\u2019m of the opinion that they don\u2019t much matter when it comes to tablets, and there\u2019s always the Google Play Edition if you like the sound of the hardware. LG have managed to tick the right boxes without compromising and while that will cost you a little extra, it\u2019s well worth it in my opinion. The 8.3-inch Full HD display is great for watching YouTube, Netflix and general surfing. It\u2019s portable enough to take with you and yet large enough to make the most of the web and HD content. This is hopefully just the start of things for LG and the tablet market and if that\u2019s the case, this G Pad is a great start. We\u2019d recommend the G Pad to anyone looking for a better tablet that isn\u2019t too large and doesn\u2019t cost the earth.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "It's been a long time since we saw LG in the tablet market and last year's G Pad 8.3 is their ticket back into the crowded world of slates.
