Rick Danielson knew he wanted to become a pastor ever since he was a teenager. He attended conservative churches, got married, had kids and was ordained in the United Methodist Church, where he served as a pastor in New York.\n\nThe story could have ended there. Then he announced he was gay, and everything changed.\n\n\"As I was coming out, I realized there was not a place for me to be\" in the United Methodist Church, which does not typically recognize LGBT pastors or gay marriage, he said.\n\nDanielson left the church and was unsure what to do next.\n\nThen he started attending services at a United Church of Christ in New York, and the welcoming atmosphere helped inspire him once again to become a pastor.\n\nAt 3 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 25, Boulder Community United Church of Christ officially will install Danielson as its new pastor.\n\nAs the church commemorates its 50th anniversary, it also will celebrate its new pastor \u2014 and Boulder's first gay senior pastor.\n\n\"I'm pleased to be part of it,\" Danielson said. \"It's a highly educated, really committed congregation with a community focus for justice and peace.\"\n\nErv Bode, chair of the church's pastor search committee, said Danielson was the best fit for CUCC's liberal, social action-oriented congregation.\n\nCUCC is an \"open and affirming\" church, which means the congregation welcomes all people, regardless of their sexual orientation. The national UCC church supports LGBT pastors and gay marriage.\n\nBode said 70 candidates applied for the job, but Danielson's ability to connect with people both young and old is what stood out \u2014 not the fact he happened to be gay.\n\n\"His love of people is what's great,\" Bode said. \"Community is everything to us. It's in the name of our church.\"\n\nThat CUCC is open and affirming is part of why some people attend the church, so it was only natural they would consider candidates who felt the same way, Bode said.\n\nThe church had a gay interim pastor, Benjamin Reynolds, for a time in 2007.\n\nDanielson said CUCC's diversity, ecumenical interests and respect for the community is what drew him to Colorado, despite not having visited the state before he applied for the job.\n\nDanielson, who married his partner, Leroy Lewis, in September, said he's gone through many life changes on his spiritual path. He is excited about worshipping and preaching in an accepting community such as Boulder, whose faith community has a high number of people who support and welcome LGBT people and their families.\n\nYet the debate over how to treat LGBT congregants and pastors continues to rage in this country, he said.\n\nThe United Methodist Church, for example, is in heated discussion about gay marriage and the topic of LGBT clergy, Danielson said. Right now, LGBT people can attend UMC services but cannot get married in the church or become a pastor.\n\n\"It's a huge issue right now, one that is threatening to split churches,\" he said. \"I see people taking sides, when it's such a shortsighted matter.\"\n\nBoulder has several churches that welcome people to participate in all aspects of the church, including marriage or commitment ceremonies and the opportunity to become a church leader, regardless of gender or sexual identity. Among them are First Congregational Church, which was the first UCC church in Colorado to become open and affirming 27 years ago; Cairn Christian Church, a Disciples of Christ church, which is open and affirming, and First United Methodist Church, which calls itself a \"reconciling ministry.\" FUMC supports same-sex marriage and LGBT pastors, despite overarching church policies against it.\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Megan Quinn at 303-410-2649, quinnm@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/meganquinn2.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_26795369/boulder-community-united-church-christ-celebrates-first-gay-pastor-50th-anniversary", "sailthru.author": "By Megan Quinn \n \n  CameraStaff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26795369:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-02T09:32:52-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "As Boulder Community United Church of Christ commemorates its 50th anniversary, it  also celebrates its  new pastor \u2014 and Boulder's first gay senior pastor.", "title": "Megan Quinn: Boulder church celebrates first gay pastor, 50th year", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_26795369/boulder-community-united-church-christ-celebrates-first-gay-pastor-50th-anniversary", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Lifestyles", "modificationDate": "2014-11-02T09:55:58-0700", "endDate": "2024-10-24T20:12:46-0600", "news_keywords": "Lifestyles, Lifestyles news, Boulder Colorado Lifestyles news, Boulder Colorado news, Lifestyles Boulder news, Lifestyles Colorado news, US Lifestyles news, world Lifestyles news.", "byline": "By Megan QuinnCameraStaff", "pubDate": "2014-11-02T09:38:11-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-02T09:32:52-0700", "sailthru.title": "Megan Quinn: Boulder church celebrates first gay pastor, 50th year", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1024/20141024__25dcarlg~1_300.jpg", "description": "As Boulder Community United Church of Christ commemorates its 50th anniversary, it  also celebrates its  new pastor \u2014 and Boulder's first gay senior pastor.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_26795369/boulder-community-united-church-christ-celebrates-first-gay-pastor-50th-anniversary", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "As Boulder Community United Church of Christ commemorates its 50th anniversary, it  also celebrates its  new pastor \u2014 and Boulder's first gay senior pastor.", "title": "Megan Quinn: Boulder church celebrates first gay pastor, 50th year"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1024/20141024__25dcarlg~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea6f\"", "article_summary": "At 3 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 25, Boulder Community United Church of Christ officially will install Danielson as its new pastor.\nAs the church commemorates its 50th anniversary, it also will celebrate its new pastor \u2014 and Boulder's first gay senior pastor.\nHe attended conservative churches, got married, had kids and was ordained in the United Methodist Church, where he served as a pastor in New York.\nThe United Methodist Church, for example, is in heated discussion about gay marriage and the topic of LGBT clergy, Danielson said.\nThe national UCC church supports LGBT pastors and gay marriage."}
