She makes efficient use of social media by checking Twitter while she is on the subway or when she's waiting in line.\n\nHealth providers must rush to take advantage of social media opportunities now or get left behind, according to Business Insider. \"Choosing not to engage the healthcare consumer where they regularly interact electronically is a tacit surrender to more forward thinking stakeholders,\" wrote David Francis of RBC Capital Markets.\n\nUse of social media platforms gives providers a whole new way to provide the public with medical education, Loeb said. It allows them to advocate for techniques and new ideas in a public forum and can even help providers market their services to the public in targeted, specific ways.\n\nProviders, she said, must follow their organization's social media policies, never offer what could be construed as medical advice and always maintain their professionalism. \"The potential utility continues to expand in ways we may not have even imagined two or three years ago,\" she said. \"I think the sky is the limit.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the HealthCareDive article\n\n- read the Business Insider article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHospitals' commitment to social media grows\n\nHow to use social media to enhance customer service\n\nAnother reason to use Twitter: Tweets can predict emergency room visits\n\nHealthcare professionals flock to Twitter\n\n3 reasons healthcare pros should join Twitter\n\nHow Twitter can help track the spread of influenza\n\nHow social media can combat chronic disease\n\nHospitals turn to social media for 'virtual' patient advice\n\nPatients choose hospitals based on social media\n\nSocial media abuse: Clinicians reveal patient info online", "article_metadata": {"description": "Social media can be a minefield, but platforms such as\u00a0 Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Twitter can also provide physicians and other healthcare professionals with an array of previously unheard-of advantages and the ability to confer with other professionals--no matter where they are in the world.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Social media can be a minefield, but platforms such as\u00a0 Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Twitter can also provide physicians and other healthcare professionals with an array of previously unheard-of advantages and the ability to confer with other professionals--no matter where they are in the world.", "title": "'Sky is the limit' for health providers who use social media", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/sky-limit-health-providers-who-use-social-media/2015-10-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Facebook,Health Information Technology,Instagram,LinkedIn,Operations & Business Management,patient engagement,Patient Privacy,social media,twitter", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Information Technology,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd2b\"", "article_summary": "Health providers must rush to take advantage of social media opportunities now or get left behind, according to Business Insider.\nUse of social media platforms gives providers a whole new way to provide the public with medical education, Loeb said.\nShe makes efficient use of social media by checking Twitter while she is on the subway or when she's waiting in line.\nProviders, she said, must follow their organization's social media policies, never offer what could be construed as medical advice and always maintain their professionalism.\nLoeb said that many healthcare professionals avoid social media because they worry about running afoul of patient confidentiality rules and that they will end up wasting time."}
