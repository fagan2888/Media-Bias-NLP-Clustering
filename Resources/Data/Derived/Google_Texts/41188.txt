In the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Obama currently sits at 41.7% approve, 52.7% disapprove — 11 points upside down. In this poll, the president’s disapproval rate has been over 50% since August of 2013, well over a year.

Obama’s job performance of late has been so bad that, with the exception of MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, even the mainstream and openly leftwing media have been critical, especially of his administration’s inability to put together a cohesive message on ISIS, a growing threat in the Middle East.

Early indications are that Friday’s monthly job numbers will disappoint.
