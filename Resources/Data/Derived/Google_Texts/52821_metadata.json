Cory Booker, (D., N.J.,) attends a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington. Andrew Harnik/Associated Press\n\nCiting a New Jersey law that protects elected leaders, Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) says he can\u2019t be sued over an alleged multimillion-dollar corruption scandal that unfolded at a nonprofit agency that once delivered water to customers throughout the state\u2019s northern communities.\n\nIn court papers, lawyers for Sen. Booker urged a federal judge to drop the lawsuit over the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corp., which shut down nearly three years ago after a state report said it \u201crecklessly and improperly spent millions of dollars of public funds\u201d during Sen. Booker\u2019s tenure as mayor of Newark.\n\nUnder the nonprofit\u2019s rules, the mayor of Newark led the board of trustees. But Sen. Booker\u2019s lawyers argued in court papers filed Friday that a New Jersey law shields public officials from lawsuits.\n\nThe law, New Jersey\u2019s Tort Claims Act, is meant to keep people who are running for elected office from worrying that they will be held personally liable for the work they do as a public servant, they said in documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Newark. Few people could afford to take on such a potentially expensive risk, they said.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of a failure to uphold these immunities would dissuade an even wider swath of individuals from seeking to hold public office. This would impoverish our democracy, as the absence of immunity would pose the risk of narrowing the pool of people willing to serve the public to the super-rich or the judgment-proof.\u201d\n\nThe Nov. 6 lawsuit against Sen. Booker also named other ex-board members. Most of the allegations focused on the agency\u2019s former director, Linda Watkins-Brashear, who was accused of mismanagement and abusive spending.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit says Ms. Watkins-Brashear improperly awarded more than $2.5 million worth of no-bid contracts for consulting, landscaping and other services to people who had agency connections, including more than $332,000 in no-bid contracts to her ex-husband for interior-design work. That violated the nonprofit\u2019s charter that restricts officers and employees from having \u201cany interest, directly or indirectly, in any contract to supply goods or services,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nThe lawsuit also said Ms. Watkins-Brashear improperly spent the agency\u2019s money, including at a 2010 conference where the agency paid for a dinner for 20 that cost $1,410 and included lobster, king crab, filet mignon, cognac and martinis.\n\nMs. Watkins-Brashear, through her lawyer, has denied wrongdoing.\n\nSen. Booker appointed Ms. Watkins-Brashear to the executive-director position shortly after he took office in July 2006. He served until October 2013, when he became a U.S. senator. In Friday\u2019s court filing, Sen. Booker\u2019s lawyers said it wasn\u2019t \u201chis duty to monitor directly the executive director.\u201d\n\nLast month\u2019s lawsuit is the work of several court-appointed trustees who were put in charge of shutting down the agency after its work was transferred to the city of Newark. Any money recovered in the lawsuit would be used to pay the agency\u2019s final bills.\n\nFounded in 1973, the agency was paid by Newark to manage the city\u2019s expansive fresh-water reservoirs in northern New Jersey and handle operations at a water-treatment facility. The agency took in more than $40 million in city money from 2008-11 under two service contracts, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe agency dissolved in March 2013, and several people who were appointed by a judge to wind up its affairs put it into bankruptcy Jan. 2.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
