It also contains a clip of Edwards reinforcing his political affiliation at a pre-runoff campaign event. Beyond showing Edwards\u2019s support for the president, the video is meant to display the gubernatorial candidate\u2019s consistent alignment with the national Democratic Party.\n\nAmerica Rising created the video because Edwards has tried to distance himself from President Obama\u2019s policies on the campaign trail, most notably Obamacare, saying that Louisiana voters have a \u201cdeeply negative view of President Obama and his policies.\u201d\n\nAmelia Chass\u00e9 of America Rising PAC summed up the video\u2019s message: \u201cDespite his election year posturing, John Bel Edwards can\u2019t escape his support of President Obama or his party affiliation. Edwards\u2019 priorities and values are far closer to President Obama and the national Democrats bankrolling his campaign than they are to the people of Louisiana.\u201d\n\nEdwards serves as the State Representative for District 72 in Louisiana.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "America Rising PAC released a new video Thursday describing John Bel Edwards, a Democrat running for governor of Louisiana, as a liberal Democrat supportive of President Barack Obama's political agend", "title": "America Rising Releases New Video: \u2018John Bel Edwards: An Obama Democrat\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/america-rising-releases-new-video-john-bel-edwards-an-obama-democrat/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "America Rising PAC released a new video Thursday describing John Bel Edwards, a Democrat running for", "creator": "@Aaron_Kliegman", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "title": "America Rising Releases New Video: \u2018John Bel Edwards: An Obama Democrat\u2019", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY: Follow @Aaron_KliegmanAmerica Rising PAC released a new video Thursday describing John Bel Edwards, a Democrat running for governor of Louisiana, as a liberal Democrat supportive of President Barack Obama\u2019s political agenda and out of touch with the voters in Louisiana.\nThe video shows Edwards at the 2012 Democratic National Convention applauding when the Louisiana delegation announced its support for the nomination of Obama and saying in his own words that he voted for \u201cthe Democrat\u201d in the last three presidential elections.\nEdwards\u2019 priorities and values are far closer to President Obama and the national Democrats bankrolling his campaign than they are to the people of Louisiana.\u201dEdwards serves as the State Representative for District 72 in Louisiana.\nBeyond showing Edwards\u2019s support for the president, the video is meant to display the gubernatorial candidate\u2019s consistent alignment with the national Democratic Party.\nIt also contains a clip of Edwards reinforcing his political affiliation at a pre-runoff campaign event."}
