One, he said, is a list of his friends.\n\n\u0093The other,\u0094 said Koskinen, \u0093is people who think this is a good idea.\u0094\n\nKoskinen, a former chairman of U.S.-owned mortgage financier Freddie Mac with no experience in tax administration, is poised to take over leadership of the U.S. tax agency as soon as later this month.\n\nAs an executive who has built his reputation on turning around troubled enterprises, Koskinen will have plenty to do at the IRS as it tries to restore public trust damaged by its treatment of small-government nonprofit groups.\n\nHe\u0092ll also encounter an agency strained by budget cuts and burdened with responsibilities to help implement the health-care law. That comes on top of its ordinary duties of enforcing tax laws, processing returns and operating call centers.\n\n\u0093Coming into the IRS under any circumstances at any time is a challenge, let alone layering on the other issues you\u0092ve got at the current time,\u0094 said Floyd Williams, who retired in 2012 after 16 years as the tax agency\u0092s top liaison to Congress. \u0093It\u0092s a large, large agency. It\u0092s got a tremendous task. And it\u0092s very difficult to get your arms around the organization.\u0094\n\n\u0092Critical\u0092 Post\n\nSenate Finance Chairman Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, said he scheduled the panel vote on Koskinen\u0092s nomination so the \u0093critical\u0094 post could be filled by the full Senate before the lawmakers leave Washington for the year at the end of next week.\n\nIn addition to his position at Freddie Mac, Koskinen has been city administrator of Washington, D.C., president of a corporate turnaround firm and leader of the federal government\u0092s preparations for the year 2000, when many computers were set to operate as if 1900 followed 1999.\n\nAccording to disclosures he filed this year, Koskinen\u0092s net worth ranges from $7.1 million to $27.4 million. In those disclosures, he said he would resign his position as a director of AES Corp. and American Capital Ltd. and sell stock holdings.\n\nLongest Gap\n\nKoskinen is the first Senate-confirmed IRS commissioner since Douglas Shulman\u0092s term ended in November 2012. That\u0092s the longest gap between confirmed commissioners since Congress created the job in 1862, according to the IRS website.\n\nShulman\u0092s successor, acting commissioner Steven Miller, was forced out by President Barack Obama in May. The president intervened after IRS officials said the agency had singled out Tea Party groups for scrutiny based solely on their names and apologized for subjecting them to delays and unnecessary questions as they sought tax-exempt status.\n\nOther IRS officials, including Lois Lerner, director of exempt organizations, were pushed out of their jobs, retired or resigned. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and congressional committees began inquiries that haven\u0092t concluded.\n\nDanny Werfel, the controller of the Office of Management and Budget, has been running the IRS since May. He\u0092s scheduled to leave by the end of the year, Baucus said.\n\nThe Tea Party controversy -- and the lack of trust it engendered in the IRS -- hung over Koskinen\u0092s confirmation hearing. The investigations haven\u0092t provided a clear picture of just what happened.\n\n\u0091Streamline\u0092 Law\n\nThe probes have shown some Democratic-leaning groups also experienced delays in seeking tax exemptions. Obama said on MSNBC Dec. 5 that IRS officials were trying to \u0093streamline what is a difficult law,\u0094 and offered the IRS controversy as an example of an issue that gets attention to the exclusion of agencies that are working well.\n\nRepublicans, who describe what happened as targeting of Obama\u0092s political opponents, used Koskinen\u0092s confirmation hearing to criticize proposed IRS rules that would change the definition of political spending for social welfare groups organized under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code.\n\nGroups using that status such as Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, which backs Republicans, and the League of Conservation Voters, which supported many Democrats, spent millions of dollars on the 2012 elections without disclosing their donors.\n\nThe IRS hasn\u0092t said how much political involvement would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the groups. The law requires them to be organized \u0093exclusively\u0094 for social welfare purposes; the IRS has previously said politics couldn\u0092t be their primary purpose.\n\n\u0091Four-Letter Word\u0092\n\n\u0093I hope we could get the IRS out of politics,\u0094 said Senator Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican. \u0093The IRS has become a four-letter word with too many people.\u0094\n\nKoskinen, who wasn\u0092t involved in writing the regulations, said a lack of clear rules contributed to the controversy and he looks forward to the results of the inquiries.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s an important matter to run to ground,\u0094 he said.\n\nThe treatment of political groups was a challenge for the IRS \u0093even before the issue blew up,\u0094 said Williams, now senior tax counsel at Public Strategies Washington Inc., a government relations firm. That\u0092s because the parties were urging the agency to act in opposite directions, guaranteeing that one or both would be unhappy with the IRS\u0092 enforcement.\n\nNarrower Issues\n\nLawmakers also pressed Koskinen to address a set of narrower issues, some caused by the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nSenator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, asked Koskinen to examine fees assessed on pharmaceutical companies that produce drugs to treat rare diseases.\n\nSenator Robert Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, wants him to look at tax-related rules affecting volunteer firefighters and adjunct professors at community colleges.\n\nThe IRS must manage the health law and the rest of its responsibilities without the prospect of additional funding.\n\nHouse Republicans proposed a spending plan earlier this year that would cut the agency\u0092s budget by 24 percent from the $11.9 billion it received in fiscal 2013. The Obama administration has proposed a $1 billion increase.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.accountingtoday.com/news/Obama-IRS-Nominee-Koskinen-Approved-68992-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.accountingtoday.com/media/ui/webcpa-socialshare-logo.png", "site_name": "Accounting Today News", "title": "Obama IRS Nominee Koskinen Approved"}, "google-site-verification": "j5muKh-DQfTuFwnYFV7lcz1jyUXULO2A4sj9MiXsHc4", "description": "John Koskinen, a 74-year-old multimillionaire with a resume full of accomplishments, is about to get the thankless career-capping job of running the IRS after the Senate Finance Committee approved his nomination Friday.", "title": "Obama IRS Nominee Koskinen Approved"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb03e\"", "article_summary": "The IRS must manage the health law and the rest of its responsibilities without the prospect of additional funding.\nThe Tea Party controversy -- and the lack of trust it engendered in the IRS -- hung over Koskinen\u0092s confirmation hearing.\nThat\u0092s the longest gap between confirmed commissioners since Congress created the job in 1862, according to the IRS website.\nThe IRS hasn\u0092t said how much political involvement would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the groups.\nOther IRS officials, including Lois Lerner, director of exempt organizations, were pushed out of their jobs, retired or resigned."}
