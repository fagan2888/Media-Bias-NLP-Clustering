He's still a good guy deep down. People just misunderstand him, when he talks a certain way. He's just expressing himself, he's intense. I couldn't do the big spectacle thing. I'm on the road every day, I'm intoxicated some times, it'd take time to write a nice speech.\u201d\n\nTouching upon a different topic, Lil Jon responded positively when asked about his take on President Obama\u2019s administration. The Atlanta native even hinted at which candidate he will be rooting for come next year\u2019s presidential elections.\n\n\u201cI think Obama's done a great job,\u201d Lil Jon says. \u201cIt takes time to restore an old historic car - you can't just do it overnight. That's how I look at the administration that came before Obama. He put a new engine in it, he put some new rims, got a paint job. He's criticized, and at the end of today it's because he's black. The numbers don't lie - unemployment is down, Obamacare is a great thing. I think Hillary is about it for 2016.\u201d\n\nLater in the conversation, Lil Jon offered a simple reply when asked about what The East Side Boyz are currently up to.\n\n\u201cI have no idea, dawg,\u201d he replied.\n\nLil Jon is in the house. #TurnDownForOx pic.twitter.com/bRZOZ7IltF \u2014 The Tab Oxford (@TheTabOxford) May 11, 2015\n\nLil Jon took to Instagram following the speech to thank the Univeristy for having him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "HipHopDX has the latest Hip Hop news, Rap news, Hip Hop gossip, Hip Hop rumors, album sales and more.
