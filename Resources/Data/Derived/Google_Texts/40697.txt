One of the areas hit hardest around our area was the Bailey community.

Power lines and trees are down in the streets in Bailey. Debris is littered around. Many who were home say the experience was a frightening one to watch. One man's family was at home when trees started falling at their house.

"She heard the noise coming and whistling, then she felt the trailer shake and that's when the trees fell," Eric Burge says. "It was over in a matter of seconds."

Lauderdale County Emergency Management Director Scott Spears tells Newscenter 11 the worst of the damage hit the Bailey and Meehan areas. Trees and power lines were down, some windows were busted, and LEMA had a report of a tree hitting a home, but fortunately, most of the damage was minor. Clayton Cobler with Metro Ambulance says there were no reported injuries. Crews have been working to clear the roads as quickly as possible, but emergency officials urge you to stay off the roads if at all possible. LEMA says right now the biggest concern is more flooding. The lakes and ponds are already full can't hold any more.
