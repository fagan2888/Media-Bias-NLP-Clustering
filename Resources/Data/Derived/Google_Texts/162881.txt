A Christmas Eve shooting has left one person dead at a mall in suburban New Orleans, and police say a suspect is in custody.

Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand says it happened about 4:21 p.m. Wednesday, less than two hours before the mall in Gretna was scheduled to close for the holiday.

Normand says the victim had just purchased something from Foot Locker and had turned from the cash register when a man walked to within three or four feet of him and began shooting.

The sheriff says at least three shots were fired. The victim was pronounced dead on the scene.

No one else was injured.

Normand says the shooter was apprehended several blocks from the mall and is being questioned by authorities. Charges have not yet been filed.
