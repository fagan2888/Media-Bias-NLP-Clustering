The Obamas'll be back in town today (why don't they just move here already), but this time they won't be kicking it in Brooklyn. This afternoon the President will be giving a speech beside the crumbling Tappan Zee Bridge, because the government is out of money and our infrastructure is falling apart. Ah, well.

Obama will land at JFK at around 2:30 p.m., and is set to speak sometime between 3 and 4 p.m. at the Washington Irving Boat Club in Tarrytown. Insiders expect he'll petition Congress to back his transportation plan, a $302 billion initiative that'll funnel money into highways, bridges, tunnels and other non-subway related methods of getting from one place to another. The nearly 60-year-old Tappan Zee is in the midst of getting replaced, with Governor Cuomo spearheading construction on a new bridge. Note that if you are planning to travel to and/or from Westchester this afternoon, there will likely be significant traffic backups, and it's possible there will be some delays on Metro-North.

The President's not just here for the bridge—tonight, he'll make an appearance at two pricey fundraisers for Democratic candidates—one in Midtown and one on the Upper East Side, so beware the presidential motorcade tonight—in the upcoming midterm election before spending the night in Manhattan, and tomorrow he'll be the keynote speaker at the National September 11 Memorial Museum's opening ceremony in Lower Manhattan. The museum opens to the public on May 21st.
