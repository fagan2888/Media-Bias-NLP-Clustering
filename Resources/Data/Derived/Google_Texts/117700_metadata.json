The all-items consumer price index has fallen from a year earlier for ten straight months.\n\n\"We expect the MAS to ease at the October policy meeting... in response to the probable recession and absence of inflationary pressures,\" Hak Bin Chua, economist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a research note.\n\nThe MAS decision, and the government's advance estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product, are expected to be announced around mid-October.\n\nThe MAS surprised investors in January by easing policy in an off-cycle move. It then kept policy unchanged in April.\n\nThe MAS manages monetary policy by letting the Singapore dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed trading band based on its nominal effective exchange rate (NEER).\n\nhas fallen 7 percent so far this year in the face of persistent strength in the greenback and a weakening outlook for emerging economies. Among those economists who expect easing, views are split on whether the MAS will reduce the slope of the band, lower the mid-point, or do both. Some expect the MAS to shift from a stance of allowing a \"modest and gradual\" appreciation of the Singapore dollar NEER policy band to a neutral stance. CIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun is among those who say a lower mid-point is more likely. \"MAS may ease further in the October policy review especially since there are downside risks to both GDP and inflation outlook for Singapore,\" Song said. Singapore's monetary policy is focused on the exchange rate, instead of interest rates, due to the trade-dependent nature of its economy.
