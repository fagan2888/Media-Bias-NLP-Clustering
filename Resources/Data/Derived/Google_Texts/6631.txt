BANGOR, Maine — A Glenburn man injured in a motorcycle crash on Thursday is in serious condition at a Bangor hospital.

William Saucier, 57, had been listed in critical condition on Thursday, but a hospital spokeswoman said Friday he is listed in serious condition.

Saucier suffered what police termed a significant brain injury after a car collided with his motorcycle on Outer Hammond Street on Thursday.

Saucier, who was not wearing a helmet, was thrown 60 feet from his motorcycle.

The man driving the car, Joseph Salls, 58, was not injured in the crash, according to Bangor police. Salls was pulling out of Target Industrial Circle when he collided with Saucier’s motorcycle.

An accident reconstruction is possible.
