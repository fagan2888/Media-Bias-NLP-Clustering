He was clearly struggling toward the end of his tenure with Colorado.\n\nThough he had developed a better changeup than he\u2019d ever had before, Betancourt\u2019s fastball command was not as sharp as used to be. Betancourt lived by moving the ball in and out, and painting the corners of the plate, but once he lost that ability, he struggled to put hitters away.\n\n\u201cThis is kind of where where we are at right now, with the state of our bullpen,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cWe need to get a look at some guys down the stretch and look toward the future and look at the bigger picture.\u201d\n\nWeiss said that calling Betancourt into his office Sunday morning to break the news was not easy, but Weiss went out of his way to praise Betancourt, who returned from Tommy John surgery to make the team this spring.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty remarkable what Raffy accomplished this year,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cTo be honest with you, going into spring training I thought there was very little chance we would see him in a big-league game this year. He not only did that, he made our club, broke camp with us and played a major role the entire season.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s a tough conversation to have with a guy like that. He\u2019s been a warrior and he\u2019s been a great leader. He\u2019s got a lot to be proud of when he looks back at his career.\u201d\n\nIn 680 appearances across 12 seasons from 2003-15 with Cleveland and Colorado, Betancourt posted a 38-37 record with 75 saves in 121 opportunities and a 3.36 ERA. His 58 saves with the Rockies rank fifth in franchise history.\n\nAfter undergoing Tommy John on Sept. 17, 2013, he pitched in the minors in 2014. He made the Rockies\u2019 opening-day roster this season as a non-roster invitee.\n\n\u201cI have always respected the people here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have always treated me very well. I saw this coming. They are going to be needing young guys.\u201d\n\nCastro, 27, pitched in four games for the Chicago White Sox during the 2013 season. He was 0-1 with a 2.70 ERA (6.2 IP, 2 ER) in four relief appearances after making his big-league debut on July 5, 2013.\n\nHe was signed by the Rockies to a minor-league contract on April 22, 2014. He underwent Tommy John surgery in January 2014, forcing him to miss all of the 2014 season. He was 5-5 with a 3.79 ERA in 36 appearances at Triple-A this season.\n\nDiaz, 24, was 3-5 with a 4.58 ERA in 47 relief appearances for the Isotopes this season. He has eight saves in 14 opportunities.\n\nDiaz, who throws a fastball in the high 90s, was acquired by the Rockies from the Angels in a trade for infielder Josh Rutledge on Dec. 10, 2014. Diaz was originally signed by Los Angeles as a non-drafted free agent on Aug. 1, 2007.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nLooking ahead\n\nRockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (7-5, 4.50 ERA) at Braves\u2019 Julio Teheran (8-6, 4.32), 5:10 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nDe La Rosa, the veteran left-hander, has turned into the Rockies\u2019 tourniquet \u2014 he\u2019s expected to stop the bleeding. The Rockies have lost 12 of their last 15 games and own the worst record in the majors. De La Rosa has gained acclaim for being the best pitcher in Coors Field history, but he has been impressive on the road this season, going 5-3 with a 3.17 ERA in 10 starts. Teheran, meanwhile, has struggled on the road but has pitched well at Turner Field (6-1, 2.44). In his last outing, he struck out seven and walked one while holding the Padres to one run on four hits over six innings in a no-decision at Petco Park.\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Chad Bettis (5-4, 4.88 ERA) at Braves\u2019 Mike Foltynewicz (4-5, 6.06), 5:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Yohan Flande (3-1, 3.94) at Braves\u2019 Shelby Miller (5-10, 2.50), 5:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Off\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rafael Betancourt designated for assignment as Rockies retool bullpen", "title": "Rafael Betancourt designated for assignment as Rockies retool bullpen", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/23/rafael-betancourt-designated-for-assignment-as-rockies-retool-bullpen/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150823_010545_rafael-betancourt.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150823_010545_rafael-betancourt.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-23T13:04:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T06:01:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Rockies also optioned right-handed reliever Justin Miller to Triple-A Albuquerque, recalled right-handed reliever Jairo Diaz from Triple-A and selected the contract of right-handed reliever Simon Castro.\nNeeding immediate help to prop up a sagging bullpen, and with an eye toward their future, the Rockies designated veteran reliever Rafael Betancourt for assignment Sunday.\nThe Rockies also reinstated right-handed reliever Brooks Brown (shoulder inflammation) from the 15-day disabled list and optioned him to Albuquerque.\nBetancourt was 2-4 with one save in four opportunities and a 6.18 ERA in 45 appearances for the Rockies this season.\nBetancourt, 40, has pitched his last game for the Rockies and admitted that retiring from baseball is a possibility."}
