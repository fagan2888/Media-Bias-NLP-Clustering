We can\u2019t uninsure people. And secondly, we have to make sure that no one loses insurance because of a pre-existing condition, okay?\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThat all said, we are about to launch a program in our state that I would want to move nationally. Right now, we don\u2019t really understand what it costs when we go to a hospital, what our doctors cost, what the quality is. \u2026 So what we\u2019re saying is total transparency. I want to know, if you\u2019re a hospital, or if you\u2019re a physician, I want to know what your quality is and what your prices are, and we can chart it, on a graph. And there are people who charge high amounts, whose quality is not better than those who charge lesser amounts, okay? there\u2019s a midpoint. What we\u2019re doing, this is a market system. We are going to incentivize, with rewards to people who produce high quality, at lower prices, below the midpoint. See, we want to begin to drive healthcare, you know, put downward pressure on it, so that we don\u2019t continue to see it skyrocket.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kasich: Use Fed Resources and Medicaid To Cover Working Poor, Ensure Pre-Existing Condition Coverage", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Kasich: Use Fed Resources and Medicaid To Cover Working Poor, Ensure Pre-Existing Condition Coverage", "title": "Kasich: Use Fed Resources and Medicaid To Cover Working Poor, Ensure Pre-Existing Condition Coverage - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Kasich-39-Thumbnail-3.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/03/09/kasich-use-fed-resources-and-medicaid-to-cover-working-poor-ensure-pre-existing-condition-coverage/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kasich: Use Fed Resources and Medicaid To Cover Working Poor, Ensure Pre-Existing Condition Coverage", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Kasich-39-Thumbnail-3.jpg", "title": "Kasich: Use Fed Resources and Medicaid To Cover Working Poor, Ensure Pre-Existing Condition Coverage - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "affordable care act, healthcare, John Kasich,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Obamacare,Kasich", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "John Kasich", "published_time": "2016-03-09T17:19:15-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "We are going to incentivize, with rewards to people who produce high quality, at lower prices, below the midpoint.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERKasich said, in response to a question on how he would repeal and replace Obamacare \u201cOne is I would take some federal resources, combined it with a freed up Medicaid program, to continue to cover the working poor.\nAnd there are people who charge high amounts, whose quality is not better than those who charge lesser amounts, okay?\nRight now, we don\u2019t really understand what it costs when we go to a hospital, what our doctors cost, what the quality is.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepublican presidential candidate Ohio Governor John Kasich stated that he would use federal resources and Medicaid to ensure the working poor were covered after Obamacare was repealed and he would ensure people don\u2019t lost insurance due to pre-existing conditions on Wednesday\u2019s \u201cOn the Record\u201d on the Fox News Channel."}
