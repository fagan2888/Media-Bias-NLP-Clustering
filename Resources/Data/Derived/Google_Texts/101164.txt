It doesn’t serve to spur economic activity, as deductions are typically meant to do

Recently, a private-school tuition tax deduction was passed into law. Beginning in 2014, parents who chose to send their children to a private school can deduct up to $4,000 paid in tuition for children in grades K through 8 and up to $10,000 for high school students. This is a tax deduction, as opposed to a tax credit, and is available to all parents, regardless of income level, which by design will benefit mostly wealthy families.

The cost to Wisconsin funding is estimated at $30 million for the 2014-2015 school year, according to Sen. Luther Olsen.

Typically, tax deductions have been sold to the public as a means to spur economic activity. The original argument for vouchers — similar to the tax breaks as public money is being paid to private schools — was that they benefit only low-income families. Now, these private-school subsidies have been expanded to families regardless of income.

This tax deduction and voucher subsidies don’t increase economic activity, aren’t focused on helping the poor and come at a substantial cost to the funding for our state and local governments. The only thing that these subsidies accomplish is to take money from public schools and give it to private schools.

Now, we’re projected to have a structural deficit in state funding. This is just bad policy and not good for Wisconsin.
