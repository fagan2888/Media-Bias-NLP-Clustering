Most measures would still need Senate approval, and the most radical GOP ideas would struggle in the face of Democratic filibusters.\n\nBut what if a newly invigorated Republican majority decided to scrap legislative filibusters so GOP lawmakers could simply do as they pleased?\n\nLate last week , Jeb Bush said he \u201cwould certainly consider\u201d getting rid of filibusters altogether \u2013 executing a new \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2013 in order to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Scott Walker was even more enthusiastic about the idea, saying he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d pursue such a strategy if it helped him dismantle the nation\u2019s health care system.\n\nThis week, as Bloomberg Politics reported , two more Republican presidential hopefuls \u2013 Rick Perry and Carly Fiorina \u2013 said they, too, would urge GOP senators to rewrite Senate rules in order to \u201crepeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nRepublican senators themselves, however, say they\u2019re not interested. The Hill reported this week:\n\nSenate Republicans appear to be closing the door on gutting the filibuster, brushing aside calls from GOP presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush and Scott Walker to consider lowering the 60-vote threshold for repealing ObamaCare. Sources close to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) say there\u2019s virtually no chance he will go along with abolishing the filibuster, something he has strongly criticized in the past.\n\nEven Ted Cruz is cool to the idea , telling Hugh Hewitt this week, \u201cI believe ending the legislative filibuster would ultimately undermine conservative principles.\u201d The Club for Growth also voiced skepticism.\n\nIn theory, that should effectively end the conversation, but there\u2019s still a little more to it.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s largely an academic exercise, speculating about a hypothetical. But imagine if Republicans found themselves in 2017 and 2018 in the same boat as Democrats for most of 2009 and 2010 \u2013 American voters gave them control of the levers of power, but their agenda was stymied by the minority.\n\nIs it possible that Republicans might change their mind about filibusters after a few months or years of Democratic obstructionism? Of course it is. Paul Waldman had a good piece on this yesterday for the Washington Post.\n\n[C]onsider this scenario. It\u2019s the spring of 2017, just months after Republicans achieved their victory at the polls. President Walker (or Rubio, or Bush) is moving to implement the agenda that he ran on. Republicans in Congress are eager to pass the bills they\u2019ve been fantasizing about for the last eight years. And there\u2019s a full docket of them: tax cuts, a national ban on abortions after the 20th week of a woman\u2019s pregnancy, eliminating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, forbidding the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, lightening Wall Street\u2019s terrible regulatory burden, block granting safety net programs, and, of course, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Yet Democrats and their filibuster stand in the way of it all. It isn\u2019t hard to imagine that the pressure from Republican legislators, the party\u2019s base and a new president eager to make his mark, all of whom would be urging McConnell to get rid of the filibuster, would be overwhelming.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, let\u2019s not discount the possibility that Senate Republicans are \u2026 how do I put this gently \u2026 fibbing.\n\nGOP leaders are no doubt aware that their party\u2019s agenda is not popular and that the party overall has a well-deserved reputation for radicalism. It\u2019s in the Republicans\u2019 interest to leave Americans with the impression that policymaking in Washington is slow, difficult, and prone to gridlock. \u201cWe can vote for Republicans,\u201d mainstream voters are supposed to think, \u201cbecause Democrats will be there to keep them from going too far.\u201d\n\nAnd so, before the 2016 elections, GOP officials have an incentive to leave Americans with the impression that Republicans won\u2019t simply be able to run roughshod, passing every right-wing idea that pops into their minds.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Imagine a scenario in which Republicans control the White House, Senate, and House.
