Carlyle Continues Mid-Market Deal Spree with R.I. Energy Center

The purchase follows the PE firms recent investments in Blyth and Coalfire Systems

The Carlyle Group (NASDAQ: CG) will purchase the Rhode Island State Energy Center (RISEC) from Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) for $490 million, continuing the PE fund’s recent string of mid-market deals. The firm is making the deal alongside its Cogentrix Energy Power Management LLC portfolio company

Rhode Island State Energy Center is a natural gas fired plant based in Johnston, Rhode Island. Carlyle is making the investment out of the firm’s Carlyle Power Partners II and Carlyle Power Opportunities Capital Partners LP funds.

“The retirement of aging generation in the region is putting a greater emphasis on efficient gas-fired generators, like RISEC, to meet everyday electricity demand,” says Carlyle managing director Matt O’Connor.

Carlyle has been active in the middle-market lately. Earlier this year, the firm acquired candle maker Blyth Inc. and partnered with the Chertoff Group to buy cybersecurity provider Coalfire Systems.

Latham & Watkins is representing Carlyle.
