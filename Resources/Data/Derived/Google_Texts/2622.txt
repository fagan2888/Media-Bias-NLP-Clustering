South Dakota Junior Football helped put on another event to help moms get a better understanding of football.

Moms took part in drills on offensive, defense and special teams. Some moms even put on shoulder pads and helmets.

A special guest Saturday was Christine Golic. She's the wife of Mike Golic, former NFL defensive lineman and current ESPN Radio Personality. She's been working on an advisory committee with the NFL to help spread the word of preventing concussions by using safe protocols in every level of football.

"I always thought there was probably room for improvement and that's really why I wanted to get involved because I kind of wanted to be a part of the change. I thought the idea of heads-up football and having guidelines for organization like the one out here is a good thing so that everybody is one the same page with what they're teaching and what they're coaching," Golic said.

Golic has traveled across the country hearing concerns from football players' moms as part of the heads-up football program. This is her first stop that wasn't at an NFL facility.
