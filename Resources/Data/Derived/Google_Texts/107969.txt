Fargo, ND

North Dakota State University students and staff will have access this year to a safety and security service that will allow dispatchers to track their whereabouts at all times and let users call for help by swiping the smartphone screen.



The app was used by some students in the spring in a pilot program and will be available this fall to everyone affiliated with the campus. The system works both on and off campus on a 24/7 basis and it is integrated with the current NDSU technology that provides centralized electronic locks and a surveillance camera system.



Safety has been in the forefront at NDSU since freshman Thomas Bearson was killed by an unknown assailant in September and two students were raped at an off-campus apartment in December.
