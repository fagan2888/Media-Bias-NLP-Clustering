Others use an idiom that, through some combination of chance and insight, anticipates changes in a language. Frank O\u2019Hara is in the second group: When O\u2019Hara\u2019s Lunch Poems was published 50 years ago, novelist Gilbert Sorrentino wrote that it had a \u201cstrictly New York joie de vivre: slightly down at heels and rumpled, but with the kind of style always a step above current \u2018style\u2019.\u201d Related Story Have You Ever Tried to Sell a Poem on Craigslist? With its references to Park Avenue, Times Square, Pennsylvania Station, liver sausage sandwiches, the Five Spot, the Seagram Building, the opening of the American Folk Art Museum, and much more, it is a very New York book. O\u2019Hara walks around the buzzing city, buys \u201ca chocolate malted\u201d or \u201ca little Verlaine,\u201d remembers a friend\u2019s birthday, and talks to the Puerto Rican cabbies before rushing back to his desk at the MoMA with a copy of Reverdy\u2019s poems in his pocket. Born in Baltimore and raised in Grafton, Massachusetts, O'Hara moved to New York in 1951 and stayed until his untimely death in 1966. The city offered freedom, possibility, movement, all of which O\u2019Hara associated with life. \u201cI can\u2019t even enjoy a blade of grass,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cunless I know there\u2019s a subway handy.\u201d It also offered him a community of fellow outcasts, poets, and artists who became, as Lytle Shaw notes, a surrogate family. Lunch Poems is still popular with New Yorkers today: In 2012, when the Leonard Lopate Show asked listeners to vote on 10 objects that \u201cbest tell New York's story,\u201d it came in at number six\u2014just above the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nBut the book has an appeal that reaches beyond the time and place it was written in, as the 50th anniversary edition of the City Lights volume shows. Casual, sardonic, funny, and full of pop-culture references, Lunch Poems has all the brevity, informality, irony, and at times chatty pointlessness of modern discourse without having been influenced by it. The volume has never gone out of print, in part because O\u2019Hara expresses himself in the same way modern Americans do: Like many of us, he tries to overcome the absurdity and loneliness of modern life by addressing an audience of anonymous others. O\u2019Hara\u2019s Lunch Poems\u2014like Facebook posts or tweets\u2014shares, saves, and re-creates the poet\u2019s experience of the world. He addresses others in order to combat a sense of loneliness, sharing his gossipy, sometimes snarky take of modern life, his unfiltered enthusiasm, and his boredom in a direct, conversational tone. In short, Lunch Poems, while 50 years old, is very a 21st-century book. O\u2019Hara\u2019s 'Lunch Poems'\u2014like a series of Facebook posts or tweets\u2014shares, saves, and re-creates the poet\u2019s experience of the world. In \u201cPersonism: A Manifesto,\u201d O\u2019Hara compares his poems to a decidedly 20th-century communication medium: a telephone call. Much of \u201cPersonism\u201d is tongue-in-cheek, but O\u2019Hara was often at his most serious when being ironic, and this is true of the second part of \u201cPersonism\u201d: O\u2019Hara writes that his poems are like telephone calls because they are addressed to someone else. The difference is that the address in the poem is indirect\u2014\u201cthus,\u201d O\u2019Hara writes, they evoke \u201covertones of love without destroying love\u2019s life-giving vulgarity.\u201d And \u201cPoem (Khrushchev is coming on the right day!)\u201d is less about Khrushchev than about a beautiful New York day, an evening at the movies, and the difference between an \u201cofficial\u201d America (which Khrushchev experiences) and an alternative one that is messier, more vibrant and more international: last night we went to a movie and came out, Ionesco is greater than Beckett, Vincent said, that\u2019s what I think, blueberry blintzes and Khrushchev was probably being carped at in Washington, no politesse Vincent tells me about his mother\u2019s trip to Sweden Hans tells us about his father\u2019s life in Sweden, it sounds like Grace Hartigan\u2019s painting Sweden The mixing of high and low culture, the sharing of preferences, and the free association of names and ideas are used here to capture and prolong a heady weekend. And as a result, the poem reads today almost like a series of tweets that both share and perform the poet\u2019s \u201cinexorable\u201d joy, as O\u2019Hara put it. In \u201cAdieu to Norman, Bon Jour to Joan and Jean-Paul,\u201d meanwhile, his exuberance is on display again: O\u2019Hara writes that \u201cwe are all happy and young and toothless,\u201d and in \u201cAve Maria\u201d he praises the movies and sex. In \u201cNaphtha,\u201d O\u2019Hara thinks of Jean Dubuffet \u201cdoing his military service in the Eiffel Tower / as a meteorologist / in 1922,\u201d and is reminded of \u201chow wonderful the 20th Century / can be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The collection broadcasts snark, exuberance, lonely earnestness, and minute-by-minute autobiography to a wide, vague audience\u2014much like today&#39;s Twitter and Facebook feeds.", "author": "Micah Mattix", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The collection broadcasts snark, exuberance, lonely earnestness, and minute-by-minute autobiography to a wide, vague audience\u2014much like today&#39;s Twitter and Facebook feeds.", "title": "Frank O'Hara's Lunch Poems: 21st-Century Poetry Written in 1964", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/05/Frank_OHara_1965_by_Mario_Schifano/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/05/frank-oharas-lunch-poems-21st-century-poetry-written-in-1964/371276/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "In short, Lunch Poems, while 50 years old, is very a 21st-century book.\nCasual, sardonic, funny, and full of pop-culture references, Lunch Poems has all the brevity, informality, irony, and at times chatty pointlessness of modern discourse without having been influenced by it.\nO\u2019Hara\u2019s 'Lunch Poems'\u2014like a series of Facebook posts or tweets\u2014shares, saves, and re-creates the poet\u2019s experience of the world.\nHe addresses others in order to combat a sense of loneliness, sharing his gossipy, sometimes snarky take of modern life, his unfiltered enthusiasm, and his boredom in a direct, conversational tone.\nLunch Poems is still popular with New Yorkers today: In 2012, when the Leonard Lopate Show asked listeners to vote on 10 objects that \u201cbest tell New York's story,\u201d it came in at number six\u2014just above the Brooklyn Bridge."}
