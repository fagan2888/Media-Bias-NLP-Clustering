His availability for an AFC wild-card playoff game at 8:15 p.m. Saturday at Heinz Field against the Baltimore Ravens is in question.\n\nCoach Mike Tomlin said there was no structural damage but with only six days to heal, Bell might miss their first playoff game.\n\nNevertheless, the Steelers were a happy if somewhat subdued bunch after they swept the Bengals to finish 11-5 and claim their first division title in four years.\n\n\u201cThis is what we\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d tackle Kelvin Beachum said. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to win the North. We got a [championship] hat and shirt, put them in our bag and we\u2019ll go and get ready for Baltimore.\u201d\n\nThe Bengals (10-5-1) will play at Indianapolis as three of the four AFC North teams made the playoffs.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the journey is not over,\u201d said quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who threw up several times in the locker room before the game with a stomach virus.\n\nHis offense was not in top form Sunday and he threw his first interception in four games that helped the Bengals claw within three points in the fourth quarter. But he threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Martavis Bryant in the second quarter and a 63-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Brown with 2:50 left to seal the victory.\n\nBrown also started the scoring with a 71-yard punt return for a touchdown.\n\n\u201cWhoa, got an excited group in there,\u201d were Tomlin\u2019s first words at his news conference after leaving the victorious locker room. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t been an easy journey for us.\u201d\n\nNeither was their victory Sunday night, which completed a sweep of Cincinnati this season with possibly a third game on the horizon.\n\nIt appeared the Bengals, trailing by three, might be on their way to tying or taking the lead when cornerback Antwon Blake ripped the ball out of the hands of wide receiver A.J. Green at the Steelers 30 and recovered the fumble with 3:51 left.\n\nRoethlisberger followed with his touchdown pass to Brown, who beat Dre Kirkpatrick on a short route and ran the rest of the way home.\n\nIt was the third turnover forced by their secondary in another game in which their defense overshadowed their more renowned offense. Cornerback Brice McCain intercepted two Andy Dalton passes.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make the tackle but I also wanted to go for the ball,\u201d Blake said of his forced fumble.\n\nUntil Blake\u2019s big play, the Steelers looked to be in trouble. Cincinnati was driving when Green caught a 17-yard pass. It would have put the Bengals at least within field-goal range of tying it, but the fumble changed everything.\n\nThe Bengals drove 89 yards for a touchdown after Nelson intercepted a Roethlisberger pass deep in Cincinnati territory. That cut the Steelers\u2019 lead to 20-17 early in the fourth quarter. It took Cincinnati 15 plays to score on Dalton\u2019s 5-yard pass to tight end Jermaine Gresham.\n\nAfter that, on fourth-and-9 at the Cincinnati 45, punter Brad Wing tried to throw a pass to safety Will Allen that Tomlin said he ordered. Instead, the Bengals\u2019 Dan Sanzenbacher intercepted it to give them a first down at their 41. There was 5:43 left in the game.\n\nCincinnati took over and looked to be moving to at least tie it when Blake stripped Green of the ball and the Bengals of the AFC North title.\n\nThe Steelers took a 20-10 halftime lead after Cincinnati went ahead, 10-7, early in the second quarter. The Steelers responded with three scores on two field goals and a touchdown pass in that quarter.\n\nMcCain intercepted two passes in the first half \u2014 one ended a Cincinnati threat and the other led to a Steelers touchdown.\n\nA Steelers fumble led to Mike Nugent\u2019s 39-yard field goal in the second quarter to give Cincinnati its first lead, 10-7.\n\nThat came after Maurkice Pouncey\u2019s snap was low in the shotgun formation and Roethlisberger could not handle it. Wallace Gilberry recovered at the Steelers 34.\n\nTwo big plays in the middle of the next drive helped the Steelers tie the score on Shaun Suisham\u2019s 29-yard field goal, 10-10. On third down, Roethlisberger stepped up into the pocket and hit Heath Miller over the middle for 20 yards to the Cincinnati 42. On the next play, Roethlisberger scrambled away from pressure, dumped a short pass to Bell and he picked up 26 yards to the 16.\n\nBut the Steelers again failed in the red zone, reaching the 11 before Suisham\u2019s kick.\n\nBut then McCain intercepted his second pass of the game, returned it 31 yards and the Steelers had the ball at the Bengals 28.\n\nThere was no red-zone failure this time. Two plays later, Roethlisberger threw a screen pass on the right to rookie Bryant, who caught it at the 23 and was sprung by two perfect blocks from Miller and Markus Wheaton.\n\nBryant ran through the block and untouched into the end zone for a 21-yard touchdown, his eighth, giving the Steelers a 17-10 lead.\n\nThat stretched to 20-10 on Suisham\u2019s 25-yard field goal (the ball hitting the left upright and going through) with 40 seconds left.\n\nEd Bouchette: ebouchette@post-gazette.com and Twitter @EdBouchette.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Steelers may have lost halfback Le\u2019Veon\u00a0Bell,\u00a0who was injured in the third quarter with what is, reportedly, a hyperextended right knee.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "It\u2019s been quite some time \u2014 in Steelers years anyway \u2014 since the AFC North Division championship arrived back in Pittsburgh, and this one came with some additional pain.
