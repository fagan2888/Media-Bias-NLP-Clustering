Now research suggests these impressionable youngsters risk internalizing their teachers\u2019 depressive symptoms by modeling their behaviors at home. Interrupting this effect, the researchers explain, may be done with the help of concerted parents who can recognize behavioral changes early and take action.\n\n\u201cWe know high-quality early childhood education is critical and we also know that very few programs in the United States are truly high in quality,\u201d Cynthia Buettner, associate professor of human sciences at The Ohio State University and senior author of the study, said in a news release. \u201cSo how do we get there?\u201d\n\nAnswering that question may save the futures of countless 3-year-olds. Children who suffer behavioral problems in childhood face an increased risk for numerous challenges later in life, including low academic achievement, poor social skills, and greater propensity to commit a crime. In the meantime, they are also more likely to manifest a wide variety of reactions, both internally and externally: Children with behavioral issues tend to be more violent and aggressive, but also more depressed and angry.\n\nBreaking this cycle of aggression breeding aggression may indeed take a collective effort, Buettner says. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important. Teachers can have a really big impact on children\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nTo better understand teachers\u2019 roles in molding young kids\u2019 behavior patterns, the group of researchers collected data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. This study has collected information on single-parent families living under low socioeconomic conditions in 20 large U.S. cities. A total of 761 families and teachers were included in the OSU research. (They also collected data from mothers on children\u2019s behavior, because mothers and teachers \u201csometimes disagree on these issues,\u201d said study leader Lieny Jeon.)\n\nThe team found that when teachers were reporting their kids\u2019 behavior, teacher depression had a direct relationship to children\u2019s externalizing and internalizing behaviors. But when mothers were reporting their children\u2019s behavior, teacher depression did not predict externalizing behaviors. What\u2019s more, when researchers considered the child-care climate \u2014 either at home or at school \u2014 they found that a poor-quality climate only resulted in behavioral issues when teachers were reporting.\n\nThis could have several implications, though the largest one, as Jeon sees it, involves the unhealthy climate of the classroom. Kids that are raised in nurturing homes may not model their teachers\u2019 depression because they aren\u2019t immediately exposed to it. It\u2019s only once they reenter the classroom that the environment turns toxic. In essence, it\u2019s the only energy they can feed off.\n\nA natural limitation of the study is that teacher depression isn\u2019t necessarily a cause of the kids\u2019 behavioral issues. Kids that grow up in poorer households are, by nature, at a greater risk for mental health issues and certain patterns of behavior. The study\u2019s findings may actually paint the reverse scenario: High-spirited teachers could be brought down by the daily struggle to keep kids from acting out. As a result, they get depressed. And the kids\u2019 mothers, being none the wiser, report everything\u2019s business as usual.\n\nWhatever the case may be, teachers are still depressed. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the time or resources to address their own psychological difficulties, or access to any specialized mental health services,\u201d Jeon said, because they are too busy putting out fires. Plus, their salary is peanuts, which doesn\u2019t exactly add much incentive to improve.\n\nFixing the problem may be as simple as understanding the problem. Once administrators and parents understand, and can empathize with, the plight of preschool teachers, they can take actionable steps to reestablish the classroom as an environment for learning \u2014 not one of suffering.\n\nSource: Jeon L, Buettner C, Snyder A.
