But she denied that any money changes hands between the two.\n\n'We, as a co-op health plan, received our own federal loan money to start a health insurance company that is member-governed,' she said.\n\n'And part of the plan we submitted to apply for the loan money included outreach expenses, and that promotion, the underwear thing, was part of it.'\n\n\n\nHashtag fun: A clothed Amy Poehler joined other celebs to encourage a mass rush to Obamacare on its first day of open enrollment -- a strategy that hasn't worked so far\n\nThis pair flashed their skin Tuesday on Denver's 16th Street pedestrian malll, but the photo suggests they didn't have many takers\n\nHutchins said that while she wants to sell insurance plans to young Coloradoans, the stunt's stripped-down nature was equally aimed at the older set.\n\n'Surprisingly, they really did catch the attention of everybody,' she said. It was amazing ... Our board members, who are mostly in their 50s and 60s, would have loved to be there.'\n\n\n\nThe scantily clad Denver street team handed out brochures to anyone who would come within arm-s reach\n\nColorado policy experts who don't agree with the concept of Obamacare, or the use of their tax dollars to promote it, aren't impressed.\n\n'It's a bad day for Obamacare when proponents have to hire models to dress like Miley Cyrus to walk the streets of Denver,' said Compass Colorado executive director Kelly Maher.\n\n'These PETA-style stunts show how truly desperate they are to get people to sign up for these plans.\n\nCompass Colorado is a conservative group that argues for fiscal responsibility and smaller government.\n\nPETA, or People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, is a group that promotes the improbable and unpopular position that food, laboratory and fur-bearing animals should have legal rights. Its most famous for its naked protests that draw attention to its cause.\n\n\n\nJon Caldara, president of the libertarian-leaning Colorado think tank the Independence Institute , told MailOnline that taking off your clothes isn't the best way to sell the merits of the president's health insurance overhaul.\n\n'There are people who need better health care in America,' Caldara said, 'and what are we saying to them \u2013 that we're spending taxpayer money selling these plans the way a beer company advertises their product?'\n\n'This money could be spent on actual health care. Give me the hot chicks without the bad policy and maybe I could be sold.'\n\n\n\nStripping down is part of the toolbox at PETA, where sex sells and grabbing attention is the #1 priority\n\nV ideo Source: Instagram\n\nMailOnline reported yesterday that some state-level health exchanges have seen fewer than 1 out of 100 website visitors signing up for their insurance plans since they launched Monday at midnight. Colorado's exchange administrators didn't respond to a request for statistics for that story.\n\nThe White House insisted on Wednesday that it doesn't have data showing how many Americans have signed up for health insurance through the federal government's flagship website, healthcare.gov. The Obama administration did, however, publish the numbers of Web hits the site received, along with state covering phone calls and online chats it conducted.\n\nAnd a Washington Post blogger pleaded Thursday morning with members of the public who have successfully signed up for Obamacare coverage to come forward.\n\n'As of yet, we haven't tracked this person \u2013 or these people \u2013 down,' the Post writer explained.T'his is not for lack of effort. Reporters here at The Washington Post and at other publications have been on the hunt for this mythical creature.'\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Colorado,Obamacare,activists,STRIP,underwear,persuade,people,covered", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2442710/Colorado-Obamacare-activists-STRIP-underwear-persuade-people-covered.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare organizers in Colorado are taking Obamacare promotion to a new low \u2013 at least in terms of their dress code.", "title": "Obamacare activists STRIP to their underwear to sell Obamacare", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2442710/Colorado-Obamacare-activists-STRIP-underwear-persuade-people-covered.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/03/article-2442710-18805F6100000578-133_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2442710, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Colorado,Obamacare,activists,STRIP,underwear,persuade,people,covered", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2013-10-03T20:53:07.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=David+Martosko,+U.S.+Political+Editor", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-10-03T21:25:28.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Colorado Obamacare activists STRIP underwear persuade people covered"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Obamacare organizers in Colorado are taking Obamacare promotion to a new low \u2013 at least in terms of their dress code.", "title": "Obamacare activists STRIP to their underwear to sell Obamacare", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2442710/Colorado-Obamacare-activists-STRIP-underwear-persuade-people-covered.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/03/article-2442710-18805F6100000578-133_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2013/10/1418450360_2717392658001_1.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Obamacare organizers in Colorado are taking Obamacare promotion to a new low \u2013 at least in terms of their dress code."}, "article_summary": "A health insurance provider is sending 20-something activists out on the streets of Denver in their underwear to persuade young people to 'get covered.'\nObamacare activists STRIP to their underwear in taxpayer-funded, PETA-style stunt to persuade young Coloradoans to 'get covered'Obamacare organizers in Colorado are taking Obamacare promotion to a new low \u2013 at least in terms of their dress code.\nColoradoHealthOP CEO Julia Hutchins confirmed that her organization was formed to sell insurance policies via the Connect for Health Colorado marketplace.\nThe Affordable Care Act's coverage model depends on enrolling 7 million Americans, including at least 2.5 million young people.\n'We, as a co-op health plan, received our own federal loan money to start a health insurance company that is member-governed,' she said."}
