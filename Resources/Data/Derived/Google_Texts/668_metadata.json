Vitter's Obamacare feud deepens\n\nThe spat between David Vitter and Senate Democratic leaders is deepening.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Vitter\u2019s amendment to kill federal Obamacare subsidies for members of Congress and their staff is \u201chypocritical and mean-spirited.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nReid pointedly suggested that the Louisiana Republican and his co-sponsors should give up their federal contribution voluntarily if they are so concerned with the program.\n\n\u201cSen. Vitter has happily allowed the federal government to pay for a portion of his health insurance for many, many years,\u201d Reid said. \u201cIf Republican senators believe they should bear the full cost of their own health insurance, they can, without any change in the law, \u2026 decline the federal government\u2019s employer contribution and pay their own way. They can even encourage their own staffs to do so. Why they would want do that I don\u2019t understand. But they can do that.\u201d\n\nVitter responded over Twitter to Reid\u2019s long missive.\n\n\u201cYou gave America #Obamacare. Are you still reading it w/ @NancyPelosi to find out what\u2019s in it?\u201d Vitter said. \u201cSo many employees will lose their employer contribution because of #Obamacare. Anyone think @SenatorReid deserves to be exempt?\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Barbara Boxer-David Vitter feud draws blood)\n\nOn the Senate floor, Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) referenced a Vitter vote for a federal contribution to members of Congress and aides. A Senate Democratic aide said that vote was a 2010 roll call on a measure to \u201cmake sure the President, Cabinet Members, all White House Senior staff and Congressional Committee and Leadership Staff are purchasing health insurance through the health insurance exchanges established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThat failed provision included instructions for Capitol Hill staff to receive federal payments for use on exchanges.\n\nRather than exempting Capitol Hill, Reid said the subsidies treat lawmakers and their staff like the rest of U.S. citizens that have a portion of their premiums paid for by their employers.\n\n\u201cIf Sen. Vitter opposes the employer contribution to congressional staffers, does he oppose it also for the 150 million other Americans whose employers help pay their health insurance premiums?\u201d Reid asked.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Vitter: Investigate Reid, Boxer)\n\nVitter\u2019s push to end a \u201cWashington exemption\u201d for thousands of staffers and 535 members of Congress has paralyzed the Senate for a week now as he presses for his amendment to be attached to an unrelated energy efficiency bill.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats alike are annoyed with Vitter\u2019s amendment, with GOP staffers quietly lobbying Democratic aides to ensure the amendment is killed because it would effectively decrease aides\u2019 take home pay. Meanwhile Senate Democrats have been scheming to embarrass Vitter with an amendment that would revive his prostitution scandal or even turn off the subsidies to lawmakers who vote for his amendment.\n\nVitter\u2019s shot back requesting an ethics investigation into Reid and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), arguing those proposed amendments amounted to \u201cbribery.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "His spat with Senate leaders is deepening.", "title": "Vitter's Obamacare feud deepens", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/david-vitters-obamacare-feud-deepens-96927.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/news/110803_david_vitter_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "David Vitter (140),Harry Reid (1755),Congress (2766),Obamacare (387),Capitol Hill (185)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "His spat with Senate leaders is deepening.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc93c9\"", "article_summary": "Vitter's Obamacare feud deepensThe spat between David Vitter and Senate Democratic leaders is deepening.\nRepublicans and Democrats alike are annoyed with Vitter\u2019s amendment, with GOP staffers quietly lobbying Democratic aides to ensure the amendment is killed because it would effectively decrease aides\u2019 take home pay.\nVitter\u2019s shot back requesting an ethics investigation into Reid and Sen.
