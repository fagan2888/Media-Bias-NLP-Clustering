President Obama’s former campaign operation is asking supporters to choose the most “embarrassing” Republican climate change deniers in a March Madness-style fundraising email.

Organizing For Action sent the “Climate Change Fantasy Tournament” message to liberal supporters Monday, asking them to choose among the “Embarrassing Eight,” modeled after the popular playoff brackets in which college basketball fans try to pick the winner of the annual NCAA tournament.

The GOP roster includes Speaker John Boeher of Ohio, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a potential 2016 presidential candidate.

“We’re getting even closer to crowning our champion, the worst climate change denier in the country,” said Jim Messina, Mr. Obama’s 2012 campaign manager, in the email. “These folks have made it this far because they’re deeply committed to publicly denying the science behind climate change.”

He said the advocacy group will “make sure we celebrate the winner — in a very public way — back in their home district.”

The message doubles as a fundraiser. If the viewer chooses Mr. McConnell over Mr. Inhofe, for example, the next screen offers donation options ranging from $15 to $1,000 or more to OFA.
