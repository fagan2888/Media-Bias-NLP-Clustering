Major Pile Up on I-76 in Upper Merion Twp, PA (WPVI)

A pair of multi-car pileups in icy conditions on interstates in the Philadelphia area has claimed at least three lives.

State police in Philadelphia say a crash involving an estimated 30 to 50 vehicles on Interstate 76 early Sunday killed one person. The crash blamed on "flash-freezing" prompted closure of the highway in both directions.

And state police say two people were killed in a crash involving multiple vehicles on Interstate 476.

Both interstates are busy arteries serving communities west of the city. To the east, bridges linking Philadelphia and New Jersey were closed while workers put down more salt, but began reopening by midmorning.

Pennsylvania Department of Transportation spokesman Eugene Blaum called travel conditions "very hazardous."

The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority canceled early bus service in Philadelphia but resumed service late in the morning.
