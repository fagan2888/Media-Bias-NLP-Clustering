â€” Halifax County sheriff's deputies arrested a 16-year-old and charged him with murder in the fatal shooting of a Weldon man.

Dashawn Hendricks, of Weldon, is accused of killing Sequon Starks, 20.

Deputies responding to 1135 Elm St. around 3:30 a.m. Sunday found Starks with a gunshot wound to the torso. He was taken to Halifax Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

Investigators have not said what might have prompted the shooting or how the two might have known one another.

Hendricks was being held without bond. His first court appearance is Tuesday.
