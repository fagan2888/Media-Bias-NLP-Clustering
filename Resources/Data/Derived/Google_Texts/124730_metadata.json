According to its organizers, the focus on children remains.\n\n\u201cOur origins were with youth, and we remain in that basis,\u201d said Ken LaDeaux, president of the Denver March Powwow board. \u201cAt that early age, it begins with education about the diversity of tribes in the U.S. \u2014 we have over 500.\u201d\n\nMore than 1,000 dancers are taking part in the event, which began Friday and lasts through Sunday at the Denver Coliseum. The dancers represent a variety of tribes, dance styles and age groups \u2014 ranging from the \u201cGolden Age,\u201d 60-plus dancers, to the \u201cTiny Tots,\u201d for ages 6 and under.\n\nGrace Gillette, executive director, agreed that childhood participation is key.\n\n\u201cThese children, when they know their roots, when they know where they come from, their path in life is going to a be a strong one and a good one,\u201d Gillette said.\n\nThe event also incorporates about 40 drum groups from across the nation. In 2004, 73 groups registered \u2014 an international record, according to Gillette. She said they didn\u2019t have room for everyone and had to add a registration fee to keep the numbers manageable.\n\nLaDeaux said there is a waiting list for vendors, too. About 180 booths circle the coliseum, offering products from handmade crafts and jewelry to fine arts and raw materials.\n\n\u201cIt kicks off the powwow season,\u201d said Jordynn Lee Paz, this year\u2019s Denver March Powwow princess. Paz, whose Crow name is One Who Puts Others Before Herself, said she\u2019ll attend 25 to 30 similar events in the coming months.\n\nThe Denver March Powwow continues Sunday, with doors opening at 10 a.m. The Grand Entry begins around 11 a.m., followed by intertribal dancing competitions. In the afternoon, the 2015 princess will be crowned, and dance contest winners will be announced. Gillette urged everyone to attend.\n\n\u201cThe misconception is that it\u2019s just for natives, but it\u2019s not,\u201d Gillette said. \u201cThe indigenous people of the North American continent are not a thing of the past. \u2026 Their culture is alive and thriving today.\u201d\n\nAnna Gauldin: 303-954-1666, agauldin@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver March Powwow carries culture through generations", "title": "Denver March Powwow carries culture through generations", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/21/denver-march-powwow-carries-culture-through-generations/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150321__032115_POWWOW_JCW_1881xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150321__032115_POWWOW_JCW_1881xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-21T15:34:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:52:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2aee\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt kicks off the powwow season,\u201d said Jordynn Lee Paz, this year\u2019s Denver March Powwow princess.\n\u201cOur origins were with youth, and we remain in that basis,\u201d said Ken LaDeaux, president of the Denver March Powwow board.\nThe Denver March Powwow continues Sunday, with doors opening at 10 a.m.\nNow, four decades later, the Denver March Powwow is one of the largest annual celebrations of American Indian culture in the country, representing nearly 100 tribes from the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nThe dancers represent a variety of tribes, dance styles and age groups \u2014 ranging from the \u201cGolden Age,\u201d 60-plus dancers, to the \u201cTiny Tots,\u201d for ages 6 and under."}
