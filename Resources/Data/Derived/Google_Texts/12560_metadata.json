One would be tempted to dismiss such scribblements as ridiculous, but six out of 10 Americans do believe in Satan. Christianity, that multilevered vehicle for the dissemination of \u201cblind and naked ignorance,\u201d has warped the minds of a majority of Americans, and Barber\u2019s blog reflects (sadly) mainstream religious convictions.\n\nBy a tragicomic process of inversion, thus, we have to take Barber seriously, precisely because we would be inclined to disregard him as deeply un-serious, and thereby fail to appreciate the increasing threat that Christianity poses to our Constitutionally godless Republic. The latest reification of this faith-based menace: the proliferating \u201creligious freedom restoration acts.\u201d Nor should we forget the already shockingly successful stealth campaign underway to circumvent Roe v. Wade and deprive women of rights over their own bodies. Both RFRAs and restrictions on abortions are the products, largely, of evangelicals whose names should go down in infamy, but who, like Barber, at least out in the red states, bask in the light of benevolence as \u201cpeople of faith.\u201d\n\nOn April 26, in response to my recent Salon article denouncing the rancid mire of superstitious gobbledygook in which our presidential candidates are wallowing, Barber published \u201cWill Christians Be Fitted with Yellow Crosses?\u201d The arguments he makes against my expos\u00e9 are as foolish as they are grounded in widely held misconceptions regarding atheism and the nature of reality itself, and so merit rebuttal \u2013 a task I find both pleasant and entertaining.\n\nAfter a desultory prolegomenon in which Barber inveighs against \u201cthe secular left\u2019s utter disdain for both our Creator Christ and His faithful followers,\u201d fumes over long-overdue progressive challenges to various discriminatory laws he supports, and warns about \u201cAmerica\u2019s cultural Marxist agents of ruin\u201d and the \u201cacidic bile\u201d of \u201cunfiltered \u2018progressivism,\u2019\u201d he labels me a \u201cGod-denying goose-stepper\u201d and \u201cparagon of paganism\u201d who \u201cably puts the \u2019bigot\u2019 in anti-Christian bigotry.\u201d\n\nAccusations of \u201cbigotry,\u201d trotted out with the intent to silence, should still the tongue of no outspoken atheist. We attack not religious folks as people, but the irrationality inherent in their religion, which is nothing more than hallowed ideology, and therefore is, or should be, as much fair game as, say, socialism. Would Evangelicals heed calls to \u201crespect\u201d Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (who has just announced his candidacy for 2016) and avoid engaging in \u201canti-socialist\u201d bigotry with regard to his political views? Of course not. Nor should they, necessarily, if they disagree with him. Being a socialist, just like being a Christian, is a matter of choice, save one important fact: at least socialism constitutes a coherent ideology to which nothing resembling the benighted principle of \u201cCredo quia absurdum\u201d (I believe because it is absurd) has ever applied.\n\nAll those who, in the public arena, advance Christianity\u2019s bizarre supernatural propositions about our world and our origins, and worse, use them to justify legislation, should expect relentless demands for evidence from rationalists. But before Barber or other faith-addled folks take to their keyboards and type out what is usually their first argument against atheism, I\u2019ll dispense with it myself. Yes, we atheists freely admit that no one can epistemologically prove there is no God. But the strength of our convictions should match the validity of the evidence on which they are founded. Shelley put it succinctly: \u201cGod is an hypothesis, and, as such, stands in need of proof: the onus probandi rests on the theist.\u201d Verse and chapter cited from a potentially unreliable translation of a supposedly holy book composed millennia ago by unknown humans cannot pass as \u201cproof.\u201d But if there is no real evidence to support belief in God, there\u2019s plenty to assume He is nothing but a figment (if a vengeful and despotic one) of our overactive imagination \u2014 a product, mostly, of our fear of death. Again, it\u2019s up to believers to justify themselves, not atheists.\n\nBut back to Barber\u2019s blog.\n\nBarber takes issue with my statement about \u201cThe electorate\u2019s gradual, relentless ditching of religion.\u201d This has been well documented in surveys, to which I link in my essay. Unable to refute them, Barber reminds us that that \u201cover 80 percent of Americans identify as Christian\u201d (which I had acknowledged), and then goes on to claim that \u201cthe vast majority of those who don\u2019t . . . nevertheless acknowledge[e] the transcendent reality of a Creator God.\u201d A Gallup poll conducted last year blows apart this contention: 42 percent of all Americans now believe God created the universe, down from 47 percent in 2000, with 19 percent (up from 9 percent in 2000) of all Americans holding that God had nothing to do with it. So even among those purporting to believe in him, the \u201cGod as Creator\u201d idea is losing out.\n\nBarber then chooses to embarrass himself with a declaration that confirms he should stick to batting in the Little League of modern-day thinkers:\n\nEvery man, woman and child understands through both general revelation and human reason that this unfathomably intricate, staggeringly fine-tuned universe didn\u2019t create and fine-tune itself. It\u2019s a tiny minority of angry, self-deluded materialists like Jeffrey Tayler who deny this self-evident truth.\n\nMany believers might indeed find such a boner-studded profession of ignorance credible (and surely Barber does, given that he earned all three of his degrees at religious institutions), but secularists who read grown-up books will immediately see how it contradicts what physics and biology tell us about the cosmos. The universe, we now know, did create itself, arising out of a quantum event \u2013 a \u201csingularity,\u201d when time and space were wrapped into one \u2014 some 13.7 billion years ago, exploding from a tiny speck of unimaginably dense, hot matter to its present dimensions. (And it\u2019s still expanding.) Some four billion years back, it is postulated that a still-unexplained chemical occurrence gave rise to the first self-replicating biological molecule from which began life on Earth and from which we evolved according to the (eminently comprehensible) process of Natural Selection. This renders God, as Richard Dawkins put it, \u201can excrescence, a carbuncle on the face of science,\u201d unnecessary for any phase of \u201ccreation.\u201d (For more information, Barber might wish to set aside his magic book and delve into the oeuvre of the theoretical physicists Lawrence Krauss and Stephen Hawking, and, of course, Dawkins\u2019 own \u201cThe God Delusion.\u201d)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Way too many of us believe in a magic book negated by science and peppered with all manner of misanthropic myths", "author": "Jeffrey Tayler", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Way too many of us believe in a magic book negated by science and peppered with all manner of misanthropic myths", "title": "Ted Cruz, our ayatollah: Fight back now, or welcome to the 2016 religious right hellstorm", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/03/ted_cruz_our_ayatollah_fight_back_now_or_welcome_to_the_2016_religious_right_hellstorm/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/ted_cruz_church.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Way too many of us believe in a magic book negated by science and peppered with all manner of misanthropic myths", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/ted_cruz_church.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz, our ayatollah: Fight back now, or welcome to the 2016 religious right hellstorm", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Ted Cruz, our ayatollah: Fight back now, or welcome to the 2016 religious right hellstorm", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Christianity, Editor's Picks, Religion, Richard Dawkins, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "One would be tempted to dismiss such scribblements as ridiculous, but six out of 10 Americans do believe in Satan.\nSo even among those purporting to believe in him, the \u201cGod as Creator\u201d idea is losing out.\nChristianity, that multilevered vehicle for the dissemination of \u201cblind and naked ignorance,\u201d has warped the minds of a majority of Americans, and Barber\u2019s blog reflects (sadly) mainstream religious convictions.\nBut the strength of our convictions should match the validity of the evidence on which they are founded.\nYes, we atheists freely admit that no one can epistemologically prove there is no God."}
