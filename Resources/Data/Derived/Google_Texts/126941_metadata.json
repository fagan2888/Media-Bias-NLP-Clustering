It\u2019s a hidden tax.\u201d\n\nSpecifically in the realm of health care, Kloster pointed to the effects that medical malpractice lawsuits can have on the price of insurance and medical services. Doctors must have insurance to protect from lawsuits involving patients who may not be able to prove that their harm was related to the one doctor\u2019s procedure.\n\nThe ease with which patients can bring lawsuits against their former doctors\u2014specifically in \u201cjudicial hellholes\u201d\u2014ultimately affects consumers.\n\n\u201cTo account for the fact that there are these \u2018judicial hellholes\u2019 across the country, insurance companies raise the rates for covering doctors, and that\u2019s passed along to customers,\u201d Kloster said.\n\nIn part through its list, the American Tort Reform Association also seeks to push back on the influence trial lawyers have on state legislatures.\n\n\u201c[O]ur \u2018Judicial Hellholes\u2019 program since 2002 has been documenting troubling developments in jurisdictions where civil court judges systematically apply laws and court procedures in an unfair and unbalanced manner, generally to the disadvantage of defendants,\u201d Tiger Joyce, president of the American Tort Reform Association, said in a statement.\n\nHere are the \u201cjudicial hellholes\u201d identified by the American Tort Reform Association.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAccording to the report, California trial lawyers frequently file suits against food and beverage companies and bring asbestos-related suits to the state\u2019s courts.\n\nNew York City Asbestos Litigation\n\nLike Newport News and Hidalgo Counties, the New York City asbestos court is \u201cunfair.\u201d\n\nFlorida\n\nIn the Sunshine State, the Florida Supreme Court strikes down civil justice reforms passed by the state legislature, according to the American Tort Reform Association.\n\nMissouri\n\nAccording to the American Tort Reform Association\u2019s report, Missouri courts allow \u201cjunk science\u201d in trials. Additionally, the plaintiff\u2019s bar, which strikes down civil justice reforms, is very powerful.\n\nMadison County, Ill.\n\nLike Newport News, many asbestos cases are tried in Madison County.\n\nLouisiana\n\nThe 2015 \u201cJudicial Hellholes\u201d report criticized Louisiana for giving lots of power to judges, who are elected officials. Furthermore, the group said the state allows plaintiff\u2019s lawyers to try cases in the court of their choosing.\n\nHidalgo County, Texas\n\nIn this county, the American Tort Reform Association found that trial lawyers have filed more than 10,000 lawsuits against insurance companies in the state. The lawsuits came after hailstorms that occurred in 2012 and 2013.\n\nNewport News, Va.\n\nThe circuit court in Newport News sees many asbestos claims, and according to the \u201cJudicial Hellholes\u201d report, lawyers representing the plaintiffs have the highest win rate in the nation.\n\nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas\n\nAccording to the American Tort Reform Association, the federal court leads the country in patent litigation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taking advantage of tort laws, according to the American Tort Reform Association, can have negative impacts on consumers.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Taking advantage of tort laws, according to the American Tort Reform Association, can have negative impacts on consumers.", "title": "Here Are the 9 \u2018Most Unfair\u2019 Courts for Civil Lawsuits", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151222_JudicialHellhole_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-24T16:09:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1YBzKrh"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Taking advantage of tort laws, according to the American Tort Reform Association, can have negative impacts on consumers.", "title": "Here Are the 9 \u2018Most Unfair\u2019 Courts for Civil Lawsuits", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151222_JudicialHellhole_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-12-23T14:21:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-24T16:09:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "tort reform, American Tort Reform Association, judicial hellholes, Tiger Joyce, Andrew Kloster"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2768\"", "article_summary": "MissouriAccording to the American Tort Reform Association\u2019s report, Missouri courts allow \u201cjunk science\u201d in trials.\nThe group examined courts across the nation and determined which civil courts, or \u201cjudicial hellholes,\u201d were the most egregious in applying \u201claws and court procedures in an unfair and unbalanced manner.\u201dMany of the civil courts singled out by the organization lean heavily in favor of the plaintiff, according to the report, and demonstrate what the American Tort Reform Association views as a bias against defendants in civil cases.\nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of TexasAccording to the American Tort Reform Association, the federal court leads the country in patent litigation.\n\u201cWhen you have a place without tort reform, you have have a drag on that growth.\nHidalgo County, TexasIn this county, the American Tort Reform Association found that trial lawyers have filed more than 10,000 lawsuits against insurance companies in the state."}
