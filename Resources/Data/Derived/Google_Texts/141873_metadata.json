View Full Caption Shuttersock/Stuart Jenner\n\nMANHATTAN \u2014 With a quarter-million New Yorkers newly covered by health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, a rush of patients are now on the hunt for primary care doctors.\n\nChoosing a physician isn\u2019t always easy \u2014 but it is key to good health, experts say.\n\nDr. Matthew Weissman, chief medical officer for the Community Healthcare Network, which sees 75,000 patients a year at its 11 low-cost medical centers, said his organization had already seen an uptick in patients making appointments for primary doctor visits.\n\nThat's likely to continue. Roughly 240,000 people were enrolled through the state\u2019s official health plan marketplace by Dec. 30 \u2014 and open enrollment continues through March 31.\n\nDr. Ashley Roman, an OB/GYN at NYU Langone consults her patients in the office to assist with their pregnancy.

Find an office that is organized and well-run\n\nMany health insurance plans require primary care doctors be your first step before you can see a specialist, by requiring them to give you a referral first. In effect, your primary care doctor becomes your \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d Mattei explained.\n\n\u201cYou need to know how efficient your primary doctor's office is in making those necessary referrals happen,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOnce, I personally had to make nine phone calls just to get a referral to a specialist for a critical examination. No one should ever have to deal with that kind of stressful nonsense, especially when experiencing a medical concern.\u201d\n\n2. Make sure your doctor is accessible by phone or via the web, especially after hours\n\n\u201cYou have to make sure someone is on call 24 hours a day,\u201d Weissman said. That's especially important, for example, if you end up in the emergency room at 3 a.m. and you or the hospital need to reach your primary care provider.\n\n3. Figure out what you want from a doctor\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the doctor, but also about the practice, and in New York there are a range of options.\n\nAt the very high-end, there\u2019s the rarefied world of \u201cconcierge medicine,\u201d in which patients pay annual fees that can cost upwards of $25,000 for personalized attention always at the ready.\n\nAt the other end, providers such as the Community Health Network offer a sliding scale and includes a range of practitioners, including nutritionists to give diet advice and even social workers to help deal with landlord issues, for example.\n\n\u201cWe see that all as part of the package of providing good health,\u201d Weissman said.\n\n3. Find a doctor who is board-certified\n\nExternal credentials are important when it comes to selecting a doctor, but many patients may be surprised to find out that their doctors may not be board-certified, a voluntary credential that means a physician has met a nationally-recognized set of standards.\n\nWhile doctors can, and do, practice without a board certification, most doctors and patient advocates agree that board certification is the \"bare minimum,\" Weissman noted.

Check for other credentials from oversight groups\n\nSome doctors and ambulatory care facilities have recently adopted a practice common to hospitals, seeking an extra \u201cgood housekeeping\u201d seal of approval through Patient-Centered Medical Home recognition and/or Joint Commission accreditation. This means that they pay to have inspectors come in to look at how an office is run in terms of patient safety, Weissman said.\n\nNot all practices do this, he added, but \u201cit\u2019s a nice touch.\u201d\n\n5. Ensure that a provider has the right bedside manner for you\n\nIt\u2019s important to find a physician you can relate to, who is responsive to your values, verbal cues and body language, Weissman said.\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to have someone who understands how to deliver information in a way that you can digest, whether it\u2019s in the form of handouts or having you repeat instructions if needed, he explained.\n\n\u201cYou want someone who really spends the time with you and is approachable if you have questions and there\u2019s a way to get in touch with them,\u201d he added.\n\n6. Understand a doctor\u2019s philosophy\n\nSome doctors, for example, may be quick to prescribe antibiotics or refer patients to specialists, while others may take a more wait-and-see approach.\n\n\u201cYou want to know a doctor\u2019s philosophy before you get sick,\u201d Weissman advised, adding that it also helps to know whether a doctor often sends patients to specialists or prefers to handle matters in-office.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "description": "With thousands of New Yorkers newly insured, many patients are looking for primary care doctors.", "application-name": "DNAinfo", "og": {"url": "https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140114/lower-east-side/how-find-primary-care-doctor-under-obamacare", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/photo/2014/01/patient-doctor-1389212420.jpg/extralarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "site_name": "DNAinfo New York", "description": "With thousands of New Yorkers newly insured, many patients are looking for primary care doctors.", "title": "How to Find a Primary Care Doctor Under Obamacare"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"site": "@DNAinfo", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "DNAinfo", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-70x70px.png", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "54902139,1379988119,575522805,108424,5519941,48600120,112261,662865465", "app_id": 153948644632011}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Lower East Side,New York City,West Harlem,Health & Wellness,Matthew Weissman,Suzanne Mattei,Community Healthcare Network,Affordable Care Act,doctors,health insurance,New York Health Benefits Exchange,New York State of Health,New Yorkers for Patient and Fa", "google-site-verification": "AYA-4dHbK-igtSqpqIYyKuCbHO3o3KourjkrAnfCeZc", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-150x150.png", "googletag": {"topic": "health-wellness", "tags": "health-insurance,obamacare,doctors,new-yorkers-for-patient-family-empowerment,affordable-care-act,new-york-health-benefits-exchange,new-york-state-of-health", "places": "community-healthcare-network", "people": "matthew-weissman,suzanne-mattei"}}, "article_summary": "In effect, your primary care doctor becomes your \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d Mattei explained.\n\u201cYou need to know how efficient your primary doctor's office is in making those necessary referrals happen,\u201d she said.\nView Full Caption Shuttersock/Stuart JennerMANHATTAN \u2014 With a quarter-million New Yorkers newly covered by health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, a rush of patients are now on the hunt for primary care doctors.\nThat's especially important, for example, if you end up in the emergency room at 3 a.m. and you or the hospital need to reach your primary care provider.\nBut credentials aren\u2019t necessarily enough, she said, noting that the \u201cefficiency\u201d of a doctor\u2019s office is also key."}
