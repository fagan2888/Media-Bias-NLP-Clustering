REUTERS/Larry Downing\n\n4442373\n\nThe Associated Press released a fact check of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2015 State of the Union address, and their analysis is not kind to Obama\u2019s claims. (RELATED: Washington Post Fact Checker: Obama Flip-Flopped On Executive Amnesty)\n\nAmong the claims the AP finds less than truthful in the piece, entitled \u201cFACT CHECK: Obama claims credit for an incomplete recovery\u201c:\n\n\u201cAt this moment \u2013 with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry and booming energy production \u2013 we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.\u201d\n\nActually, the AP notes, \u201cBy many measures, the economy is still recovering from the deep scars left by the Great Recession.\u201d Unemployment has been steadily decreasing, but that\u2019s driven primarily by a growth in low paying jobs and people leaving the labor market. There are still 1.7 million fewer workers with full-time jobs than in December 2007 when the recession began.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college \u2014 to zero.\u201d\n\nThe cost of community college isn\u2019t being lowered to zero, the costs will simply be shifted elsewhere. The AP estimates it would cost \u201can estimated $60 billion over 10 years to the treasury.\u201d Furthermore, the plan would require states to contribute a quarter of tuition, and not all students would qualify.\n\n\n\n\u201cWages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small-business owners plan to raise their employees\u2019 pay than at any time since 2007.\u201d\n\nWhile business owners are indeed reporting that they \u201cplan\u201d to increase wages, \u201cthere is scant evidence that it is happening yet.\u201d (RELATED: Reminder: Income Inequality Got WORSE Under Obama)\n\nBy contrast, the AP only highlighted one claim from Iowa Senator Joni Ernst\u2019s Republican response to the State of the Union: her claim that Obamacare was a \u201cfailed policy.\u201d In the AP\u2019s eyes, \u201cthe jury is still out\u201d on the Affordable Care Act, which has led to 10 million getting insurance, but higher costs for many.\n\nFollow Alex Griswold on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Griswold", "description": "The Associated Press released a fact check of President Barack Obama's 2015 State of the Union address, and their analysis is not kind to Obama's claims.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Associated Press released a fact check of President Barack Obama's 2015 State of the Union address, and their analysis is not kind to Obama's claims.
