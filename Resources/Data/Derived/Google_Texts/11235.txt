Amid all the talk about terrorism, mass shootings, a second war in Iraq, religious extremists, abortion, refugees, Chinese competition, income inequality, police brutality, and climate change, it’s easy to forget that America faces yet another government shutdown. Indeed: unless Congress comes to a compromise, the government will shut down on Friday.

This will be Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan’s very first shutdown fight as House Speaker—everyone, send him flowers to congratulate him!—and according to CNN, the former budget hawk plans on making the entire messy process less “drama”-filled than it has been in years past: in a closed-door meeting, he reportedly told the House Republicans that he would attempt to make this budget fight, poorly timed for the end of the year, less of a “crap sandwich” than it normally is. (This involves handing over several of the negotiations to his committee chairs, reconciling Senate and House riders, and basically crossing his fingers, hoping that he’ll get a somewhat reasonable bill to pass on to the president by Friday.)

Though people initially believed that the fight would be over defunding Planned Parenthood and repealing Obamacare—two things that would never happen as long as Barack Obama is around to veto those bills—the 2016 budget fight’s immediate focus will be on national security and managing the Syrian refugee crisis: several House conservatives want to dismantle Obama’s program to resettle 10,000 refugees to America.

While normal budget fights already have high stakes, this time, Congress cannot prolong it as much as they have in previous battles: the legislature officially goes on holiday starting December 18, giving them only one chance to extend funding past Friday, and no matter how passionate each side is about getting their special projects funded or defunded, no one wants to miss the holidays. No one. So basically, whoever continues to keep the government defunded will be shunned for their lack of holiday spirit.
