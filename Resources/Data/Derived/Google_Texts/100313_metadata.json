Unlike the process on New York\u2019s Ellis Island , where early 20th-century immigrants afflicted with benign non-communicable conditions like varicose veins, hernias, and poor vision were denied entry, this president must think humanitarianism is best exhibited by exposing healthy Americans to foreigners with contagious genital lesions.\n\nIn 2009, the president pulled HIV from the list of diseases that bar immigrants from coming to the U.S. Now, according to a report issued by the nonpartisan Center for Immigration Studies, Obama\u2019s Health and Human Services has publicly stated that the cost of handling and treating immigrants with STDs does not impact taxpayers in a significant way.\n\nMoreover, even though, by nature, venereal disease is contagious, the Obama administration has decreed that specific communicable diseases are no longer \u201cof public health significance.\u201d Unfortunately, that opinion applies only to those who are thankfully not among the victims sexually abused by one of the 2,000 illegals in Texas, who, with or without a sore on their private parts, were deported because of sex crimes.\n\nThat \u201cnot \u2026 in a significant way\u201d guarantee comes from the same government that had a virtual non-response when undocumented workers illegally employed in places like Chipotle passed along pathogens, which, sorry to say, were likely transported into customers\u2019 intestines via Crispy Corn Tacos contaminated with human feces.\n\nSo, if having an oozing genital sore does not prohibit a person entry into the U.S., how is the Obama administration going to ensure that immigrants, who tend to gravitate toward food service, diligently follow proper hygiene protocol after manhandling their genitalia?\n\nThey\u2019re not.\n\nLaw 360, a website tool for those in the legal profession, reported that under the new immigration rule, despite being infected with a sexually transmitted disease, persons will still be granted entry into the U.S. with things like granuloma inguinale, which is spread through vaginal and anal intercourse; chancroid, which produces a contagious fluid; and bloody/pus-forming lymphogranuloma venereum, a bacterium common in Central and South America.\n\nHHS maintains that although these three bacterial infections are \u201ctransmitted through sexual contact, [they] have never been common in the United States and over the past two decades are observed to be increasingly rare throughout the world.\u201d\n\nThat said, it appears as if importing individuals afflicted with abscesses on their genitals may just be HHS\u2019s way of assisting Obama\u2019s ongoing effort to level the playing field. And if that\u2019s the case, pioneering STD sufferers with a mind to relocate will have easy access into a country where, with the government\u2019s help, they are free to pursue a vigorous sex life. Then, after those who are currently uncontaminated become contaminated, Barack can pat himself on the back for making another thing that\u2019s \u201cnever been common in the United States\u201d common.\n\nIn any case, similar health- and wealth-sharing processes have already been underway for almost eight years. By admitting what was once inadmissible, Barack Obama\u2019s effort to turn America into a third-world hellhole has thus far been quite effective. For example, syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, and leprosy are still on America\u2019s list of inadmissible communicable diseases. Nonetheless, along with the unmonitored influx of illegals came syphilis and gonorrhea, both of which are currently on the rise. As for leprosy, that nasty organism has officially landed, as have plagues like the deadly multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and death-defying super-lice. Maybe the president\u2019s rationale is that in the ongoing quest to dilute what little is left of American culture, citizens contracting exotic third-world diseases, or being infected with an STD from a hardworking immigrant, is a tolerable tradeoff.\n\nIn an article entitled \u201cObama Opens the Border to More STDs,\u201d Jon Feere of The Center for Immigration Studies said that the administration considers the STD rule changes beneficial because physicians who would otherwise be administering physical exams on incoming immigrants \u201cwill be able to devote more time and training to other, more common and/or more serious health issues.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s brilliant! If HHS is to be taken seriously, STDs are being permitted to arrive aboard the genitals of immigrants to further the common good. In other words, rather than wasting time running a whole battery of tests on pilgrims with penile pustules, stressed out Obamacare doctors will be freed up to focus on more severe health issues.\n\nAnd just because the immigration system will be less likely to protect Americans from communicable diseases, Jon Feere writes that when it comes to STDs, Americans are \u201cnot to worry\u201d because:\n\nHHS \u2026 explains that these 'primarily tropical infections can be prevented through improved personal hygiene and protected sex' and that if you do get them, the STDs can be cured 'with a short, uncomplicated course of antibiotic therapy.\u2019\n\nWait! Can Cipro also cure beheading? Because that sounds reminiscent of the reasoning behind accepting Syrian refugees with the full knowledge that the incoming group will likely be infected with a smattering of saber-bearing subversives.\n\nEither way, notwithstanding the inevitability that ISIS will probably lop off a few heads, when did providing antibiotics and hand-washing seminars to sexually promiscuous immigrants become America\u2019s priority? Furthermore, aren\u2019t our veterans dying on VA waiting lists, and isn\u2019t there an impending antibiotic shortage?\n\nEven still, Barack Obama, who knows better, obviously feels that spending $100 million a year to care for immigrants with STDs is a great way to invest the money of those who will ultimately end up suffering as a result of yet another in a long list of imprudent policies.\n\nAnd so, on the path to \u201cfundamental transformation,\u201d it\u2019s nice to know that if an immigrant with a seething chancroid ulcer should happen to rape an American, the ill-fated event can be promptly remedied by an \u201cuncomplicated course of antibiotic therapy.\u201d\n\nJeannie hosts a blog at www.jeannie-ology.com.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/02/obama_embraces_illegals_with_stds.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Obama embraces illegals with STDs"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "By admitting what was once inadmissible, Barack Obama\u2019s effort to turn America into a third-world hellhole has thus far been quite effective.\nSadly, the latest segment in Barack Obama\u2019s national makeover includes granting access to the U.S. to immigrants with venereal diseases.\nIf HHS is to be taken seriously, STDs are being permitted to arrive aboard the genitals of immigrants to further the common good.\nNonetheless, along with the unmonitored influx of illegals came syphilis and gonorrhea, both of which are currently on the rise.\nWhat\u2019s next \u2013 based on their skill set on the open sea, Obama unilaterally invites Somali pirates to be the official captains of America\u2019s tugboats?"}
