It is our chance to give back to our community,\u201d she said.Denning said the pow wow is supported by the 11 federally recognized tribes and bands of Wisconsin, who support the pow wow and recognize that Milwaukee has the largest population of Natives in the state.\n\nThe pow wow is by no means Native inclusive. Denning said that the community extends to foreign visitors coming from Canada, England, Germany, France and Australia.\n\nLocal and foreign guests will be entertained by the Ballet Folklorico Mexico de los Hermanos Avila, an Aztec dance troupe, and Strawberry Moon Singers, a 12-women hand drum group known for its healing songs.\n\nVideo of Winter Pow Wow - Aztec Fire Dance\n\nLeonard Malatare (Confederated Salish & Kootenai of the Flathead Indian Reservation) is the pow wow\u2019s MC; Ronnie Preston (Apache), arena director; and Wazi Jaci (Ho-Chunk), host drum.
