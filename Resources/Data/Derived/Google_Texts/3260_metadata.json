He was appointed Sept. 1 by the Board of Supervisors, which this week approved a contract paying him a $418,184.85 annual salary.\n\nWhile he admitted to taking a \u201cnon-traditional career trajectory\u201d for a hospital CEO, Gray said he believes his experience at the county hospital gives him a unique vantage point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen Natividad in many different lights and I understand the transformation that has occurred over the past decade,\u201d he said. \u201cMy fear is someone else would take our current success for granted. That\u2019s why I wanted this job. I think it\u2019s important to have someone with a historical perspective.\u201d\n\nGray, 52, earned his doctorate in osteopathic medicine from the University of Osteopathic Medicine and Health Sciences in Des Moines, Iowa, before completing his residency and an internship in family medicine at Womack Army Medical Center in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and a short stint in private practice in Denver.\n\nGray first came to Monterey County when he got married in Pacific Grove in 1988. He returned to work as an Army staff physician at Fort Ord and the Presidio of Monterey in the early 1990s, and says he never forgot the area\u2019s charm.\n\nWhen a position became available at Natividad, Gray said he jumped at the chance. In addition to returning to the area, he said the safety net hospital\u2019s mission held a particular appeal.\n\n\u201cI really believe in primary care and I really believe in access, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all about,\u201d Gray said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring his time at Natividad, Gray has served in a number of administrative roles, including director of the family medicine residency program, chief of staff and chief medical officer, as well as interim CEO since February. Gray took over as interim CEO from Dr. Kelly O\u2019Keefe, a member of the hospital board who stepped in for former CEO Harry Weis who left abruptly last summer.\n\nSupervisor Dave Potter, who has served on the Natividad board for nearly a decade, said Gray\u2019s professional expertise and an extensive knowledge of the hospital\u2019s operations, along with his rapport with physicians and medical staff, his knowledge of the community, and his work on the trauma center and dealing with changes under the Affordable Care Act made him the choice to lead the hospital.\n\nGray praised Weis as a \u201cgreat man\u201d for his leadership at the hospital from the time he arrived with the Huron Consulting Group to his work as CEO in solidifying the progress made during the turnaround. Gray said he learned a lot from Weis.\n\nAt the same time, while Weis chafed under county oversight, regularly arguing and maneuvering for more autonomy, Gray described himself as \u201cpretty comfortable\u201d with the hospital\u2019s place as part of a larger organization.\n\nUnder Weis, Natividad began an ambitious capital improvement program that included renovation of an unused section of the hospital as a family medicine clinic operated by the county health department and plans for a remodel of the acute care unit. The hospital has also built its medical staff and service lines in a way that Gray said has helped it strike a balance between treating all patients regardless of the ability to pay and a healthy bottom line.\n\nGray said he believes Natividad is uniquely poised to meet the demands and challenges of national health reform as a result of its business practices and focus on \u201cpopulation health\u201d and hospital-supported physician base.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a dynamic balance of the business side and meeting the health care mission of the institution \u2014 that\u2019s the secret sauce \u2014 and very few safety net hospitals have achieved that balance,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI\u2019m very thankful for that because it allows us to meet our mission.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our legacy, not what happened 14-15 years ago. In time, I hope those days fade into the past and out of memory, and we think of Natividad\u2019s success as the norm.\u201d\n\nGray said he has no plans to join the previous parade of CEOs to stop by Natividad in those bad old days, and hopes to leadlo the hospital until he retires.\n\n\u201cI have no intention of going anywhere. Personally and professionally, this is where I want to be.\u201d\n\nJim Johnson can be reached at 726-4348.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salinas >> New Natividad Medical Center CEO Dr. Gary Gray admits he could never have envisioned where both he and the county-owned hospital would end up when he arrived in 2001.Gray came to Natividad from Georgetown University School of M", "title": "New Natividad CEO has seen good, bad times at county hospital", "og": {"url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20150917/NEWS/150919794", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.montereyherald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NF/20150917/NEWS/150919794/AR/0/AR-150919794.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1033px"}, "type": "article", "title": "New Natividad CEO has seen good, bad times at county hospital"}, "twitter": {"domain": "montereyherald.com", "description": "Salinas >> New Natividad Medical Center CEO Dr. Gary Gray admits he could never have envisioned where both he and the county-owned hospital would end up when he arrived in 2001.Gray came to Natividad from Georgetown University School of M", "title": "New Natividad CEO has seen good, bad times at county hospital", "url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20150917/NEWS/150919794", "image": {"src": "http://www.montereyherald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NF/20150917/NEWS/150919794/AR/0/AR-150919794.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@montereyherald", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id507308258", "iphone": "id507305181", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.montereyherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "z_Top_Story_1, Health", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "z_Top_Story_1, Health"}, "article_summary": "While he admitted to taking a \u201cnon-traditional career trajectory\u201d for a hospital CEO, Gray said he believes his experience at the county hospital gives him a unique vantage point.\nWhen a position became available at Natividad, Gray said he jumped at the chance.\nSalinas >> New Natividad Medical Center CEO Dr. Gary Gray admits he could never have envisioned where both he and the county-owned hospital would end up when he arrived in 2001.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen Natividad in many different lights and I understand the transformation that has occurred over the past decade,\u201d he said.\nAnd Gray has been appointed the hospital\u2019s top administrator after a national search and topping a slate of three finalists."}
