The "Social Circle" is a group effort between readers, social networkers and the OnMilwaukee.com editors. Every Monday, we ask a question via Facebook and Twitter and then post the responses from our Facebook "likers" and Twitter followers in this column. Well-known Milwaukee movers and shakers will contribute, too.

It's finally have-a-drink-on-a-patio season in Milwaukee and so this week's Social Circle question asks about your favorite outdoor spaces for a drink. Where's your top spot?

Below is a sampling of the responses, but to read the entire thread, go here.

What's your favorite? Public patio? Your porch? Beer garden? Anywhere, anytime?

Kelly Briskie: "Benelux."

Andrew Cook: "O'Lydia's is awesome."

Teresa Dickert: "Great Lakes Distillery."

Sean Finnegan: "Wicked Hop is always solid."

Russell Fox: "Outside. Anywhere. Preferably in the shade, on a river."

Joe Ignacio: "My deck."

Nicole Noonan: "Tosa Hollander."

Mary Olson: "Botanas."
