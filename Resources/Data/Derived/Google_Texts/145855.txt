Patients suffering from terminal illnesses are often forced to make the heart-wrenching decision to enter hospice for end of life care. The decision to enter hospice is tragic and sad enough for patients, but now they are being told they are no longer welcome at hospice facilities because of Obamacare.

Michigan’s Hospice of Holland has announced that it is no longer accepting patients.

“The biggest issue under the Affordable Care Act is…that we’re going to see cuts in reimbursement- it’s going to be at least 12 percent. We projected out what those cuts are going to do to the organization long term and we realized that in a short period of time, we’re going to be pulling money from our savings in order to keep the house open,” the Executive Director told WXMI.
