The measure would also allow Massachusetts to collaborate with New England states including Connecticut and Rhode Island in the procurement of hydropower.

Gov. Charlie Baker has filed a bill that calls for the purchase of hydroelectric power by Massachusetts utilities.

Baker called the legislation submitted to the state Senate on Thursday a critical step in reducing the state's carbon footprint while also helping ratepayers by providing a cost effective alternative to coal and oil.

The measure would also allow Massachusetts to collaborate with New England states including Connecticut and Rhode Island in the procurement of hydropower.

The three states had previously announced a joint effort to seek power purchase agreements for hydropower or other types of renewable energy.

Baker's legislation would allow renewable energy sources such as wind power from being included in contracts, provided those resources are supported by hydropower.
