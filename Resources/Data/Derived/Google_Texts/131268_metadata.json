In the late 1960s, Bob Dylan recorded some long, loose, loopy sessions with members of the Band, and for years these demos/field recordings/gag reels were available only on white-label pressings sold under the counter like drugs and pornos, then debated among hardcore Dylanophiles with the vehemence that most people bring to discussions of religion and politics. A handful of songs were released in the mid-1970s, but they had been cleaned up, sussed out and overdubbed with Robbie Robertson\u2019s preening guitar licks. That set only hinted at the shambolic grandeur of the real \u201cBasement Tapes,\u201d which despite being famously hard-to-find seeped into the American subconscious, inspiring generations of artists, at least one feature film (Todd Haynes\u2019 expertly fragmented 2007 biopic \u201cI\u2019m Not There\u201d), and Greil Marcus\u2019 \u201cThe Old Weird America: The World of Bob Dylan\u2019s Basement Tapes,\u201d which stands as one of the best volumes of music criticism in the last 20 years.\n\nBecause we\u2019ve waited nearly half a century for an official release, the new reissue of \u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d \u2014 the 11th volume in Dylan\u2019s vault-clearing Bootleg Series \u2014 arrives in stores with an air of finality, although not for Dylan\u2019s or even for the high eBay bids on bootlegs. Instead, it harkens the end of the CD age itself. Sales are plummeting by the week, and CDs have been upstaged by technologies both older (vinyl) and newer (digital), which means there won\u2019t be many more holiday shopping seasons to gather these tunes in the format that most baby boomers still buy. As well, Columbia Legacy is releasing it in three different packages: a two-disc set for curious fans, a six-disc set for completists, and a vinyl box for whoever is more rabid than completists. In other words, rock\u2019s first great bootleg may be its last great CD box set, which is fitting: \u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d is all about tearing things up and rebuilding them cattywampus.\n\nGenially anarchic and often hilarious, the music of \u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d is so tangled up in the story of \u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d that the two have become inseparable. In 1967, Dylan was recovering from a motorcycle accident that stalled his career, dragged him out of the spotlight, and alleviated the pressure of being a generational mouthpiece for most of the decade. Thoroughly shaken, he retreated to rural New York state, where he and members of his backing band the Hawks set up makeshift studios at Dylan\u2019s house and later in the basement of a rental nicknamed Big Pink. Recuperating from a long world tour during which Dylan unveiled his new electrified sound for antagonistic audiences, the musicians wrote and played and sang and created some of the wildest and wooliest music of the era, with only themselves as the intended audience.\n\nThe result, nearly 50 years later, is a sprawling collection of gloriously half-assed performances, as loose and unguarded as Dylan has ever sounded. They rip through new arrangements of old tunes and old arrangements of new tunes, deconstructing pre-rock folk ballads like \u201cBells of Rhymney\u201d as well as recent hits by Johnny Cash and Hank Williams. They indulge rambling improvisations that would be a stretch to call jams. The tackle doo wop and teen pop, often running through the same song in different musical settings. The mood is loose and amiable, almost drunkenly so at times, yet these sessions produced some of Dylan\u2019s most enduring songs, including \u201cI Shall Be Released,\u201d \u201cMillion Dollar Bash,\u201d \u201cYou Ain\u2019t Goin\u2019 Nowhere\u201d and \u201cTears of Rage\u201d (several of which would appear on the Band\u2019s 1968 debut, \u201cMusic From Big Pink\u201d).\n\nThese aren\u2019t professional recordings, which is exactly the point. When you throw out conventional ideas of good and bad, you get something new and powerfully subversive. The underground means of dissemination\u2014via bootleg rather than official release, favoring the hawker and the pusher rather than the major label\u2014became an extension of that idea, and much of the power of \u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d has traditionally derived from its scarcity. It was something you had to hunt, like wild prey, sly and evasive. Buying a copy of \u201cGreat White Wonder\u201d (the most popular bootleg iteration) made you an outlaw of sorts. Which was only fitting since the musicians were playing these songs like they stole them.\n\nOn the new reissue, Dylan comes across as the ringleader of this motley crew, leading them through a dramatic and even revolutionary reimagining of American folk music. That impression, however, is misleading. Because it\u2019s now part of Dylan\u2019s Bootleg Series, the box set includes only the tracks where Dylan sings lead and ignores those featuring Richard Manuel or any of the other Band vocalists (some of which appear on the 1975 double album, which is not yet redundant). But the Band wasn\u2019t Dylan\u2019s backing band. Instead, he had been absorbed into the collective, the fifth member (sixth, once Levon Helm returned to the fold) in a musical democracy.\n\nThat is crucial, because it\u2019s the same spirit with which they approach American music, where one style holds no more sway than any other style. There is folk and rock, but also country and rockabilly, odd takes on matinee pop and R&B. Traditional Irish and American folk tunes like \u201cOl\u2019 Roison the Beau\u201d and \u201cThe Bells of Rhymney\u201d jostle against pop and country covers like Hank Williams\u2019 \u201cYou Win Again\u201d and the Carter Family\u2019s \u201cWildwood Flower.\u201d For years I thought \u201cI\u2019m Your Teenage Prayer\u201d had to be a cover of some sappy Sinatra crooner\u2019s only obscure hit, because it just sounded too weird to be Dylan\u2019s own composition. Theirs is an egalitarian understanding of American popular music.\n\n\u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d is a weird and contradictory artifact. Although pursued by fans, assessed by critics, and dissected by academics with dogged determination over the years, the music makes a virtue of never taking itself too seriously, and that attitude may be the source of its charm and easygoing genius. Rather than give old-time music the white-glove treatment, they poke some fun at the notion of pop music past or present as \u201cimportant,\u201d which for Dylan seems profound. In the basement of Big Pink, he could make stuff up on the spot. He could goof off, crack a joke or two, smirk and insinuate \u2014 all without the expectation of making some grand pronouncement. On \u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d he sounds like an artist slipping out from under the pressures of his own celebrity, even going so far as to redo his career-making composition \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d as a lowdown rural blues rather than a solemn folk dissension. To listen to it is to hear Dylan reborn into a craftier and much slyer artist, closer to the squirrelly old man he is today than to the earnest, angry young man he was in the \u201860s.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Latest edition of Dylan's bootleg series is essential, and a tough comparison for a new Costello/Jim James project", "title": "Bob Dylan\u2019s unguarded moment: The glorious subversion of the new \u201cBasement Tapes\u201d box set", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Latest edition of Dylan's bootleg series is essential, and a tough comparison for a new Costello/Jim James project", "title": "Bob Dylan\u2019s unguarded moment: The glorious subversion of the new \u201cBasement Tapes\u201d box set", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/15/bob_dylans_unguarded_moment_the_glorious_subversion_of_the_new_basement_tapes_box_set/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/bob_dylan_basement_tapes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Latest edition of Dylan's bootleg series is essential, and a tough comparison for a new Costello/Jim James project", "title": "Bob Dylan\u2019s unguarded moment: The glorious subversion of the new \u201cBasement Tapes\u201d box set", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/bob_dylan_basement_tapes.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Stephen Deusner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Basement Tapes, Bob Dylan, Editor's Picks, Elvis Costello, Hank Williams, Jim James, Johnny Cash, Music, New Basement Tapes, Old Crow Medicine Show, Robbie Robertson, T Bone Burnett, The Band", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Genially anarchic and often hilarious, the music of \u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d is so tangled up in the story of \u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d that the two have become inseparable.\n\u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d is a weird and contradictory artifact.\nTopics: Basement Tapes, Bob Dylan, Editor's Picks, Elvis Costello, Hank Williams, Jim James, Johnny Cash, Music, New Basement Tapes, Old Crow Medicine Show, Robbie Robertson, T Bone Burnett, The Band, Entertainment News\u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d is the most notorious bootleg in the history of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\nIn other words, rock\u2019s first great bootleg may be its last great CD box set, which is fitting: \u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d is all about tearing things up and rebuilding them cattywampus.\nBut the Band wasn\u2019t Dylan\u2019s backing band."}
