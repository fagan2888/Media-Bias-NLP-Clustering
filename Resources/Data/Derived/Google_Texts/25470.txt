A local club hosted a miniature golf event for local kids Saturday.

The Panama City optimist club hosted 40 kids from local organizations like the Boys and Girls club and the Children's Advocacy Center for a round of mini golf.

Hidden Lagoon Mini Golf donated a round of golf and lunch to each of the kids.

All of the children were sponsored by local individuals and businesses.

"The whole idea is to let them have a day out to do whatever they want to do and just enjoy it, have fun, no costs, no worries, no stress," explained Rick Cooper, the President of the Panama City Optimist Club.

Sherry Melton, the Chairperson for the event added, "For them to be able to come out today and just be kids and have fun really means a lot to them and it means a lot to us to be able to give that."

This is the first time the Optimist club hosted this event and they hope to do another one in the fall.
