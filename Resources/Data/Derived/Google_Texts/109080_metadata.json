Rand Paul of Kentucky said his \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d bids to loosen gun laws in the District of Columbia and beat back terrorism prove that he is a Republican presidential contender who will fight to bring \u201cmuch-needed change\u201d to Washington.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who must defend her seat next year, managed to knock the Affordable Care Act while trying to preserve the women\u2019s health care services amid controversy over Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion practices.\n\nPHOTOS: See Obama's biggest White House fails\n\nIndeed, there was something for everyone in Republicans\u2019 successful effort last week to finally dispatch a health care repeal bill to President Obama\u2019s desk.\n\nThe fast-track legislation, which passed on a 52-47 vote near party lines, would dismantle Obamacare and strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood for one year in the wake of videos showing organization officials negotiating sales of fetal body parts, raising the stakes for Republican incumbents who might worry that women would have to scramble for non-abortion services.\n\nEveryone knew the bill was doomed by Mr. Obama\u2019s veto pledge and was purely a messaging vehicle ahead of pivotal elections.\n\nPHOTOS: Top 10 handguns in the U.S.\n\nFirst and foremost, congressional Republicans can say they are battle-tested and ready to use the budget process known as \u201creconciliation\u201d to scrap Obamacare on a majority vote in 2017 without having to overcome Democrat-led filibusters that have doomed every previous repeal effort.\n\nThey said they were fulfilling a pledge that they made to voters who handed them the keys to Congress in last year\u2019s midterm elections and that Mr. Obama will have to defend a law that has been linked to rising premiums, high out-of-pocket costs and swiftly failing co-op plans.\n\nBut Democrats didn\u2019t leave empty-handed. The budget process that brought the bill to passage allowed them to offer amendments, forcing Republican incumbents to take politically difficult positions on gun control and women\u2019s health funding before they defend their seats in a presidential election year.\n\nDarrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said, \u201cParties live to put candidates on record with controversial issues.\n\n\u201cThat allows opponents to put out specific votes for campaign ads. That puts them on the defensive and have to explain those votes,\u201d he said. \u201cCandidates sometimes lose elections based on these issues.\u201d\n\nNew Hampshire Democrats took a two-for-one swipe at Sen. Kelly Ayotte \u2014 a Republican running for re-election against Maggie Hassan, a Democrat and current governor \u2014 and Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican running for president.\n\n\u201cThis is a vote to take away health care coverage for more than 40,000 people in New Hampshire,\u201d said former New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairwoman Kathy Sullivan.\n\nRepublicans say their measure simply winds down the coverage that had been extended to people making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, so it will have time to pass a replacement plan instead of dumping people off their coverage. Also, Ms. Ayotte was able to boast that the repeal bill included $1.5 billion to combat the opioid abuse epidemic that is affecting her state and others.\n\nAnalysts say there may be little political risk for Republicans who have taken shots at Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law. Uninsured people are less likely to be registered voters, and those who suddenly gain coverage under Obamacare might not change their habits.\n\n\u201cIt is a fair bet that in the short term the newly insured will behave politically much like the uninsured have: Many will not vote, and they will continue to represent a very small slice of the electorate,\u201d Drew Altman, president and CEO of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, wrote in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMs. Murkowski is walking a different kind of political tightrope. She joined Republican Sens. Mark Kirk of Illinois and Susan M. Collins of Maine in trying to remove a part of the reconciliation bill that defunds Planned Parenthood. The senators said they feared women would have to scramble to find non-abortion services at other clinics.\n\nThat amendment failed, yet Ms. Murkowski still supported the underlying bill, citing the need to repeal Obamacare.\n\nOthers tried to burnish their credentials for a promotion to the White House.\n\nMr. Paul, one of Mr. Rubio\u2019s competitors for the Republican nomination, tried to stop the U.S. from issuing visas to people from countries with high risks of terrorism. The amendment failed, 10 votes to 89.\n\nHis bid to override D.C. officials and set up a concealed carry program in the city failed to reach a 60-vote threshold, 54-45, but his campaign saw the silver lining in a contest that has been dominated by outsiders vowing to change the ways of Washington.\n\n\u201cThere is a reason that most of America rightfully believes that politicians in Washington are out of touch. Tonight, we witnessed two common-sense pieces of legislation get defeated,\u201d Mr. Paul said, arguing that his colleagues reinforced the status quo on homeland security and kept restrictive gun laws in place. \u201cI will keep fighting to bring much-needed change to our legislative priorities and continue in my efforts to defeat the Washington machine.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats swiftly blasted Senate Republicans up for re-election in 10 states for voting to repeal Obamacare, saying it would \"pull the rug out\" from under thousands of people who are newly eligible for Medicaid coverage in their states.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Democrats swiftly blasted Senate Republicans up for re-election in 10 states for voting to repeal Obamacare, saying it would \u201cpull the rug out\u201d from under thousands of people who are newly eligible for Medicaid coverage in their states.", "title": "Obamacare repeal bill offers something for everyone on Capitol Hill", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/6/obamacare-repeal-bill-offers-something-for-everyon/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/06/RandPaul.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/06/RandPaul.jpg", "description": "Democrats swiftly blasted Senate Republicans up for re-election in 10 states for voting to repeal Obamacare, saying it would \"pull the rug out\" from under thousands of people who are newly eligible fo", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare repeal bill offers something for everyone on Capitol Hill"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Washington"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1064\"", "article_summary": "Also, Ms. Ayotte was able to boast that the repeal bill included $1.5 billion to combat the opioid abuse epidemic that is affecting her state and others.\nEveryone knew the bill was doomed by Mr. Obama\u2019s veto pledge and was purely a messaging vehicle ahead of pivotal elections.\nPHOTOS: See Obama's biggest White House failsIndeed, there was something for everyone in Republicans\u2019 successful effort last week to finally dispatch a health care repeal bill to President Obama\u2019s desk.\nAnalysts say there may be little political risk for Republicans who have taken shots at Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law.\nThat amendment failed, yet Ms. Murkowski still supported the underlying bill, citing the need to repeal Obamacare."}
