â€” Police have charged a Clayton man with swindling Latinos out of more than $50,000, promising to obtain driver's licenses and immigration papers for them before skipping out with their money.

Alfonso Pasillas Carrillo, 24, was charged with 18 counts of obtaining property by false pretense and was being held in the Johnston County jail under a $362,000 bond.

Eighteen people told police that Carrillo charged them $2,500 to $5,000 for the papers between February and September but never delivered.

Police also charged Carrillo in October with impersonating a law enforcement officer.
