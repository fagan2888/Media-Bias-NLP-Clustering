The CFPB refers to this project as TRID, which stands for TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure. TILA is the Truth in Lending Act that was passed in 1968, and RESPA is the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act that was passed in 1974.\n\nIn response to the real estate bubble, and the lending abuses that were part of that, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 created the CFPB and tasked that new agency with combining TILA and RESPA to improve consumer disclosures associated with a real estate lending and settlements. That generated TRID.\n\nAs we reported in our May 13 column on TRID, it was originally slated to go into effect on Aug. 1. We thought that was a pretty aggressive timetable, given that TRID has nearly 2,000 pages of regulations and will fundamentally change how banks, title companies and real estate agents conduct settlement. Apparently a number of like-minded voices were also heard, and the implementation of TRID has been pushed back to Oct. 3, 2015. Not everyone was happy about that, since many of the businesses that would be impacted invested substantial amounts of time and money to be ready by Aug. 1. Nevertheless, the new deadline will give everyone a little more breathing room. The lending and settlement industry is highly computerized, and rewriting all those programs to accommodate TRID is no small matter. In fact, TRID has actually spawned a cottage industry of software companies that help banks, title services and real estate brokers all coordinate the settlement process and meet TRID requirements.\n\nIn our previous column, we noted that the CFPB was still working on the final design of TRID. Now, they have completed much of that work, and we have a much better idea of what TRID will look like.\n\nFirst and foremost, TRID will change what the settlement statements look like. The settlement statement, which is commonly called the HUD-1, used to be only two pages long. Then, the government decided to simplify it and make it clearer. The result was an increase to four pages and a document that in many ways was less clear than the one that preceded it. With TRID, the settlement statement will now become 8 or 9 pages. Another major change is that there will be separate documents for both the buyer and the seller. In the past, the HUD-1 contained all the information necessary for both sides of the transaction.\n\nAlthough doubling the pages makes it sound like the settlement statement will become more complicated, the new forms are actually quite user-friendly. The primary goal in all of this is to help consumers clearly understand how their home loan works and better track the estimates they were given regarding loan costs against the actual numbers they get at settlement. Some tweaking might be required, but we think the new statements are fairly clear, easy to read, and for the most part, they seem to accomplish the stated goals of TRID.\n\nAn additional objective for TRID was to provide borrowers with the disclosure of loan information prior to settlement. The CFPB wanted to reduce the instances where buyers would get to settlement and find that their loan costs were higher than anticipated, but since all their possession were on a moving truck in the parking lot, they didn't have much choice other than to pay up and go to settlement. Under TRID, borrowers must be given the loan disclosure forms three days prior to closing. And, if certain changes are made to the numbers found in the settlement statement, that three day review period must start over, possibly delaying settlement.\n\nAt first, there was a lot of concern about this three day period, because a lot of changes are often made at the last minute, changes that frequently impact the settlement statement. When we wrote our last column, the CFPB wasn't very clear about what changes would be allowed and which ones would not. Since then, we now have more guidance. According to the CFPB website, only three changes will require a new 3-day review period. They include:\n\n1)The APR (annual percentage rate) increases by more than 1/8 of a percent for fixed-rate loans or \u00bc of a percent for adjustable loans. A decrease in APR will not require a new 3-day review if it is based on changes to interest rate or other fees.\n\n2)A prepayment penalty is added, making it expensive to refinance or sell. For us here in Maryland, that's not an issue, because prepayment penalties are not allowed on residential mortgages.\n\n3)The basic loan product changes, such as a switch from fixed-rate to adjustable interest rate or to a loan with interest-only payments.\n\nThe CFPB website says that no other changes will require a new 3-day review period. As an added point of explanation, they note \"There has been much misinformation and mistaken commentary around this point. Any other changes in the days leading up to closing do not require a new 3-day review, although the lender will still have to provide and updated disclosures. For example, the following circumstances do not require a new 3-day review: 1) Unexpected discoveries on a walk-through such as a broken refrigerator or a missing stove, even if they require seller credits to the buyer. 2) Most changes to payments made at closing, including the amount of the real estate commission, taxes and utilities proration, and the amount paid into escrow. 3) Typos found at the closing table.\"\n\nThese clarifications were critical in alleviating many of the fears real estate agents and others in the industry had about TRID. Many settlements are marked by the types of changes the CFPB said would not require a 3-day delay. Had the CFPB included those in the list of what does trigger a new 3-day period, it would have caused a tremendous disruption in how home sales get to settlement. The CFPB requirements with TRID are actually quite reasonable. Importantly though, consumers should realize that this 3-day period is not there as a means for withdrawing from the contract. It is just there to give borrowers time to absorb the information they will be seeing at settlement and give them an opportunity to get more of an explanation about their loan from their lender. The 3-day period is NOT a chance for buyers to change their mind about buying the house. Also, real estate agents should be aware that just because the loan disclosure information must be made available three days prior to closing, that does not mean the money or the loan package will be ready three days before closing. Unfortunately, those important pieces will show up at the last minute like they always have. Consumers might not realize, but the money that funds the loan, pays all the settlement expenses and the documents that guide the whole process, are a just-in-time sort of thing. Agents and settlement officers are often pacing the floor, minutes before settlement, waiting for an email notification that the money and loan package have arrived.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Realities of Real Estate: Update on changes to the settlement process", "Description": "In response to the real estate bubble, and the lending abuses that were part of that, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 created the CFPB and tasked that new agency with combining TILA and RESPA to improve consumer disclosures associated with a real estate lending and settlements.
