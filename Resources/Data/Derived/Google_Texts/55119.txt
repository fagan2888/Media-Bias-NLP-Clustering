The Dallas County elections chief said voting in today’s local election is going smoothly so far.

Some polling stations have had to rearrange their voting booths — the paper ballots don’t fare well in moisture — but the impact so far has been minimal, said Toni Pippins-Poole, the county elections administrator.

“Everything seems to be going fine,” she said. “No other issues.”

She added that this morning’s rain also didn’t seem to impact voter turnout, which is expected to be exceptionally poor based on weak early voting totals.

In fact, some locations — such as Cedar Hill, Duncanville and Rowlett — have had a higher voter turnout so far than other locations, Pippins-Poole said.

“They’re either trying to miss the rain, trying to do it early, or they are some of our core voters that are just going to go out and vote,” she said.

Severe thunderstorms are expected to roll through the area this afternoon.

If paper ballots become too moist to run through the machines, officials will drop them in a secure bin and let them dry before counting them.
