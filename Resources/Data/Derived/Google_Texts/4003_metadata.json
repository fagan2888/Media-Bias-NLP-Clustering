Maryland Health Connection. The Washington Health Benefit Exchange.\n\nEvery one of those state insurance exchanges added new carriers in preparation for Obamacare\u2019s second open enrollment period this fall.\n\nCovered California did not.\n\nInstead, the Golden State took a different approach: Its exchange is getting smaller.\n\nDwindling Participation. Diminished Returns?\n\nWhen Covered California unveiled its initial slate of 13 carriers last year, their low rates got some attention \u2014 but so did their mix.\n\nWhile Covered California couldn\u2019t boast Aetna or UnitedHealthcare, which instead elected to leave the state\u2019s individual market, four major insurers were on board: Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California, Health Net and Kaiser Permanente.\n\nAnd the exchange also had drawn in several smaller health plans, like Ventura County Health Plan, which were going to compete for share on the individual market for the first time.\n\n\u201cFor me, the story is [these] new participants,\u201d Micah Weinberg of the Bay Area Council told California Healthline last summer. \u201cWho exactly they are, and how they are being offered in these marketplaces, is worth watching.\u201d\n\nBut Ventura County quietly pulled out. A second small carrier, Alameda Alliance, was kicked out. And earlier this summer, a third carrier \u2014 Contra Costa Health Plan \u2014 was forced to drop out, citing state rules around offering on- and off-exchange plans.\n\nThat\u2019s left Covered California with 10 plans \u2014 which would be a bounty for nearly any other state. Not so across California\u2019s vast, 164,000-square-mile expanse, where many regions are essentially dependent on a lone insurer.\n\nAs \u201cRoad to Reform\u201d tracked throughout last year\u2019s enrollment period, the seven small insurers ended up splitting just a fraction of Covered California\u2019s customers, while the \u201cbig four\u201d insurers were responsible for almost 95% of all sign-ups across the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just an issue of market concentration,\u201d California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones (D) told California Healthline. \u201cIt\u2019s the absence of choice that exists for some consumers in some parts of California.\u201d\n\nExchange supporters counter that the market is efficient, pointing to the state\u2019s strong enrollment in year 1 of Obamacare exchanges and the low rates recently announced for year 2.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clear sign that the system in place is working,\u201d Charles Bacchi, the incoming CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, told the Los Angeles Times last month. \u201cCovered California is making it possible for individuals to purchase quality health coverage at affordable rates.\u201d\n\nConcerns Around Competition, Access\n\nThe debate over the number of carriers, the cost of premiums, the range of doctors in Covered California\u2019s networks \u2014 it all can be boiled down to a single question:\n\nHas Covered California done a good enough job covering California?\n\nSeveral experts credited the exchange with one big win: Creating more options for shoppers.\n\n\u201cI think competition did increase [given] new entrants into the individual market,\u201d UCLA\u2019s Dylan Roby told California Healthline.\n\nRoby rattled off the carriers that joined \u2014 Chinese Community Health Plan, LA Care, Molina, Sharp and Valley Care \u2014 and noted that Cigna and Assurant continue to offer off-exchange plans, too. As a result, California ended up with 17 carriers in the individual market in 2014, compared with 10 in 2010, Roby says.\n\nThat\u2019s one potential reason more insurers may not have wanted to flock to join Covered California. Another hypothesis: The existing plans did such a good job signing up consumers last year, there\u2019s less reason for new competitors to try and jump in.\n\n\u201cI do wonder whether the upside potential for new entrants in a state like California is more limited,\u201d compared with states that enrolled less of the potential marketplace population, Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Larry Levitt mused. According to KFF data, nearly 43% of potential customers signed up last year in California; in contrast, Maryland\u2019s insurers enrolled less than 17% of eligible customers. Maryland Health Connection has subsequently announced two new insurers for next year.\n\n\u201cIn California, the number of remaining uninsured includes harder-to-reach groups,\u201d Levitt added in an interview. \u201cYou also have a market largely dominated by four carriers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor any new entrant to gain meaningful market share, they\u2019d have to be able to price very competitively, and that requires having good contracts with providers.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s low premium hikes for 2015 could further suggest that the exchange is working. Robert Wood Johnson Foundation on Tuesday released a study finding that state Obamacare markets that were less competitive saw the highest premium hikes, and vice versa. (RWJF did not examine California.)\n\nBut there\u2019s also reason to be wary of Covered California\u2019s current strategy, the state insurance commissioner tells California Healthline.\n\nJones stressed that he\u2019s a supporter of Covered California \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s been a very good start,\u201d he repeated \u2014 but the dwindling number of participating plans has concerned him.\n\n\u201cThat has enormous consequences for pricing and insurers\u2019 ability to charge excessive rates,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich has enormous downstream consequences for consumers and the prices they have to pay.\u201d\n\nHe also suggested that Covered California has boxed itself in by relying on the big four plans in parts of the state.\n\n\u201cIf the [exchange] disagrees with the price that Anthem, Blue Shield, Kaiser, or HealthNet are charging \u2014 they have no real bargaining power to get a lower price, because Covered California can\u2019t afford to kick them out of the exchange,\u201d Jones added.\n\nLooking Forward\n\n\u201cRoad to Reform\u201d surveyed a dozen experts, and nearly all of them felt that while Covered California was relatively successful last year, there\u2019s room for the exchange to grow.\n\n\u201cI would like to see more choice in some regions of the state,\u201d Roby acknowledged. Ideally, there would be \u201cat least four to five plans in each area, with one or two being lower-cost, local-initiative, [not-for-profit] plans like L.A. Care.\u201d\n\nCAHP\u2019s Bacchi thinks exchange operations will only improve with more experience.\n\n\u201cWe expect to see this robust competition among insurers to continue and possibly expand as we gain more experience with this new marketplace,\u201d he told California Healthline. \u201cAll of this should help moderate premium growth in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see new entrants into the market next year,\u201d adds Weinberg of the Bay Area Council. \u201cThe national payers have been expanding their participation in public marketplace and even a lesser known name, Assurant, is filing in 16 states this year\u201d \u2014 although California isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nTwo national payers that aren\u2019t coming back to California any time soon: Aetna and United. Because both pulled out of the California market, they can\u2019t be allowed back in until 2018. And given current laws and taxes that he says favor Anthem and Blue Cross, Jones wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they stay away.\n\n\u201cUntil we make sure we have a level playing field, I think we\u2019re going to continue to see United and Aetna stay out of the market,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s a look at several other stories making news on the road to reform.\n\nHow the Halbig plaintiffs changed their mind: Writing in Politico, Abbe Gluck, a law professor at Yale, notes that the plaintiffs in Halbig v. Burwell \u2014 the lawsuit challenging the legality of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance subsidies \u2014 originally filed a suit against the law that completely opposes their current argument. (Here\u2019s California Healthline\u2018s detailed breakdown of the Halbig case, which includes comments from Gluck.)\n\nAuto-renewal could be a problem: The National Journal\u2018s Sam Baker digs into why consumers who choose to keep their Obamacare plans could be in line for an unexpected premium hike this year.\n\nDid the Affordable Care Act create the Tea Party? Bloomberg\u2018s Megan McArdle digs into whether the polarizing health law helped drive the political movement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Bucking national trends, Covered California didn't add any insurance carriers -- and actually shed a plan -- ahead of its second year.
