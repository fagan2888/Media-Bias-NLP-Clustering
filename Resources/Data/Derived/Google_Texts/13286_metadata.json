It's a bit of an experiment, but we're hopeful,\" she said.\n\n\"Private rental is the big part of the market so private rental is where we've got to put our emphasis.\"\n\nDr Holst says the homelessness problem will only get worse.\n\n\"Well, just more people staying in motels, on friend's couches, more rough sleeping, more families being broken up,\" she said.\n\nThe biggest uncertainty for the new project is the number of landlords who will contribute property to rent or manage.\n\nOne landlord already on board is businessman, Philip Endersbee. He has leased out his investment property at reduced rent.\n\n\"In the whole of scheme of things it's not really that much,\" he said.\n\n\"I mean if you're saying that a two bedroom, lounge room, kitchen, nice sized unit probably has a market rental of about $450 to $500. We may get $350,\" he said.\n\nHe is hoping the project will give those in need a fresh start.\n\n\"We offer a place in the eastern suburbs to someone who may be from the women's refuge or someone from the refugee centre,\" he said\n\n\"What better to move into an area where you know they haven't got other issues in the street and if they've got children they can go to a government school in an area and hopefully get that break in life that we all need every now and then.\"\n\nVeteran real estate agent Philippe Batters has volunteered to act as the agency's principal advisor.\n\n\"With the housing crisis as bad as it is, different ways, new thinking, has to be applied to try and solve the issue,\" he said.\n\nTopics: housing-industry, homelessness, charities-and-community-organisations, community-and-society, australia\n\nFirst posted", "article_metadata": {"ABC_WCMS_sitesearch_include": "true", "ContentId": 5208446, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/2374660-1x1-700x700.jpg", "site": "@ABCNews", "card": "summary"}, "ICBM": "-26.000,134.500", "keywords": "housing, homelessness, rentals, real estate, HomeGround Services", "DC.language": "en-AU", "DC.title": "Homelessness charity wants landlords to donate real estate", "geo.position": "-26.000;134.500", "DCTERMS.modified": "2014-01-20T14:19:30+1100", "DC.type": "Current", "DC.date": "2014-01-20T14:00:37+1100", "DCTERMS.spatial": "east=134.500;north=-26.000", "DC.creator.CorporateName": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "ABC.site": "ABC News", "DCTERMS.issued": "2014-01-20T14:00:37+1100", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ABC News", "description": "A not-for-profit real estate agent is hoping generous landlords will provide free or low-cost rental properties to homeless people and low-income families.", "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.identifier": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-20/not-for-profit-real-estate-agent-gives-free-rentals-to-homeless/5208446", "ABC.tags": "housing-industry;homelessness;charities-and-community-organisations;community-and-society", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/abcnews.au", "tag": "Charities and Community Organisations", "published_time": "2014-01-20T14:00:37+1100", "modified_time": "2014-01-20T14:19:30+1100", "author": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/simon-lauder/167198"}, "DC.rightsHolder": "ABC", "DC.Publisher.CorporateName": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Landlords are being urged to give free or cheap rentals to low-income families to help combat homelessness.", "title": "Homelessness charity wants landlords to donate real estate", "url": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-20/not-for-profit-real-estate-agent-gives-free-rentals-to-homeless/5208446", "image": {"width": 700, "identifier": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/2374660-1x1-700x700.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 700}, "updated_time": "2014-01-20T14:19:30+1100", "type": "Article"}, "DC.rights": "http://www.abc.net.au/conditions.htm#UseOfContent", "ABC.editorialGenre": "News & Current Affairs", "title": "Homelessness charity wants landlords to donate real estate", "DC.subject": "Business, Economics and Finance:Industry:Housing Industry;Community and Society:Homelessness;Community and Society:Charities and Community Organisations;Community and Society"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ede\"", "article_summary": "Not-for-profit real estate agent wants landlords to give cheap or free rent to homelessUpdatedA not-for-profit real estate agent is hoping generous landlords will provide free or low-cost rental properties to homeless people and low-income families.\n\"Private rental is the big part of the market so private rental is where we've got to put our emphasis.\"\nChief executive Heather Holst says the lack of affordable private rental properties is a big problem.\nShe is hoping landlords will pay the service to manage their properties, offer properties to low income families at reduced rent or even donate properties for rental.\nThe biggest uncertainty for the new project is the number of landlords who will contribute property to rent or manage."}
