It was this belief that formed the basis of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s New Nationalism and Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, and this belief that helped inspire Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s efforts to craft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that was ratified by the United Nations just three years after its 1945 founding.\n\nWhat is often overlooked in this story is the role that all three of these remarkable leaders played in helping to preserve the American free enterprise system, of trying to mitigate the worst excesses of capitalism, not only out of a desire to protect the American people from exploitative labor practices or fraudulent financial dealings, but also out of a desire to protect our very way of life during an era when liberal capitalist democracy was under siege in much of the rest of the world. As the late Arthur Schlesinger Jr., once remarked, the twentieth century in many respects can be viewed as a struggle of ideologies, a time in which the anti-democratic forces of fascism and totalitarian communism were on the march, so that by January 1942 at the height of the Second World War, there were only a handful of democracies left on the planet.\n\nIn the rhetorically charged atmosphere of the mid 1930s, FDR\u2019s critics alleged that the reforms he instigated under the New Deal were designed to take the country down the path to socialism. But nothing could be further from the truth. Social Security, unemployment insurance, and granting labor the right to organize were all inspired by the desire to provide the average American with a basic degree of economic security within the capitalist system. So too were the many financial reforms that brought us the likes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The same argument could be made about Theodore Roosevelt, whose decision to take on such conglomerates as the Beef Trust or the Northern Securities Rail Company was driven by the desire not to destroy big business but to limit monopoly and restore the cut and thrust of the free market. In short, both men were motivated by the idea that the federal government had a responsibility to make capitalism work for the average American.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt concurred with these ideas, and in spite of her reputation as a left-leaning reformer, spent much of her considerable energy in the post-1945 world arguing in favor of the World War II monetary and trade reforms that helped launch the globalization of the world\u2019s economy. In her May 21, 1945 \u201cMy Day\u201d column, for example, ER spoke out in favor of the 1944 Bretton Woods accords which established the International Monetary Fund and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, later the World Bank. Here, she argued in favor of the stabilization of currencies, because in the past there had been much speculative trading in this area, which resulted in \u201ceconomic warfare\u201d that in time brings us to \u201cshooting warfare.\u201d And she had this to say about the establishment of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new PBS documentary examines how New Nationalism and the New Deal saved the country from capitalism's excesses", "title": "\u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d: Ken Burns\u2019 economics lesson for America", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The new PBS documentary examines how New Nationalism and the New Deal saved the country from capitalism's excesses", "title": "\u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d: Ken Burns\u2019 economics lesson for America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/27/the_roosevelts_ken_burns_economics_lesson_for_america_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/MV5BMTU2NDg3MzEwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA2NDI0MjE@._V1__SX1249_SY643_-e1411776529972.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The new PBS documentary examines how New Nationalism and the New Deal saved the country from capitalism's excesses", "title": "\u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d: Ken Burns\u2019 economics lesson for America", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/MV5BMTU2NDg3MzEwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA2NDI0MjE@._V1__SX1249_SY643_-e1411776529972.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David B.
