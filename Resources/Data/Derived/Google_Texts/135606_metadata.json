John Kasich\u2019s budget sound familiar, it\u2019s because most are recycled from budget plans dating to 2012.\n\nTo pay for state income tax cuts and exemptions, the Republican governor wants to hike the state sales tax, Commercial Activity Tax, cigarette tax and severance taxes paid by oil and gas drillers.\n\nIn his 2016-17 budget released Monday, Kasich proposed $2.5 billion in tax cuts and $2.3 billion in tax hikes for the 2016 fiscal year starting July 1, followed by $3.1 billion in tax cuts and $2.8 billion in tax hikes in fiscal 2017.\n\nIncluding a cut to the CAT\u2019s alternative minimum tax, Kasich\u2019s two-year plan would result in a net tax cut of $523 million \u2014 less than the cost of two months of Kasich\u2019s Obamacare Medicaid expansion.\n\nIn a Forbes column last week, economist Scott Drenkard of the nonpartisan Tax Foundation criticized Kasich\u2019s proposed small business income tax exemption as a \u201cgimmick\u201d and noted Kasich \u201chas a track record of proposing handfuls of hikes to other damaging taxes to make the budget numbers add up.\u201d\n\n\u201cKasich is singularly focused on lowering the individual income tax rate, but he is pairing it with increases to other growth-quashing taxes,\u201d Drenkard said in an email to Ohio Watchdog. \u201cThis is not tax reform, it\u2019s tax shuffling.\u201d\n\nFor fiscal 2016 and 2017, Kasich\u2019s budget calls for a total of $138.7 billion in spending. Despite using tax hikes and a portion of rebounding state revenue to pay for income tax cuts, Kasich has increased spending dramatically since 2011.\n\n\u201cIt is truly hard to believe Governor Kasich is proposing a budget that would result in a government spending increase of over 40 percent from his first year to his sixth year, largely funded by projected higher tax revenues and growing dependence on federal deficit spending,\u201d Matt Mayer, president of free-market think tank Opportunity Ohio, told Ohio Watchdog via email.\n\n\u201cThis marks the third budget devoid of making tough choices,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cOhioans must now pray his rosy projections materialize. Governor Kasich simply can no longer claim to be a fiscal conservative \u2014 he is a tax shifting, big spending populist.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s proposed $1 cigarette tax hike \u2014 from $1.25 to $2.25 a pack \u2014 would give Ohio a higher rate than any of the five neighboring states. The governor presents his cigarette tax hike as a public health measure while seeking to tax smokeless e-cigarettes at the increased rate.\n\nKasich\u2019s \u201cmid-biennium review\u201d last spring included a similar measure, with a much smaller 60-cent per-pack hike. As with other proposals Kasich revisited Monday, the Ohio General Assembly removed his last cigarette hike before approving the MBR.\n\nKasich also proposed a CAT hike last spring, suggesting a rate increase from 0.26 percent to 0.3 percent. At 0.32 percent of gross business receipts exceeding $2 million, the CAT hike in Kasich\u2019s 2016-17 budget is even steeper.\n\nAlthough the CAT was created only 10 years ago, promotional materials for Kasich\u2019s 2014 MBR described a CAT hike as \u201cOverdue Tax Reform.\u201d A document published Monday calls for \u201cThe First-Ever Revisions to the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) Rate.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the new budget\u2019s proposed severance tax hike on hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking,\u201d for oil and gas is Kasich\u2019s fourth attempt at a severance tax hike and is bigger than he has ever requested.\n\nIn 2012, Kasich proposed a 4 percent tax on crude oil and liquid natural gas extracted by fracking. Kasich asked for the same rate in 2013, and he proposed a 2.75 percent gross receipts tax on fracking in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe governor proposes fixed rates for crude oil and natural gas of 6.5 percent when sold at the wellhead, and a lower rate of 4.5 percent for natural gas and natural gas liquids when sold downstream,\u201d budget documents released Monday explain.\n\nA severance tax hike remains one of Kasich\u2019s second-term priorities, even though an Opportunity Ohio study last month showed output from fracking wells in eastern Ohio has fallen far short of his projections.\n\nConsistent with Kasich\u2019s stated desire to shift from income to consumption taxes, his budget plan also proposes increasing the state sales tax from 5.75 percent to 6.25 percent and applying the sales tax to a number of currently exempt services.\n\nThe sales tax rate increased from 5.5 to 5.75 percent as part of the budget passed in 2013, after Kasich proposed cutting the rate to 5 percent.\n\nIn a February 2013 budget summary, Kasich said a rate cut \u201cwould reverse a long trend of increasing state sales tax rates either to raise general revenue or to compensate for the progressive narrowing of the sales tax base.\u201d\n\nInstead, the sales tax base was broadened to a long list of formerly exempt services and the rate was hiked to pay for income tax cuts when the General Assembly rejected the second iteration of Kasich\u2019s severance tax hike.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If the tax proposals in Ohio Gov.
