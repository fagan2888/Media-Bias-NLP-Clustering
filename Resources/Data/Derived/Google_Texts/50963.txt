For many locals, graffiti is as much a part of New York City’s landscape as skyscrapers and city parks– and looked upon either as a symbol of degradation and disrespect or a creative outlet and form of expression.

The continued presence of graffiti in New York is part of a seemingly never-ending tug of war between city departments, building owners and the graffiti artists and taggers. It is also a target of the New York City police commissioner, Bill Bratton. Getty photographer Spencer Platt spent time in the Lower East Side photographing some of the neighborhood’s graffiti. See some of his shots below.

In recent years, street art has recieved increased recognition as a form of art. Last October, British street artist Banksy began a month-long residency in New York City that attracted substantial press attention and a hunt for his works, which can fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars. In November, locals mourned the loss of FivePointz, a famous canvas for the city’s graffiti artists, painted over in preparation for its demolition. An exhibition later showcased some of the graffiti artists whose work had been displayed on the building. The City Museum of New York currently has an exhibition of works by Martin Wong, an East Village collector of graffiti art, called “City as Canvas.”
