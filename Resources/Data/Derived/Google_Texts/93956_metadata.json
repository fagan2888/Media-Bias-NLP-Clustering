This is one of the few places where you could go and feel like you weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAfter two days of his first training camp with the Falcons, Tamme said there has been no scary break-in period. He said Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan has helped make for an easy transition.\n\n\u201cMatt has been awesome,\u201d Tamme said after Saturday\u2019s practice. \u201cI love working with him. He\u2019s got a lot of similarities with Peyton \u2014 the way he leads, the way he approaches the quarterback position. I\u2019ve got a lot of respect for that, so I\u2019m really excited.\u201d\n\nRyan is entering his eighth season as Atlanta\u2019s starter, and his status as a respected quarterback helped draw Tamme to Atlanta as a free agent. Another attraction was the chance to play in new offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan\u2019s system, which makes good use of tight ends.\n\nTamme may be the favorite to win the starting job in training camp over returning starter Levine Toilolo and Tony Moeaki.\n\nTamme, who has 178 career catches, is the most accomplished receiver of the three. Moeaki, who had two starts with Seattle last season, has 88 career receptions but is better known for his blocking.\n\nToilolo had 31 catches for 238 yards and two touchdowns but he also had some drops in his first full season as Atlanta\u2019s starter. Like Moeaki, Toilolo was best known for his blocking when he was drafted by Atlanta, and it wasn\u2019t easy for the 2013 fourth-round draft pick from Stanford to follow standout Tony Gonzalez as the Falcons\u2019 starter.\n\nTamme, 30, already has shown the ability to catch the ball in traffic in training camp.\n\n\u201cThat hasn\u2019t changed from all the way from OTAs,\u201d said Falcons coach Dan Quinn. \u201cHe\u2019s had catches behind and down low. We\u2019re just trying to find ways to feature him. He\u2019s got a unique style of how to get open, where to go find it. I think there\u2019s a good rhythm with him with that.\u201d\n\nTamme (6-3, 230) set career highs with 67 catches for 631 yards and four touchdowns in 2010 with Indianapolis. He had 52 catches in 2012, his first season with Denver, but had only a combined 34 the last two years.\n\nTamme\u2019s production could increase as the Falcons look for ways to keep defenses from focusing on star receivers Julio Jones and Roddy White.\n\n\u201cI feel ready to fill in a lot of different roles,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a tight end, you get to do a lot of different things in this offense. I love all the aspects of our position. I\u2019m looking forward to being a versatile player for us.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The team signed OL Pierce Burton and released OG Harland Gunn.
