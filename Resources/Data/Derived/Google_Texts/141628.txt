A stolen vehicle that appeared to be trying to elude a police cruiser crashed into a garage Monday afternoon, and the driver was arrested after a short foot chase, police said.

The incident happened about 2 p.m. in an alley off West Ellsworth Avenue and Osceola Street, said Sonny Jackson, a Denver Police Department spokesman.

Four people — one male and three females — jumped out of the Nissan sport utility vehicle and dashed off on foot. But police caught up with them a short distance away, Jackson said.

The man was arrested, Jackson said, and the three females, including a juvenile and another who is reportedly pregnant, were taken to a local hospital as a precaution.

A patrol car in the area spotted the vehicle before it made a quick U-turn, apparently trying to distance itself from police, Commander Bill Nadle said. As it was attempting to leave the area, the vehicle crashed, Nadle said.

The vehicle came to rest on its side within the garage. No one inside the home was injured.

A Denver Fire Department collapse team was sent to the scene to check on the integrity of the detached garage, said Mark Watson, a fire department spokesman.
