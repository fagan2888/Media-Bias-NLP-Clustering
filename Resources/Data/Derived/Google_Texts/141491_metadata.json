The packaging requirements were the subject of high-profile debate, were approved Sept. 9 and put into effect Oct. 15, said Julie Postlethwait, spokeswoman for the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division. She said it is disappointing if store owners waited until the last minute.\n\n\u201cThis is not a surprise that came and hit them over the heads,\u201d Postlethwait said. \u201cThe main point here, the focus the industry tends to forget, is we exist in order to ensure public safety. You don\u2019t want a child ingesting high-potency infused products. The risk is a child\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nIndustry representatives say they are committed to following the rules and keeping pot away from children. But they say they also are juggling a number of regulatory demands as they rush to prepare for what they hope will be a historic day.\n\nSome prospective pot-shop owners \u2014 most are awaiting licensing and inspection approval that will allow them to open \u2014 say they\u2019ve just recently found solutions to avert a packaging crisis.\n\nEan Seeb, co-owner of the medical-marijuana dispensary Denver Relief, said he has been talking since October with a New York company that sells a product called Stink Sack.\n\nThe company\u2019s owner, Ross Kirsh, landed in Denver this week and is visiting dispensaries with prototypes of his smell-proof bag with a double-locking mechanism that comes in three pot-friendly sizes.\n\nThe state defines child-resistant packaging as \u201csignificantly difficult for children under 5 years of age to open and not difficult for normal adults to use properly\u201d based on an international standards organization.\n\nKirsh said a half million of his opaque bags are in production and will be ready for delivery by Jan. 1.\n\nOther companies are pitching packaging, but business owners remain skeptical there will be enough to go around.\n\nRyan Cook, a co-owner of The Clinic in Denver, a chain of medical marijuana dispensaries branching into retail sales, said he ordered packaging from China before the final state rules were issued because the turnaround for delivery is about three months.\n\nNow, he is sitting on $40,000 worth of bags that don\u2019t pass muster because they are opaque on one side and clear on the other.\n\n\u201cFor us, it was an unfortunate situation,\u201d Cook said. \u201cBut now I think the whole industry is faced with, \u2018Can everyone get the packaging they need in the time frame they need it?\u2019 That might be an uphill battle.\u201d\n\nThe Clinic prepackages its products at a warehouse and ships them to its six dispensaries, making tracking easier and more secure, he said. But Cook can\u2019t prepackage in darkened bags because customers want to see what they\u2019re shopping for. Something will need to change, he said.\n\n\u201cIt stinks,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIt\u2019s our mistake. We knew the rules were coming out. But we were under the impression we had a package that was considered child-proof, resealable and tamper-proof.\u201d\n\nAn August report from researchers at the Colorado School of Public Health and Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado predicted accidental marijuana ingestion by children would be cut nearly in half if the state required opaque, child-resistant packaging for pot leaving stores.\n\nColorado saw a rise in emergency-room visits by children who had ingested pot after medical dispensaries grew in number.\n\nPostlethwait said ramifications for breaking packaging rules are being finalized, but the state can initially fine violators and take more serious actions if problems persist.\n\nEric Gorski: 303-954-1971, egorski@denverpost.com or twitter.com/egorski", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Marijuana shop owners racing to bag safety", "title": "Marijuana shop owners racing to bag safety", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/06/marijuana-shop-owners-racing-to-bag-safety/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131206__20131207_A1_CD06POTPACKAGING1p1.jpg", "height": 471}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131206__20131207_A1_CD06POTPACKAGING1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-06T20:58:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T15:23:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba1a\"", "article_summary": "But several business owners say they are struggling to find vendors that manufacture the proper bags or can supply enough to meet demand in time for the opening of the first stores Jan. 1.\nPostlethwait said ramifications for breaking packaging rules are being finalized, but the state can initially fine violators and take more serious actions if problems persist.\n\u201cA number of our members are having an incredibly difficult time,\u201d said Mike Elliott, director of the Medical Marijuana Industry Group, the state\u2019s largest marijuana business group.\n\u201cThe main point here, the focus the industry tends to forget, is we exist in order to ensure public safety.\nColorado saw a rise in emergency-room visits by children who had ingested pot after medical dispensaries grew in number."}
