Of course, Fox sang quite a different tune when President Bush made a slideshow and jokes about looking for weapons of mass destruction in the White House.\n\nGeraldo Rivera stopped by the Curvy Couch for a discussion about a humorous video of President Obama taking selfies, practicing his basketball jump shot and more \u2013 all of which were designed to urge people to sign up for ObamaCare before the February 15 deadline this weekend.\n\nCo-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck wasn\u2019t happy. She complained, \u201cISIS is expanding territory in Iraq and Afghanistan as we\u2019re drawing troops down in Afghanistan. \u2026The timing of it just seems so insensitive.\u201d\n\nIn case anyone missed the point, a banner on the screen read, \u201cPOTUS goofs in video as ISIS kills Americans.\u201d\n\nRivera agreed, \u201cThe timing is horrible, Elisabeth, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d But he also said that the video had gotten almost 6 million hits (Our count is closer to 25 million). \u201cTo reach the crowd that doesn\u2019t consume regular news, I\u2019m not that upset,\u201d Rivera allowed. \u201cIf he can reach the young audience with this stuff, to do the right thing, then I\u2019m OK with it.\n\nBrian Kilmeade asked, \u201cNo matter how he acts?\u201d\n\n\u201dWell, he can be dumb, I mean listen,\u201d Rivera said in \"defense\" of Obama.\n\n\u201dIt just seems to be a chronic issue after something terrible,\u201d Hasselbeck griped.\n\n\u201dYou don\u2019t want him to just be in the White House and be all sourpuss,\u201d Rivera argued.\n\n\u201dNo, I want him to be a leader,\u201d Kilmeade grumbled.\n\nIf President Obama were a Republican, something tells me the curvy couch crew would be singing quite a different tune. That something is a little slideshow from a 2004 speech in which then-President George W. Bush repeatedly joked about the missing weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Joking about an invasion fail in which thousands were killed and injured? Fox called the speech \u201cvery funny\u201d and attacked its critics as \u201cseek(ing) victim status.\u201d\n\nWatch the video from today\u2019s Fox & Friends below. Underneath are the BuzzFeed video and Bush\u2019s jokes, for comparison.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "LEjnY/B/9Opduvhe4nsVBAqb4TY5ms/tPsmh7+2/iyI=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/fox_friends_sourpusses_exploit_kayla_mueller_s_death_to_attack_obama_s_buzzfeed_video_021315", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Fox & Friends Sourpusses Exploit Kayla Mueller\u2019s Death To Attack Obama\u2019s BuzzFeed Video"}, "Title": "Fox & Friends Sourpusses Exploit Kayla Mueller\u2019s Death To Attack Obama\u2019s BuzzFeed Video"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7a7\"", "article_summary": "President Obama\u2019s BuzzFeed video and the death of American ISIS captive Kayla Mueller were today\u2019s Obama whine for Fox & Friends.\nFox called the speech \u201cvery funny\u201d and attacked its critics as \u201cseek(ing) victim status.\u201dWatch the video from today\u2019s Fox & Friends below.\nIf President Obama were a Republican, something tells me the curvy couch crew would be singing quite a different tune.\nOf course, Fox sang quite a different tune when President Bush made a slideshow and jokes about looking for weapons of mass destruction in the White House.\nBrian Kilmeade asked, \u201cNo matter how he acts?\u201d\u201dWell, he can be dumb, I mean listen,\u201d Rivera said in \"defense\" of Obama."}
