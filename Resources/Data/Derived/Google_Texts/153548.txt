FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Julian Edelman and LeGarrette Blount scored touchdowns before Washington ran its second play from scrimmage, and the New England Patriots won 27-10 on Sunday to remain unbeaten.

Tom Brady completed 26 of 39 passes for 299 yards and two touchdowns, including an 8-yard TD to Edelman on the Patriots’ opening drive. New England (8-0) then pulled off a surprise onside kick, but that drive stalled when Edelman fumbled.

The Redskins could manage only a single play: Kirk Cousins’ pass that bounced off Pierre Garcon and into the air, where it was intercepted by Logan Ryan. New England made it 14-0 on Blount’s 5-yard score.

Washington (3-5) managed just 15 total yards in the first quarter.

Kirk Cousins was 22 for 40 for 217 yards on the day, but he was hurt by seven dropped passes.
