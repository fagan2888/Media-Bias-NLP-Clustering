Staples has said that the policy in place was instituted a decade ago, so it was not instituted as a way to get around Obamacare,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cBut he makes it sound as if getting around a law, meaning responding to the incentives that are written into the law, is somehow unsavory. And he talks about that, it's the same way he talks about everything that's private enterprise.\u201d\n\nKrauthammer points out that while the president speaks disdainfully of private enterprise profits, the federal government depends on those dollars to run the country, which is something Obama fails to acknowledge.\n\n\u201cThat's the source of the millions that are paid in taxes, which support the parasitic government that Obama is running. I mean, that's essentially how capitalism works,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cThe government doesn't make money, it takes it, and it takes it from enterprises that are successful.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Krauthammer said, Obama just refuses to recognize those truths about our system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather elementary, but he still doesn\u2019t get it.\"",
