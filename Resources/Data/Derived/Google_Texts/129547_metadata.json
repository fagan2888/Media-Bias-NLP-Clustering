Nationwide, the Department of Health and Human Services estimates there are 10.5 million such people.\n\n\n\nSince Covered California launched in 2013 under Obama\u2019s landmark Affordable Care Act (ACA), the number of uninsured California residents has dropped from 21 percent to 11 percent, noted Jones. Some of the benefits of ACA health care plans, she said, include no annual caps on coverage, equal premiums charged to men and women, and government subsidies that make the plans affordable.\n\n\n\nYet, there are about 134,000 people who are subsidy-eligible in the Bay Area but uninsured, Bonta said, promising to do a better outreach among them to drop that number.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs Oakland and the Bay Area go, so goes the rest of California,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nTo make it convenient to enroll, City Hall has become one of several enrollment centers in the city. It will be open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. For more information, visit www.coveredca.com.\n\n\n\nRecent aggressive campaigning by Covered California has helped to net an additional 197,000 people across the state in just one week this month, said Howard. More than half of those enrolled on the exchange are paying less than $50 a month in premiums, he added.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a civil rights coalition last week filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights, charging California with engaging in unlawful discrimination by paying doctors some of the lowest reimbursement rates in the nation through Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s Medicaid program for low-income residents.\n\n\n\nThe complaint, which is unrelated to Covered California, says that the low rates have severely shrunk the pool of doctors willing to accept Medi-Cal patients, preventing doctors and hospitals from treating Latinos, who make up the majority of Medi-Cal enrollees.\n\n\n\nAbout 2.5 million residents have enrolled in the expanded Medi-Cal program under the ACA. Among other things, expansion has allowed childless adults to enroll. That has brought the state\u2019s total Medi-Cal enrollment to a little over 12 million.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with New America Media after the conference, Bonta, who chairs the Assembly health committee, declined to discuss specifics of the complaint, but acknowledged there was truth in it.\n\n\n\nFor an average patient visit, Medi-Cal now reimburses doctors $41.48, while Medicare \u2013 the health insurance program for elders and people with disabilities -- pays $102.45.\n\n\n\nBonta said his attempts to bring Medi-Cal reimbursement rates back on par with Medicare\u2019s through a bill he sponsored earlier this year, AB 366, didn\u2019t succeed.\n\n\n\nThe state would need an additional $10 billion in its Medi-Cal budget to bring the program\u2019s rates on an equal footing with Medicare\u2019s. Bonta said that meeting the $10 billion shortfall could take \u201cmultiple years.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs chair of a special legislative session set up by Governor Brown last June, Bonta said he and others in the health care coalition are trying to restore the cuts made in 2011 to Medi-Cal provider reimbursement rates. They are trying to identify additional revenue streams, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything to increase the provider rates, the problem will get worse,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "obama, aca, bonta, coveredca, medi-cal, medicare,", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
