She said \u201cwe need to be more forward thinking,\u201d when it comes to budgetary issues.\n\nSund also went after Paulsen on the rising cost education to students, citing his votes for Representative Paul Ryan\u2019s budget which cut education funding. Sund said the about two-thirds of higher education used to be subsidized. Government cuts have forced more of those costs on students which leaves them saddled with debt. Paulsen countered that universities are expecting students to get money from the government so they\u2019re \u201cbuilding it into their tuition model\u201d and that\u2019s responsible for the increases.\n\nThe two also answered questions about the Affordable Care Act. Paulsen called it a \u201cdisaster\u201d and agreed with Hauser that it is unpopular. Sund challenged the unpopularity assumption saying that components of the ACA such as not denying coverage for pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parents coverage until they are 25 are very popular. She said the ACA as a whole does not poll well because it has become \u201cpoliticized\u201d.\n\nThe two differed on raising the federal minimum wage. Paulsen said it would lead to job loss. Sund said real wages for middle class workers are continuing to decline. Without raising wages there is not enough spending to create jobs.\n\nOn taxes both supported eliminating a tax on medical devices (Sund noted that her husband works at a medical device company) and both were for reforming the tax code but differed on how that should be done. Paulsen emphasized \u201csimplifying\u201d the tax code for businesses and individuals. Sund emphasized that it had to be done bi-partisanly.\n\nInterview questions and answers\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a log of the 28 minute interview with times based on the video player. Since timer on player counts down, times are the remaining time in video\n\n26:40 \u2013 Affordable Care Act, polls show many disapprove. What would you do with the ACA?\n\n26:11 \u2013 Sund \u2013 disputes unpopularity. Says components are popular and it has been politicized. People like that children can stay on parents insurance until they\u2019re 25 and pre-existing conditions are covered. People come up to me and say I wouldn\u2019t be alive today without the ACA. Important that citizens have access to health care.\n\n24:42 \u2013 Paulsen \u2013 rollout was a disaster and health care reform is still needed. Premiums are up. What ACA did can be done more strategically.\n\n23:32 \u2013 How would you cover preexisting conditions without the ACA?\n\nPaulsen- let people buy insurance across state lines\n\nSund \u2013 I\u2019ve heard solutions mentioned, but not heard them presented in a way to get bipartisan support. Paulsen has had many opportunities to do that but he hasn\u2019t. All sides need to work together. Saying we\u2019re going to get rid of it and start all over doesn\u2019t work.\n\n21:53 \u2013 Where do you stand on getting rid of the medical device tax?\n\nSund \u2013 My husband works at a medical device company. We need Representative who will fight as hard for families as corporations. I would support revoking it.\n\n20:29- How do you pay for ACA without that tax?\n\nPaulsen \u2013 This is about keeping innovation alive in Minnesota.\n\n19:45 \u2013 Tax reform \u2013 Do we need to eliminate loopholes that allow corporations to move and not pay taxes?\n\nPaulsen \u2013 we need to simplify taxes and require businesses to pay less. Then they won\u2019t move. Too complicated for individuals too.\n\n18:17- Sund \u2013 tax code is not the only reason companies leave. Minnesota had highest tax on companies but we were a leader on innovation and growing jobs. It\u2019s not just about cut cut cut, it\u2019s about balance. We need a balanced approach to tax code. Companies and people are attracted to our state because of arts, infrastructure, schools. That takes taxes to support. Yes, bring the taxes down for corporations. Mr. Paulsen has voted for tax cuts that will hurt middle class and cause them to take more of the burden.\n\n15:55 \u2013 Paulsen \u2013 I support simpler tax code for all. Needs to be done bi-partisanly.\n\n15:17 Education costs going up faster than health care. What would would you do to control that to make it more affordable?\n\n14:38 Sund \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t do what Paulsen has done and cut education like the Ryan budget does. When we invest in ages 1-6, that gives us an eight time return on dollars. We need to allow students to renegotiate college loans. We used to have 2/3rds subsidies.\n\n13:10 \u2013 Paulsen \u2013 It\u2019s good that Congress removed setting the student loan rates and let them float with the market. We need to look at the cost that are driving the need for loans. Students and parents need financial literacy on these loans.\n\n12:03- How to break the cycle of costs going up? Government loans driving cost up.\n\n11:32- Sund \u2013 State provides less to higher education and so there\u2019s pressure on federal government to provide more. Do we want an educated workforce? If so, we need to put money into the institutions so they\u2019re not struggling.\n\n10:30 \u2013 Paulsen \u2013 Colleges are counting on the students getting the money and are building that into their tuition models.\n\n10:06 \u2013 What can congress do about \u201cachievement gap in Minnesota?\n\n9:48 \u2013 Paulsen \u2013 Zip code shouldn\u2019t determine education. Need more charter schools. Need focus on science and tech and math.\n\n9:08- Sund \u2013 Increasing the minimum wage would help. Family income has a huge impact on achievement gap. Stable housing and jobs make a big difference. Families need an adequate living wage.\n\n8:05 What is the best way to create good paying jobs?\n\n7:51- Paulsen \u2013 raising minimum wage will lead to job loss. Reduce regulations on employers.\n\n7:08 \u2013 Sund \u2013 People\u2019s wages are continue to decline. they\u2019re losing spending power. Middle class spending is the engine of our society. If there\u2019s no spending, jobs won\u2019t grow. Get the loan burden off students and that will add money into our economy. Invest in renewable energy to create jobs.\n\n5:13 \u2013 Social security \u2013 does it need to be addressed?\n\n4:55 \u2013 Paulsen \u2013 Good for now, Congress shouldn\u2019t wait for a crisis.\n\n4:25- Sund \u2013 If we can get democrats and republicans to work together it would help. We need people who make $250,000 and more to continue to pay into the system.\n\nPaulsen \u2013 I don\u2019t support privatizing social security as my opponent claims I do.\n\n3:09 \u2013 Has the US response to ebola been OK?\n\nPaulsen \u2013 it\u2019s exposed issues with the Centers for Disease Control. The government hasn\u2019t done enough. Need travel ban from west African countries.\n\n2:24- Sund \u2013 The President says that\u2019s not going to help us. We need to be forward thinking and coming up with solutions before and not after the fact. Government shutdown and sequester cut funding to CDC. Now we\u2019re doing catchup.\n\n1:33 Are we doing enough to fight ISIS in Syria and Iraq?\n\nPaulsen- Arming Syrian rebels \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re arming the right folks. Not a lot of good options. Need to keep everything on the table.\n\nSund: I support the President in what he\u2019s doing. We need to engage our partners in the area more to fight their own wars.\n\nThe interview conducted on October 18 was not posted to KSTP-TV\u2019s website until Oct 31 \u2013 less than a week before the election.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://theuptake.org/2014/11/01/video-replay-sund-and-rep-paulsen-clash-on-ebola-health-care-minimum-wage-in-kstp-interview/", "dcterms.title": "The UpTake - Video Replay: Sund And Rep.
