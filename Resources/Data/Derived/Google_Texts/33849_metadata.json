I didn\u2019t manage it but I\u2019ll be back next year.\u201d\n\nRunning his sixth Berlin marathon, Kipchoge finished comfortably ahead of compatriot Eliud Kiptanui in second on 2:05:22 and Feyisa Lilesa of Ethiopia third in 2:06:57. All times were official.\n\n\u201cFrom the first kilometer I had problems with my shoes,\u201d Kipchoge said. \u201cNevertheless, I am very happy about my victory. I love the Berlin course and the people. I\u2019m glad I won and in a personal best. I would very much love to come back and run an even faster time.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Mutai was fourth and Geoffrey Mutai fifth, ahead of Canada\u2019s Reid Coolseat, who ran 2:10:28.\n\nKipchoge shaved five seconds off his previous personal best time and 42 seconds off the previous fastest mark of the year that he set at the London Marathon on April 26.\n\nDespite acknowledging that he \u201ccould have run faster,\u201d Kipchoge laid no fault with his sponsor for his footwear issues.\n\n\u201cI tested the shoe, I tested many pairs of Nike. I think this shoe is the best shoe ever. The shoe is good,\u201d the 30-year-old said. \u201cThe sole was not glued. I used the same pair in Kenya and it was good.\u201d\n\nKiptanui was happy with his second-place finish.\n\n\u201cI think I had no chance to beat Eliud,\u201d said Kiptanui, who knocked 17 seconds off his personal best set in Prague in 2010.\n\nKipchoge clocked 2:04:05 in 2013 only to be beaten by compatriot Wilson Kipsang, who set a then-record of 2:03:23.\n\nGladys Cherono of Kenya beat the 2:20 mark to win the women\u2019s race in 2:19.25 ahead of Ethiopian trio Aberu Kebede, Meseret Hailu and Tadelech Bekele.\n\nIt was Cherono\u2019s first win in only her second marathon. The 32-year-old half marathon world champion ran 2:20:03 for second place in her debut in Dubai last January.\n\nConditions were ideal on a cool, crisp autumn morning in Berlin. More than 41,000 runners from 131 countries were registered to run.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wayward insoles cost Eliud Kipchoge a chance to break a world record.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Wayward insoles cost Eliud Kipchoge a chance to break a world record.", "title": "Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya wins Berlin Marathon", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/27/eliud-kipchoge-of-kenya-wins-berlin-marathon/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/27/22ebe65275ab312b830f6a70670027fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/27/22ebe65275ab312b830f6a70670027fb.jpg", "description": "Wayward insoles cost Eliud Kipchoge a chance to break a world record.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya wins Berlin Marathon"}, "Author": "CIARAN FAHEY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbdac\"", "article_summary": "I didn\u2019t manage it but I\u2019ll be back next year.\u201dRunning his sixth Berlin marathon, Kipchoge finished comfortably ahead of compatriot Eliud Kiptanui in second on 2:05:22 and Feyisa Lilesa of Ethiopia third in 2:06:57.\nDespite problems with his shoes from the first kilometer, Kipchoge won the Berlin Marathon on Sunday in a personal best time of 2 hours, 4 minutes.\nThe 32-year-old half marathon world champion ran 2:20:03 for second place in her debut in Dubai last January.\n\u201cI think I had no chance to beat Eliud,\u201d said Kiptanui, who knocked 17 seconds off his personal best set in Prague in 2010.\nBERLIN (AP) - Wayward insoles cost Eliud Kipchoge a chance to break a world record."}
