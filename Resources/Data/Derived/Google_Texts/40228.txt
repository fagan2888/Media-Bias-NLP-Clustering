For most teenagers, New Year's Eve is a time to hang with family and friends. But that is not the case for Dahne Lynn McKay.

For the past three years, the 15-year-old from California has traveled 1,500 miles to race a micro sprint car in the Tulsa Shootout. She spent New Year's Day in the River Spirit Expo Center getting her car ready for competition.

"I would just be home hanging out with friends," McKay said of what she would be doing at home in Laton, Calif. "No parties for me. I would rather be racing.

"I am up here doing what I love to do. I don't miss being at home."

McKay's family is here, too.

"We have 15 people here," she said. "They travel and I fly in. My mom, my brother, my grandma and grandpa, then my uncle and cousins race, so they are all here."

In 2011, McKay did not know what to expect when she arrived in Tulsa for the first time, but she quickly found out Â— and so did everyone else. McKay became the first female to win a Shootout race. She repeated the feat in 2012.

"I was surprised since no girl had ever won," recalled McKay, who won in the restricted A class. "People come from everywhere to race. This has to be the biggest micro show there is. When you are a girl everyone thinks differently.

"It was scary and difficult, but we got through it and pulled out the victory."

McKay's success is no surprise if you look at the rest of her family. Her uncle, Heath Dunkerken, also picked up a second consecutive win last year in the outlaw class.

McKay said she felt it was time to move up after winning the past two years. This year, she is competing in the outlaw and A classes.

"Back home, we ran two years in restricted, so we decided to move up and see what we can do," McKay said. "Moving up to these two classes, there is a lot more competition.

"I am a little nervous just coming up here, especially standing around and watching the races," McKay said of waiting for her turn on the track. "But I have confidence and just try to stay out of the traffic and get up to the top. You have to be aggressive."

McKay finished fourth in her A class heat Wednesday and won her outlaw heat Thursday.

"It is pretty tight. Tracks back at home are bigger than this," she said of the course. "You just have to see how it feels in hot laps and practice."

McKay raced last summer at Lemoore Raceway, Visalia Plaza Park and Stockton 99 Speedway, finishing third in the points standings at Lemoore and fourth at Visalia. She had 21 wins in the restricted class.

She is a sophomore at Riverdale High School, where she is on the basketball team.

"I do play basketball," McKay said. "I am actually missing tournaments back at home for this, but I race every weekend. I don't have much time for anything else. This race is more important."

As for the future, McKay would like to continue her education and her racing.
