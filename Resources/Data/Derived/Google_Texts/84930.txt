NEW YORK (MainStreet) â€” When making that split-second decision on how to handle a child's serious injury or ailment, most parents err on the side of caution and head to the hospital ER, especially when their doctor's office is closed.



But not Megan Warner, whose 5-year-old son abruptly started complaining and crying about severe ear pain this past Christmas Day. "He rarely complains of medical issues of any sort...so we took him very seriously," says Warner, a clinical psychologist from Guilford, Conn. "We moved very fast, not knowing what was happening, but opted for urgent care since it was during the daytime, on Christmas, and we didn't feel it was serious enough for the emergency room."



It turned out to be a huge ball of wax causing the ear pain. The urgent care physician was able to remove it and relieve the pain, and the Warners were thrilled at not having to spend hours at the emergency room on a holiday. Other parents, when presented with similar challenges, may do well to follow suit -- especially if they're also interested in protecting their financial best interests.

According to an overview entitled "Children in the Emergency Department" and published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, most emergency room visits by children are unnecessary. A full 96% of emergency room visits resulted in children being treated and released instead of admitted to the hospital with a true emergency.

The 2010 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey showed, in those under age 15, almost none of the recorded ER visits were true level 1 emergency visits requiring immediate assistance (a visit in which the patient should be seen in less than one minute). Only 7.4% were of the Emergent Level 2 variety (a visit in which the patient should be seen in one to 14 minutes). The majority (42.6%) of visits were of the semi-urgent type.
