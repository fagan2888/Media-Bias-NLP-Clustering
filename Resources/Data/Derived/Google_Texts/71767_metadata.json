Obamacare is immoral because it uses the power of government, originally designed by the Founding Fathers to protect individual rights, to violate them by forcing taxpayers to act against their own interest by subsidizing others' health care costs with substantial penalties for noncompliance. You cannot create something moral by imposing something immoral.\n\nDr. Berman also implies that the benefits of Obamacare are \"bold\" and \"moral.\" Every benefit he lists violates someone's individual rights: insurance company owners by dictating premiums, coverage, and profit margins; hospital owners and health care workers by \"eating some of the costs\"; but most importantly patients by subjecting them to 13,000 pages of unread, unknown regulations.\n\nAs philosopher Ayn Rand said about individuals, \"Every one of them has the right to make his own decision but none has the right to force his decision on others.\" That includes the government or the majority vote. We need to stand for individual rights and keep our health care moral.\n\nTom Gyory\n\nNorth Whitehall Township\n\nThe writer is a member of the\n\nLehigh Valley Tea Party's Individual\n\nRights Action Committee.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Letters, Opinion", "og": {"url": "http://articles.mcall.com/2013-10-02/opinion/mc-obamacare-scott-berman-your-view-gyory-20131002_1_obamacare-health-care-individuals", "type": "article", "site_name": "tribunedigital-mcall", "description": "On principle, I disagree with Scott Berman's Your View, \"Obamacare makes a 'bold, moral statement.'\" Bold perhaps, moral not.Morality, as I understand it, is choosing to act in a way that is...", "title": "Obamacare violates rights of individuals"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 185854558123618}, "description": "On principle, I disagree with Scott Berman's Your View, \"Obamacare makes a 'bold, moral statement.'\" Bold perhaps, moral not.Morality, as I understand it, is choosing to act in a way that is"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf19c\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare violates rights of individualsMorality, as I understand it, is choosing to act in a way that is beneficial to my life without harming others.\nWe need to stand for individual rights and keep our health care moral.\nObamacare is immoral because it uses the power of government, originally designed by the Founding Fathers to protect individual rights, to violate them by forcing taxpayers to act against their own interest by subsidizing others' health care costs with substantial penalties for noncompliance.\nDr. Berman also implies that the benefits of Obamacare are \"bold\" and \"moral.\"\nEvery benefit he lists violates someone's individual rights: insurance company owners by dictating premiums, coverage, and profit margins; hospital owners and health care workers by \"eating some of the costs\"; but most importantly patients by subjecting them to 13,000 pages of unread, unknown regulations."}
