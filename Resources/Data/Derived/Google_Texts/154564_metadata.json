Ami Bera, D-Calif., and Chris Gibson, R-N.Y., suggested in their SOTU response for the post-partisan, good-government group No Labels, is \u201ca government of collaboration.\u201d Not in the Vichyite sense, don't worry\u2014what No Labels proposes is a government with a \u201cformula for how to get our leaders in Washington to start solving problems together again.\u201d\n\nWhat that \u201cformula\u201d might be is never quite clear, but it starts with our representatives moving their flag pins to make room for new congressional \u201cflair.\u201d Over 70 members showed up to the SOTU sporting NL's orange \u201cProblem Solvers\u201d pin. The standard, grammatically-challenged version says \u201cCommitted to Fix Not Fight,\u201d but, for a night on the town, congressmen can download sexier alternatives, like \u201cMake Love, Not Gridlock\u201d or \u201cNo More No.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2010 to \u201cmove America from the old politics of point-scoring toward a new politics of problem-solving,\u201d No Labels is back, with a \u201cthree-year campaign to create a national strategic agenda\u201d and a new book, No Labels: A Shared Vision for a Stronger America.\n\n\u201cThe grownups show up,\u201d gushes one Amazon reviewer. But if these are the \u201cgrownups,\u201d why do they come wearing happy-face buttons and spouting get-along bromides that might have been drawn from a middle-school \u201cNo Putdowns\u201d campaign? Does Congress really need its own anti-bullying movement?\n\nIn the book\u2019s introduction, No Labels co-chairman Jon Huntsman laments the partisan state of the State of the Union: \u201cIf we had a national strategic agenda this could all be different. The president and the leader of the opposition could meet before the State of the Union\u201d and \u201cget agreement on goals before the policy-making process starts.\u201d\n\nThis is how \u201cgrownups\u201d are supposed to think about politics? When the old New York Sun started calling \u201cgood government\u201d reformers \u201cgoo-goos\u201d in the 1890s, they didn't know the half of it.\n\nNL\u2019s \u201cProblem-Solvers\u201d blog features a Rubik\u2019s Cube logo; as long as we\u2019re living in the \u201880s, \u201cwhere\u2019s the beef?\u201d is a relevant question. What is this \u201cnational strategic agenda\u201d anyway?\n\nIt involves agreement on \u201cfour essential goals\u201d: 1. 25 million new jobs; 2. Medicare and Social Security solvency; 3. balancing the budget; and 4. making America \u201cenergy self-sufficient.\u201d\n\nThe last item is mercantilist nonsense, but all four goals are already widely shared by pols. If we haven't achieved them, \u201cit's not because the solutions aren't clear,\u201d No Labels argues, \u201cbut because we haven't focused our talents and resources.\u201d \u201cNo one ever actually tells us how they plan\u201d to unite America, co-chairman Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., writes in the book's foreword, \u201cin the pages ahead, you'll read about the 'how.'\u201d Many platitudinous pixels later, the authors write that \u201cthere will be a lot of tough decisions ahead. ... in this book, however, we have purposely stopped short of suggesting which tradeoffs will be needed.\u201d I see.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to make fun of No Labels; but it\u2019s also important, because their empty pieties offer no real alternative to business as usual.\n\nMeanwhile, some of Congress's archest ideologues have proven themselves capable of cross-aisle cooperation on important issues like National Security Agency reform. Socialist Bernie Sanders of Vermont and libertarian Justin Amash, R-Mich., have joined to tackle the problem of the surveillance state without the benefit of a \u201cProblem Solvers\u201d pin\u2014as have Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Ill., and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., cosponsors of the USA Freedom Act.\n\nSolving that problem will take a fight, but there's no \u201cfixing\u201d without \u201cfighting.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "It\u2019s easy to make fun of No Labels; their empty pieties offer no real alternative to business as usual.", "title": "We Need Political Labels, and Battles", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/02/04/we-need-political-labels-and-battles", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/2014_02/MajorParties.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/2014_02/MajorParties.jpg", "description": "In his State\nof the Union address last week, President\nObama demanded \u201ca year of action.\u201d\nBut what we really need, Reps.
