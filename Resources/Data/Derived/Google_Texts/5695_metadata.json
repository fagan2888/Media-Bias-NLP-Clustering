A toddler shot himself or herself in 31 of those occasions, Ingraham found.\n\nThese incidents are more common in the plains states and the Southeastern United States, according to Ingraham\u2019s report. In fact, Missouri has had five separate events where a toddler has shot himself or herself. Florida and Texas sit right behind with four and three incidents, respectively, according to Ingraham.\n\nIn fact, as our own Tyler Stahle reported in May, a child shoots someone almost every 36 hours.\n\nThis news comes at a time when gun violence has increased overall in the United States, especially on the large-scale level. As I reported earlier this month, there have been more mass shootings in 2015 than there have been days in the year \u2014 showing that the U.S. averages more than one mass shooting per day.\n\n![](https://atlas.qz.com/i/atlas_Ny07Wfvke.png)\n\nBut as Ingraham noted and research \u2014 like this 2013 investigation into [gun violence and how it affects kids](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/children-and-guns-the-hidden-toll.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) from The New York Times \u2014 has backed up, these incidents are avoidable, especially if parents take proper precautions to secure their weapons and keep them away from children.\n\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t accidents,\u201d according to a 2015 study from Everytown Research. \u201cThey\u2019re preventable. More than two-thirds of these tragedies could be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and prevented children from accessing them.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a study from researchers at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill found that just 57 percent of adults lock up their guns in places where children can\u2019t find them, according to ABC News.\n\n\"This surprised me,\" Dr. Tamera Coyne-Beasley, senior author of the study, told ABC News. \"I [thought] people who exercised good general safety habits would also probably have good firearm safety habits as well.\"\n\nMore so, 36 percent of families who own guns admitted in the study that they kept their guns loaded and 45 percent said they won\u2019t use locks on their weapons, ABC News reported.\n\nThat goes against Coyne-Beasley\u2019s advice for keeping children safe from guns.\n\n\"If you must keep a gun [at home] the safest thing to do is to unload [it] and keep it locked up,\u201d Coyne-Beasley told ABC News. \u201cThen keep the ammunition locked up and stored separately from the gun.\u201d\n\nStill, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests the best way to keep children safe from guns is to just not own one, or remove it from the home entirely. If parents do choose to own a gun, it\u2019s important they store it somewhere other than where their child plays, the AAP reported.\n\n\u201cRemember that young children simply do not understand how dangerous guns can be, despite parents' warnings,\u201d according to the AAP.\n\nIt\u2019s also important for gun owners to leave their weapon unloaded when it\u2019s locked away, and to keep the bullets away from the gun, according to the AAP. Parents may also want to hide any keys that can give children access to the weapon.\n\nWhat To Expect, a parental advice website, suggests parents also don\u2019t leave their guns around the home if they choose to clean them, and may even want to install a trigger lock for extra security.\n\nBut most important, What To Expect suggests that parents teach their children how to respond if they find a gun in the home to limit the amount of potential violence.\n\n\u201cTeach your children these four rules so they know what to do if despite your best efforts they do find a gun unattended in your home (or at a friend\u2019s or relative\u2019s): Stop. Don\u2019t touch. Leave the room immediately. Tell an adult. Repeat these rules early and often,\u201d What To Expect explained.\n\nSimple conversations with your child can also help.\n\n\u201cHave regular conversations about the violence your kids may see on TV, in movies, or in video games, and explain how that\u2019s different from what happens in real life,\u201d according to What To Expect. \u201cKeeping those lines of communication open and honest is one of the best ways to keep kids safe (no matter what the issue).\u201d\n\nOrganizations like Gun Free Kids also work to inform parents about proper gun safety. They also offer a wide range of tips and information for parents who own guns or are considering buying one.\n\nFor more on gun violence and children:\n\nMental health vs. gun control: The answer may be somewhere in the middle\n\nHow does a school move on after a shooting?\n\nHow to talk to your child about the Umpqua Community College shooting\n\nHerb Scribner is a writer for Deseret News National.
