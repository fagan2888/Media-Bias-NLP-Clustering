Intermountain Healthcare of Salt Lake City, Utah on Monday said it will take full ownership of Amerinet, one of the nation’s largest healthcare group purchasing companies.

Intermountain already owns half of St. Louis, Missouri-based Amerinet. Under the new agreement, it would acquire the remaining half owned by Administrative Resources, Inc.

The deal is subject to ARI shareholder approval.

Intermountain, one of the largest systems in the United States, already runs 22 hospitals, 200 clinics and its own health plan. The deal adds a group purchasing business to its stable.

Group purchasing leverages the buying buying power of a large group to drive down costs and make ordering more efficient. Intermountain claims its own supply chain processes have helped the system save money.

Amerinet’s member roster isn’t small, either. The company lists more than 83,000 on its website, divided among acute care hospitals, clinics, hospital-based physicians, ambulatory surgery centers and other providers.
