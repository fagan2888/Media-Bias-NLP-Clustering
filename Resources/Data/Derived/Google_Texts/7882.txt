CONCORD, N.C. — The second race in “The Double” is underway.

Kurt Busch has started the Coca-Cola 600 just hours after finishing the Indianapolis 500 in sixth place. Busch is bidding to become the second driver to finish both races in the same day.

Busch qualified 28th for the Coca-Cola 600 but had to start the 400-lap race at the rear of the field because he didn’t make it to the track in time for the driver’s meeting. He arrived at the track via helicopter about an hour before the start of the Sprint Cup race.

Only three drivers have attempted “The Double.” Robby Gordon was the last to try in 2004. Only Tony Stewart in 2001 successfully completed the two races.
