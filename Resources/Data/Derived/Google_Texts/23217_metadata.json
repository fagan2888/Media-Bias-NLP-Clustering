This situation now forces the Congress to move boldly on this issue. This is a very clear-cut concern; it\u2019s very black and white. We must get big money and big labor out of the election process or this country will be unsalvageable.\n\nMillions and millions of dollars have flooded into the political arena since the 2010 Citizens United ruling. This clearly usurped the sovereign guidance of the American people, putting corporations and banks effectively in charge of the United States by way of money.\n\nA Princeton University study recently found the United States to no longer be a representative democracy but an oligarchy, where a group of social elite run the country. That is the state of it, and we must rectify it before time runs out.
