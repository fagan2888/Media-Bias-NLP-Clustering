Burdick, details the opportunities for further savings in the present U.S. system, despite the improvements of Obamacare.\n\nDr. Burdick maintains that \u201cthrough controlling expenses that do not help patients, a single payer system will simplify our health care, improve the quality of care and provide savings far exceeding the cost of extending coverage to every American.\u201d\n\nDr. Burdick\u2019s book disputes criticisms being lodged against Bernie Sanders\u2019 single payer health care plan.\n\n\u201cThe cost of a single payer national health program will be lower because it will avoid the excess expenses in the largely unregulated chaos today,\u201d Dr. Burdick says.\n\nDr Burdick cites what he calls the sinkholes of wasted US medical expenditures \u2014 insurance administration ($300 billion), harmful excessive care (at least $500 billion), lost taxes from employer health plans ($100 billion).\n\n\u201cNone of these costs would be necessary in a single payer system,\u201d Dr. Burdick says. \u201cSavings of nearly a trillion dollars, as detailed in these estimates, will far exceed the cost of extending coverage to the over 30 million presently unserved Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis common sense has been buried in expensive campaign advertising that confuses present reality and clouds future possibilities,\u201d Dr. Burdick says. \u201cThe game-changing argument in this book is that now no one can honestly claim that higher costs will result for most Americans in a single payer system than the charges and financial risks we are burdened with in our present outrageously expensive health care system.\u201d\n\nDr. Burdick developed the physician-empowering strategy detailed in his book after a high-tech surgical career in organ transplantation.\n\n\u201cFifteen years ago, when the Clinton health reform failed, I began to feel that something was missing,\u201d Dr. Burdick says. \u201cAlmost no one mentioned it \u2014 the doctors were missing from the design. This book corrects that error.\u201d\n\nThe book includes quotes from Burdick\u2019s interviews with thirty health care experts.\n\nHis single payer solution calls for the creation of \u201ca transparent, apolitical national public-private doctors board, using secure electronic medical records to make the system work best for doctors and patients.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 3.8.14", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A Johns Hopkins transplant surgeon asserts that a single payer health care system will actually save most taxpayers money.\n\u201cNone of these costs would be necessary in a single payer system,\u201d Dr. Burdick says.\nThis book corrects that error.\u201dThe book includes quotes from Burdick\u2019s interviews with thirty health care experts.\n\u201cFifteen years ago, when the Clinton health reform failed, I began to feel that something was missing,\u201d Dr. Burdick says.\n\u201cThe cost of a single payer national health program will be lower because it will avoid the excess expenses in the largely unregulated chaos today,\u201d Dr. Burdick says."}
