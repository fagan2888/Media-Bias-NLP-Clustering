No one wears shorts to Sunday morning services at St. Andrews African Methodist Episcopal Church, or blue jeans either. The church has sat in the leafy shadow of Sacramento’s Southside Park for more than 50 years, and the worshippers come in their Sunday bests – men in coats and ties, women in dresses and high heels, children freshly scrubbed, their hair neatly combed or braided, many wearing shiny patent leather shoes.
