The fiscally conservative argument against expanding Medicaid in Texas has taken another blow after the Kaiser Foundation released its annual state-by-state analysis of Medicaid enrollment and spending.

For the first time, Kaiser compared health care costs for states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA with those that didn’t, and the results aren’t great for Texas.

Predictably, states that expanded Medicaid coverage saw a big jump in enrollment – 18 percent on average, compared to a national growth rate of about 14 percent. Meanwhile, non-expansion states like Texas grew their rolls by just over five percent. This might seem a brag-worthy statistic for fans of limited government and ideological foes of Medicaid as a whole. But when placed in the context of taxpayer bang-for-buck, that five percent growth in enrollment loses much of its luster.

That’s because even though expansion states boosted the reach of their health care safety net by almost a fifth, their average state spending on Medicaid rose by just 3.4 percent.

Meanwhile, Medicaid costs to non-expansion states like Texas rose by a troubling 6.9 percent.

So while Texas and other non-expansion states allowed less than a third as many people to join Medicaid as in expansion states, they also ended up paying twice as much for that modest boost.

Of course, overall spending in expansion states – that is, Medicaid spending including federal dollars – rose commensurate with the jump in enrollment. So the 18 percent increase in number of enrollees in expansion states came with a 17.7 percent rise in total Medicaid spending.

But the federal government paid 80 percent of that increase. In non-expansion states, federal spending on Medicaid grew by less than state spending—meaning, if it weren’t already obvious, that Uncle Sam is getting the sweet end of the deal as Texas and other states continue to resist Medicaid expansion.

What’s more, the Kaiser report looks at state spending directly on Medicaid. It doesn’t quantify the expected savings to counties and businesses caused by having fewer uninsured people seek free medical care through emergency rooms. Nor does it address the short- and long-term savings created by giving poor people access to preventative care and early treatment.

Catching illness early—or keeping it from ever starting—reduced health care costs at every level, in addition to improving the economic health of communities and reducing citizen reliance on other parts of the social safety net.

In short, there may be reasons not to expand Medicaid in Texas. It is becoming increasingly difficult, however, to argue that fiscal responsibility is one of them.
