The records do not include the audio content of the conversations.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The NSA called the technology \"very effective.\"", "description": "The NSA called the technology \"very effective.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The NSA called the technology \"very effective.\"", "title": "Docs reveal how NSA turns phone calls into searchable text", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/241075-docs-show-how-the-nsa-turns-phone-calls-into-searchable-text", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/smartphones_041915getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/241075-docs-show-how-the-nsa-turns-phone-calls-into-searchable-text", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-05T12:54-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "National Security Agency,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-05T12:54:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/241075-docs-show-how-the-nsa-turns-phone-calls-into-searchable-text", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The NSA called the technology \"very effective.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Docs reveal how NSA turns phone calls into searchable text"}, "dcterms.title": "Docs reveal how NSA turns phone calls into searchable text"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f12\"", "article_summary": "The National Security Agency (NSA) has for years used sophisticated technology that can turn audio content from phone calls or news broadcasts into rough transcripts that can be easily searched and stored.\nThe records do not include the audio content of the conversations.\n\u201cVoice word search technology allows analysts to find and prioritize intercept based on its intelligence content,\u201d the NSA said in a 2006 memo.\n\u201cTechnology is amazing.\u201dThe technology has been employed extensively in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the Intercept, as well as in Mexico and Latin America.\nThe first version of the technology was rolled out in 2004, under the code name \"Rhinehart,\" designed to search real-time audio as well as months-old archives."}
