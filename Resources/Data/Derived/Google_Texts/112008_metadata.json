Streisand: I would love her to run. I think we have advanced with Obama, and I think people are giving him a hard time, which is not fair because this Affordable Care Act is working and it\u2019s going to help a lot of people. But it\u2019s like Greek tragedy, you know, they always try to bring down the gods, bring down the kings, bring down the leaders. AP: Do you feel like he\u2019s doing a good job? Streisand: I do. And it\u2019s right to take your time going to war and so forth. He has to be thoughtful.\n\nThe interviewer doesn\u2019t ask any follow-up questions nor probes Streisand\u2019s answers. It\u2019s still a typical response on the subject from Obama\u2019s loyal Hollywood supporters.\n\nHis job is oh, so hard. He doesn\u2019t deserve the level of criticism he receives. ObamaCare is just wonderful, thank you for asking. It\u2019s like a script passed around from agent to agent, one worked on rigorously by spin doctors and pundits alike.\n\nAnd, like many Hollywood scripts, it has plenty of holes in it.\n\nObama\u2019s approval ratings are nose-diving, even if media outlets refuse to promote their own polls revealing that ugly truth. The public, which approved of Obama enough to elect him twice, have seen enough.\n\nStreisand blithely praises ObamaCare an the president\u2019s \u201cthoughtful\u201d leadership while average voters see chaos and indecision. Her song remains the same despite evidence to the contrary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barbra Streisand: America 'Advanced' Under Obama, Says Leader Doing Good Job", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Barbra Streisand: America 'Advanced' Under Obama, Says Leader Doing Good Job", "title": "Barbra Streisand: America 'Advanced' Under Obama, Says Leader Doing Good Job - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/09/17/streisand/Barbra-Streisand.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2014/09/18/barbra-streisand-obama-advanced/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Barbra Streisand: America 'Advanced' Under Obama, Says Leader Doing Good Job", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/09/17/streisand/Barbra-Streisand.png", "title": "Barbra Streisand: America 'Advanced' Under Obama, Says Leader Doing Good Job - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "published_time": "2014-09-18T10:13:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bdb\"", "article_summary": "Streisand blithely praises ObamaCare an the president\u2019s \u201cthoughtful\u201d leadership while average voters see chaos and indecision.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBarbra Streisand is singing President Barack Obama\u2019s praises like it\u2019s 2008 all over again.\nStreisand is out promoting a new album of duets dubbed Partners, and during one interview fielded a politically charged question about both Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 political aspirations as well as Obama\u2019s job performance.\nBack then, the country appeared enamored of a leader who promised hope, change and the fundamental transformation of the nation.\nBut it\u2019s like Greek tragedy, you know, they always try to bring down the gods, bring down the kings, bring down the leaders."}
