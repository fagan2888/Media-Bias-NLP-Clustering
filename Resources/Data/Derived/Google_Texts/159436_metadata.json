If you\u2019re not feeling the love for 14 February, join the club. But we singletons have a lot more to gripe about than a dearth of roses and the inability to get a table for dinner at a nice restaurant. Being single is actually hazardous to your financial health.\n\nMarried couples who like to complain about the \u201cmarriage penalty \u201d in tax rules \u2013 which can have them forking out thousands of dollars more in payments to the IRS now they file jointly \u2013 don\u2019t realize that that over the course of the year, the financial benefits they derive from being a couple may be just as significant. It\u2019s just that rarely are they ever spelled out explicitly.\n\nYour auto insurance company isn\u2019t going to tell you: \u201cCongratulations! Because you\u2019re married , you have now qualified for a lower rate!\u201d\n\nThe financial benefits of coupledom start early and add up over time, especially if you\u2019re a woman and already likely to earn less over the course of your lifetime. One study pegged the lifetime cost of being single at as much as $1m .\n\nYou\u2019ve decided to revisit Europe with your new partner and introduce him to the places you loved on your last visit \u2013 and realize, to your joy, that sharing hotel rooms cuts the cost literally in half, and splitting the car rental in half makes in cheaper for each of you than it would if you were making the trip solo. Even if you\u2019re traveling by train, rail passes offer special deals for people traveling together. If you\u2019re planning a cruise, the benefits are even more stark: if you want to do it solo, you\u2019ll get hit with a penalty for occupying a cabin on your own.\n\nMove in together, and the benefits start to multiply . You once struggled to juggle rent or mortgage payments on your own; now there are two of you earning a paycheck (well, hopefully) and either this frees up a lot of extra cash for you both to save or spend on those vacations, or it means that you can grab a nicer space.\n\n(I confess to envying those within my circle of friends who were able to execute this manoeuvre; envy that spilled over into irritation when they didn\u2019t understand why I chose to abandon New York\u2019s high rents, as a singleton. \u201cIt\u2019s not really all that expensive,\u201d one told me. \u201cWe found something.\u201d Yes, I muttered to myself; the key word there was \u201cwe.\u201d)\n\nThe same applies to most household expenses. You can cut utility bills and the cost of household repairs in half. Even food bills drop: you can buy more efficiently when there are two of you eating.\n\nThen we get into the lifestyle stuff. When you go to a wedding, or have to buy a Christmas or birthday present for one or the other\u2019s parents or siblings, suddenly, it\u2019s a present from \u201cMike and Jane\u201d or \u201cCassie and Dave\u201d \u2013 you can share the financial burden. And you win the other way around too, since most of your old friends and family members will direct their own gifts for you to either Cassie or Dave, rather than to you as a couple (unless, of course, it\u2019s a wedding gift). Health clubs offer couples special rates. If you\u2019re a couple, you can get a joint cellphone plan and save that way, too.\n\nAnd for all the griping about the marriage penalty, if you decide to tie the knot, the financial benefits extend well beyond the silver photo frames, the fancy espresso machine and other gifts. While Obamacare has, to some extent, eliminated some of the advantage given to those seeking health insurance as a couple, you\u2019ll still get other financial breaks once you\u2019re married.\n\nLawyers have calculated that in the workplace, the \u201c marriage-centric\u201d nature of the benefits that companies offer mean that the value of a single person\u2019s compensation is about 25% less than that of his or her married colleague\u2019s package \u2013 even if they are earning the same nominal salary. You can live with and support a parent, sibling or child \u2013 but you can\u2019t name them as a beneficiary on most pensions: only a spouse qualifies.\n\nLet\u2019s not even get into the ways in which some entities actively discriminate against singles. There will be some neighborhoods where you won\u2019t be able to rent or buy \u2013 yes, studies have discovered housing discrimination against singles. There will be issues like working on holidays, promotions and all that stuff \u2013 rightly or wrongly, many folks still view married individuals as more stable than singles.\n\nSeveral big benefits involve retirement. For starters, married couples seem predisposed to save more . Then, too, the tax laws favor them. You can name anyone as a beneficiary of your IRA: yippee! But if you\u2019re married, and your spouse isn\u2019t working, you can save extra (tax free!) for every year that he or she isn\u2019t employed. And if there\u2019s a health emergency and you need to tap into that cash to cover medical or education expenses, the spouse can do that under some circumstances \u2013 and without paying the 10% penalty a singleton faces .\n\nSocial Security favors married folks even more blatantly. If I were married, I could collect half of my husband\u2019s benefits while he was still alive. If he died, and his benefits were higher than my own would have been, I would get his instead of mine. Great deal.\n\nIn fact, the only way that being married imposes a lasting financial penalty seems to involve having a large family and then having both spouses encounter job problems. Raising children is a costly enterprise \u2013 the average annual price tag is between $12,800 and $15,000 for a middle-income family raising a child to the age of 18 \u2013 so that changes the dynamics somewhat. But then, with children come a host of new tax breaks and benefits that singletons don\u2019t benefit from. And of course, not all parents are in couples\u2026\n\nAfter pondering the myriad ways in which I\u2019m disadvantaged, financially speaking, by remaining single, the only thing that is stopping me from rushing out to sign up for an online dating service is the recognition that if there\u2019s one thing worse than watching couples bask in their financial privilege, it would be ending up in a toxic relationship.\n\nAfter all, the statistics also show, very clearly, that if marriage is no solution to poverty, divorce can be a giant step toward financial disaster .\n\nSuzanne McGee\n\nguardian.co.uk \u00a9 Guardian News and Media 2015", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Single-and-unhappy-on-Valentines-Day-via-Shutterstock-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Happy Valentine\u2019s Day?
