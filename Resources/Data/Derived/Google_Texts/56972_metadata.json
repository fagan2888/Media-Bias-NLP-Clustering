Plus, when sleep cycle is disrupted, you deal with obesity, depression and other things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also hate the idea of these little kids standing out in the dark waiting on buses,\u201d she continued.\n\nCurrently, Sequoyah High School, Vonore Elementary and Vonore Middle schools are already on the 8:15 a.m. start time schedule.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said Director of Schools Tim Blankenship. \u201cIt would help on the buses too.\u201d\n\nHarrill said a lot of school systems have looked at moving their start times.\n\nBlankenship asked the School Board if they wanted him to put up a survey on the school system\u2019s website to get community feedback, but he was quickly greeted with the answer \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why they elected this board,\u201d said 3rd District member Steve Rogers.\n\nOther board members felt like the community should be involved.\n\n\u201cI do think we need feedback,\u201d said 2nd District\u2019s member Bob Lovingood.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to make that decision without it,\u201d added 2nd District\u2019s Marsha Boring Standridge.\n\nRogers explained that he was for it right now, but if the majority of the community is against it, he will not be able to vote for it.\n\nThe School Board tabled further discussion on changing the start time until the April meeting. Chairman Dr. Larry Stein gave the board instructions to talk with parents and community members in their district to get feedback. Blankenship said he would get feedback from teachers and principals.\n\nSticking with the topic of changing times, Rogers recommended changing the start time for School Board meetings from 7 p.m. to 6 p.m.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try it for three months,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t like it, we can go back to the way it is.\u201d\n\nA few board members had concerns, however.\n\n\u201cWe do need to give people who attend the board meetings time to get here after getting off work,\u201d said Bob Lovingood.\n\n\u201cIf people work and want to have time to stop at home and change, they\u2019re not going to have time to do that,\u201d added Sonya Lynn.\n\nRogers said he believed that while it may hurt a few, it would \u201chelp the vast majority.\u201d\n\nIn a roll call vote, only Lynn and Dewitt Upton voted against the three-month trial, which will begin at the April meeting.\n\nAlso at the meeting:\n\n\u2022 Rural Vale Elementary School student Vince Weigel was honored for his second-place win at the state Beta Convention recently.\n\n\u2022 Rural Vale Elementary School Principal Missy Carter and Monroe Academy Principal Maurice Moser gave state-of-the-school presentations.\n\nCarter recognized fifth-grader James Holt for winning the 4H Poultry Show, calling him the \u201cchicken king,\u201d and seventh-grade student Autumn Ritsko for winning first place in website design at the National History Day competition for the Southeastern Division. Ritsko\u2019s project on Sacajawea\u2019s leadership throughout history will advance her to the state contest in Nashville.\n\nMoser announced that Monroe Academy had graduated 57 students so far this school year and that all students at the academy had enrolled in Tennessee Promise.\n\n\u2022The School Board approved several budget amendments, overnight field trip requests and the consent agenda.\n\n\u2022 Second District\u2019s Standridge, 3rd District\u2019s Lynn and 1st District\u2019s Dr. Stein were appointed to the Policy Committee. The Policy Committee will meet in its first meeting on March 24 at 4 p.m.\n\n\u2022 The calendar for the 2016-2017 school year was approved. The calendar follows the current schedule after the previous year-round school proposal was decided against.\n\n\u2022 Transportation and Maintenance Director Terry Harris asked permission to open bids for a mowing services contract for the school system.\n\nHarris said after looking into Affordable Care Act regulations, also known as Obamacare, they realized they were going to have to pay insurance for two additional full-time employees, as two people are hired to work 40 hours weekly from April to October for mowing season.\n\n\u201cBecause that makes them full-time employees, we\u2019d have to offer health care,\u201d said Harris.\n\nThat with the overall upkeep to continue mowing (approximately $46,000 last school year on labor, parts, gas, etc.), Harris said it may be beneficial to bid out for a contract instead of having maintenance employees do the mowing. This year is also the year that the school system had set aside to buy mowing machines.\n\nAt the motion of Lovingood, the School Board moved to bid five-year contractor mowing services out for two mowers.\n\nHarris also updated the School Board on bus route changes.\n\n\u201cThe weather got us a little bit behind,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, Harris said he is working with the Madisonville and Vonore bus contractors to improve those routes and the Tellico routes are being developed and studied now. He said he is looking at implementing the new routes after TCAP testing.\n\nIn addition, Harris said the bids for the three extracurricular activities buses for the high schools were opened this week and will be awarded next Thursday, March 19.\n\n\u2022 In his director of schools report, Blankenship announced that the school system had been granted a waiver for three missed snow days, leaving the system with one inclement weather day to use this year.\n\nThe Five-Year Plan Committee met last week and will present to the board in May.\n\nIn addition, Blankenship said a new legal and corrections services class would be piloted at Sequoyah High School next school year by the Sheriff\u2019s Office. Blankenship hopes the class, which will be at no cost to the school system, can be expanded to all the area high schools in the future.\n\n\u2022 The School Board will meet in a budget workshop on Thursday, April 9, at 5 p.m. just before the new time for the regular monthly meeting at 6 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Advocate & Democrat", "description": "MADISONVILLE-The start time for the Monroe County School System may be changing soon.", "title": "Later start for school days?", "url": "http://www.advocateanddemocrat.com/news/article_da6c03ba-cbdf-11e4-880c-1f2cd97a9012.html", "image": "http://advocateanddemocrat.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/og_image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@MCADnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "MADISONVILLE-The start time for the Monroe County School System may be changing soon.", "fb": {"app_id": 135817296433862}, "keywords": "news", "news_keywords": "news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf9d\"", "article_summary": "\u2022The School Board approved several budget amendments, overnight field trip requests and the consent agenda.\n\u2022 Transportation and Maintenance Director Terry Harris asked permission to open bids for a mowing services contract for the school system.\nAt the motion of Lovingood, the School Board moved to bid five-year contractor mowing services out for two mowers.\nHarris also updated the School Board on bus route changes.\nThis year is also the year that the school system had set aside to buy mowing machines."}
