Everyone I met in the Project owned Bitcoin and was willing to accept it for goods and services. Of the couple thousand people living there, at least seven own 3D-printers. Though the idea originally was to get a critical mass to influence the political process, many in the movement now feel that the freedoms they want may be better realized through technology that routes around the government rather than engaging it directly.....\n\nThe Free Staters are into Bitcoin:\n\nErik Voorhees, a Bitcoin entrepreneur who recently made headlines for settling a suit with the SEC over selling shares in Bitcoin businesses for Bitcoin, moved to New Hampshire in May 2011 to join the Free State Project. It was there that he first heard about Bitcoin after someone posted about it in the Free State Facebook group. \u201cVery few Free Staters knew about about it at that point. They don\u2019t like using government money, but they were more into gold and silver than virtual currency,\u201d he says. \u201cI went down the rabbit hole and couldn\u2019t stop talking about it, and then warmed other Free Staters up to it.\u201d Voorhees notes that Roger Ver, a Bitcoin entrepreneur who lives in Tokyo, was also an early signer of the Free State petition, and bought Bitcoin ads on Free Talk Live, a libertarian radio station associated with the project.\n\nThey are into 3D printing:\n\nI also saw my first 3D-printed gun that weekend. A member of the Free State movement, Bill Domenico, printed the second-ever Liberator after Defense Distributed\u2019s Cody Wilson first made it a reality in Texas last year. Domenico, an electrical engineer, has lived in New Hampshire for 30 years, and joined the Free State Project in 2008. He has a 3D printer that he built himself as well as a commercial one. He has printed two guns with it so far, but only for himself. \u201cIt would be illegal for me to print guns for other people,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t used it heavily beyond that. Lately, I\u2019ve been making memorabilia for PorcFest: Liberator earrings and porcupine trinkets.\u201d\n\nAnd lasers as a means to communicate with fellow citizens:\n\nBill Domenico says another popular technology within the movement is the \u201cGreen Beam,\u201d a laser projector he built for campaigning for Ron Paul that now gets used to warn people about police checkpoints or to stage public protests, as when \u201cBearcat Equals Tyranny\u201d and \u201c City Council Sucks\u201d were projected on a building in Concord.\n\nIndeed, if a cool tech is opposed by the state and helps route around its restrictions, libertarians are natural early adopters.\n\nSee our December 2013 issue, our most recent exploration of the libertarian implications of cool tech, and the state's often rearguard actions against it.\n\nMy reporting from 2004 on the roots of the FSP.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Forbes tech writer Kashmir Hill hangs out with members of the libertarian diaspora of the Free State Project (FSP) in New Hampshire and finds\u2014no surprise", "title": "Exploring the Borderland of Libertarianism and Cool Tech with the Free State Project", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/06/17/exploring-the-borderland-of-libertariani", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_06/-51.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_06/-51.jpg", "title": "Exploring the Borderland of Libertarianism and Cool Tech with the Free State Project", "description": "Forbes tech writer Kashmir Hill \nhangs out with members of the libertarian diaspora of the Free\nState Project (FSP) in New Hampshire and finds\u2014no surprise to\nregular readers of Reason\u2014that many of them are early\nadopters and innovators with cutting edge state-defying\ntechnologies.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nI discovered that this isolated group has fully adopted Bitcoin,\nand that", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reason"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-06-17T20:40:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/brian-doherty"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddca5\"", "article_summary": "Domenico, an electrical engineer, has lived in New Hampshire for 30 years, and joined the Free State Project in 2008.\nA member of the Free State movement, Bill Domenico, printed the second-ever Liberator after Defense Distributed\u2019s Cody Wilson first made it a reality in Texas last year.\nIt was there that he first heard about Bitcoin after someone posted about it in the Free State Facebook group.\n\u201cVery few Free Staters knew about about it at that point.\nIndeed, if a cool tech is opposed by the state and helps route around its restrictions, libertarians are natural early adopters."}
