But after a purge of the lists this spring, just 82,605 doctors are now available, according to the state Department of Health Care Services.\n\nMany doctors have chosen not to continue providing for Medicaid patients in the state after Obamacare forced an update of provider requirements, according to Medi-Cal spokesman Anthony Cava. The updated requirements \u201chave strengthened the department\u2019s ability to deny or terminate providers who do not comply with application requirements,\u201d Cava said.\n\nOthers were dropped from the list of participating physicians because they hadn\u2019t accepted a Medicaid patient in the past 12 months, Cava said.\n\n\u201cThis has not resulted in a decrease in access to care,\u201d Cava insisted, according to California Health Report.\n\nBut Medicaid patients nationwide already struggle to find doctors that accept the coverage, which typically has the lowest physician reimbursements of any federal program. Earlier this year, a Merritt Hawkins survey of physicians in top cities across the country found that just 45 percent of physicians in the 15 biggest cities in the country take Medicaid patients.

According to the state\u2019s data, those numbers will now fall even further.\n\nThe drastic drop couldn\u2019t come at a worse time for low-income customers in California, which has signed up more new Medicaid customers than any other state as part of the health-care law\u2019s Medicaid expansion. California has two million more Medicaid sign-ups from the expansion, bringing its grand total to 10.5 million Medi-Cal customers statewide.\n\nState officials are already struggling with the large influx. California was one of six states to be called out by the federal Obamacare and Medicaid administrator, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), for failing to address its staggering backlog of Medicaid applications. The state owed CMS a plan on how to address its 600,000 application backlog last Monday.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "The number of doctors accepting Medicaid patients in California dropped by a quarter from 2013, at the same time that 2 million new Obamacare expansion patients", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The number of doctors accepting Medicaid patients in California dropped by a quarter from 2013, at the same time that two million new Obamacare expansion patients are joining the rolls.
