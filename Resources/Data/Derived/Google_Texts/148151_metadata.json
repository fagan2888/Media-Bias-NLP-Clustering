It remains the highest rate in the developed world despite tax reform pledges by leaders of both major U.S. political parties.\n\nThose guarding the mountains of overseas cash include some of the best-known names in American business, including General Motors Co., General Electric Co., Apple Inc. and Google Inc.\n\nWhile many companies are simply reinvesting the cash in their operations in China and other overseas markets that have been growing faster than their U.S. operations, others are using it to acquire foreign companies. A majority appear to be using the cash as collateral to borrow funds in the U.S. to finance generous stock buyback and dividend programs for their shareholders. Only a small fraction of the money is being used to increase hiring, wages and business expansion in the U.S.\n\nFactors contributing to the unprecedented overseas cash balances include tax avoidance, easy credit conditions and booming overseas sales.\n\nSeveral deals recently highlighted the extreme measures companies are prepared to take to avoid paying U.S. taxes. Drug giant Pfizer this month announced that it would deploy some of its $39 billion overseas cash hoard in a $200 billion bid to purchase Britain\u2019s AstraZeneca PLC, with the goal of eventually relocating its headquarters to London so it no longer has to worry about paying U.S. taxes on its earnings.\n\nApple, which has the largest overseas cash trove by far at $132 billion, is one of the many corporations that, rather than dip into its cash and take a tax hit, took out debt instead to fund a big stock buyback and dividend program. The move was spurred by Carl C. Icahn and other activist investors frustrated at their inability to get their hands on some of the company\u2019s far-flung cash.\n\nBorrowing to buy stock\n\nAmong the 80 percent of blue chip companies listed in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index that conducted major stock buyback programs last year \u2014 often after borrowing the money as Apple did \u2014 were Ford Motor Co., Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., 3M Co., Microsoft Corp., Safeway Inc., and Travelers Cos.\n\n\u201cShareholders are pushing for the return of this cash,\u201d S&P analyst Andrew Chang said.\n\nApple and other corporations are unwilling to repatriate the money and pay high U.S. taxes on it, so they are borrowing money instead to satisfy investors, Mr. Chang said. He predicted that the trend would accelerate this year.\n\nCorporations get a double tax advantage if they borrow money to pay stockholders rather than dip into their cash. They can avoid giving a third of their earnings to the federal government, and the interest on their debt becomes a tax-deductible business \u201cexpense.\u201d\n\nMoreover, interest rates on the debt are some of the lowest on record, thanks to the Federal Reserve, which for the past five years has been trying to boost U.S. economic growth by purchasing more than $3 trillion of the most conservative bond investments: U.S. Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed\u2019s dominance of those traditional markets has driven private investors into corporate debt and riskier markets as they seek higher returns than the rock-bottom yields on Treasury bonds.\n\nInvestors\u2019 thirst for higher-yielding corporate debt has resulted in a borrowing binge. Corporations are taking out nearly $4 in loans for every $1 in cash they earned in recent years, according to S&P.\n\nSome say the borrowing spree borders on a credit market bubble that is feeding stocks because much of the debt is used to repurchase the companies\u2019 own shares.\n\nFew take the tax hit\n\nIn a survey last month of corporations with large cash holdings overseas, researchers at the British bank Barclays PLC found that only a small number of companies were repatriating their cash earnings for use in the U.S.\n\nEBay reported recently that it is bringing home $9 billion in cash to pursue \u201cgrowing opportunities in the U.S.\u201d The online auction giant also said it is making provisions for higher taxes on foreign earnings in the future as it transfers a higher proportion of its cash back to the U.S.\n\nBarclays found that companies like eBay, whose competitors are mainly in the U.S., are more likely to bring home their cash than companies like Apple and Pfizer, whose competitors reside mainly in other countries. Companies with mainly foreign competitors are more likely to spend their cash expanding and acquiring assets overseas, the survey found.\n\nOf all the companies with large overseas cash hoards, Xilinx Inc., NetApp Inc., Western Union Co. and EMC Corp. are the most likely to repatriate their money and pay taxes so they can use the funds in the American market, Barclays said.\n\nS&P\u2019s Mr. Chang said that, despite all the corporate machinations aimed at minimizing taxes and maximizing profits, the pileup of so much cash overseas seems to have been inadvertent for most corporations.\n\n\u201cWe believe most of these [corporations] did not intend to have such a large cash pile sitting on the sidelines. If given the choice, most would prefer to repatriate the cash and limit debt issuance,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Congress and the Obama administration have failed to reach an agreement on lowering tax rates, Mr. Chang pins as much blame for the borrowing binge on the Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the availability of cheap debt has been most responsible for the record cash balances,\u201d as it has simply made more economic sense for companies to borrow rather than spend down their cash, he said.\n\n\u201cWithout access to the accommodating credit markets, companies would likely not have provided the returns that shareholders have become accustomed to in recent years,\u201d Mr. Chang said, voicing the widespread view that investors in stocks and bonds \u2014 rather than workers and Main Street businesses \u2014 have been the main beneficiaries of the cash-backed borrowing binge.\n\nHiring drought continues\n\nWhatever the reasons driving the trend, economists and business leaders from Wall Street to Main Street have been decrying the drought of investment by U.S. businesses in expanding plants, upgrading equipment, and hiring and giving raises to workers, even though many of these corporations are flush with cash and increasingly burdened with debt.\n\nHistorically, businesses have devoted larger shares of their profits to improving their businesses. Even some prominent investors who have benefited from the stock-buying trend have raised alarm about corporations no longer making investments that produce long-term growth in their companies, not just short-term fillips in their stocks.\n\n\u201cToo many companies have cut capital expenditures and even increased debt to boost dividends and increase share buybacks,\u201d Larry Fink, chairman of BlackRock, which manages $4.3 trillion in investments, said in a letter to the chief executives of the world\u2019s 600 largest corporations. He said this practice can \u201cjeopardize a company\u2019s ability to generate sustainable long-term returns.\u201d\n\nWith corporate profits at the end of last year hitting a record high 11 percent of economic output even as middle-class wages stagnate, Jerry Jasinowski, former president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said corporate America is starting to look like Disney\u2019s stingy character Scrooge McDuck.\n\n\u201cOur biggest corporations have been sitting on a lot of money for many years, and it is not a transitory phenomenon. That fabled money bin just keeps growing,\u201d while companies listed in the S&P 500 index have been increasing investment in their businesses by only 0.8 percent a year, he said.\n\n\u201cInstead of launching new products and identifying new markets, they have become obsessed with controlling costs and financial transactions,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies have become notoriously reluctant to hire and slow to raise compensation for those not in the front office. This is causing hardship for many people \u2014 inflation has outpaced wage gains for the past five years \u2014 and is undermining the economy that these businesses depend upon for their big profits.\u201d\n\nFrustration in Congress\n\nFrustration over the persistent tax avoidance and business\u2019 hoarding practices is growing in Washington. For several years, President Obama and Republican leaders have advocated reforming the tax code to reduce the top corporate rate to 25 percent to 30 percent, eliminating or paring back loopholes such as business depreciation and expense deductions.\n\nMr. Obama has proposed tackling the corporate tax code as part of a broader campaign to curb the budget deficit, while Republicans want broader tax reforms that encompass both corporate and individual taxes.\n\nThe stalemate blocked most reform efforts this year, although new Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, Oregon Democrat, recently outlined his ideas about tax reform for the first time.\n\nShort of overhauling the tax code, a growing number of legislators advocate another tax \u201choliday\u201d like one enacted in 2004 that would temporarily lower the rates paid on repatriated cash as an inducement to get corporations to bring money back home. In his highway reauthorization bill submitted last month, Mr. Obama proposed using such a tax holiday as one way of paying for roads and bridges.\n\nThe holiday likely would provoke a \u201cmad rush of repatriation,\u201d and no doubt would be successful at temporarily filling federal coffers with a gusher of one-time tax payments, said Mr. Chang, but the money more likely would continue to be spent enriching shareholders rather than increasing hiring and business expansion in the U.S.\n\nIf Congress\u2019 goal is to induce businesses to create jobs, a tax holiday will not do the trick, said Curtis S. Dubay, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation. The 2004 holiday prompted businesses to bring $362 billion back home, but most of them spent the money on dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions.\n\nThe 2004 holiday had a \u201cnegligible\u201d impact on jobs, he said. To the extent the funds were used for corporate acquisitions, in fact, they may have helped cut jobs as merging companies eliminated overlapping functions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "American corporations seem to be doing just about everything with their record $1.53 trillion in cash holdings except using it to invest and hire in the United States, even though the sluggish economy could use the boost.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "American corporations seem to be doing just about everything with their record $1.53 trillion in cash holdings except using it to invest and hire in the United States, even though the sluggish economy could use the boost.", "title": "Corporations hoard cash overseas away from high U.S. taxes, have little incentive to reinvest", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/18/corporations-hoard-cash-overseas-away-from-high-us/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/18/5_182014_ap832406261059-08201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/18/5_182014_ap832406261059-08201.jpg", "description": "American corporations seem to be doing just about everything with their record $1.53 trillion in cash holdings except using it to invest and hire in the United States, even though the sluggish economy", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Corporations hoard cash overseas away from high U.S. taxes, have littl"}, "Author": "Patrice Hill", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Andrew Chang, Standard   Poor Corp, Apple Inc"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd68ea\"", "article_summary": "Those guarding the mountains of overseas cash include some of the best-known names in American business, including General Motors Co., General Electric Co., Apple Inc. and Google Inc.\nInvestors\u2019 thirst for higher-yielding corporate debt has resulted in a borrowing binge.\nCorporations get a double tax advantage if they borrow money to pay stockholders rather than dip into their cash.\nThree-quarters of that corporate cash pile was earned overseas and is being held outside the country to avoid the top U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent, according to a study by Standard & Poor\u2019s Corp.\nMr. Obama has proposed tackling the corporate tax code as part of a broader campaign to curb the budget deficit, while Republicans want broader tax reforms that encompass both corporate and individual taxes."}
