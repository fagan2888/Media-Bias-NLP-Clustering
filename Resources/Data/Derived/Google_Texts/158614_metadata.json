Lewis of the United Mine Workers dominated the movement.\n\nToday, nearly one in four Americans disapproves of organized labor, while 71 percent endorse the right-to-work laws, which are anathema to union members. Those laws \u2013 currently in force in 24 states \u2013 allow workers to hold jobs in unionized workplaces without joining a union.\n\nAfter decades of declining membership, loss of jobs to overseas markets, internal union strife, and corruption, the labor movement today is struggling to hang on as the economy and industry undergo dramatic change.\n\nPublic sector unions, including AFSCME (the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees), the American Federation of Government Employees, and the American Federation of Teachers, enjoy a membership rate of 35.3 percent, according to Department of Labor statistics. That is five times greater than the 6.7 percent union rate within the private sector job market.\n\nRelated: Big Labor\u2019s Mounting Feud with Barack Obama\n\n\u201cHardly a day goes by when American unions are not attacked from some quarter,\u201d Thomas A. Kochan, a professor of industrial relations and employment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management, wrote recently in Fortune.\n\nThe assaults range from a Supreme Court decision that weakened unions representing home care workers, to a California judge\u2019s ruling throwing out teacher tenure and seniority rules, to a few states like Wisconsin that have stripped public employees of collective bargaining rights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that for years most private sector employers have successfully fought union organizing and collective bargaining, using every legal delaying tactic and in many cases illegally firing workers,\u201d Kochan wrote. \u201cWal-Mart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, is the most visible case in point. By deploying its union-fighting swat team from corporate headquarters to any store that shows signs of worker protest, it has remained 100 percent \u2018union-free.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nGallup says the popularity of right-to-work laws stems largely from the widespread conviction that no American should be required to join any private organization against his or her will.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Auto Bailout Was Really a Hefty Union Payoff\n\n\n\nThe new poll found that 82 percent of Americans agree with that. Some pro-union forces \u2013 mostly Democrats \u2013 partly oppose right-to-work laws because of the \u201cfree-rider\u201d problem. That is, \u201cnon-union workers benefit as much as union workers when unions negotiate pay and benefit increases with employers,\u201d according to the Gallup analysis.\n\n\n\nRepublicans disapprove of unions by 57 percent to 32 percent and support right-to-work laws by 74 percent to 18 percent, according to Gallup\u2019s findings. Democrats overwhelmingly approve of labor unions, but they feel nearly as strongly as Republicans that workers should not be forced to join unions and pay dues if they don\u2019t want to.\n\n\n\nThe AFL-CIO contends that \u201cextremist groups, right-wing politicians and their corporate backers want to weaken the power of workers and their unions\u201d through \"right to work\" laws.\n\n\n\n\u201cTheir efforts are a partisan political ploy that undermines the basic rights of workers,\u201d the AFL-CIO said in a statement. \u201cBy making unions weaker, these laws lower wages and living standards for all workers in the state. In fact, workers in states with these laws earn an average of $5,680 less a year than workers in other states. Because of the higher wages, working families in states without these laws also benefit from healthier tax bases that improve their quality of life.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As another Labor Day rolls around, a new Gallup survey of the nation\u2019s attitudes toward the labor movement shows that just 53 percent still approve of unions and their goals \u2013 while the vast majority favors so-called \u201cright to work\u201d laws that have greatly accelerated the decline of unions in the private sector.", "title": "Why We Like \u2018Right-to-Work\u2019 Laws More Than Unions", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/29/Why-We-Right-Work-Laws-More-Unions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/020902102_Indiana_Unions_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/29/Why-We-Right-Work-Laws-More-Unions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/020902102_Indiana_Unions_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As another Labor Day rolls around, a new Gallup survey of the nation\u2019s attitudes toward the labor movement shows that just 53 percent still approve of unions and their goals \u2013 while the vast majority favors so-called \u201cright to work\u201d laws that have greatly accelerated the decline of unions in the private sector.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Republicans disapprove of unions by 57 percent to 32 percent and support right-to-work laws by 74 percent to 18 percent, according to Gallup\u2019s findings.\nSome pro-union forces \u2013 mostly Democrats \u2013 partly oppose right-to-work laws because of the \u201cfree-rider\u201d problem.\nToday, nearly one in four Americans disapproves of organized labor, while 71 percent endorse the right-to-work laws, which are anathema to union members.\n\u201cBy making unions weaker, these laws lower wages and living standards for all workers in the state.\nThat is, \u201cnon-union workers benefit as much as union workers when unions negotiate pay and benefit increases with employers,\u201d according to the Gallup analysis."}
