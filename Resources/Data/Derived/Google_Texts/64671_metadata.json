Officers also discovered a tripod, camera and several sex toys in the room. He is accused of videotaping the teenager performing sex acts.\n\n\"There was another 17-year-old female found in the parking lot, and [she] admitted to have sex with Heselton the night before,\" Oklahoma City Police Captain Dexter Nelson said.\n\nAccording to court papers, both teenagers admitted they had sex with Heselton, and that the act was videotaped. They claim it happened several times, often at Heselton's home in Edmond. The teenagers also told officers that Heselton was well aware of their age.\n\nHeselton was not at his law office today to answer questions about the allegations.\n\nHe was not at home either, and Acers and others neighbors said that's fine with them. They don't want that type of activity in their neighborhood.\n\n\"The neighborhood kind of stops right there across the street when it starts with his house,\" Acers said.\n\nHeselton was arrested on complaints of possession of child pornography and is now out on $20,000 dollar bond.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A local attorney is in trouble with the law tonight, arrested for possession of child pornography.", "author": "Lisa Monahan", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25061280/local-attorney-arrested-for-possession-of-child-pornography", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25061280_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A local attorney is in trouble with the law tonight, arrested for possession of child pornography.", "title": "Local Attorney Arrested For Possession Of Child Pornography"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25061280_SA.jpg", "description": "A local attorney is in trouble with the law tonight, arrested for possession of child pornography.", "card": "summary", "title": "Local Attorney Arrested For Possession Of Child Pornography"}, "wnreadableurl": "local-attorney-arrested-for-possession-of-child-pornography", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/03/24", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news, crime, local, attorney, arrested, possession, child, pornography, teenage, girl, hotel, room, news 9, news9.com, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS28", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news, crime, local, attorney, arrested, possession, child, pornography, teenage, girl, hotel, room, news 9, news9.com, kwtv"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc93c\"", "article_summary": "A local attorney is in trouble with the law tonight, arrested for possession of child pornography.\nJoseph Heselton, Jr. was arrested on complaints of possession of child pornography and is now out on $20,000 dollar bond.\nHeselton was arrested on complaints of possession of child pornography and is now out on $20,000 dollar bond.\nNo one at Heselton's home would comment on his arrest for child pornography, but neighbors said they've speculated he was involved in some sort of illegal activity.\nAcers lives across the street from Heselton, Jr. and said she's long been suspicious of her neighbor."}
