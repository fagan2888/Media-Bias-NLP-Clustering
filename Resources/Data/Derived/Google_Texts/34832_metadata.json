Providence, Alaska Regional, Alaska Native Medical Center and Fairbanks Memorial are all in the bottom 25% nationally for the number of infections and serious complications patients get in their hospitals, according to data analyzed by Kaiser Health News. The penalties are part of a focus on quality care that\u2019s included in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDownload Audio\n\nCentral lines are IV\u2019s inserted in veins that lead right to a patient\u2019s heart. Infections in those lines are serious. And in 2012, Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage had 17 of them in their Intensive Care Units.\n\n\u201cThere was no one single thing, there\u2019s no smoking gun, we were not doing x.\u201d\n\nDr. Dick Mandsager is Providence\u2019s hospital administrator. He says the hospital recognized the infections as they were happening and started paying attention to every detail for patients with central lines. In 2013, Providence had six central line infections instead of 17.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s making sure that the whole bundle of care is done every single time, all the time, regardless of how pressured you are, regardless of how many things you\u2019ve got on your mind.\u201d\n\nThe spike in central line infections in 2012 helped push Providence into the lowest quarter of hospitals nationally for safety measures Medicare is tracking. The analysis is preliminary, but the fines are unlikely to change when the final numbers are out later this year. In Alaska, Providence has plenty of company. The state\u2019s three other big hospitals; Alaska Native Medical Center, Fairbanks Memorial and Alaska Regional are all receiving penalties for patient safety. As a result, the hospitals will lose 1% of their Medicare payments for a year starting in October.\n\nJulie Taylor is the new CEO of Alaska Regional. She says her hospital\u2019s poor score is due in part to an increase in post surgical blood clots- seven total- during the year the Medicare data was pulled from.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the percent of our total surgeries, this number isn\u2019t alarming. But if it\u2019s my mom, that number is alarming, even one.\u201d\n\nTaylor says Alaska Regional has emphasized training to bring down the rate of blood clots and other complications, which is especially important given a staff turnover rate of 20 percent annually at the hospital:\n\n\u201cWhat that means to you is that we have to retrain staff who are coming in, make sure they understand all the protocols, because this takes hard wiring. It\u2019s not by happenstance that these things are prevented, it absolutely has to be hardwired and that\u2019s why orientation and training and vigilance has to take place.\u201d\n\nTaylor applauds Medicare\u2019s effort to track patient safety and penalize the worst performing hospitals. That\u2019s a point all of the hospitals agree on, including Fairbanks Memorial. Gena Edmiston is Chief Nursing Officer there. She says during the last year, the hospital has had a new focus on patient safety:\n\n\u201cWe meet every two weeks, look at every single safety incident in the hospital. We address them and then very consciously look for results.\u201d\n\nEdmiston says Fairbanks Memorial has seen steep drops in some areas, like central line infections. Other problems, like patient falls, have been harder to address.\n\nAll the hospitals pointed out potential problems with the way Medicare measures quality. Alaska Native Medical Center\u2019s Jay Butler chairs the infection control committee there and says his hospital\u2019s poor score flagged one main problem:\n\n\u201cThe one that really stands out to us is the catheter associated urinary tract infection rate.\u201d\n\nButler says many of the cases were from a type of bug that colonizes the urinary tract without causing an infection. Basically something that looks and acts like an infection, but isn\u2019t one. He says the hospital will address how those cases are handled. He says the way Medicare issues hospital penalties isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s better than nothing:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to track how we\u2019re doing otherwise we have no idea whether or not we\u2019re making progress. We wouldn\u2019t even know whether or not we\u2019re providing good care.\u201d\n\nBut a Harvard health policy expert has big problems with the way Medicare is measuring quality. Professor Ashish Jha says large teaching hospitals and urban hospitals tend to get the bulk of the penalties. He thinks that may be because they\u2019re doing a better job documenting complications compared to hospitals that aren\u2019t even aware of errors:\n\n\u201cWhat you end up doing is penalizing hospitals that are more vigilant, that are paying closer attention, are documenting the complications and coding them in their billing data.\u201d\n\nStill, Jha thinks infection rates, which do not come from billing data, are important quality measures. He says hospitals should have close to zero central line infections, the problem Providence struggled with, if they\u2019re following standard practice.\n\nDr. Mandsager, from Providence, says the hospital\u2019s goal is zero central line infections, but it\u2019s a challenge:\n\n\u201cI could not have predicted 20 years ago, in the measures that get publicly reported, how close you have to be to perfection otherwise you\u2019re doing poorly comparatively. Do I feel bad about our current performance? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nMandsager is confident Providence will not be in the same position during the next round of Medicare penalties. In the meantime, he says the 1% cut in Medicare payments is significant. The hospital estimates it will lose more than $500,000 in federal payments. Fairbanks Memorial Hospital calculates its lost payments could be as much as $400,000. Both Alaska Regional and Alaska Native Medical Center estimate their penalties will cost them around $200,000.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership between APRN, NPR and Kasier Health News.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "The four largest hospitals in Alaska are facing Medicare payment penalties for the quality of their care.
