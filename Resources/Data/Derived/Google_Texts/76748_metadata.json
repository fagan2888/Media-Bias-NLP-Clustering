However, concerns about the study\u2019s design, research methodology and management led to increased cost projections and triggered questions, most recently detailed in a June 16 report by the National Academy of Sciences, about whether the study should proceed. An NIH working group was charged with evaluating these issues.\n\n\u201cBased on the working group\u2019s findings and internal deliberation, I am accepting \u2026 findings that the NCS is not feasible,\u201d said NIH Director Francis Collins in the Dec. 12 announcement of the program\u2019s dismantlement. \u201cI am disappointed that this study failed to achieve its goals. Yet I am optimistic that other approaches will provide answers to these important research questions.\u201d\n\nAn NIH spokesperson said that the agency will use the experiences from the National Children\u2019s Study, including best practices on data collection and recruitment, to examine the links between environmental factors and child health and development in the smaller studies to be started in 2015.\n\n\u201cNIH will work with Congress to address any questions that they may have about the NCS. It\u2019s important to note that the Vanguard study [the pilot study that was the precursor to the NCS] did provide insights on best practices and strategies for conducting studies of this size and complexity,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nDean Baker, director at the Center for Occupational and Environmental Health at the University of California Irvine, was disappointed with the decision. He is concerned because NIH could use the $165 million for other research while still asserting that the agency has been doing what is required by the Children\u2019s Health Act.\n\n\u201cI hope there\u2019s something that could be used as the successor to the National Children\u2019s Study. Otherwise the funding will evaporate in following years,\u201d said Baker, who was involved in the initial study design and Vanguard Study.\n\nNIH has 90 days to submit new research plans to Congress.\n\nNigel Paneth, a professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at the University of Michigan, was involved with designing the study from its inception in 2000. Although he views the cancellation as the right decision, he doesn\u2019t agree with the way NIH dismantled the work at the original 40 sites and doesn\u2019t think the communications via email and letters with participants are being handled correctly. Researchers put a large effort into engaging communities and getting buy-in from participants.\n\n\u201cThey [NIH] had no concept that they were real people out there,\u201d he said. As the research was being slowed down and the number of sites was constricting, researchers were expected to turn over individuals\u2019 information to other researchers without consulting participants. \u201cIt was mismanaged, from the conceptual idea to actualization in the field,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The National Children\u2019s Study has been canceled despite almost 10 years of work and $1.3 billion of funding.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The National Children\u2019s Study has been canceled despite almost 10 years of work and $1.3 billion of funding.", "title": "Government Cancels Study After Spending $1.3 Billion", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/sfphotos424406.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-17T15:25:56+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xrkDIr"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The National Children\u2019s Study has been canceled despite almost 10 years of work and $1.3 billion of funding.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/sfphotos424406.jpg"}, "title": "Government Cancels Study After Spending $1.3 Billion", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "government waste", "published_time": "2014-12-17T11:23:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-17T15:25:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "nih, national children's study,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde159\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI hope there\u2019s something that could be used as the successor to the National Children\u2019s Study.\nThe National Children\u2019s Study has been canceled despite almost 10 years of work and $1.3 billion of funding after a National Institutes of Health working group concluded that the project was flawed and too expensive to continue.\nOtherwise the funding will evaporate in following years,\u201d said Baker, who was involved in the initial study design and Vanguard Study.\nAn NIH working group was charged with evaluating these issues.\nResearchers and children\u2019s health advocates now fear that while funding for smaller projects will continue in 2015 with an already appropriated $165 million, NIH may use that money for research not related to children\u2019s health."}
