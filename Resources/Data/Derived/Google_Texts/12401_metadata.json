Those numbers will take time to fully analyze.\n\nPremiums are the first thing most consumers look at.\n\nOverall, the premiums for a type of low-price plan that the government uses to set subsidies for consumers will cost roughly the same as this year, about $330 a month on average. Many people will pay much less after subsidies, about 25 percent of the cost, which will be good news for first-time customers.\n\nBut there is a catch if you are already a customer: Your plan may no longer be the low-cost benchmark in your community. In that case, you\u2019ll pay more unless you switch.\n\n\u201cJust because you enrolled in a low-cost plan this year is no guarantee that your plan will also be low-cost next year,\u201d said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. He analyzed a 48-city sample of 2015 premiums from data available earlier this week.\n\n\u201cLast year\u2019s low-cost plans will experience premium increases, meaning the majority of consumers will experience cost increases if they re-enroll in the same plan,\u201d said Caroline Pearson of Avalere Health, a private market analysis firm.\n\nAn early look by Avalare at premiums for a hypothetical 50-year-old nonsmoker in the benchmark plan found wide differences among states, from a 28 percent increase in Alaska to a 19 percent reduction in Mississippi. Most states saw single-digit changes.\n\nConsumers should be wary of national and even state averages, and instead focus on what\u2019s happening with their own plan, the analysis said.\n\nThe shifts are due to the ups and downs of the market, and to cost-saving provisions written into the law.\n\nSticker shock\n\nThe Affordable Care Act offers subsidized private health insurance to people who don\u2019t have access to coverage on the job. HealthCare.gov and state insurance markets are launching their second annual sign-up season, which runs through Feb. 15. This year, 85 percent of their customers received tax credits to subsidize their premiums.\n\nThose existing customers will be renewing coverage for the first time. Some could face sticker shock.\n\nThe following example uses actual premiums from HealthCare.gov, and was provided by the Kaiser Foundation:\n\nTake a hypothetical 40-year-old retail saleswoman in Miami making $20,000 a year. This year, she signed up for the benchmark low-cost plan in her area, the \u201cCoventry $10 Copay.\u201d The full premium was $270 a month. Her government tax credit covered $184 of that, so her share was $86 a month.\n\nFor 2015, Coventry is no longer the benchmark plan. Instead, it\u2019s the \u201cMolina Silver HMO,\u201d with a monthly premium of $274. If the consumer switches to Molina for 2015, the government will pay $191 and her share will be $83.\n\nBut if she wants to stay with Coventry, she\u2019ll see a 40 percent increase.\n\nThat\u2019s because Coventry increased its premium to $311 for 2015. And also, the federal share will be capped at $191 \u2014 what the government would pay for the benchmark Molina plan.\n\nThe consumer would be on the hook for $120 a month.\n\nMessy competition\n\nPart of the reason for such shifts is that the health care law was designed like a voucher system.\n\nYou get a tax credit for health insurance based on your income and on the premium for the benchmark plan in your area, called the \u201csecond-lowest-cost silver plan.\u201d Plans are offered in four \u201cmetal levels\u201d of coverage: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. The benchmark silver plan can change every year based on bids submitted by insurers.\n\nIf you pick a higher-cost plan, or if you stay in a plan that has lost its benchmark status, you are responsible for the entire difference in premiums.\n\nThe idea was to create incentives that would force insurers to compete and keep premiums low.\n\nCompetition is helping to drive down the price of the benchmarks, said Levitt, which is good for the federal budget. \u201cBut competition is also messy, particularly for consumers.\u201d\n\nRicardo Alonso-Zaldivar,\n\nThe Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some benchmarks changed, meaning their returning customers will pay more unless they switch, according to HHS data.", "og": {"description": "Some benchmarks changed, meaning their returning customers will pay more unless they switch, according to HHS data.", "title": "Obamacare premiums to rise for many looking to renew benchmark plans", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/washington/20141114-obamacare-premiums-to-rise-for-many-looking-to-renew-benchmark-plans.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-11-15T05:22:50Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-11-15T04:45:33Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare premiums to rise for many looking to renew benchmark plans\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/washington/20141114-obamacare-premiums-to-rise-for-many-looking-to-renew-benchmark-plans.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2043347\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-15T04:45:33Z\", \"section\": \"Washington\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-11-15T04:45:33Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "The benchmark silver plan can change every year based on bids submitted by insurers.\nHe analyzed a 48-city sample of 2015 premiums from data available earlier this week.\nBut there is a catch if you are already a customer: Your plan may no longer be the low-cost benchmark in your community.\nSticker shockThe Affordable Care Act offers subsidized private health insurance to people who don\u2019t have access to coverage on the job.\nThis year, she signed up for the benchmark low-cost plan in her area, the \u201cCoventry $10 Copay.\u201d The full premium was $270 a month."}
