Tim Arango and Michael R. Gordon write in the New York Times\n\nThe embassy, a beige fortress on the banks of the Tigris River within the heavily-secured Green Zone, where Iraqi government buildings are also located, has the largest staff of any United States Embassy. The exact number of people being evacuated was not clear Sunday. The embassy would remain open, a person familiar with the planning said, and much of its staff of about 5,500 would stay in Baghdad. The American government is expected to call the move a relocation, suggesting that it is a temporary precaution, the person said. Many staff members who are leaving will be flown to Amman, Jordan, where they will continue their work at the embassy there. Others will be shifted from Baghdad to consulates here in Erbil, in the northern Kurdish region, and in Basra, in the south, which are not now under threat by the militants.\n\nIs anyone comforted by the words of Sate Department spokeswoman (and former Obama campaign staffer) Jen Psaki (via AP)?\n\n\"Overall, a substantial majority of the U.S. Embassy presence in Iraq will remain in place and the embassy will be fully equipped to carry out its national security mission.\"\n\nThe photograph below by Hubert van Es became the iconic image of America\u2019s defeat in the Vietnam War, a political failure that resulted in allies being abandoned, millions slaughtered by our enemy, and American power held up to ridicule around the world.\n\nOur humiliation in Iraq, unless things chage drastically, will be even deeper, because our president now is feckless. Michael Ramirez of Investor\u2019s Business Daily captures the irony perfectly.\n\nOne big difference: The Vietnamese Communist Party had no interest in exporting its fight with us to our homeland.
