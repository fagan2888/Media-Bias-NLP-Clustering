They\u2019ll come to your kitchen or living room and give you a checkup, but they won\u2019t actually be there. They\u2019ll be live via the Web.\n\nWelcome to the age of virtual doctor visits.\n\nAn early foray into this new world is Medzed, a Web-based doctoring service that started recently in Atlanta, offering house calls and basic checkups for children in the metro area. Unlike some Web doctoring services, Medzed isn\u2019t run through an employer or insurance company. It\u2019s more like the Web version of urgent care, and it costs about the same per visit: $150, out of pocket.\n\nHow to see a virtual doctor\n\nThere are basically three ways you can see a doctor online. Most appealing perhaps, to those with a regular physician, is simply to connect with your usual doctor via the Web. Unfortunately, not many doctors formally see their patients that way. According to 2013 statistics from American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), that translates to about 1.6 e-visits per week, but the number is rising. And in recent years, 39 percent of doctors have reported communicating with patients in some way via the Internet, up from only 16 percent a few years earlier. Insurers are paying more doctors for this sort of service, though at a lower rate than for office visits.\n\nYou can also find a virtual doctor via your employer or insurer \u2014 again, only if they offer the service. And more are following suit. Such services are becoming more widespread and increasingly have the support of the insurance industry, which generally seems willing to pay for them.\n\nOne site that offers this option is LiveHealth Online, which is available in nearly every state through insurers like BlueCross BlueShield. LiveHealth, like many larger web doctor services, promotes the notion of having \u201ca doctor by your side 24/7.\u201d\n\nIf you don't have either option, you can go to an independent company like Medzed. Call them, explain your child's issue and they\u2019ll send a pediatric nurse to your door. After a brief exam and a few questions, the nurse will connect online with one of Medzed's four Georgia-based doctors, who then takes over the exam via live streaming video chat.\n\nIf necessary, the doctor can move beyond video interaction for certain parts of the exam. Various devices allow doctors to do things like check a patient\u2019s heartbeat. Doctors also can ask the nurse to give other diagnostic information throughout the exam. In most cases, the doctor can provide a diagnosis in a few minutes, and then call in medicine to a nearby pharmacy.\n\nBusy people like virtual doctors because they can skip crowded waiting rooms.

But the ease and availability of such services has a time-saving appeal for everyone \u2014 especially busy parents \u2014 since ER and doctor office visits are incredibly time-consuming.\n\nEmergency room wait times in the Atlanta area, for instance, range from a half hour to well over three. And that\u2019s just the time spent in the waiting room. All in all, total time spent at the ER \u2014 from when you enter the hospital to when you leave \u2014 averages two hours and 18 minutes in the United States.\n\nWait times at doctor\u2019s offices aren\u2019t quite so bad, with an average wait time of 21 minutes last year. But that was up 6 percent from the year before. And such yearly increases seem to be part of a trend, with wait times getting longer as doctors take on more patients.\n\nBut are \u201cwebcam doctors\u201d the future of medicine? It\u2019s too early to know the answer, but companies like Medzed hint at a trend. Virtual doctor services are on their way to the mainstream \u2014 especially since insurers and employers may be willing to pay for them, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFor anyone suffering from a common, generally minor health issue, a digital visit may be just what the doctor ordered. But what if you have a more serious health issue? That\u2019s when you take the old-fashioned route and go visit a flesh-and-blood doctor \u2014 hopefully without a long, miserable wait time.\n\nRelated on MNN:", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are all sorts of pain-free ways you can get medical care without leaving the privacy of your home.", "og": {"site_name": "MNN - Mother Nature Network", "description": "There are all sorts of pain-free ways you can get medical care without leaving the privacy of your home.", "title": "The doctor is in (your living room)", "url": "http://www.mnn.com/health/fitness-well-being/stories/the-doctor-is-in-your-living-room", "image": "http://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2014/09/virtual-doctor.jpg.600x315_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.mnn.com", "description": "There are all sorts of pain-free ways you can get medical care without leaving the privacy of your home.", "title": "The doctor is in (your living room)", "url": "http://www.mnn.com/health/fitness-well-being/stories/the-doctor-is-in-your-living-room", "image": {"src": "http://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2014/09/virtual-doctor.jpg.560x0_q80_crop-smart.jpg"}, "site": "mothernaturenet", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "doctor, housecall, healthcare, medved, sick"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd760\"", "article_summary": "You can also find a virtual doctor via your employer or insurer \u2014 again, only if they offer the service.\nLiveHealth, like many larger web doctor services, promotes the notion of having \u201ca doctor by your side 24/7.\u201dIf you don't have either option, you can go to an independent company like Medzed.\nWelcome to the age of virtual doctor visits.\nThey\u2019ll come to your kitchen or living room and give you a checkup, but they won\u2019t actually be there.\nVirtual doctor services are on their way to the mainstream \u2014 especially since insurers and employers may be willing to pay for them, according to The Wall Street Journal."}
