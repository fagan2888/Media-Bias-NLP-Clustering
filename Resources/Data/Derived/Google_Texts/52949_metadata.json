(Charles Ommanney/For The Washington Post)\n\nWhen Sen. Marco \u00adRubio stands before Miami\u2019s historic Freedom Tower on Monday and announces that he is the second Cuban American to join the 2016 race for president of the United States, Gabriel Perez, Emilio Izquierdo and Mike Valdes will share a powerful sense of pride. This is the big sign that Cuban Americans have finally made it, they all say \u2014 accepted not only as refugees from communism or as successful businesspeople but as serious contenders for the most American job in the land.\n\nBut let the wave of pride surrounding the candidacies of Florida\u2019s Rubio and fellow Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas subside, and Perez, Izquierdo, Valdes and many of their fellow Cuban Americans find themselves in surprising discord.\n\nThe idea of the Cuban American monolith, the notion that the estimated 2 million immigrants and their offspring constitute a single-issue ramrod that for a half-century has forced Washington into a hard line against the Castro brothers\u2019 regime, is crumbling in the classic, perhaps inevitable, way: Time is turning immigrants into Americans.\n\n\u201cOver the last 15 years, and especially the last five years, the Cuban American community has undergone a major transformation,\u201d said Fernando Amandi, whose research firm, Bendixen & Amandi International, regularly polls Cuban Americans. \u201cIn the most politicized Hispanic group in the country, there is now a cleavage in which the second and third generations, as well as more recent arrivals from Cuba, do not share the hard-line views and staunchly Republican affinity of the historic exile generation.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama handily won the vote of Cuban Americans between ages 18 and 50 in both of his elections, according to Amandi\u2019s surveys. His recent research shows that Rubio and Cruz are not necessarily favorite sons at the ballot box. Rubio, who opposes easing the U.S. embargo against Cuba, \u201cis literally advocating for policies that separate the more recent arrivals from their families who are still on the island,\u201d Amandi said.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, a potential White House contender in 2016, is known for his stances on immigration and tax reform. Here's the Florida Republican's take on Obamacare, the Islamic State and more, in his own words. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nOn the streets of Miami, the palpable pride in Rubio, Cruz and the other Cuban American senator, Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), even though he is under indictment on federal corruption charges, does not automatically translate into votes.\n\n\u201cRubio, he\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d said Perez, a retired mechanic at Miami\u2019s airport who fled Cuba in 1961 and long ago concluded that stiff-arming the communist regime in Havana never had a prayer of working. \u201cThis thing Obama\u2019s doing now, doing business with Cuba again, if America did it 40 years ago, Castro would have been gone.\u201d\n\nPerez points at the others at Domino Park in Miami\u2019s Little Havana, many of them Cuban octogenarians trading quips over the clatter of domino tiles on a dozen outdoor tables. \u201cRubio is like the old guys here who can\u2019t stop fighting,\u201d Perez said. \u201cThey try the same idea for 40 years, and it never works and they just keep fighting.\u201d\n\nTwenty blocks down Little Havana\u2019s main drag, Calle Ocho, Izquierdo, a 67-year-old limo driver who runs a Cuban patriots group on the side, develops a catch in his throat as he talks about two sons of exiles like himself now running for president.\n\n\u201cTwo million Cubans and two possible presidents,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very emotional about it.\u201d Rubio doesn\u2019t have his vote wrapped up yet, but the fact that he is Cuban weighs heavily in his favor. \u201cThis says we are a powerful community. And yes, emotion plays a role: Spaniards go by opinions and Anglos go by facts; we Cubans are a hybrid of the two.\u201d\n\nThe defining moments in Izquierdo\u2019s life came in Cuba, and his politics in the United States consistently reflect that. \u201cI was 11 when Castro took the power,\u201d he said. \u201cI was 14 when Castro took my family\u2019s property.\u201d He fled in the Mariel boatlift emigration in 1980 and became a U.S. citizen six years later. What he wants from a presidential candidate now is the right answer to one question: \u201cAre you going to represent the Cuban exiles? Because we don\u2019t believe in relations with communists.\u201d\n\nSeventeen miles away, in the upper-middle-class suburb of Miami Lakes \u2014 a generation ago an Anglo enclave and now a mostly Cuban community \u2014 Mike Val\u00addes, 38, owns Moda, a high-end boutique in which Spanish is used as the main language. The Rubio and Cruz candidacies \u201cput us on the map, finally for something other than Castro, rum or Cohibas,\u201d he said, referring to the brand of cigars.\n\nThe older generation of Cubans in Miami regularly get together to play chess and dominoes in Domino Park in Little Havana. (Charles Ommanney/For The Washington Post)\n\nBut relations with Cuba don\u2019t make Valdes\u2019s political top-10 list. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of problems in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to do for us before we start doing for other places.\u201d Valdes remains a Republican because that\u2019s how he was brought up, but he\u2019s okay with Obama\u2019s outreach to Cuba and looks forward to normalized trade and travel.\n\n\u201cOur grandparents\u2019 generation is passing on, and my generation doesn\u2019t really know their stories,\u201d Valdes said. \u201cOur Cuban part is there when you need it, but we\u2019re losing the accents and the language. Soon, the Cubans will just be Miamians. Eventually, they\u2019ll knock down the Freedom Tower and nobody will remember what it meant.\u201d\n\nThe Freedom Tower, gateway to the United States for the first generation of Cuban refugees, stands at 17 stories, a rust-colored Spanish Renaissance structure that for decades sat abandoned in a desert of urban decay along Miami\u2019s bayfront, surrounded by empty lots, a notoriously dangerous park and the city\u2019s skid row. Today, the building is dwarfed by gleaming white 60-story condo towers, almost lost across from a busy and festive waterfront and the snazzy home of the Miami Heat. Downtown Miami\u2019s boom is proud evidence of Cuban success, but the symbolic importance of the Freedom Tower is lost on younger Cubans, many here say.\n\nThe developing divide within the Cuban community is stark. Amandi\u2019s latest poll shows that 66 percent of Cuban Americans born in the United States support Obama\u2019s effort to normalize relations with the island nation, while 60 percent of those who arrived in this country before 1980 oppose the initiative.\n\nSaturday\u2019s meeting between Obama and Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro, the first such discussion in more than 50 years \u2014 as well as the State Department\u2019s recommendation last week that the United States remove Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism \u2014 would have been unthinkable during the decades of Cuban American consensus on a hard no-contact policy toward their former home.\n\nBut now, the move away from a single-issue focus on Cuba is evident in Cuban Americans\u2019 party affiliations. Twenty years ago, 70 percent of Cuban Americans called themselves Republicans. In the latest Florida International University Cuba Poll, that number was down to 53 percent.\n\nAlmost half of Cuban Americans are now U.S.-born, and they are reverting to a full spectrum of political perspectives, said Guiller\u00admo Grenier, a sociologist who has run FIU\u2019s Cuba Poll for 24 years. \u201cWhat it meant to be Cuban got really narrowed in the United States in the \u201960s and \u201970s, because the passion to overthrow Castro trumped everything else,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing the full diversity of political views.\u201d\n\nIn South Florida, immigrants who arrived after 1995 now make up a third of the Cuban community, and most are not Republicans, Grenier said. Similarly, next-\n\ngeneration Cubans no longer reflexively hew to the GOP, and especially not to candidates who oppose opening up to the island.\n\n\u201cMy students think of themselves as Republicans,\u201d Grenier said, \u201cbut they keep asking, \u2018How can Rubio be against making Cubans\u2019 lives easier by being against investing in the island?\u2019 Republicans can\u2019t just play the Cuba card like they did 20 years ago.\u201d\n\nThe labels that Miami-Dade County\u2019s nearly 900,000 Cuban Americans use reveal their political journey.\n\nMany in the first generation call themselves \u201cCuban exiles.\u201d More recent immigrants often just say \u201cCuban.\u201d And many \u00addescendants of those refugees call themselves \u201cCuban Americans\u201d or just \u201cAmericans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are like any other immigrant group,\u201d Perez said. \u201cOur old identity is dying. In a few years, Miami will be like Tampa, where they all have Spanish names but almost nobody speaks Spanish.\u201d\n\nAt Domino Park on Friday, only three of the 88 men and two women at the game tables said they were fluent in English.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re isolated, like any new immigrant group,\u201d said Rey Valdes, 71, a Cuban immigrant who is running for the Democratic nomination for a state House seat representing a district that spreads from Little Havana to Miami Beach. \u201cThat isolation allowed them to remain ideological. But their children understand this isn\u2019t an ideological society. It\u2019s a nation of pragmatists.\u201d\n\nValdes said Cubans remain largely conservative and entrepreneurial but no longer exist in a political bubble.\n\n\u201cRubio and Cruz running \u2014 to us this is like when Argentina got their pope,\u201d he said, \u201cbut most Cubans under 40 or 50 see issues beyond the tyranny of Castro. We like that Rubio is running, but his rhetoric is from another era.\u201d\n\nNancy Coto, 52, was 8 years old when her parents brought her to Miami. On paper her politics don\u2019t differ much from her father\u2019s, but her heart is sometimes in a different place.\n\n\u201cI share what he believes, but not that passion,\u201d she said, and to demonstrate the difference, she shook her entire body to represent her father\u2019s total devotion to any policy that could make the Castro brothers miserable. Then she went slack to show her own priorities: \u201cCuba\u2019s just not on top of my list. If Obama wants to reach out to Cuba, it doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m more concerned about jobs.\u201d\n\nLeslye and Eduardo Martin were barely teenagers when they left Cuba in the late 1990s. Living with their two small children in Miami Lakes, their new world is a classic suburban blend of long hours at work, a strong focus on the children and a long-term plan to live the American Dream and step up the economic ladder.\n\nLeslye, who is 30 and works in health-care administration, calls herself a committed Republican and appreciates the help that her family got from Rubio in navigating the immigration bureaucracy. But his positions on Cuba don\u2019t really factor into her vote for president. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where he stands on Cuba,\u201d she said. \u201cOur life is here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs time passes, we leave Cuba behind,\u201d said Eduardo, 31, a network engineer. \u201cWe never forget our roots, but we\u2019re here and our job is to make the country better.\u201d This country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For 2016, presidential candidates will have to contend with changing ideals among various generations.", "author": "http://facebook.com/fisherm", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "For 2016, presidential candidates will have to contend with changing ideals among various generations.", "title": "Cuban Americans\u2019 shifting identity, and political views, divides key bloc", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-time-passes-a-cuban-identity-fades-to-an-american-one/2015/04/12/83d3346a-dfd0-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/04/10/Others/Images/2015-04-09/mrm111428630428.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mffisher"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-time-passes-a-cuban-identity-fades-to-an-american-one/2015/04/12/83d3346a-dfd0-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Campaign 2016, presidential race, Cubans in America, Cubans, U.S. and Cuba, Cubans and Florida, Robert Menendez, Obama and Castro, Obama and Cuba, Miami Cubans, Marc Fisher", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://facebook.com/fisherm"}, "eomportal-uuid": "83d3346a-dfd0-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Campaign 2016, presidential race, Cubans in America, Cubans, U.S. and Cuba, Cubans and Florida, Robert Menendez, Obama and Castro, Obama and Cuba, Miami Cubans, Marc Fisher"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9e5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOver the last 15 years, and especially the last five years, the Cuban American community has undergone a major transformation,\u201d said Fernando Amandi, whose research firm, Bendixen & Amandi International, regularly polls Cuban Americans.\nBut now, the move away from a single-issue focus on Cuba is evident in Cuban Americans\u2019 party affiliations.\nTwenty years ago, 70 percent of Cuban Americans called themselves Republicans.\nMany in the first generation call themselves \u201cCuban exiles.\u201d More recent immigrants often just say \u201cCuban.\u201d And many \u00addescendants of those refugees call themselves \u201cCuban Americans\u201d or just \u201cAmericans.\u201d\u201cWe are like any other immigrant group,\u201d Perez said.\nAlmost half of Cuban Americans are now U.S.-born, and they are reverting to a full spectrum of political perspectives, said Guiller\u00admo Grenier, a sociologist who has run FIU\u2019s Cuba Poll for 24 years."}
