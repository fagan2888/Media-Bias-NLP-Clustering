In Green Bay, the average premium is $791. The region comes in under the state average for small group and individual program premiums, Kraig said.\n\nThe report only covers premiums. It does not address the cost of health care \u2014 how much doctors and hospitals cost \u2014 but it does include an insurance plan quality rating.\n\nThe greater Fox Valley area, including Appleton and Oshkosh, had the second highest increase at 247 percent.\n\nStatewide, large-group program health insurance rates have more than tripled since 2000, increasing 211 percent, according to the report.\n\nRhinelander has the highest average large-group premium at $820. Madison has the lowest at $673.\n\n\"We continue to find, as we have through all previous nine years of this report, a huge variation between regions of the state,\" Kraig said. \"There's a 22 percent variation ... between Rhinelander and Madison.\"\n\nCitizen Action argues in its report that state officials could combat the rising costs and wide variation in premiums by taking advantage of powers granted under the Affordable Care Act to moderate costs through a state-run health insurance exchange.\n\nGov. Scott Walker opted to use the national marketplace instead of creating a Wisconsin-specific one.\n\n\"There have been huge problems in Oregon, Minnesota and Maryland,\" Walker said during a stop in the Green Bay area on Wednesday. \"The state-based exchanges have not worked well around the country, and for all the promises they've made, they haven't lived up to those promises.\"\n\nThe Republican governor said the Affordable Care Act, also known Obamacare, has not lived up to its promise and he said he wants to see it repealed.\n\n\"My hope, long term, is they repeal Obamacare and allow us to make decisions when it comes to healthcare at the patient level,\" he said. \"Not at the government or bureaucratic level.\"\n\nState Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, said the state could improve insurance costs by creating a state-based marketplace.\n\n\"Ignoring public policy that can fix insurance markets ... will only make us all pay more in the end to insurance companies,\" he said during the teleconference.\n\nThe report uses premium-payment information on government employees, retirees and their dependents in the Group Health Insurance Program (GHIP), about 194,000 individuals statewide.\n\nThe organization thinks GHIP is an adequate surrogate for health care premium costs in the private sector. It acknowledges it is more reflective of large-employer experience, but beginning last year it had access to more small-employer and individual costs because of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nFor small group and individual market rates, the report relies on data released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for ACA exchange plans.\n\n\u2014arodewal@pressgazettemedia.com and follow him on Twitter @AdamGRodewald and on Facebook at Facebook.com/AdamGRodewald.\n\n\u2014 Richard Ryman Press-Gazette Media\n\nHealth insurance inflation\n\nA report by Citizen Action of Wisconsin ranks the state's metro areas based on the rate of health insurance inflation.
