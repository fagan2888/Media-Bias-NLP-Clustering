SPRINGFIELD - Citing costs that exceed reimbursement rates, Health New England will no longer participate in MassHealth CarePlus as of Feburary 2016. CarePlus was instituted by the state in 2014 for individuals who did not qualify for traditional Medicaid but did qualify for assistance.

The announcement was made late last week in the form of letters to some 16,000 consumers insured through HNE Be Healthy!(pdf), according to HNE spokesperson Elaine Mann.

"We made this difficult decision so we can remain financially stable and continue to serve the Western Massachusetts community," Mann said.

"Health New England has a strong commitment to MassHealth, but unfortunately the costs exceed the payments we receive for CarePlus."

Mann said HNE would continue to insure some 64,000 other consumers through its participation in standard MassHealth plans, and that HNE is working with the state to help transition those with HNE Be Healthy! to other coverage. She said the state is developing such coverage.

"We are working closely with MassHealth for a smooth transition to other coverage," said Mann, adding the transition should not "significantly" impede access to health services for affected consumers in Western Massachusetts.

HNE has participated in MassHealth since 2010.

MassHealth CarePlus is for adults 21 to 64 years old whose income is at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level. This would be, for a family of four, an annual income of $32,253 or less. The federal poverty level for a family of four is $24,250.

HNE has offered this coverage through its HNE Be Healthy! since CarePlus was initiated to reach a wider net of consumers in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act.

Traditionally, Medicaid, a state-federal program, has provided medical coverage for low income individuals. More than one million residents in the commonwealth have such coverage. Some of these consumers are covered directly by the state, but the majority are insured through about a half dozen private insurers.

These insurers have maintained their costs for the increased enrollment and mandated coverage under the Affordable Care Act are exceeding reimbursement rates and have sought additional monies both from the state and federal governments.

In 2014, these insurers reported losses of more than $140 million. Reasons given were the cost of ensuring new consumers with more serious medical conditions, as well as the cost of the new hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi.

Sovaldi has a cure rate of more than 90 percent, but costs an estimated $84,000 for a standard 12-week course of treatment. This is about $1,000 for each pill, taken daily, or about $600 per pill through Medicaid programs that are usually able to negotiate discounts based on volume.

HNE is one of the smaller insurers in MassHealth. It enrolled about 30,000 new members in 2014, and put its losses around $500,000 for that year.

HNE is a Springfield based not-for-profit insurer whose parent company is Baystate Health. Dr. Mark Keroack, Baystate Health president and CEO, has said Baystate Health loses $45 million a year due to under reimbursement for Medicaid services.

According to a document (pdf) from the state's Department Health and Human Services at the time of the creation of MassHealth CarePlus, CarePlus was developed for individuals "who do not qualify for MassHealth Standard. MassHealth CarePlus offers a wide range of health benefits, such as doctor and clinic visits, hospital stays, prescription medicines, mental and behavioral health, and substance abuse services."

"MassHealth CarePlus is provided through six health plans known as managed care organizations (MCOs), unless the member is enrolled in other insurance outside MassHealth, such as through an employer. Members receive full coverage for CarePlus covered services on a fee-for-service basis until their enrollment in a health plan is effective. MassHealth will not enroll Care Plus members who are enrolled in other insurance into a health plan, and those members will receive CarePlus benefits that are not provided by the other insurance on a fee for-service basis," the document reads.

It names the six health plans serving MassHealth CarePlus at the start as BMC HealthNet Plan, CeltiCare Health Plan, Fallon Community Health Plan, Health New England, Neighborhood Health Plan, a Boston-based Medicaid insurer owned by Partners HealthCare System and Network Health, a Medford-based Medicaid insurer owned by Tufts Health Plan

Late on Monday, MassHealth issued a statement reaffirming the importance of CarePlus, and that consumers would find other insurers. It did not state what Western Massachusetts hospitals are in the insurance networks of CarePlus.

A quick web check indicated Cooley Hospital, in Northampton, Holyoke Medical Center and Mercy Medical Center accept BMC HealthNet, which is a unit of Boston Medical Center. Holyoke Medical accepts CeltiCare while Fallon's CarePlus coverage seems to be for Central and Eastern Massachusetts.

"CarePlus is a valuable program of Medicaid in Massachusetts," said Michelle Hillman, MassHealth spokesman.

"It provides coverage for thousands of low-income adults in the commonwealth. We are confident that MassHealth CarePlus members in Western Mass will continue to have access to quality services through other trusted health plans and providers."
