Armistead also expressed his support for Chief Justice Roy Moore, who has dedicated himself to making sure Alabama defies the federal order mandating the legalization of same-sex marriage in the state.\n\nIn the post, titled \u201cIn Alabama: We Dare Defend Our Rights,\u201d Armistead wrote, \u201cI have just returned from a week in Israel where I visited many holy sites from both the Old and New Testament.\u201d\n\nSeeing the places where the Christian Bible claims Jesus Christ walked and lived set Armistead in a philosophical state of mind, he said.\n\n\u201cScripture comes alive more than ever as you come to realize much of what you see of God\u2019s chosen land is what was seen by Jesus and those who lived in Biblical times, like Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt also solidifies the permanency of the teachings of the Scriptures. God\u2019s word never changes. What He proclaimed thousands of years ago as truth is still truth in the eyes of true believers.\u201d\n\nTherefore, he said, \u201cScripture then teaches that \u2018a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh\u2019 (Genesis 2:24). This is God\u2019s word. This is God\u2019s truth.\u201d\n\nOf a federal judge\u2019s order for Alabama to end marriage segregation and allow same-sex couples to wed, Armistead said, \u201cGod will not be mocked. The State of Alabama and the United States of America will reap God\u2019s wrath if we embrace and condone things that are abhorrent to God, such as redefining marriage as anything other than a union between one man and one woman.\u201d\n\nHe went on to affirm his support of Judge Moore\u2019s decision to flout the federal court\u2019s ruling, saying, \u201cI definitely support Judge Moore and the way he\u2019s approaching this.\u201d\n\nHe also touted his role in drafting and passing the 1988 Alabama law that became the Alabama Marriage Protection Act, a state ordinance that defined marriage as being between one man and one woman.\n\nThat law, said U.S. District Judge Callie Granade, is unconstitutional and denies equal rights to same-sex couples in the state.\n\nMoore has attempted to block same-sex marriages in the state, but the Supreme Court denied his request for a stay against Granade\u2019s decision. Currently some counties in the state are granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples while others are not.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bill-Armistead-via-Facebook-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Chairman of Alabama GOP: Allowing same-sex marriage will bring down \u2018God\u2019s wrath\u2019 upon us"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd894e\"", "article_summary": "The chairman of the Alabama Republican Party fretted on Wednesday that widespread acceptance of same-sex marriages will bring down \u201cGod\u2019s wrath\u201d on the United States and on Alabama.\nThis is God\u2019s truth.\u201dOf a federal judge\u2019s order for Alabama to end marriage segregation and allow same-sex couples to wed, Armistead said, \u201cGod will not be mocked.\nCurrently some counties in the state are granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples while others are not.\nArmistead also expressed his support for Chief Justice Roy Moore, who has dedicated himself to making sure Alabama defies the federal order mandating the legalization of same-sex marriage in the state.\nThe website AL.com reported that party chairman Bill Armistead published a column on the state Republican Party\u2019s website in which he lamented the fact that same-sex marriage has become legal in much of the nation."}
