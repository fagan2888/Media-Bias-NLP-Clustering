LTAC care for other patients will be reimbursed on a per diem site neutral rate that amounts to less than the PPS rates on average.\n\n\u201cThese new regulations, coupled with a consistent, multi-year decline in inpatient census, have resulted in an untenable situation,\u201d Spaulding officials said. \u201cSadly, it is no longer viable to continue Spaulding North Shore\u2019s inpatient services and we will discontinue inpatient operations by September 30, 2015.\u201d\n\nSome 300 employees will be impacted by the closure, although they may find jobs elsewhere within the Spaulding or Partners system. After the closure of the North Shore hospital, the Spaulding Rehabilitation Network will include three other hospitals, 23 outpatient centers and three skilled nursing facilities.\n\n\u201cOur primary interest at this juncture is to continue to provide high quality care to our patients and to support our staff during this difficult transition,\u201d Spaulding leaders said. \u201cWe will continue to provide inpatient and outpatient care at all other Spaulding hospitals in Charlestown, Cambridge and Cape Cod, as well as our skilled nursing facilities in Boston and our outpatient sites on the North Shore.\u201d\n\nAlso on the horizon for long-term acute care financing is the so-called 25 percent rule. Starting in 2017, long-term acute care hospitals that receive more than 25 percent of their patients from a single referring hospital will receive payment reductions.\n\nThough the Medicare changes are challenging health systems like Partners and may spur more closures, they're likely to be beneficial for some in the long-term acute care business, such as Kindred Healthcare, the nation\u2019s largest provider of post-acute care services.\n\nThe new regulations are an \u201copportunity to develop clinical programs and services that better align cost and care over the implementation period to appeal to ACOs, managed care organizations and others,\u201d Kindred said in a presentation at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January. They offer \u201csignificant clarity and will allow Kindred to organically grow patient volumes and leverage existing capacity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/partners-rethinks-ltac-closes-hospital-face-medicare-changes", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Mass-General-caption_2.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Though new Medicare LTAC regulations are challenging health systems, they're a big opportunity for giants in the long-term care business.", "title": "Partners rethinks  LTAC, closes hospital in face of Medicare changes"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Mass-General-caption_2.gif"}, "title": "Partners rethinks  LTAC, closes hospital in face of Medicare changes", "description": "Though new Medicare LTAC regulations are challenging health systems, they're a big opportunity for giants in the long-term care business.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Partners HealthCare is closing one of its rehabilitation hospitals, highlighting the tenuous future some health systems are facing in long-term acute care, and the opportunity for others.&#13; Partners\u2019 Spaulding Rehabilitation Network is closing its 160-bed North Shore hospital in Salem, the former Shaughnessy-Kaplan Rehab facility, in the face of steep business challenges with federal reimbursement changes.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0284\"", "article_summary": "Partners\u2019 Spaulding Rehabilitation Network is closing its 160-bed North Shore hospital in Salem, the former Shaughnessy-Kaplan Rehab facility, in the face of steep business challenges with federal reimbursement changes.\nStarting in 2017, long-term acute care hospitals that receive more than 25 percent of their patients from a single referring hospital will receive payment reductions.\nPartners HealthCare is closing one of its rehabilitation hospitals, highlighting the tenuous future some health systems are facing in long-term acute care, and the opportunity for others.\nThough the Medicare changes are challenging health systems like Partners and may spur more closures, they're likely to be beneficial for some in the long-term acute care business, such as Kindred Healthcare, the nation\u2019s largest provider of post-acute care services.\nAfter the closure of the North Shore hospital, the Spaulding Rehabilitation Network will include three other hospitals, 23 outpatient centers and three skilled nursing facilities."}
