I truly believe that we will see an upturn in the fourth quarter of this year, and that 2015 will be a great year for MHMC.\"\n\nDespite the job cuts, Meadowlands is not operating in the red, Considine said. A report ordered by the health department last year forecasting the hospital\u2019s financial outlook through 2017, predicts Meadowlands will finish 2014 with a 2 percent operating margin.\n\n\u201cThere is no correlation . . .between the reduction in staff and financial health of the hospital,\u201d according to an email from Considine.\n\nBut the financial report showed serious systemic operating issues at Meadowlands, which investors bought in 2010 before it went bankrupt. \u201cSince 2010, Meadowlands has been facing multiple financial problems which have created significant cash flow challenges, exacerbating difficulties in meeting day-to-day financial commitment,\u201d according to the report by Executive Resources Healthcare Management Consultants.\n\nThe hospital also lacks a \u201cformalized budgeting process\u201d and a \u201cfinancial review process,\u201d according to the report. At Meadowlands\u2019 request, the health department redacted more than half of the report to protect \u201ctrade secrets and proprietary commercial or financial information,\u201d according to a letter from the public records custodian.\n\nThe announcement stunned members of Health Professionals and Allied Employees, the union that represents nurses and medical employees, and renewed calls for more state oversight or the appointment of a financial monitor.\n\n\"How does a hospital get to the point of laying off 20 percent of its staff?\" said Jeanne Otersen, a union spokeswoman. \"Is the Department of Health aware of this? Where is the state?\"\n\nUnion leaders, consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers have repeatedly urged the administration of Gov. Chris Christie to require such for-profit hospitals as Meadowlands to open its financial books and explain how it is running its operations.\n\nMeadowlands has been cited by the Internal Revenue Service for indicating on paychecks that it had collected payroll taxes but then not sending the money to the government. In addition, the hospital has also delayed paying medical claims for some employees.\n\nThe state Health Department declined to comment.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 New Meadowlands hospital CEO pledges more cooperation with state\n\n\n\n\u2022 Meadowlands Hospital submits long-overdue financial report, NJ accepts smaller fine\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "secaucus, news", "title": "Meadowlands Hospital to eliminate 100 jobs, CEO letter says", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center plans to lay off 102 full-time employees", "title": "Meadowlands Hospital to eliminate 100 jobs, CEO letter says", "url": "http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/07/meadowlands_hospital_to_eliminate_more_than_100_jobs_according_to_ceos_letter.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/05/14875222-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center plans to lay off 102 full-time employees", "creator": "@susanklivio", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/05/14875222-large.jpg", "title": "Meadowlands Hospital to eliminate 100 jobs, CEO letter says", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, July 09, 2014,  8:07 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, July 09, 2014,  5:15 PM", "article_author": "Susan K.
