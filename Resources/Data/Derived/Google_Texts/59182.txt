WARWICK, R.I. (AP) — Rhode Island’s health insurance marketplace is opening a temporary consumer center in Warwick as another sign-up deadline approaches.

HealthSource RI’s satellite center on Centerville Road will be open from Monday through the end of April.

Spokeswoman Dara Chadwick says HealthSource RI officials wanted to offer an alternate location to the one in Providence, in part because they’re expecting increased sign-ups before the first open enrollment period for individual and families ends March 31.

Small business plan sign-ups and Medicaid enrollments will continue on a rolling basis.

The Warwick center will be open seven days a week and will be staffed with current employees.

Chadwick says many consumers have been visiting the Providence location from the Cranston and Warwick areas so the new location should be more convenient.
