Hobby Lobby is in the process of opening a new store at the intersection of 441 and Palmetto Park Road.\n\nThe protest, by \u201cWomen are Watching Florida\u201d is outlined in a press release below.\n\nAccess to birth control is critical for women\u2019s basic preventive health care, for our ability to plan our families, and for expanding economic opportunities. But the Supreme Court\u2019s recent Hobby Lobby decision puts birth control access in jeopardy for many working women. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that in 2014, we\u2019re still fighting about whether women should have access to birth control. The decision to take birth control is between a woman and her doctor, not her boss,\u201d said Laura Goodhue, Campaign Manager for the Florida Planned Parenthood PAC\u2019s Women Are Watching campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s not the role of bosses of private, for-profit businesses to make decisions about women\u2019s health care for their employees based solely on their own personal religious beliefs.\u201d \u201cAs a mother and a grandmother of young women, I cannot believe we are turning back the clock on women\u2019s health care,\u201d said Boca Raton resident Jan Wexler who called for the rally. \u201cThese are rights I fought for in the 1950s! I cannot wait to go to the polls this November to show politicians our health does matter! Protestors will rally against the opening of a new Hobby Lobby store to send this message to Hobby Lobby and the 2014 candidates for office: Women\u2019s health care is not a political bargaining chip. Women are watching this November. And they will make their voices heard! Who: Planned Parenthood PAC volunteers and Boca Raton residents. What: Rally against the Supreme Court\u2019s recent Hobby Lobby decision and store opening. When: Wednesday October 1, 2014, 4:30pm \u2013 6pm. Where: New Hobby Lobby store at 21759 State Road 7, Boca Raton 33428. Why: To send the message that women should have the right to make their own medical decisions in consultation with their doctor, not their boss.\n\n----------------\n\nBocaNewsNow.com is the leading site for news and information based in Boca Raton, Florida.
