He writes about the lawmakers, politics and policy that affect Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Tamari previously covered the Philadelphia Eagles and the NFL. Before that he worked in Trenton, reporting on the characters and color of New Jersey state government. He lives in Washington.\n\nKatie McGinty had never won an election and lagged in polls until the final stretch.\n\nKatie McGinty\u2019s first-ever election victory turned out to be a big one.\n\nGov. Wolf\u2019s former chief-of-staff won the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate by around 10 percentage points \u2013 more than pollsters and even her most bullish supporters forecasted in the run up to primary day.\n\nHer victory pays off part of the big bet national Democrats -- including President Obama -- placed on the unproven candidate. Now comes the second part: proving she was the right choice to take a winnable, but likely tough race against Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nOur story on McGinty's win is here.\n\nHere are five additional thoughts on the outcome, McGinty\u2019s match-up with Toomey, Sestak\u2019s legacy and the big results for Braddock Mayor John Fetterman as we look back at the primary and ahead to one of the most closely-watched Senate races in the country.\n\nThe Fetterman effect?\n\nAlong with McGinty\u2019s margin, the other big surprise of the night was Braddock Mayor John Fetterman\u2019s showing (though his aides will tell you they felt the energy building all along).\n\nThe mayor captured outsized media attention and intrigued party insiders, but when he struggled to raise money and polled in the single digits, many reporters and analysts dismissed him.\n\nHe far exceeded expectations with 20 percent of the vote on a shoestring budget \u2013 and may have badly hurt Sestak.\n\nThey appealed, after all, to some of the same kind of voters: liberals who rejected pragmatic establishment politics. Internally, Sestak\u2019s allies had predicted that anything better than 15 percent for Fetterman would be lethal, according to one of the former congressman\u2019s backers. A McGinty supporter also attributed the big final margin, in part, to Fetterman\u2019s better-than-expected performance.\n\nA Franklin & Marshall poll in April had Fetterman with only 8 percent. He beat that by 12. Elections are never so simple that you can assume all of Fetterman\u2019s growth was carved out of Sestak\u2019s hide, but if even much of that 12 percent had shifted, Sestak could have made the race the close contest widely expected.\n\nFetterman\u2019s strength was most notable in his home county, Allegheny, where he finished first with a whopping 45 percent of the vote. Sestak took only 20 percent there, finishing third.\n\nFetterman disputed the idea that he hurt Sestak any more than McGinty \u2013 \u201cwe took votes from Pennsylvania,\u201d he said \u2013 adding that Sestak had a lead, millions of dollars and years of campaigning with which to secure support.\n\nWe\u2019ll have more on Fetterman\u2019s candidacy and future later today.\n\nThe Philadelphia factor\n\nWhen Sestak upset the Democratic establishment and won the Senate nomination in 2010, he gave much of the credit to the big support he got from African-Americans in Philadelphia.\n\nThe tables turned this time. McGinty, a Wayne resident who grew up in Northeast Philly, won the city by more than 46,500 votes \u2013 nearly one-third of her total margin. She worked the city hard.\n\nSestak still made his traditional visits to black churches \u2013 but it was no match for a barrage of ads featuring Obama\u2019s voice praising McGinty.\n\nMcGinty\u2019s next challenge\n\nEven as McGinty gained momentum, her allies worried that many voters still didn\u2019t know who she was. Having never held public office, she had no natural political base, and her endorsements cut both ways.\n\nBacking from the White House and top Senators gave McGinty instant credibility, but also meant that when she campaigned with Vice President Biden or Sen. Bob Casey or showed up as a guest at a labor event, she often seemed like a supporting player in her own race, rather than the star.\n\nHer challenge now is to spread her story \u2013 mother of three who rose from blue collar Philadelphia roots and truly cares about the middle class \u2013 before Republicans can make their version stick: liberal bureaucrat who used the revolving door to flip from government work to high-paying corporate jobs.\n\nThe problem for McGinty is that she just came through a costly primary that will leave her campaign fund depleted, while Toomey sits on more than $9 million.\n\nMitt Romney faced the same problem after the GOP presidential primary in 2012 \u2013 giving the Obama campaign the chance to tar him as a plutocrat. He never got out from under that label.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to have a very robust discussion about the things that Katie McGinty has done,\" Toomey said in a telephone interview Wednesday morning.\n\nIndependent Democratic groups are hoping to fill the breach. Senate Majority PAC lined up its own attack Wednesday casting Toomey as a Wall Street ally who votes in the interest of the wealthy, not average voters. The race is on to define the rivals before they truly face off.\n\nToomey-Trump?\n\nSpend any time with Toomey, and one thing is obvious: the man is a careful planner who likes to have everything laid out just so. When I asked him last year about a tree house he built, Toomey sketched out a detailed diagram in response, and sent it through his staff.\n\nAnalysts and operatives in both parties say Toomey prepared well for 2016, building a substantial campaign fund and taking moderate stands on a few high-profile issues, most notably his support for more background checks on gun purchases.\n\nBut no one could have planned for Donald Trump or for a Supreme Court nomination fight taking center stage in the national debate. Both could create problems for Toomey in a moderate state that tilts blue in presidential years.\n\nHe voted for Ted Cruz Tuesday -- and said Wednesday he is running his own race -- but the night\u2019s primary results make it seem likely Toomey will be running with Trump atop the ticket this fall, and the New York billionaire has proven hard to ignore.\n\nMcGinty certainly won't.\n\nSeven times her prepared victory speech referred to \u201cTrump and Toomey\u201d or the \u201cTrump-Toomey\u201d ticket. As in: \u201cToomey and Trump would repeal the Affordable Care Act and return us to a time when insurance companies called the shots.\u201d Or: \u201cWe\u2019re getting a taste of what the Toomey-Trump team would do right now as they lead an unprecedented obstruction of the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are eager to hang Trump\u2019s name around the neck of every Republican they can. And if the names work alliteratively, all the better for them.\n\nSestak\u2019s lament\n\nSestak\u2019s maverick run in political life appeared to end with his second loss in a Senate race.\n\nOn paper, he\u2019s a stellar candidate: Naval academy, three-star admiral, service in Iraq and Afghanistan, White House national security council, two-term Congressman.\n\nBut he never got along with party leaders, and while Sestak wore that fissure as a badge of honor, it cost him. If party insiders were going to expend resources on a critical race, they wanted a nominee who would take their input \u2013 and sometimes direction \u2013 along with their money.\n\nSestak made clear he wouldn\u2019t do that \u2013 and says the party apparatus cut off his donor network. Washington Democrats and their allies spent $4.5 million to lift McGinty over Sestak.\n\nSo much of politics comes down to balancing ideals with sometimes ugly realities to reach imperfect but workable results. That goes for governing and campaigning both.\n\nSestak\u2019s uncompromising approach won him a loyal following \u2013 he played \"My Way\" as he finished his concession speech -- but the party apparatus is also part of the game. Its power is perhaps diminished, but it still has some muscle to shape races, as this primary showed.\n\nYou can follow Tamari on Twitter or email him at jtamari@phillynews.com.\n\nPublished: The Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160527, "editdate": "20160427T08:27:21", "twitter": {"title": "Five takeaways on the Pa.
