Though Fowler appeared bright-spirited during the tournament, Fowler\u2019s swing coach Butch Harmon said he was seething about the survey, USA Today said.\n\nSergio Garcia and Kevin Kisner matched Fowler\u2019s score, so the three of them went back out on the course for a playoff. When Kisner missed his long birdie putt on 17, Fowler nailed down his victory with a clutch putt.\n\nRegarding Fowlers final putt of the \u201c17th Sudden Death playoff,\u201d CBS\u2019s Kyle Porter said, \u201cFowler might as well have burned the 17th hole to the ground on Sunday. He hit three different shots inside of seven feet in the same day on the scariest hole on the course.\u201d\n\nFowler spoke to NBC after the round. \"My game has felt very good. I struggled a little bit the last two days, just fairways and greens. I had a lot of confidence coming out of last week. It's pretty fun. This is special.\"\n\n\"I'd say this is a pretty big one,\" Fowler said of proving himself to those who vote him overrated. \"I'm happy about the week. This is one to look back on for sure.\"\n\nThere were several videos by the PGA covering Fowler\u2019s win, but notably, one video shows the excitement of his win by several announcers all over the world.
