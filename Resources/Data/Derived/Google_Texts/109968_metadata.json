CONGRESS Budget debate could prove awkward for 2016 hopefuls The four Republican senators considering a run for president will have to take sides.\n\nCongress\u2019 battle of the budget could be coming soon to the 2016 Republican presidential primary.\n\nThe four Republican senators considering a run for president will have to take sides in the feud between fiscal hard-liners and defense hawks over the budget. That will give voters a clear read on their ideology just as they\u2019re hitting the campaign trail \u2014 and likely complicate Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s vow to shepherd a spending blueprint through the GOP-controlled Congress.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTwo of the White House hopefuls, Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, have voted against GOP budget plans in past years and are viewed as potential \u201cno\u201d votes, given their calls for deeper cuts in previous battles. Two others, Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida, have pushed for more defense spending, an issue that has emerged as an early sticking point between the House and Senate as they try to craft their first Republican budget since the George W. Bush era.\n\nAdding to the challenge is that the budget fight will consume this spring, just as each of the four men prepares to launch his likely presidential campaign. If they endorse a plan, they\u2019ll have to defend it against criticism from the right that it does too little to address pressing national challenges. But if they oppose a budget, they could be blamed for killing a proposal that GOP leaders say is paramount to proving the Republican Party can responsibly govern.\n\nTheir positions, illuminated in interviews with POLITICO, underscore the larger challenges McConnell faces in trying to bridge diverging views within his caucus.\n\n\u201cI think part of our national security is trying not to overburden the country with debt,\u201d Paul said.\n\nGraham fired back: \u201cI agree with Sen. Paul that one of the threats to our nation is the debt. But I reject the idea that defense spending has anything at all to do with that.\u201d\n\nSens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham will have to take sides, giving voters a clear read on their ideology just as they're hitting the campaign trail.\n\nWith 54 seats in his caucus, McConnell has little margin for error. While Senate rules prohibit Democrats from filibustering a budget resolution, McConnell can\u2019t lose more than three votes. If Congress can\u2019t pass a budget resolution, Republicans would also lose the ability to use fast-track budget procedures to take aim at Obamacare.\n\nStill, it\u2019s doubtful that a budget that cuts as much as Paul and Cruz are seeking could win the support of the centrist elements of the Senate Republican Conference.\n\nAt the same time, Senate Republican defense hawks are skittish about the plan unveiled Wednesday by Sen. Mike Enzi, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. At least one \u2014 Arizona Sen. John McCain \u2014 said he would oppose the plan if it does not ratchet up spending for national security.\n\nEnzi\u2019s plan would maintain spending levels set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 for defense, starting at $523 billion in 2016 and rising to $549 billion in 2018. The idea is to create a separate \u201creserve fund,\u201d forcing Congress to later reach a deal to increase spending on defense. But the costs would have to be offset with other cuts in the budget so that it does not add to the deficit over a decade \u2014 no easy task.\n\nThat differs sharply from a House Republican plan drafted by Georgia Rep. Tom Price, which calls for an increase in defense spending to $574 billion in 2017 and $599 billion in 2018. But the House does an end run around the budget caps by proposing $94 billion in emergency spending in 2016 to fight the war against terrorism, a plan critics in both parties deride as a gimmick. The Senate plan caps emergency overseas contingency funding at $58 billion.\n\nBoth approaches have been panned by defense hawks \u2014 and led to a robust private debate Wednesday in a meeting of Senate Republican chairmen in the chamber\u2019s Strom Thurmond Room, attendees said. The matter will grow more complicated as the Senate Budget Committee begins voting on the plan Thursday, followed by floor action next week. Assuming the two chambers can pass their respective proposals, the differences will then have to be reconciled between the House and the Senate, which is bound to intensify the GOP divisions.\n\nMcCain, the Armed Services Committee chairman, said in an interview Tuesday he would vote against the Enzi plan as it currently stands, and he called the House proposal \u201cthe lesser of two evils.\u201d\n\n\u201cNational security as an issue has gone from eight or nine to tied at No. 1 with the economy, with the beheadings, ISIS, all of those things,\u201d said McCain, the GOP\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee, using an acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. \u201cSo it has dramatically changed the field of debate as far as the people seeking the Republican nomination are concerned.\u201d\n\nSome of the presidential aspirants seem to agree.\n\nIn an interview, Rubio made clear he needs to see higher defense spending levels to get behind a budget resolution. He argued that Congress should return to budget levels under former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, before across-the-board cuts known as sequestration were imposed. Before sequestration, $577 billion was projected to be spent on defense in fiscal 2016.\n\n\u201cIt certainly has to be at least as much or more than what\u2019s in the president proposal, which I don\u2019t think is enough, given the national security threats our country faces,\u201d Rubio said, referring to Obama\u2019s $561 billion budget for defense, a $38 billion increase.\n\nRubio signaled he was open to the House tactic of labeling extra emergency spending as part of an overseas contingency fund.\n\n\u201cAs for the process of how we get the money, I\u2019m open-minded,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIn terms of the exact number, obviously we have to get something done. I think not raising defense spending has been shortsighted in the past. Every time we have dramatically cut defense spending in this country, we have had to come back and scramble to make it up.\u201d\n\nRubio added: \u201cAgain, on the tactics of it, obviously, it has to be something reasonable and responsible, and it doesn\u2019t set us up for other long-term problems. The priority here is to make sure \u2026 our national security is funded adequately.\u201d\n\nGraham, who frequently sides with McCain, said he\u2019s prepared to vote for the Enzi budget because it\u2019s a \u201cstep in the right direction.\u201d But he said it does not go far enough to overhaul costly entitlement programs.\n\n\u201cThe real debate comes from people who are going to run for president on our side \u2014 [they need to] lay out a plan of what they will do to come up with the long-term unfunded liabilities,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThe retirement of the baby boomers is as much of a threat to our livelihood as foreign terrorism.\u201d\n\nEven if McConnell wins over Graham, he may have trouble wooing deficit hawks in his party who have been skeptical of GOP budgets in the past. In addition to Cruz and Paul, who have voted against previous budgets produced by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), GOP leaders also have lost support from a like-minded conservative, Utah Sen. Mike Lee. More moderate senators, Dean Heller of Nevada and Susan Collins of Maine, also voted in 2013 against the Ryan plan, which sought to cut spending by $4.6 trillion over a decade.\n\nIn an interview this week, Cruz was mum about whether he would endorse the budget plans this year, even as his office previously told reporters he opposed the Ryan plan because he thought \u201cit didn\u2019t go far enough.\u201d (The Enzi plan would slash the deficit $5.1 trillion through cuts and interest savings over the next decade.)\n\n\u201cI am going to wait until I have the opportunity to review the proposed budgets in detail before I express my opinion,\u201d Cruz said Tuesday.\n\nIn an interview this week, Paul said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in the last GOP budget, pointing to gimmicks that he argued would prolong the time it takes to reach balance well beyond 10 years. Paul has previously proposed plans to balance the budget in five years.\n\n\u201cIt has to have balance in a finite period of time,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIf we decided as a country that we need more spending for defense, then we have to take it from somewhere else and not just add it to the deficit.\u201d\n\nBut if Paul follows recent history and bucks his party on the budget, it could make it harder for McConnell to keep his promise to restore order to an unruly Congress.\n\nWhen asked about the challenges in passing a GOP budget last year, McConnell declared: \u201cFailure is not an option.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The four Republican senators considering a run for president will have to take sides.", "title": "Budget debate could prove awkward for 2016 hopefuls", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/fiscal-hard-liners-vs-defense-hawks-budget-splits-16-hopefuls-116211.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/03/18/150317_mcconnelloffice_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Lindsey Graham 2016,2016 Elections,Lindsey Graham,Senate Elections 2016,Ted Cruz 2016,Elections,Senate,Republicans,Mitch McConnell,Marco Rubio 2016,Budget,Rand Paul,Marco Rubio,Rand Paul 2016,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The four Republican senators considering a run for president will have to take sides.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc992d\"", "article_summary": "CONGRESS Budget debate could prove awkward for 2016 hopefuls The four Republican senators considering a run for president will have to take sides.\nWhen asked about the challenges in passing a GOP budget last year, McConnell declared: \u201cFailure is not an option.\u201d\nAt the same time, Senate Republican defense hawks are skittish about the plan unveiled Wednesday by Sen.
