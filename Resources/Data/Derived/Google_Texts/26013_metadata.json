Now, she\u2019s paying less than $100.\n\nBonnie Berg spent most of her professional career working in social services. She always had insurance through her job and when she retired in August 2010, she kept it through COBRA.\n\n\u201cI was paying about a $1000 a month, and about $250 each quarter for my basic meds. So in other words, it was costing me $13,000 a year just for the dead basics,\u201d she explains.\n\nAfter 18 months on COBRA, Berg switched to a catastrophic plan, which cost $526 each month. She paid close to $900 every quarter for two asthma medications. Her deductible was $5,000.\n\nIn the 40 months since retirement, Berg went to the doctor only twice. \u201cI wasn\u2019t willing to pay for any tests on my own. I wasn\u2019t willing to do anything the doctor really wanted me to do, unless I was having an episode,\u201d Berg says. \u201cI probably allowed myself the worse medical care of my life at the time I was paying huge prices.\u201d\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act became law, Berg wanted to be on a health plan as soon as she could, though she will qualify for Medicare in eight months. \u201cThis is going to save me $4- or $5,000 just in eight months. If anything happens, it\u2019s going to save me a lot more than that,\u201d she says.\n\nBerg tried to navigate healthcare.gov on her own in mid-October, but didn\u2019t get anywhere. Then she found someone to help.\n\n\u201cThat makes a huge difference. You really need to do a hook-up with a navigator who has done this for a few people now or an agent with Enroll Alaska. It\u2019s free. They know exactly what questions to ask. They put it all in in the correct format and tell you what to do next,\u201d Berg says.\n\nBerg now pays $90 a month for health insurance. Her deductible is $250 and her maximum out of pocket is $500.\n\nEnroll Alaska\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Tyann Boiling says Berg\u2019s case is not rare:\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of very, very happy people that are getting health insurance for the first time or they\u2019re getting health insurance that\u2019s affordable to them for the first time.\u201d\n\nBoling says about 80 percent of people signing up with Enroll Alaska receive financial assistance.\n\n\n\nFor assistance signing up for health care: Navigator Crystal Bourland is available Tuesday and Thursday afternoons at Wal-Mart and Wednesday afternoons at the Downtown Public Library, or call 523-1147. Two Enroll Alaska agents can be found at Bartlett Regional Hospital Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursdays. Call 907-770-5100 to make an appointment.\n\nJuneau\u2019s United Way Navigator Crystal Bourland says people are also happy to find their plans include free preventative services, like cholesterol screenings, colonoscopies, and immunizations, \u201cRegardless of which plan they choose they can still go to the doctor to get preventative and wellness checks. Just some of those added protections that exist under the Affordable Care Act, I think, is usually pretty surprising for people.\u201d\n\nDespite the positives, Enroll Alaska\u2019s Boling says the health brokerage firm has made 1,100 enrollments, but she thinks that should be at least 15,000 by now. She blames the early troubles with the healthcare.gov website, \u201cWe lost two full months of enrolling people and those were critical months. That\u2019s where the momentum was and we couldn\u2019t get people enrolled. I think that we lost a lot of people and we lost them for good.\u201d\n\nBonnie Berg was not one of those people. She worked with an agent for more than a month before she successfully enrolled in mid-December. Now, she says, she\u2019s ready to take better care of herself:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be putting some thought into my health which is a good thing for anybody to do.\u201d\n\nThe deadline to apply for a plan that starts in March is February 15. Open enrollment ends March 31 and won\u2019t begin again until November.\n\nRelated articles\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"category": "Featured News,Health", "description": "Now, Bonnie Berg says, she\u2019s ready to take better care of herself", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Lisa Phu", "og": {"site_name": "KTOO", "description": "Now, Bonnie Berg says, she\u2019s ready to take better care of herself", "title": "From paying $1,000 a month for health care to $100", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1182, "identifier": "http://www.ktoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bonnie-berg.jpg", "height": 904}, "updated_time": "2014-01-29T08:40:06-08:00", "url": "http://www.ktoo.org/2014/01/28/from-1000month-health-care-to-100/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Now, Bonnie Berg says, she\u2019s ready to take better care of herself", "creator": "@ktoolisa", "image": "http://www.ktoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bonnie-berg.jpg", "title": "From paying $1,000 a month for health care to $100", "site": "@KTOOpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "nid": 82723, "fb": {"admins": "100000451568550,1057430445,64202921,5701326,100009904184202,100000548846198,100000571087086,100005265339889,657797481,698475886,100002322833863,529595225,1074192195", "app_id": 129011767246539}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.ktoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cropped-KTOO_favicon-270x270.png", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Bonnie Berg,COBRA,Crystal Bourland,Enroll Alaska,health care,health insurance,navigator,Tyann Boling,United Way", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ktoopublicmedia", "section": "Featured News", "tag": "United Way", "published_time": "2014-01-28T21:14:12-08:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-29T08:40:06-08:00"}, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1002\"", "article_summary": "Prior to January 1, Bonnie Berg was paying up to $1000 a month for health insurance.\nA Juneau woman says getting insurance under the Affordable Care Act means she\u2019ll take better care of herself.\nFor assistance signing up for health care: Navigator Crystal Bourland is available Tuesday and Thursday afternoons at Wal-Mart and Wednesday afternoons at the Downtown Public Library, or call 523-1147.\n\u201cI was paying about a $1000 a month, and about $250 each quarter for my basic meds.\nBerg now pays $90 a month for health insurance."}
