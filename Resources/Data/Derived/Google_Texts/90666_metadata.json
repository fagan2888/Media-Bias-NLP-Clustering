This is not yours or mine.

And it helped my family out a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, if the man would shake my hand on national TV with me wearing this [Confederate flag] shirt, he just does not know how many southerners would start to smile at him again.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below from The Tennessean, broadcast July 1, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tennessean_flag_150701c-Edit-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Tennessee protesters confront Obama waving Confederate flag \u2014 but they love Obamacare"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Scott Hudson and Rick Martin support the Confederate flag in Tennessee (The Tennessean/screen grab)A group of protesters in Tennessee waved Confederate flags at President Barack Obama on Wednesday while praising his health care reform law.\nRick Martin told The Tennessean that he drove two hours to the president\u2019s health care rally in Madison to stand up for his heritage.\n\u201cPersonally, I would love to meet the man, I would love to shake his hand, say hi,\u201d Hudson explained.\nIt\u2019s his, and we have to keep God alive in our country.\u201dBut Hudson told WPLN that he agreed with the president on at least one point: Obamacare works.\n\u201cIt would be my pleasure to meet the president of the United States,\u201d Martin explained."}
