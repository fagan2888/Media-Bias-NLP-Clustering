The Obama administration is removing 200,000 illegal aliens from Obamacare coverage, in an ongoing effort to figure out which enrollees are not entitled to benefits.

Obamacare benefits will terminate Feb. 28 for those enrollees who failed to verify their immigration or citizenship status, Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday. Most have had coverage for a year or more, but responded inadequately to a letter requesting verification, reported The Wall Street Journal.

Another 110,000 who did not respond to the letter at all were dropped from coverage in September.

It’s unclear whether the IRS is making any attempt to recover the lost tax dollars, and it did not respond to a WSJ request for comment.

An Obamacare provision prohibits illegal aliens from enrolling, but almost a million people signed up in 2014 with questionable legal status. Critics say technical problems with Healthcare.gov let people slip through the cracks, but immigration activists argue officials made it unclear how and when enrollees should verify their status.

Officials also said Wednesday nearly 7.75 million people have enrolled in 2015 plans through HealthCare.gov.

“Go to HealthCare.gov for life — a healthier life — liberty, freedom to pursue your happiness,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday. “We are very proud of the Affordable Care Act.”
