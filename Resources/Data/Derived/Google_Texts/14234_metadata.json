But Cruz likely sees it as a necessity.\n\nTrump leads in South Carolina with 36 percent support in the RealClearPolitics poll average. Cruz runs second at 20 percent, with Rubio well back in third, below 13 percent.\n\nWith Trump proving in New Hampshire that he can win over a broad coalition of Republicans and independent voters, and Cruz riding high among evangelicals and other social conservatives, the Trump-Cruz battle will be paramount, with mainstream candidates likely scrapping for bronze in South Carolina.\n\nThe first southern state to vote in the primaries is a rough-and-tumble political swamp.\n\nCruz told the Mike Gallagher radio show on Wednesday that \u201cSouth Carolina is going to play a key role in choosing whether the Republican nominee is a proven conservative or simply a candidate who talks the talk on the trail but hasn\u2019t walked the walk.\u201d\n\nTrump, scheduled to hold a Wednesday night rally in the state, meanwhile unleashed a South Carolina campaign ad criticizing Cruz as \u201cthe worst king of Washington insider who just can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ted-cruz-afp-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Ted Cruz says Donald Trump wants \u2018Bernie Sanders-style socialized medicine\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe only candidate who can beat Donald Trump is me,\u201d Cruz told reporters in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where Republicans vote on February 20.\nTrump leads in South Carolina with 36 percent support in the RealClearPolitics poll average.\nCruz highlighted the \u201csignificant glaring differences\u201d between the two on health care, stressing that Trump was keen on \u201cadopting Bernie Sanders-style socialized medicine,\u201d a reference to the independent senator challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.\nTrump and Cruz both say they want to dismantle President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, but Trump has been hammered by conservative rivals for expressing support years ago for universal health care.\nCruz runs second at 20 percent, with Rubio well back in third, below 13 percent."}
