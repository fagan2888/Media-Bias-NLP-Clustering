Pierre, SD

South Dakota lawmakers expect to spend a lot of time during the upcoming legislative session debating the Common Core standards that establish what students should know in math and English at each grade level.



Rep. Jim Bolin, of Canton, says he believes the standards adopted by 45 states are a move to take away people's ability to control their own local schools.



Bolin says bills will be introduced to phase out the standards, halt them pending future study and prevent information on individual students from being given to the federal government.



State Education Secretary Melody Schopp defends the Common Core standards, saying they maintain local control because each school district decides how to teach the required skills. She says the standards require students to learn what they need to succeed.
