Other subjects covered in the issue: health care payment reform; the diminished number of uninsured young adults; and regulatory approval of new drugs by the FDA.\n\nPublication of the cancer studies in the April issue was supported by Precision Health Economics and the Celgene Corporation.\n\nDoes increased spending on breast cancer treatment result in improved outcomes?\n\nAaron Feinstein of Yale University School of Medicine\u2019s Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center and coauthors compared care costs and survival rates among women ages 67\u201394 diagnosed with stage II or III breast cancer during two time periods, 1994\u201396 and 2004\u201306. They found that over the course of a decade, median cancer-related costs increased from $12,335 to $17,396 among women with stage II disease, and their five-year survival rate improved from 67.8 to 72.5 percent.\n\nFor those women with stage III disease, costs increased from $18,107 to $32,598 with an accompanying five-year survival improvement from 38.5 to 51.9 percent. The cost increase was largely attributable to a substantial increase in the cost of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n\nThe authors note that the price society is willing to pay for an additional year of life remains controversial in the United States and suggest that more research is needed to determine how to best contain costs while continuing to advance patient care.\n\nFalse-positive mammograms and potential overdiagnoses cost the US $4 billion annually.\n\nIn recent years, the prevalence of false-positive mammography screenings and overdiagnosis of breast cancer (diagnosis of cancer that will never cause symptoms or death during a patient\u2019s lifetime) has been well-documented. Until now, however, the full, national-scale cost burden has not been documented.\n\nMei-Sing Ong of the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital Informatics Program and Ken Mandl, Harvard Medical School professor and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital Informatics Program faculty member, assessed the costs from false-positive mammograms and breast cancer overdiagnoses among more than 700,000 women ages 40\u201359, between 2011 and 2013. Average expenditures ranged from $852 for every false-positive mammogram to $12,369 for each misdiagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (abnormal changes in the cells of the milk ducts of the breast\u2014the most common type of non-invasive breast cancer).\n\nThe authors found that the national costs of false-positive mammograms and breast cancer overdiagnoses are $4 billion each year. They note that these costs must be considered in debates about whether screening guidelines should take into account additional factors beyond age.\n\nCancer-related papers in the April issue also include:\n\nOther topics in the issue:\n\nDataWatch: The Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage provisions\u2019 impact on young adults.\n\nStacey McMorrow of the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Policy Center and coauthors examined data from the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 National Health Interview Survey and found that young adults have experienced substantial gains in insurance from health reform. They found that the percent of young adults, ages 19\u201325, who were uninsured fell 11 percentage points\u2014from 30 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to just 19 percent by the second quarter of 2014.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s dependent coverage expansion, which allows adults to remain on their parents\u2019 insurance until their twenty-sixth birthday, first took effect in September 2010, while the Medicaid expansion and Marketplace coverage began in January 2014. Coverage gains were concentrated among higher- and moderate-income young adults through 2013, while those with lower incomes were more likely to gain coverage in 2014, especially in states that expanded Medicaid.\n\nThis study is part of Health Affairs\u2019 DataWatch series.\n\nUnder the new pay-for-performance models, how do low performers fare?\n\nJessica Greene of George Washington University\u2019s School of Nursing and coauthors studied the impact of a primary care provider compensation model\u2014that of Fairview Health Service, a Pioneer accountable care organization in Minnesota\u2014in which 40 percent of providers\u2019 compensation was based on their clinic-level quality outcomes. The researchers examined providers\u2019 performance data before the model and two years after implementation,\n\nThe best predictor of improvement was the primary care providers\u2019 baseline quality performance. Greene and coauthors found that the providers whose baseline scores placed them in the lowest one-third in terms of performance on three quality metrics improved three times more, on average, than those in the middle-third, and almost six times as much as those in the top-third.\n\nThe authors note that payment reform may help narrow variation in primary care performance.\n\nOne of the nation\u2019s largest fee-for-value initiatives among the first to show promise.\n\nChristy Harris Lemak of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and coauthors analyzed Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan\u2019s Physician Group Incentive Program\u2019s impact on quality and spending for more than three million beneficiaries across 11,000 primary care practices from 2008 to 2011. They found practice participation in the fee-for-value program was associated with approximately 1.1 percent lower total spending for adults and a 5.1 percent reduction in total spending for children.\n\nAt the same time, the practices maintained or improved performance on eleven of fourteen quality measures\u2014including screenings for patients with diabetes, breast and cervical cancer screenings, and well-child visits. The authors note that the findings contribute to the growing body of evidence in favor of models that align physician payment with cost and quality performance.\n\nPublication of the cancer studies in the April issue was supported by Precision Health Economics and the Celgene Corporation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/04/06/health-affairs-april-issue-the-cost-and-quality-of-cancer-care/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Health Affairs\u2019 April Issue: The Cost And Quality Of Cancer Care"}, "description": "Health Affairs\u2019 April Issue: The Cost And Quality Of Cancer Care | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd398\"", "article_summary": "Chris FlemingApril 6, 2015The April issue of Health Affairs contains a cluster of papers focusing on the cost and quality of cancer care.\nIn recent years, the prevalence of false-positive mammography screenings and overdiagnosis of breast cancer (diagnosis of cancer that will never cause symptoms or death during a patient\u2019s lifetime) has been well-documented.\nDoes increased spending on breast cancer treatment result in improved outcomes?\nOther subjects covered in the issue: health care payment reform; the diminished number of uninsured young adults; and regulatory approval of new drugs by the FDA.\nThe authors found that the national costs of false-positive mammograms and breast cancer overdiagnoses are $4 billion each year."}
