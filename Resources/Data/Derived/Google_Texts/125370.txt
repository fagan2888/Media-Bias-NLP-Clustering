Kean’s closing 8 dry cleaning locations in Baton Rouge, Gonzales

Kean’s Fine Dry Cleaning said it is closing eight locations by Oct. 9 and blamed the decision on a shift to business casual clothes, labor shortages and the Affordable Care Act.

The 115-year-old business said its dry cleaning locations at 218 Staring Lane, 4665 Perkins Road and 4556 Government St. in Baton Rouge and 14505 Highway 44 in Gonzales will be closed effective Monday. The Government Street location had been open since early August. Kean’s locations at 140 Sharp Road, 8178 Plank Road and 439 Ninth St. in Baton Rouge and 311 S. Burnside Ave. in Gonzales will remain open through Oct. 9. All of the stores have stopped taking new cleaning orders.

In a statement, the company said the eight stores were underperforming, accounting for one-third of Kean’s total sales. According to the company website, after the closures, Kean’s will have seven locations in Baton Rouge, Prairieville and Central. The company has announced plans to open new locations at the Highland Marketplace and in the Onyx Residences downtown in 2016.

“As Baton Rouge has shifted and changed through the years, Kean’s has made an attempt to remain in many of these locations,” the company said in a news release. “However, due to ‘wash and wear,’ as well as more casual business attire, the volume in these locations does not justify our presence any longer.”

The company also said it has felt the impact of labor shortages, as well as the Affordable Care Act, which mandates that companies with 50 full-time employees offer health insurance.

Kean’s said employees who are being affected by the store closings will be offered jobs at the remaining locations where possible.
