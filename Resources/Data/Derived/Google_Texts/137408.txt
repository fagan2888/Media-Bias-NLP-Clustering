The gallery overlooking the chamber of the House of Representatives is filling up for President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address.

Democratic Congressmen Rick Larsen of Washington and Charles Rangel of New York have announced they’ll host the mother and sister of Kenneth Bae, an American imprisoned in North Korea since 2012.

Republicans, meanwhile, are bringing as their guests people struggling under Obama’s signature national health care law.

House Speaker John Boehner’s guests include employers in his district like David Lippert, president of Hamilton Caster & Manufacturing Company in Hamilton, Ohio.

Lippert employs 72 people but is unable to expand the nearly century-old business, Boehner’s office says, because of problems with “Obamacare.”
