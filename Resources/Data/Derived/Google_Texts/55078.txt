â€” I went to Basan last month and I think I ate my weight in sushi. The food was that good! That is why I can tell you that you really need to check out this event next week!

Our friends over at The Point are hosting a $20 sushi tasting at the new American Tobacco Campus hot spot on Tuesday, March 24. For $20, you get two pieces of sashimi roll, two pieces of volcano roll, a small cup of pork ramen, two pieces of chicken karaage and three half pieces of mochi (coffee, green tea, or mango).

Only a limited number of tickets are being sold for this event so buy your tickets early.

The fish at Basan is shipped in just about every day - so you are getting quality sashimi and sushi rolls. And the sake isn't too bad either!
