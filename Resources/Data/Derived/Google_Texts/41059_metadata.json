There were three layers of foam and one is being removed for health and safety reasons,\u201d Vali added. \u201cIt\u2019s being done right now. The fight is definitely on. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nFury had earlier threatened to pull out of the fight if the canvas wasn\u2019t changed, and he made a complaint to the British Boxing Board of Control and the fight commissioner.\n\n\u201cThey need to change it. If they don\u2019t change it, then we have a problem,\u201d Vali said earlier, adding that \u201cthe foam underlay is too soft. It\u2019s five inches (12.7 centimeters) thick, which doesn\u2019t help a big lad going into a ring. We\u2019ve never seen canvas like this before. It\u2019s too much from a health and safety point of view, because he can easily do (damage) his ankle. Usually there\u2019s only a two-inch foam, and that\u2019s it \u2013 this is between five and six inches.\u201d\n\nVali said the 27-year-old Fury had looked at the canvas and \u201csays it\u2019s ridiculous and that he can\u2019t fight in a ring like that.\u201d\n\nThe undefeated Fury (18 knockouts in 24 bouts), a former British, Irish, European and Commonwealth champion, is bidding to end Klitschko\u2019s heavyweight reign and take the Ukrainian\u2019s WBA, IBF and minor WBO and IBO belts.\n\nThe 39-year-old Klitschko, whose record is 64 wins with 53 knockouts from 67 fights, weighed in at 111.5 kilos (246 pounds) on Friday, giving Fury a slight advantage at 112 kilograms (247 pounds).\n\nFury, at 2.09-meters (6-foot-9), is also taller than the 1.98-meter (6-foot-6) Klitschko.\n\nAP Sports Writer Steve Douglas contributed from Manchester, England.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wladimir Klitschko-Tyson Fury fight is on after soft canvas issue resolved", "title": "Wladimir Klitschko-Tyson Fury fight is on after soft canvas issue resolved", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/28/wladimir-klitschko-tyson-fury-fight-is-on-after-soft-canvas-issue-resolved/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151128_100424_klitschko-fury.jpg", "height": 453}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151128_100424_klitschko-fury.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-28T10:00:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T05:08:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOne of the canvas layers is being removed.\nDUESSELDORF, Germany \u2014 Tyson Fury has withdrawn a complaint about the canvas being too soft for Saturday\u2019s world heavyweight title fight against Wladimir Klitschko, meaning the bout will go ahead as planned.\nFury\u2019s agent, Asif Vali, said organizers had agreed to remove a layer of foam to make the canvas firmer.\nThere were three layers of foam and one is being removed for health and safety reasons,\u201d Vali added.\nIf they don\u2019t change it, then we have a problem,\u201d Vali said earlier, adding that \u201cthe foam underlay is too soft."}
