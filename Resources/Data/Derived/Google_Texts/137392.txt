Blueprint Health, a mentor-focused New York City health tech accelerator, showed off seven new companies during their seventh annual Demo Day. Blueprint boasts over 200 health executives and clinicians in their mentor network who offer support and advice to their startups.

On Friday, April 24th, Blueprint’s Winter 2015 class of startups pitched to several hundred of Silicon Alley’s health tech elite. Jean Luc Neptune, Blueprint’s Executive Director and Accelerator Leader, led off the afternoon with an update on their past companies:

85% still in operation

80% generating revenue

Touch Surgery (Winter ’13) with 50 employees

Procured Health (Winter ’12) with 30 employees

4 companies from Summer ’13/ Winter 14 classes on pace to generate more than $1 million in annual revenue

All companies from Summer ’12 (8 in total) still in operation three years after participation in program

In the last three months, thecompanies from this latest class honed their visions and gained traction. Several have pilot programs (as far away as New Zealand) and are already generating income. This group of startups predominantly focus on the opportunities in operations. They demonstrate understanding both of day-to-day healthcare and new opportunities offered by the Affordable Care Act. For instance, Moving Analytics and GlucoIQ take advantage of the push for more accessible care management programs by providing technology driven platforms for patient monitoring and engagement. And that’s just for starters.
