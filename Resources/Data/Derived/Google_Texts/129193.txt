Gary Johnson: 2016 is an Opportunity for a Libertarian Candidate

Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, the current Libertarian Party frontrunner and likely nominee, said in an interview with the Daily Caller that this year was the best opportunity for Libertarians in a general election an opportunity like it they may not see again.

Johnson believes the current political climate is ripe for a third party candidate to capitalize, with both major party’s gearing up to potentially nominate polarizing and unpopular candidates.

“If this isn’t an opportunity for the Libertarian nominee — and I hope to be the Libertarian nominee — there will never be an opportunity, in my opinion,” Johnson said.

Johnson also brought up his lawsuit against the Presidential Debates Commission, which he filed in hopes of getting the Libertarian nominee into the presidential debates for the general election.

“There’s no way that a third party wins the presidency without being in the presidential debates,” Johnson said.

Johnson also took shots at Senator Rand Paul, saying that he is libertarian on economic issues but not on social issues.

“What’s disheartening is he’s got this libertarian label, which is applicable to half of what he had to say, but then on the social side, he’s a Republican. At the end of the day, he’s a Republican.”

Johnson also believes that most voters are libertarians “at the end of the day.”

“I really believe that the majority of people in this country are libertarians, that we’re classically liberal at the end of the day, we’re fiscally conservative…but also we’re socially liberal. Who cares how you live your life as long as it doesn’t adversely affect mine?”
