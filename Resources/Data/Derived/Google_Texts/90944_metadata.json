(MarketWatch) \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t sell a dull market short.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll be hearing that Wall Street adage a lot in coming weeks, but should you follow it? It\u2019s important to get the right answer, since stock exchange trading volume invariably declines following Memorial Day and doesn\u2019t pick up in earnest until after Labor Day.\n\nTo gain insight, I focused on the stock market\u2019s behavior following low and high readings of the CBOE\u2019s Volatility Index, or VIX VIX, -1.25% This index\u2019s level at any given time reflects traders\u2019 expectations about stock market volatility over the subsequent 30 days.\n\nMany traders interpret the VIX in a contrarian way: They consider it bearish when the markets are dull and the VIX is low, while high VIX levels are considered bullish. If they\u2019re right, then the Wall Street adage is wrong \u2014 and you should be prepared to sell a dull market short.\n\nBut I found no support for this contrarian interpretation of the VIX, after feeding into my PC\u2019s statistical package the historical values for the VIX back to 1990, which is the first date for which the CBOE has data for this index. The stock market performs no more poorly in the wake of VIX readings that are below the historical median than when the VIX is above it.\n\nWhen VIX is... Average market return next month Return next quarter Return next 6 months Returns next 12 months Above its median level of 18.38 0.90% 2.64% 4.92% 9.03% Below its median level of 18.38 0.85% 2.70% 5.95% 13,77%\n\nIf anything, in fact, the data suggest the market does slightly better following below-median readings, though one shouldn\u2019t put too much weight on that since the differences are minor and not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level that statisticians often use to conclude that a pattern is genuine.\n\nTo be sure, contrarians have many other ways in which they interpret the VIX. One way is to compare the VIX to its recent levels; is it lower than its average level of the previous month, for example, or much higher?\n\nBut this alternate approach doesn\u2019t get support from the historical data, either. I sliced and diced the VIX data since 1990 in numerous ways, focusing on the VIX\u2019s level relative to its moving average of the trailing month, quarter and six months, and searching for correlations with performance over the subsequent month, quarter and six months. I found no patterns that were statistically significant.\n\nThe bottom line: This is one of those cases in which Wall Street\u2019s conventional wisdom is right: Don\u2019t sell a dull market short.\n\nClick here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Sentiment Indexes.\n\nMore from MarketWatch:\n\nPinterest, Uber \u2014 \u2018$10 billion is the new $1 billion\u2019\n\nDon\u2019t bet on a summer rally this or any other year\n\n5 dividend stocks that may be safer than Treasurys\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "As trading volume declines, that\u2019s the question of the moment, writes Mark Hulbert.", "creator": "@MktwHulbert", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CB448_asia_b_MG_20140430001126.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "parsely-author": "Mark Hulbert", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-05-21T06:00:00-04:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/should-you-sell-short-a-dull-stock-market-this-summer-2014-05-21", "author": "Mark Hulbert", "parsely-title": "Should you sell short a dull stock market this summer?", "description": "As trading volume declines, that\u2019s the question of the moment, writes Mark Hulbert.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "article.section": "Markets", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Markets", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "As trading volume declines, that\u2019s the question of the moment, writes Mark Hulbert.", "title": "Should you sell short a dull stock market this summer?", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/should-you-sell-short-a-dull-stock-market-this-summer-2014-05-21", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CB448_asia_b_MG_20140430001126.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CB448_asia_b_MG_20140430001126.jpg"}, "article.id": "DB78295A-E030-11E3-B5C0-00212803FAD6", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0929\"", "article_summary": "If they\u2019re right, then the Wall Street adage is wrong \u2014 and you should be prepared to sell a dull market short.\nThe bottom line: This is one of those cases in which Wall Street\u2019s conventional wisdom is right: Don\u2019t sell a dull market short.\nShutterstock/BurachetCHAPEL HILL, N.C.
