Two years ago, Marshall Henderson, Choctaw, was in the middle of a media firestorm when ESPN’s Erin Andrews allegedly called him out after a failed drug test.

At the time, in July 2013, USA Today reported Henderson, a guard for Ole Miss basketball, was suspended indefinitely for a violation of team rules. Police reports before the suspension, from the City of Oxford, Miss., were obtained by the paper and revealed that he had allegedly been cited for several incidents, including a traffic stop in which drugs were involved. In an interview with ESPN, Henderson talked about these incidents, and his personal battle with drug use.

On the same day that Henderson was suspended, July 10, 2013, Andrews sent this tweet and Henderson responded:

Just days ago, on April 17, Andrews’s boyfriend, Jarret Stoll, a forward with the LA Kings, was arrested for drug possession, according to a Las Vegas police report.

And Henderson made good on his word.

But, as of today, @NativeFlash22, who plays basketball for the Nift Al-Janoub Iraqi Superleague in Baghdad, has deleted that tweet from his Twitter account.

No formal charges against Stoll have been filed.
