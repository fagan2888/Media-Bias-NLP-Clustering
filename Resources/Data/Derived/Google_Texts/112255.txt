The same familiarity with the seashore that informs the lobster roll and fish taco at 167 Raw may have saved a woman’s life earlier this month.

“I grew up on Isle of Palms, and Jesse (Sandole) is from Nantucket, so we both have strong backgrounds in water activities,” Kyle Norton says by way of explaining why the downtown restaurant founders didn’t hesitate to rescue a stranded swimmer 200 yards off Sullivan’s Island.

Norton, Sandole and Sandole’s cousin, Dan Sampsonis, were at a friend’s house when they heard a woman screaming.

“We looked out and could see little heads bobbing,” Norton recalls. Without consulting each other beforehand, they sprinted for the water. The flailing woman was separated from her two young children by about 10 yards.

“By the time we got there, one other guy was holding the mother up,” Norton says. “I don’t know where he came into the picture, but he was just barely able to keep her head above water. Jesse and I grabbed the mother, and Dan and the other guy each grabbed a kid.”

According to Norton, the woman was so weakened by the ordeal that she was unable to stand up even after he and Sandole returned her to knee-deep water. “We literally carried her onto the beach,” he says. Paramedics arrived a few minutes later.

Now 26, Norton believes he was a more capable swimmer a few years ago. But the rescue was powered by adrenaline. “My adrenaline was going so much, I was asking Jesse afterward where he was,” he says.

While Norton never learned the woman’s name, he’s confident she weathered the incident without sustaining any serious physical harm. And, he adds, “it’s pretty apparent that she was probably not from here.”
