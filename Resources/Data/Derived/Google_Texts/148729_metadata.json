One study in Health Affairs last year concluded that about 70 percent of the health spending slowdown is a result of the economy, not any structural changes to health care delivery. Obamacare may be due some credit, but not too much.\n\nSimilarly, it\u2019s true that a government report estimated that between 2010 and 2013, deaths from \u201chospital-acquired conditions\u201d were reduced by about 50,000. But it\u2019s hard to fully pin this on Obamacare when the report states up front that \u201cthe precise causes of the decline in patient harm are not fully understood.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the 16 million insured figure comes from a March report by the Department of Health and Human Services, and it is a total of those who gained coverage through Obamacare\u2019s exchanges, Medicaid, employment, and the individual market place, which means it\u2019s not wholly attributable to the law. And it tallies those who signed up for coverage rather than those \u201ceffectuated enrollment\u201d\u2014those who have already paid their premiums. The actual number is probably not too far off from what President Obama stated, but, once again, Obamacare isn\u2019t the entire story here.\n\nSo Obama is overstating the case, and, of course, leaving out points against the law.\n\nFor example: About half of the people who received subsidies through the law last year will have to pay them back through their taxes this year, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study this week. On average, those who owe will have to pay a little more than a quarter of their subsidy back. A few will have to pay back the entire subsidy.\n\nOn the flip side, a little less than half will end up getting money back, but even that will be complicated by the fact that the federal government and California, which runs the biggest state exchange, sent out nearly a million tax forms related to the health law with incorrect information, leading the administration to ask many to delay filing their taxes as a result. California has already issued 120,000 correct tax forms, but there are still \u201ctens of thousands\u201d who haven\u2019t gotten updated forms, according to the L.A. Times.\n\nBeyond that, there are additional questions about whether the Internal Revenue Service is even equipped to handle all the new paperwork required by the law. According to the Chicago Tribune, roughly a quarter of tax filers will have extra filing requirements due to the health law.\n\nAnd then there are the poll numbers for the law, which is still unpopular, just as it has been throughout the five years it has been law. Polls differ on the exact contours of public opinion about the law, but all the polls in the Real Clear Politics opinion survey show that oppositions outweighs support by at least seven points; on average, the opposition is 10.5 points higher than the support.\n\nIf the law is truly working so well for so many people, if it is, as Obama has now taken to saying, working better than expected or anticipated, then why does it remain so stubbornly unpopular?\n\nWhen the law was being debated in Congress, many supporters of the law argued that it would grow popular once it passed. When that didn\u2019t happen, Obamacare backers insisted that it polled poorly because the major benefits had yet to kick in. When the major benefits kicked in, they argued that the botched launch of the exchanges was killing support.\n\nThese excuses no longer work. The coverage expansion has arrived, and while the precise numbers aren\u2019t clear, there\u2019s no denying that far more people are covered now than two years ago. The exchanges are still incomplete on the back end, but the consumer-facing part of the system works well enough. The health insurance subsidies have arrived, and are being doled out to millions, and so have the insurance rules restricting insurers from charging or denying coverage based on preexisting conditions.\n\nObamacare\u2019s major benefits have gone into effect and had time to work their way through the system\u2014and yet the law remains widely disliked. Obama\u2019s message about the law, meanwhile, remains the same as always: It\u2019s great, and people should stop resisting and recognize how great it is.\n\nAfter five years, in other words, President Obama has not changed his message, even in the face of consistent broad public opposition, even as the various theories for why it remains unpopular have fallen away. Obamacare is simply not well liked. This is the political reality\u2014and President Obama still refuses to embrace it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Obamacare turns five years old this week, and to mark the occasion, President Obama took after critics of the health law, noting their ongoing opposition", "title": "On Obamacare, It\u2019s the President Who Refuses to Embrace Reality", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/03/24/on-obamacare-its-the-president-who-refus", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14272221906143.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare turns five years old this week, and to mark the occasion, President Obama took after critics of the health law, noting their ongoing opposition while briefly laying out the reasons he believes it to be a success. \u201cIt\u2019s time to embrace reality,\u201d he said, according to The Hill.\nThe president ticked off a string of points in support of the law: an additional 16 million insured, 50,0", "title": "On Obamacare, It\u2019s the President Who Refuses to Embrace Reality", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14272221906143.jpg", "creator": "@petersuderman", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-03-24T18:42:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/peter-suderman"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "This is the political reality\u2014and President Obama still refuses to embrace it.\nThe actual number is probably not too far off from what President Obama stated, but, once again, Obamacare isn\u2019t the entire story here.\nThe law, he said, is \u201cworking even better than expected.\u201dOne could reasonably quibble with much of this, because not all of the points President Obama cited are clearly or fully attributable to Obamacare.\nAfter five years, in other words, President Obama has not changed his message, even in the face of consistent broad public opposition, even as the various theories for why it remains unpopular have fallen away.\nAccording to the Chicago Tribune, roughly a quarter of tax filers will have extra filing requirements due to the health law."}
