Purpose and Registration

The purpose of the listening sessions is to better understand local and state level efforts related to the implementation of the NHAS and its focus on the HIV care continuum, including discussion about how the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is helping advance the Strategy. The meetings are open to the public with the goal of engaging many stakeholders about the innovations, successes, and challenges being experienced at the state and local levels. Pre-registration is requested so that organizers know how many attendees to expect. To RSVP, please visit: https://www.cmpinc.net/onap .
