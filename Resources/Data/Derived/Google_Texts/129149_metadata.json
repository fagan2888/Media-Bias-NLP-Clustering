There have been many significant moments in the eurozone since it erupted in crisis fully seven years ago, but none has been sharper than the confrontation now playing out in Greece. Europe\u2019s fate may hang in the balance.\n\nImmediately at issue is a parliamentary vote Monday for or against Stavros Dimas whom the government has nominated for the Greek presidency. If Dimas fails to win substantially more support among legislators than he now has, the constitution mandates national elections, and therein lies the crux.\n\nFew Greeks want to go to the polls just now. But if they do, all surveys indicate they will choose Alexis Tsipras, leader of the Syriza party as their next prime minister. Syriza\u2019s stripe runs along the left side of the social-democratic spectrum. Tsipras is a vigorous and articulate opponent of the austerity policies lenders have imposed on Greeks. His party was the big winner in elections to the European parliament last May.\n\nRelated: Greece Faces Crucial Vote that Could Trigger Election\n\nUnder a Syriza government, hence, Greece would turn on a dime. And in short order, so would Europe. For weeks, the thought of \u201cPrime Minister Tsipras\u201d has inspired terms such as \u201cmenacing clouds\u201d and \u201cGrexit,\u201d meaning the prospect of Greece simply leaving the eurozone to go its own way.\n\nBroadly speaking, a confrontation has been building for a couple of years between austerians and Keynesians who favor political rather than technocratic solutions to Europe\u2019s crisis. Of late, French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Matteo Renzi, the Italian premier, have broken into open resistance to the tough budgetary and deficit restrictions Brussels and Frankfurt, seat of the European Central Bank, insist upon.\n\nBut Tsipras is of another order altogether. He is a 40-year-old civil engineer with a long record of political activism, notably in opposition to the neoliberal version of globalization. Emphatically populist, Tsipras displays little concern for the fate of bankers or industrialists, although he is now trying to calm bondholders. He has had a parliamentary seat since 2009.\n\nRelated: Greek Opposition Leader Accuses Government of Fear-Mongering\n\nOn Sunday, Tsipras published a much-noted opinion piece in Avgi, an Athens newspaper. Based on a Syriza press release, Bloomberg\u2019s Nikos Chrysoloras put out an early curtain raiser Saturday, noting these points:\n\nTsipras\u2019s top priority will be \u201ca social spending program to alleviate the \u2018humanitarian crisis\u2019 in Greece.\u201d\n\nSocial spending will require no new borrowing.\n\nThe social outlays will not be open to negotiation.\n\nSyriza\u2019s intent is \u201cto build consensus in Greece\u201d and \u201cpave the way for an alternative policy in Europe.\u201d\n\nHere is a little of what Tsipras sounded like over the weekend:\n\nSyriza\u2019s victory will be the start of a great national effort to save society and restore Greece\u2014a national effort with international repercussions, since our historical responsibility is\u2026 turning a eurozone country from a neoliberal experiment to a model of social protection and growth.\n\nNote the implied commitment to the eurozone. It\u2019s real. Tsipras doesn\u2019t want to take Greece back the drachma, but he views the nation\u2019s $240 billion in public debt to its \u201ctroika\u201d of lenders\u2014 the European Commission, the ECB, and the IMF\u2014as unsustainable.\n\nRelated: Greek PM Offers 2015 Election Once Bailout Talks Complete\n\nMissing not a trick, Tsipras earlier invoked the London Debt Agreement of 1953, by which lenders wrote off half of Germany\u2019s postwar debt. \u201cWhile generosity was extended to Germany, Germany refuses to extend the same generosity,\u201d Tsipras told an Athens audience a few weeks back.\n\nThe path through the euro crisis was bound to lead to this, in my view. And the shove back against Germany\u2019s inflation hawks and the technocrats to the north was bound to be stiffest in Greece. It has been years since we saw pictures of Athenians eating dinner out of dumpsters and former business executives running what Americans called hobo camps back in the 1930s.\n\nLast month the economy finally climbed out of recession, but taking back the 25 percent it has shrank is a generation\u2019s work. Unemployment, while down from its peak, is still just short of 26 percent; the International Labour Organisation recently warned of \u201ca prolonged social crisis\u201d unless a lot of jobs materialize quickly.\n\nThe troika and the European Union are having none of this, of course. The sum of their position is roughly, the bailout terms are the bailout terms. You\u2019re stuck.\n\nRelated: ECB Weighs Weaker Eurozone States Bearing More QE Risk\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Jean-Claude Juncker, European Commission president, said he wanted Greece\u2019s next president to come from New Democracy, the rightist party Konstantin Karamanlis founded when the military dictatorship collapsed in 1974. Following Juncker\u2019s inappropriate comment, Pierre Moscovici, a commissioner, traveled to Athens to lobby no fewer than seven government ministers, the central bank governor, and assorted others in the same cause.\n\nAbsolutely unconscionable. It is a perfect display of the E.U.\u2019s indifference to politics and social issues, which is what brought the eurozone to this point in the first place.\n\nMore of the same now makes sense, does it?\n\nWhat\u2019s tough to figure is why Antonis Samaras, the conservative prime minister, decided to bring forward the election to replace Karolos Papoulias, the outgoing president, who was not scheduled to retire until next March. Syriza made clear its popularity in the E.U. elections. Athens and the troika are amid tough negotiations on further assistance, and the latter has agreed to extend aid only until the end of February.\n\nSamaras gambled and Samaras now stands to lose. On Saturday, he pleaded with parliament on national television to give Dimas the 12 additional votes he needs to take office and avert elections.\n\nIn my view, there will be less than now meets the eye in the \u201ccatastrophe\u201d of a Syriza victory, if it comes to one. Scrape away the politics and Tsipras wants a new deal for Greece because he wants jobs and growth. In three words this has been the anti-austerian argument from the first, austerity having plainly let many Europeans down.\n\nThis should be everyone\u2019s priority in Europe now. It is a mystery why bond investors and bank lenders can\u2019t see what\u2019s in their interest, too.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s all eyes on Athens this week.", "title": "A New Leader Could Lift Greece\u2014and Europe\u2014Out of Crisis", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/29/New-Leader-Could-Lift-Greece-and-Europe-Out-Crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-07-24T154633Z_1_CBRE86N17TO00_RTROPTP_2_GREECE-RESTRUCTURING.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/29/New-Leader-Could-Lift-Greece-and-Europe-Out-Crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-07-24T154633Z_1_CBRE86N17TO00_RTROPTP_2_GREECE-RESTRUCTURING.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s all eyes on Athens this week.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Unemployment, while down from its peak, is still just short of 26 percent; the International Labour Organisation recently warned of \u201ca prolonged social crisis\u201d unless a lot of jobs materialize quickly.\nBut if they do, all surveys indicate they will choose Alexis Tsipras, leader of the Syriza party as their next prime minister.\nRelated: Greek Opposition Leader Accuses Government of Fear-MongeringOn Sunday, Tsipras published a much-noted opinion piece in Avgi, an Athens newspaper.\nRelated: Greece Faces Crucial Vote that Could Trigger ElectionUnder a Syriza government, hence, Greece would turn on a dime.\nScrape away the politics and Tsipras wants a new deal for Greece because he wants jobs and growth."}
