One of the conservative journalists who met with President Obama on Tuesday night responded to what he called "suspicions" about the off-the-record session.

The Washington Examiner's Byron York was one of a small group of reporters and columnists who sat down with the president. He was joined by columnists Kathleen Parker and Charles Krauthammer, Wall Street Journal editorial page editor Paul Gigot and National Review reporter Robert Costa.

Though there was relatively little outcry on the right about the meeting, at least some conservative outlets, such as Breitbart, chided the journalists for speaking to Obama.

On Wednesday morning, York responded to apparent questions about his decision:

Finally, I was impressed Obama invited conservative journalists in. He didn't have to, but he did, and I thought that was a good thing. — Byron York (@ByronYork) October 9, 2013
