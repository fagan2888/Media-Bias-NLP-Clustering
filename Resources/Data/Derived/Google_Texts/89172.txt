WASHINGTON (CBS DC) – Actor Richard Dreyfuss is drawing heat from Conservative wetsites like Breitbart.com.

The Oscar winning actor appeared on CNN’s “Piers Morgan Live” on Tuesday.

When the subject turned to politics and Obamacare, Dreyfuss said it was shameful that Republicans were not trying to help solve the problems that have appeared with the rollout of the Affordable Care Act.

He also said it should be no surprise there were glitches in these early days “all of our national endeavors started out badly. World War II did not start well, or the Highway Act, or Social Security, or the Hoover Dam.”

Dreyfuss then said it was the duty of both parties to come together to make the law work.

What riled conservatives was when he said, “if one party says no, then they should anticipate having the sick and the dying and the dead on their lawns.”

His remarks were also singled out for criticism on DailyCaller.com.
