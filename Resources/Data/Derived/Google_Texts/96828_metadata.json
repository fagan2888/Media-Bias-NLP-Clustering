The officers responded to the call promptly, assuming that either Doris or her husband, 95-year-old Fred Thomson, had fallen or injured themselves.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case. Doris and her husband, who is blind, were simply lonely and wanted to share a chat and, perhaps, a cup of tea with someone.\n\nAnd the officers who responded firmly believe that their jobs aren\u2019t just about fighting crime, but also about responding to the needs of the citizens they protect, with caring and kindness. So instead of arresting or even issuing a warning to the elderly couple, Police Constable Stu Ockwell and his colleague brewed a pot of tea for the elderly couple, sat down with them, and cured their loneliness with kindness.\n\n\u201cIt was a nice change to have somebody to talk to,\u201d Fred explained in an interview with ITV News. \u201cI was very pleased to know there was help about and pleased to talk to them because sometimes you can be a bit isolated as you get older but they made me feel at home.\u201d\n\nOckwell and the other police officer spent around half an hour with the elderly couple, drinking their tea, having their chat, and showing that a little bit of kindness can have a huge impact on others in the community. Fred Thomson even opened up and regaled the two police officers with tales of his past.\n\nHero bobby visits 95-year-old couple after elderly lady rings 999 because she was \u2018lonely\u2019 https://t.co/tY99D5opsr pic.twitter.com/eYYsJ1LpIS \u2014 Manchester News MEN (@MENnewsdesk) November 10, 2015\n\n\u201cWe spent half an hour with them, put on the kettle whilst Fred told us the stories of when he was in the war. He\u2019s an amazing character and had us in fits of laughter and to me it made my day,\u201d Ockwell said. Despite the fact that the call had nothing to do with a physical injury or medical emergency like he first assumed, the police officers believed that the visit was necessary. \u201cThe lady\u2019s husband has gone blind and she struggles to look after him,\u201d Ockwell said, according to the Manchester Evening News. \u201cIt was out of desperation, really. She isn\u2019t very well herself.\u201d\n\nIn fact, during the interview given by the husband, Mrs. Thomson was too frail to make even an appearance. The police officer said that Mr. and Mrs. Thomson do have \u201cgood support from neighbors and children, who visit every other day,\u201d but that he believes Mrs. Thomson\u2019s memory \u201cappears to be fading a bit.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat was clear is that, although it is hard, they just want to look after each other.\u201d And, although he and his colleague faced some criticism for \u201cwasting time\u201d on something not deemed a \u201creal incident,\u201d Ockwell and his colleague stand by their decision.\n\n\u201cSometimes people struggle, especially at this time of year. The help is there, we just went to comfort them.\u201d\n\nThe department for which Ockwell and his colleague work made a joke about the sudden \u2014 and positive \u2014 spotlight focused on their police officers after this simple, but lovely, incident of human kindness, drawing a sharp contrast to the many stories of police misconduct.\n\nAfter the recent media frenzy this week it would appear Police Brew-tality is acceptable afterall Morning everyone \u2014 GMP Middleton (@GMPMiddleton) November 14, 2015\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that police officers have responded to calls that were not emergencies, but warranted kindness rather than punishment.
