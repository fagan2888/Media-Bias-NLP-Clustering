He gave up four runs on five hits and two walks in 1 2/3 innings. How rough was the lefty\u2019s first Cactus League start? He threw 42 pitches, just 18 for strikes.\n\nGray was efficient and impressive, needing only 23 pitches (17 strikes) in his two innings. He gave up a leadoff double to Yonder Alonso, but that was the only hit he allowed. He struck out there and walked none. His fastball was clocked at 96 mph and he blew it by the Padres\u2019 Wil Myers on a called third strike in the second innings.\n\n\u201cI was trying to pitch with some controlled aggression,\u201d Gray said.\n\nHe said his feel for his slider this spring is \u201ctremendous.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year I didn\u2019t have it dialed in like I did in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know that I have it back. I used all three pitchers today and was able to get outs with every single one.\u201d\n\nHits\n\nNew catcher Nick Hundley, the former Padres catcher, hit a two-run double in the third innings.\n\nRafael Ynoa continued his impressive spring, driving in a run with a single in the second.\n\nMisses\n\nThough Matzek\u2019s fastball reached 94 mph, he didn\u2019t command it very well and was constantly behind hitters.\n\nUp Next\n\nThe Rockies host the Reds in a 1:10 p.m. game at Salt River Fields. Troy Tulowitzki and Carlos Gonzalez, coming back from injuries, could make their spring debuts.\n\nScheduled to pitch for the Rockies are right-handers Jordan Lyles, Tommy Kahnle, Jorge Rondon, Brooks Brown and Jose Ortega. Lefty reliever Rex Brothers is scheduled to pitch for the first time this spring, and lefty Aaron Laffey is also slated to pitch.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Carlos Gonzalez,Jon Gray,Nick Hundley,Troy Tulowitzki,Tyler Matzek", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Jon Gray was sharp, Tyler Matzek was not.
