Sen. Robert P. Casey (D., Pa.) praised a $25 million allocation to help railroads install Positive Train Control, the safety system that could have averted the Amtrak crash in Philadelphia in May.\n\nThere's a two-year delay of the \"Cadillac tax\" on expensive health-insurance plans and a two-year suspension of the Affordable Care Act's tax on medical device makers, a levy fiercely opposed by Republicans, including Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), and Democrats from states with large medical industries, such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nSens. Robert Menendez and Cory Booker, both New Jersey Democrats, praised tax credits to help the poor and those with mortgage debt. Another rider includes wording inserted by Rep. Tom MacArthur (R., N.J.) to protect South Jersey's joint McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst military base.\n\nLawmakers were careful to highlight the provisions that could justify their stands ahead of critical Friday votes.\n\nOn the crude-oil exports, Fattah said he would have opposed the measure if it were a stand-alone bill.\n\n\"It's a bad idea,\" he said. \"However, as part of the overall negotiations on the appropriations for the year, there's a thousand other things in the bill.\"\n\nIn exchange for lifting the oil export ban, Democrats won an extension of tax credits for wind and solar energy.\n\nParty leaders hailed the bill as a true example of bipartisan give-and-take. Others were less charitable.\n\nLawmakers can't vote for the good ideas, said Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), \"without also voting for each and every dysfunctional, irresponsible, and unsustainable policy.\"\n\nThe push to end the export ban was one of the final and most contentious sticking points.\n\nOil producers and Republicans argued that allowing crude exports will create benefits that will ripple through the economy. \"This is a big win for American jobs and for our energy industry,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said.\n\nMeehan looked to refineries in Philadelphia and Trainer and saw a major downside.\n\nThere are about 3,000 jobs, including contractors, directly tied to local Philadelphia Energy Solutions' refineries and Monroe Energy's refinery in Trainer, according to Meehan's office.\n\nRoughly 1,000 more work at PBF Energy refineries in Paulsboro and in Delaware City, Del., and about 100 work at Axeon Speciality Products, an asphalt refinery in Paulsboro.\n\nAnd that doesn't count local businesses tied to those facilities.\n\nWith an expanded market for oil, crude prices are expected to rise, helping oil producers counter the sharp drop sparked by the shale boom. That means higher costs for refiners who turn the crude into gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel - particularly for refiners in the Philadelphia area who can handle the type of oil that comes from shale.\n\nBy 2025, refiners' profits will be $22.7 billion less than if the export ban remains in place, according to a September report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\n(For consumers, however, several studies have predicted a small drop in gasoline prices, which are linked to the international oil market, not the domestic market.)\n\nMeehan said he had \"deep reservations\" about the export change, but would look \"at the totality\" of the bill.\n\nA coalition of refiners, including those from the Philadelphia area, said Thursday it was \"extremely disappointed\" with the legislation, and questioned the wisdom of allowing exports when the United States still imports seven million barrels of oil per day.\n\nBut Brady, a close ally of the refiners, said he did not expect layoffs.\n\nHe noted that the bill includes language allowing the president to stop exports in case of economic harm.\n\n\"They don't like it, but they're not going ballistic,\" Brady said. He said he was \"leaning\" toward backing the bill. \"I don't think [the refiners] want to put me in a position to vote to shut down the government,\" he said.\n\njtamari@phillynews.com@JonathanTamari\n\nwww.philly.com/capitolinq", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"url": "http://articles.philly.com/2015-12-19/news/69148642_1_oil-export-ban-tax-credits-refineries", "site_name": "philly-archives", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON - Refineries and lawmakers in the Philadelphia area are cringing over one of the marquee provisions in the massive spending bill expected to pass Congress on Friday.
