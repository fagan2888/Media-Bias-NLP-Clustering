Get ready.\n\nIt has been a while since Walker has been front and center in the mainstream media. Walker was one of the very first government officials to publicly warn Americans about the nation\u2019s dire financial pressures. He has touched upon the country\u2019s colossal debt problems, immense budget deficits and the $120 trillion unfunded liabilities and expenditures that will soon come due.\n\nCiting the enormous costs of Social Security, public pensions and healthcare, Walker believes your retirement funds are at risk. Remember, this isn\u2019t just a conspiracy theory from a YouTube commenter or Alex Jones.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) has already confirmed that the Disability Insurance Trust Fund could be out of money as early as next year. This means approximately 11 million depending on such monthly payments could be left out in the cold. Overall, Social Security is scheduled to run out of money by 2033 and Medicare could be insolvent in less than 10 years.\n\nAccording to Walker, the government will likely apply a temporary, short-term band-aid that likely won\u2019t solve the problem at all. One of the measures he thinks Congress will put forward is a reallocation of payroll revenues from the retirement element to the disability portion.\n\n\u201cAccording to the trustees, it\u2019s supposed to go to zero, the so-called trust fund in 2016,\u201d said Walker on Sunday in an interview with CNBC. \u201cWashington has a tendency to put band aids on open wounds, rather than trying to actually do what needs to be done.\u201d\n\nFor years, people have been discussing the very real threat of Social Security extinction. Walker alluded to the \u201ctrust fund\u201d and the fact that the federal government tends to purport \u201cwords that don\u2019t mean the same thing as Webster\u2019s Dictionary.\u201d Walker believes you can\u2019t really trust the trust fund because what\u2019s inside is just government debt. However, there\u2019s enough government debt to make Social Security benefits payments for less than two decades.\n\nDespite the troubles of Social Security, \u201cMedicare is in much worse shape than Social Security\u201d because the government, including President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act (ACA), \u201coverpromised\u201d on its healthcare obligations. Walker posits that healthcare inflation remains one of the greatest threats to the federal government amid changing demographic trends.\n\nIn order to solve the looming federal Social Security crisis, Walkers suggests three moves:\n\nIncrease the retirement eligibility age for younger workers.\n\nRevise the benefit formula to offer more money for low-income retirees.\n\nBoost the payroll tax cap to $200,000, but not raise the tax rate above 6.2 percent.\n\nMoreover, another disastrous threat is the matter of underfunded state pensions and healthcare given to retirees. The issue, Walker says, stems to governments promising very generous and lucrative pensions to state and municipal employees even when the money wasn\u2019t there \u2013 last year, U.S. state pensions were only funded 80 percent, down from 97 percent in 2008.\n\nTo solve this state problem, Walker recommends imposing new plans for new workers and eradicate the abuses, otherwise known as \u201cdouble-dipping.\u201d Also, Walker wants a cap placed on indexing benefits to increase with inflation.\n\nWhat are the odds of anything really being done? Very little, says Walker, because of the \u201cgreat partisan and ideological divide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need to understand the longer we wait, the more dramatic the changes, both on the spending side and the revenue side,\u201d stated Walker. \u201cMaking tough choices sooner rather than later is the way to go.\u201d\n\nWe know politicians and, more importantly, the voters. Any time there is talk of entitlement reform, even if it means raising the retirement age, it generates vitriol, anger and back-pedaling, not to mention the influx of accusations that you detest old people and the working man.\n\nDon\u2019t remember David Walker?
