For you seniors out there, I checked to see if that might just possibly be \u2018Charlie\u2019 McCarthy, of old time ventriloquist Edgar Bergen (Candice\u2019s dad) and puppet, Charlie McCarthy, fame. After all, Republican Congressmen are all puppets to the giant corporations. As it develops, the Californian is Kevin McCarthy (no relation). Up until Friday, the post was all but conceded to the non-wooden McCarthy. Then, Friday, along comes a no-name backbencher, Raul Labrador, entering the fray.\n\nIronically, the Puerto Rican-born Mormon Latino is an unforgiving \u2018illegal\u2019 immigrant basher. No citizenship for the undocumented, EVER!!!. So Labrador, himself a one-time immigration attorney is enemigo publico numero uno to the U.S. population of targeted Hispanics and Latinos. And we can\u2019t ignore his Tea Party wackadoodle bona fides AND the fact he resides in overwhelmingly Republican Idaho. If ever there was a bizarre political state that makes its own rules, many, way short of legal, it\u2019s Idaho. Nice skiing. That\u2019s where it ends for reasonable Americans.\n\nSo, let\u2019s compare the two final combatants, barring the last minute entry of Carrot Top or one of the Kardashians. McCarthy sort of has to make nice with the Democrats occasionally, being from a district dotted with left-coasters. He\u2019s even hinted he\u2019d be willing to grant citizenship to most undocumenteds. \u201cFruit Tramps\u201d are also central to California\u2019s economy. These are the predominantly Mexican workers who follow the harvesting season and it wouldn\u2019t do to create an enemy class out of them or more importantly, the growers representing a $45 billion industry. They\u2019d love to see the low-paid undocumenteds turned into U.S. citizens. That\u2019s the \u2018moderate\u2019 side of McCarthy. On the other hand, he is a border hawk who wants to create stringent border enforcement.\n\nMcCarthy could be characterized as a careful politician. No tabloid-screamer sound-bites from him. He chips away at the edges. Voting for modest, but painful food stamp cuts. Demanding votes on anything to do with Obama administration attempts at modifying the Affordable Care Act and putting the brakes on Executive Orders. On the stump he insists we keep taxes \u201clow\u201d so as to \u201chelp our small businesses.\u201d What he really means is following Koch Brother\u2019s orders designed to help only \u201chuge\u201d businesses. So he falls short of vile and repugnant, but is an unrepentant and unfeeling Republican nonetheless. Any moderate leanings reflect political expediency as opposed to responding to the greater good.\n\nIf there are any questions as to fealty to party, OpenCongress had McCarthy voting with his party 97.5% of the time last year. He\u2019s a Republican through and through and everything you don\u2019t like about the direction the GOP is taking our country, he\u2019s helping to take it there. As for the origins of Kevin\u2019s campaign cash, his top contributors for the 2013-2014 cycle were from the Securities and Investments sector. Regulate securities and investments? Nay, Nay, Nay\u2026who knows what the number 2 contributing industry, Real Estate, wants, but Pharmaceuticals/Health Products, Health Professionals and Insurance come in 3, 4 and 5. Decimate ACA anyone? Yep, he\u2019s Republican with a capital \u201cR\u201d and he isn\u2019t about to do Democrats any favors other than possibly the district-driven full citizenship.\n\nNow, the guy you\u2019ve all been waiting for. Heeeere\u2019s RAUL!!! A 46-year-old, he\u2019s got that nice guy look until you start learning things about him. He was first elected to Congress in 2010 and is the father of five kids. His stand on the Affordable Care Act was made clear when he enthusiastically endorsed the Idaho Health Freedom Act allowing the state\u2019s Attorney General to join 19 states in challenging the ACA mandates. Gee, do you suppose the American Legislative Exchange Council\u2019s \u201cHealth Care Freedom Act\u201d offered any guidance?\n\nAbout a year ago to the day, Labrador walked out on a bipartisan group working on the question of how undocumented immigrants would pay for their health care on a possible path to citizenship. He left the three remaining Republicans and the four Democrats on the committee in the lurch because he said he was through compromising. Waaah, Waaah! The perfect Tea Party Congressman. He also expressed his intention not to vote for any bill the group might get to the floor. In October of last year, when interviewed on Fox News, he seemed for all the world to oppose a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d so it\u2019s clear months later that the citizenship issue was the reason for his departure.\n\nIt should be noted that Labrador is on the House Judiciary Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee: A Perfect Tea Party fit.\n\nOn other legislative fronts, he voted against a bill that would have assessed the Keystone Pipeline vulnerabilities to terrorist\u2019s attacks. The bill included the inclusion of necessary protections. Again, only a concern for terrorists when his corporate puppet-masters are not involved.\n\nI don\u2019t know where Labrador is going in this and perhaps subsequent Congresses. He\u2019s introduced a half-dozen or so bills, none of which went anywhere. He just won his state\u2019s primary, so he\u2019ll probably get reelected. Clearly he\u2019s looking for a higher profile and Idaho is one of the remaining bastions of true Tea Party power. I\u2019ve heard there are a couple of other TP\u2019ers casting their covetous eyes on the Majority Whip position should McCarthy win Republican Majority Leader and move up from Whip. Ergo, like so many cockroaches, they\u2019ll be crawling all over congress for the next few weeks, assuring Fox News a full guest list and thoughtful progressives permanently elevated eyebrows.\n\nI fear we have two more years of suffering in front of us. After that, there should be at least a generation of sense and reason.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Word has it that a California Republican Representative named McCarthy is in line to take over Eric Cantor's post as House Majority Leader next Thursday, the 19th.
