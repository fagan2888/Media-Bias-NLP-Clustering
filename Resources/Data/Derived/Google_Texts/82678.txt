WASHINGTON – One of President Obama’s biggest cheerleaders slammed him Sunday for botching the launch of ObamaCare.

“The fact is, that, yes, what has happened is unacceptable in terms of the glitches,” House Minority Leader Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on ABC’s “This Week.”

The bad review from Pelosi, who is usually one of Obama’s staunchest defenders, underscored the massive extent of the technical bugs that plague the government Web sites where Americans are supposed to sign up for health insurance.

The Web sites repeatedly crashed or blocked access for consumers. And when they did manage to log on, many received faulty information about health care plans.

“This has to be fixed,” declared Pelosi, who presided as speaker of the House in 2010 when Democrats controlled the chamber and passed the ObamaCare bill, officially known as the Affordable Care Act.

Still, Pelosi remained a fervent supporter of Obama’s landmark health care law.

“What doesn’t have to be fixed is the fact that tens of millions of more people will have access to affordable, quality health care. That no longer having a preexisting medical condition will bar you from getting affordable care,” she said.
