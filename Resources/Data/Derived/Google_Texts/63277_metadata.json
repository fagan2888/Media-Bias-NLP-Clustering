But we need to keep up with the times,\u201d said Insurance Commissioner Katharine Wade, adding how new technologies and procedures have been proven to be clinically effective, making it more possible for older people to conceive a child.\n\nWade\u2019s office on Friday issued a bulletin to insurance companies and health care centers, informing them they must remove the age limit on infertility benefits for policies sold or renewed on or after Jan. 1, 2016. In April, the Washington, D.C.-based National Women\u2019s Law Center released a report that found numerous violations of the Affordable Care Act regarding requirements for women\u2019s health coverage in 15 states, including Connecticut. The federal act prohibits discrimination in health care.\n\nKaren Davenport, director of health policy at the center, said Connecticut was one of a handful of states that required coverage for infertility treatment but imposed the 40-year age limit. She praised the state for lifting it.\n\n\u201cThe Connecticut Department of Insurance was really open to hearing our arguments,\u201d she said.\n\nUnder the revised rule, men and women receiving infertility treatments still must be healthy and the treatment must be medically necessary in order to be covered. According to the bulletin issued by the agency, carriers and physicians may use \u201creasonable medical management\u201d to determine if an individual is healthy or if the treatment is medically necessary.\n\nWade said there are tests available that can help determine whether infertility treatment will work for a woman.\n\nKeith Stover, a lobbyist for the Connecticut Association of Health Plans, said the health insurers support the change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a positive development handled exactly the right way by the insurance commissioner,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were asked to discuss, we brought our experts to the table and worked out a sound and rational approach to the issue.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many people may ultimately be helped by the change in Connecticut\u2019s policy. But Susan Yolen, vice president of public policy and advocacy for Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, said more women are choosing to become mothers later in life.\n\n\u201cWhile we most often think of family planning as pregnancy prevention for younger women,\u201d she said, \u201cthere are an increasing number of women who choose parenthood later in their reproductive lives, only to experience infertility.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The insurance commissioner says the cutoff at age 40 didn't account for recent medical advances.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The insurance commissioner says the cutoff at age 40 didn't account for recent medical advances.", "title": "Connecticut requires infertility insurance coverage for those over 40 - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "updated_time": "2015-08-15T19:23:19-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/08/15/connecticut-requires-infertility-insurance-coverage-for-those-over-40/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The insurance commissioner says the cutoff at age 40 didn't account for recent medical advances.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "title": "Connecticut requires infertility insurance coverage for those over 40 - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "published_time": "2015-08-15T19:23:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-15T19:23:19-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8fd\"", "article_summary": "HARTFORD, Conn. \u2014 People over 40 who still hope to become parents in Connecticut may soon have the cost of infertility treatments covered by their insurance company.\nWade said there are tests available that can help determine whether infertility treatment will work for a woman.\nKaren Davenport, director of health policy at the center, said Connecticut was one of a handful of states that required coverage for infertility treatment but imposed the 40-year age limit.\nThe state Department of Insurance has determined that a 2006 state law mandating coverage for medically appropriate fertility treatments for men and women is discriminatory because it sets an age limit of 40.\nUnder the revised rule, men and women receiving infertility treatments still must be healthy and the treatment must be medically necessary in order to be covered."}
