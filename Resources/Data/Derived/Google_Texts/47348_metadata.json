It was the fourth win in a row for Pavelec, who only recently reclaimed his starting job from rookie Michael Hutchinson.\n\nThe Capitals (39-24-10) lost for the first time in four games, but have a comfortable grip on the Eastern Conference\u2019s first wild card spot.\n\nPavelec made a number of saves that brought the MTS Centre crowd to its feet, and also benefited from three Washington shots that hit iron.\n\nBraden Holtby had 21 saves for the Capitals.\n\nStuart, a stay-at-home defenseman, opened the scoring 11:46 into the first period with his second goal of the season. He pinched in from the blue line and Drew Stafford found him from behind the net.\n\nScheifele made it 2-0 midway through the second period with a high shot that beat Holtby to the glove side after a centering pass from Blake Wheeler. Stafford added his second assist of the game.\n\nAdam Lowry had an empty-net goal with 1:22 remaining.\n\nWinnipeg played without defenseman Dustin Byfuglien, No. 1 center Bryan Little and fourth-leading goal scorer Mathieu Perreault, who are all nursing injuries.\n\nThe Jets have 10 games remaining in their pursuit of their first playoff appearance in their four seasons in Winnipeg.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mark Stuart, Mark Scheifele and Adam Lowry scored for Winnipeg, which closed out a perfect three-game homestand with a 3-0 victory that snapped the Capitals' three-game win streak.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Mark Stuart, Mark Scheifele and Adam Lowry scored for Winnipeg, which closed out a perfect three-game homestand with a 3-0 victory that snapped the Capitals\u2019 three-game win streak.", "title": "Ondrej Pavelec makes 27 saves as Jets continue playoff push, shut out Capitals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/21/ondrej-pavelec-makes-27-saves-jets-continue-playof/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/21/Capitals_Jets_Hockey.JPEG-01080.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/21/Capitals_Jets_Hockey.JPEG-01080.jpg", "description": "Mark Stuart, Mark Scheifele and Adam Lowry scored for Winnipeg, which closed out a perfect three-game homestand with a 3-0 victory that snapped the Capitals' three-game win streak.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Ondrej Pavelec makes 27 saves as Jets continue playoff push, shut out"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Winnipeg, Mark Stuart, Washington Capitals, Ondrej Pavelec"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbab4\"", "article_summary": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba \u2014 Ondrej Pavelec made 27 saves, and the Winnipeg Jets beat the Washington Capitals, 3-0, on Saturday night for their fourth consecutive win.\nStuart, a stay-at-home defenseman, opened the scoring 11:46 into the first period with his second goal of the season.\nScheifele made it 2-0 midway through the second period with a high shot that beat Holtby to the glove side after a centering pass from Blake Wheeler.\nThe Jets have 10 games remaining in their pursuit of their first playoff appearance in their four seasons in Winnipeg.\nIt was the fourth win in a row for Pavelec, who only recently reclaimed his starting job from rookie Michael Hutchinson."}
