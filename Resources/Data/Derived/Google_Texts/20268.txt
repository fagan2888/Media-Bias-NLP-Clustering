WASHINGTON D.C. — It’s getting laughable now.

Another group of World War II veterans, this time from Ohio, chuckled when they were told the World War II Memorial in the nation’s capital city was closed.

The National Parks Service rangers told the vets the memorial was “officially closed,” but said anyone is free to “practice their First Amendment rights.”

Here’s what that looked like.

“Officially Closed”

Seriously guys, we’re closed:

Closed? LOL

No government. No water fountain.

Let’s go.

Oh, hello, congressman.

Picture time.

This is why we are here.

A long time coming.

I do not care about your so-called “government shutdown.”
