(AP) - While the Maryland General Assembly\u2019s presiding officers rely on staff to read and respond to email on their state accounts, Gov. Larry Hogan is in the driver\u2019s seat of his. The 59-year-old Republican is blunt with his staffers when it comes to defending his administration and protecting his image.\n\nThe Associated Press obtained hundreds of pages of emails from the governor and leading lawmakers over a week\u2019s time in a Public Information Act request as part of a Sunshine Week initiative. From complaints about editorials to how he looks in a photograph, Hogan doesn\u2019t hold back when he reads something he doesn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cWhat idiots,\u201d Hogan wrote, after complaining to his deputy director of communications about a reporter\u2019s story on a budget matter on Feb. 5 and asking the staffer to correct him.\n\nThe AP requested emails and calendar items from Feb. 1 to Feb. 7, a busy week during the state\u2019s legislative session that included Hogan\u2019s State of the State speech. The governor bristled at an editorial in The Baltimore Sun about his speech to the legislature, in which the newspaper wrote: \u201cThe battle lines in Annapolis appear to be shifting from a fight about whether Mr. Hogan\u2019s agenda is dangerous for Maryland to one about whether his inaction is setting the state back.\u201d\n\nThe governor wrote to his communications director: \u201cMy \u2018inaction is setting the state back.\u2019 What a joke. We have more action in one year than most do in 8.\u201d\n\nThe governor added in the Feb. 3 email that he has been a leading voice for improving the state\u2019s economic competitiveness and that Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller and House Speaker Michael Busch were not focused on the issue before Hogan called attention to it. Hogan noted their response, which included convening an economic development panel headed by former Lockheed Martin CEO Norman Augustine to make recommendations. The governor wrote that the \u201cfact they have done nothing proves it was a PR stunt in response to me.\u201d\n\nHogan took issue with another Sun editorial two days earlier, after a snowstorm, when the newspaper wrote that Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman raised Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford\u2019s street higher in priority for plowing. The Sun quoted Del. Frank Turner as finding it \u201codd\u201d that his street didn\u2019t get plowed as quickly even though he lives near Rutherford.\n\n\u201cWhat a BS Sun editorial,\u201d Hogan wrote to two administration spokesmen. \u201cWe have the best response of any state. And the only thing to focus on is Boyd, again?! We should raise holy hell.\u201d\n\nHe wrote another email less than an hour later: \u201cBaltimore City still hasn\u2019t dug out thousands of people and they get a pass. They\u2019d rather talk about one whiny delegate and one street in Howard County as the most important lesson of storm?!\u201d\n\nThe Sun isn\u2019t the only publication to annoy the governor.\n\nHogan, who underwent 30 days of chemotherapy last year to treat B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, noted a photo he thought was used often by The Washington Times that showed him during the worst period of his treatment. The governor wrote: \u201cCan we get Wash Times to stop using that photo?\u201d\n\nThe week also included a campaign trip to New Hampshire for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who campaigned for Hogan in 2014. Hogan emailed an aide who gathers press clips that \u201cyou missed a bunch of hogan christie stories and tv clips.\u201d\n\nWhile the Hogan administration released about 210 pages of emails, some were withheld because they were protected by executive privilege, wrote Geoffrey Hengerer, in a letter responding to the PIA request. Documents withheld or redacted involved communications to and from employees and officials of the governor\u2019s office in discussion of \u201cdifferent options available to it when considering various budgeting and legislative priorities,\u201d Hengerer wrote\n\nMiller and Busch, who are both Democrats, also provided emails and calendars, but both have staffers read and respond to emails. Many of them are letters from residents expressing support or opposition to legislation. Del. Nic Kipke, the House minority leader, and Sen. J.B. Jennings, the Senate minority leader, also provided emails and calendars.\n\nNone of them were required to release many of the emails under the state\u2019s Public Information Act, according to Sandra Brantley, counsel to the General Assembly. As members of the legislature, all public records related to their legislative activities \u201care absolutely privileged and do not have to be disclosed,\u201d Brantley wrote in a letter responding to the request.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "While the Maryland General Assembly's presiding officers rely on staff to read and respond to email on their state accounts, Gov.
