NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Hospitals in the U.S. spend exorbitant amounts on overhead compared to those of other countries, and that's causing financial ills for the average American patient.

According to new research comparing hospital costs in eight nations, including the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Wales, the Netherlands, France and Germany, the U.S. spends twice as much on bureaucracy as other nations. In particular, the U.S. spends $150 billion annually in hospital overhead alone.

The study — which was spearheaded by the City University of New York (CUNY) and the London School of Economics and also included researchers in France, Germany and the Netherlands and published in the September issues of peer review journal Health Affairs — also found that overhead comprised a little over a quarter (25.3%) of hospital budgets in the U.S. in 2011. What's more, the researchers found that within the U.S., administrative costs were highest (27.2 %) at for-profit hospitals.

Specifically , hospital administrative spending totaled $667 per capita in the U.S., $158 in Canada, $164 in Scotland, $211 in Wales, $225 in England and $325 in the Netherlands. Comparable dollar estimates could not be calculated for French and German hospitals because of accounting differences. However, their hospital administration costs were still found to be about 20% higher than in Canada and Scotland, yet still 40% below the U.S. levels.

"We're squandering $150 billion each year on hospital bureaucracy and $300 billion more is wasted each year on insurance companies' overhead and the paperwork they inflict on doctors," study lead author Dr. David Himmelstein, a professor at the CUNY/Hunter College School of Public Health and lecturer at Harvard Medical School, said in a release.
