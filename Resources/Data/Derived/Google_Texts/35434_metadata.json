Students at both Spelman College and Morehouse told CocoaFab in a series of interviews that they believed the liberal candidate would address the issues that matter most to them.\n\nSanders also released a stirring video from Eric Garner\u2019s daughter, Erica, sharing the reasons she believes he will be able to tackle the issue of police brutality.\n\nHillary Clinton picked up an important endorsement from the Congressional Black Caucus and now Geneva Reed-Veal, the mother of Sandra Bland, is joining her campaign.\n\nAccording to HillaryClinton.com Geneva shared this poem announcing her support in Chicago:\n\nNow is the time, this is the place,\n\nNow we are ready. Hillary is the face.\n\nWhy am I endorsing this woman to my right?\n\nBecause she has for years continuously put up the fight.\n\nShe seeks to make equal pay for equal work a priority.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but that sure works for me!\n\nHere\u2019s a woman who has shown time and time again,\n\nShe has the skill, experience and staying power more than 20 years in.\n\nYes, there was Benghazi and the infamous email situation.\n\nWhile both were stressful, she maintained her poise and dedication.\n\nDedicated to seeing mothers who singlehandedly raise babies\n\nFinally get compensated equal pay in this world that has gone crazy.\n\nSelfless in sitting down with a room of mourning mothers,\n\nWho have violently lost their children\u2014both sons and daughters.\n\nNow this I know to be absolutely true;\n\nI am one of those who met with her and was able to make it through.\n\nShe has a plan on gun laws that\u2019s like none other.\n\nUnapologetically she speaks out about the NRA and issues of color.\n\nHer plan for immigration is to keep families together.\n\nShe\u2019ll end family detention and close private immigration shelters.\n\nShe supports the bipartisan U.S.A. Freedom Act.\n\nPresident Obama signed it into law, and she has his back!\n\nShe has fought for quality affordable health care her entire career.\n\nSo she\u2019ll defend the Affordable Care Act and build on the successes of it here.\n\nShe\u2019ll cut taxes for the middle class, raise the minimum wage, and ensure the wealthiest pay their fair share.\n\nShe\u2019ll invest in infrastructure and education. This woman really cares.\n\nI\u2019ve watched and followed her career, and saw her take hits.\n\nYet she still manages to stand here decades later as if it didn\u2019t bother her one bit!\n\nAs Sandra Bland\u2019s mother, I know a little about frustration.\n\nYou have to stand and push through it, even when you want a vacation.\n\nLike me, she misses the counsel of her late father, who told her always \u201ccarry a shovel,\u201d\n\nSo at any given time she could dig herself out of trouble.\n\n\n\nLike me, she lost her dad in 1993.\n\nHis wisdom played a big part in the strength she shows you and me.\n\nI\u2019ve shared with you just some of Hillary\u2019s views,\n\nNow it\u2019s up to you to do your research\u2014and vote when you\u2019re through.\n\nPeople, we are expecting a new president in nine months. Hillary is that new baby.\n\nFrom now until November let\u2019s fiercely support this lady!\n\nI present to you, Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nWho will get your vote?", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "geneva reed-veal, sandra bland's mom endorses hillary clinton for president with a poem, bernie sanders, black voters,", "og": {"site_name": "CocoaFab", "description": "As the battle for the Black vote continues, the leading Democratic\u00a0candidates are working hard to galvanize\u00a0support in our community.
