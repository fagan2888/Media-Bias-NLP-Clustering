It\u2019s not a bad idea; the president\u2019s party needs all the help they can get.\n\n\u201cAfter being diminished in Congress, wiped out in the South, and marginalized in the states Dems focus on gun control,\u201d wrote National Review\u2019s Charles Cooke on Wednesday.\n\nIt\u2019s true. \u201cA handful of Democratic lawmakers said Tuesday they plan to push once again for universal background checks on all gun sales in the new Congress, even though they recognize it will be an uphill battle with Republicans taking majority control,\u201d The Hill reported.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t pass background checks, it\u2019s just much more likely that someone will get their hands on an illegal gun and use it to kill their neighbors or their classmates,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi will join the call for expanded background checks at an event on Wednesday. The lawmakers are also pushing for legislation to keep guns out of the hands of people who have been convicted of domestic violence.\n\nIf new gun laws did not pass even in the wake of the mass shootings in Colorado and Connecticut in 2012, they certainly would not pass today. Rank and file Democrats have convinced themselves that new checks on the legal ownership of firearms are a winning issue. \u201c90 percent of Americans support background checks,\u201d they tell themselves. Indeed, the popularity of this concept might explain why it has been federal law to impose background checks on prospective firearms purchasers since 1993.\n\nWhen the Democrat-controlled Senate failed to pass even modest new gun control legislation in April of 2013, the left was shocked. They shouldn\u2019t have been. If they had not committed to a selective reading public opinion surveys, the failure of their new gun control push would not have come as such a surprise.\n\nWhile vast majorities did support new gun laws in theory following the nightmarish massacre of school children in Newtown, Connecticut in December of 2012, few regarded that initiative as a matter of urgency. Gallup surveys from that period showed that guns and gun control was the top priority of only 6 percent of the public in February of 2013, declining to just 4 percent the following month. By April, issue of guns ranked well behind the economy, unemployment, \u201cdissatisfaction with government,\u201d the federal debt/deficit, healthcare, and the decline of the institution of the family.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey from January of 2013 found that, among 18 major issues facing the nation, the problem of guns in America ranked 15th.\n\nWhen gun control died in the Senate, a Washington Post-ABC News poll discovered that a plurality (47 percent) was either \u201cdisappointed\u201d or \u201cangry\u201d about that development. Just 39 percent described their reaction as either \u201cvery happy\u201d or \u201crelieved.\u201d A parsing of that data, however, would have revealed the folly of the Democratic Party\u2019s gun control push. While the vast majority of Democrats were disappointed by the Senate\u2019s decision to pass on new gun laws, a majority of Republicans and a plurality of independents were not.\n\nEven in the wake of the Sandy Hook Massacre, gun control was only ever a priority for the left. That condition has not changed and neither has the Democratic Party.\n\nCongressional Democrats\u2019 renewed advocacy for new gun laws may be the starkest admission yet that the president\u2019s party is intellectually spent and focused entirely on maintaining the cohesion of its increasingly moribund electoral coalition.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Intellectually spent.", "title": "Party of ideas: Democrats to revive gun control push", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/12/10/party-of-ideas-democrats-to-revive-gun-control-push/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-10T19:41:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-10T17:19:43+00:00"}, "keywords": "2012, democratic party, gun control, Newtown,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2060\"", "article_summary": "Even in the wake of the Sandy Hook Massacre, gun control was only ever a priority for the left.\n\u201cAfter being diminished in Congress, wiped out in the South, and marginalized in the states Dems focus on gun control,\u201d wrote National Review\u2019s Charles Cooke on Wednesday.\nIf they had not committed to a selective reading public opinion surveys, the failure of their new gun control push would not have come as such a surprise.\nWhen the Democrat-controlled Senate failed to pass even modest new gun control legislation in April of 2013, the left was shocked.\nWhen gun control died in the Senate, a Washington Post-ABC News poll discovered that a plurality (47 percent) was either \u201cdisappointed\u201d or \u201cangry\u201d about that development."}
