Remember how the city's banks merged and sold to out-of-state companies in the 1980s and 1990s? The hospital situation \"is parallel to that,\" Kinslow added. \"Some hospitals are doing very well. Some are not... We are still slightly overbedded in this region. You will see some closures.\"\n\nShe gave Obamacare credit for shifting the focus of the healthcare industry from making sure it works for doctors and other providers, to \"finally put(ting) the patient in the middle of the conversation\" by expanding coverage for people with chronic diseases, adult children and more poor people: \"All those are real positives.\"\n\nKinslow is concerned that too many people are still choosing the lower-cost, high-deductible plans, and then delaying or refusing doctor-recommended procedures when they realize they'll have to pay $5,000 or $10,000 out-of-pocket.\n\nBut overall, the Aria chief expects that the aspects of the law that are still \"problematic, will correct themselves\" as doctors, insurers, hospitals, employers keep adapting. The health system will \"look very different in the next several years.\"", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160525, "editdate": "20150114T08:42:44", "twitter": {"creator": "@PhillyJoeD", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inq-phillydeals/Aria-chief-Obamacare-helps-but-more-Phila-hospitals-will-shut-merge.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/designimages/Philly_Twitter_Generic_880x440.jpg", "title": "More Phila hospitals will shut, says Aria chief", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "cg": "business", "keywords": "Joseph N.
