Alan Grayson cited Communist Manifesto and Das Kapital author Karl Marx in his criticism of U.S. foreign policy in a local radio interview Monday.\n\n\u201cWell history repeats itself, first as tragedy and then as farce. We had the same origin for Osama bin Laden didn\u2019t we,\u201d Grayson said when asked about a report from Steve Clemons of The Atlantic that the Saudis could have helped fund ISIS.\n\n\u201cBy the way am I allowed to repeat Karl Marx on the air,\u201d Grayson then said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay? On your show it\u2019s okay. I want to make sure I\u2019m not offending anyone.\u201d\n\nGrayson said Marx\u2019s quote best reflected the problems of United States foreign policy in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThat was actually Karl Marx who says history repeats itself first as tragedy and then as farce. And in this case it is a farce because we haven\u2019t learned our own lessons. A lot of the grief that we\u2019ve come to in the Middle East for the past twenty years has been a product of our own making.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Democrat cited the Iraq War as an \u201cultimate example\u201d of history possibly repeating itself.\n\n\u201cI think that the War in Iraq is the ultimate example of that. Four trillion dollars down that rathole and now we have people who are anxious for us to do it all over again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3440136, "userid": 227410}, "description": "\"By the way am I allowed to repeat Karl Marx on the air.
