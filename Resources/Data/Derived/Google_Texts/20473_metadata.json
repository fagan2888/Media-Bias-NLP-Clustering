He is Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics, Pathology, and Decision Science; and former Chief of Cardiology (Pediatric). Dr. Deane serves on the Board of Directors of the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange (NMHIX). Opinions offered here are Dr. Deane's alone, and do not necessarily reflect those of the NMHIX Board.\n\nPresident Barack Obama ignores the checks and balances built into U.S. government structure, acting as though the rule of law does not apply to him, to his minions or supporters. He protects his faithful from consequences of their dishonest or illegal acts.\n\nPresident Obama has created a supra-legal presidency.\n\nTreaty With Iran\n\nThe president wants his treaty with Iran, despite its unfavorable terms that may endanger world peace. Congress opposes it, so do most Americans \u2014 however, neither the Constitution nor the will of the people will stop him from realizing his legacy.\n\nArticle II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution says, in part, that the president \u201cshall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.\u201d\n\nTo understand the full extent of President Obama\u2019s illegal behavior, read the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Sept. 10 editorial \u201cIran No Confidence Vote.\u201d The Senate passed the Nuclear Agreement Review Act (aka the Corker-Cardin Bill) 98-1. The president signed it, committing him to allow Congress to review any Iran deal in its entirety before finalizing.\n\nHe then signed a \u201cSole-Executive Agreement\u201d with Iran, parsing the word \u201ctreaty\u201d into agreement. Finally, he browbeat his faithful Democratic senators (who themselves are skeptical of the deal) to filibuster, preventing a vote on a resolution to disapprove of his Iran \u201cagreement.\u201d Our supra-legal president made a terrible deal with a nation whose foreign policy is \u201cDeath to America.\u201d He ignored the deal he made with Congress. He discarded the constitutional requirements and used a political gambit to circumvent both letter and intent of the law.\n\nImmigration\n\nOne reason to have a federal government is to control our borders. Federal law requires individuals entering this country to go through a visa process. Those entering illegally are deported.\n\nFor the first three and a half years of his presidency, Obama deported more illegals (on a monthly average), primarily back to Mexico, than anyone before him. Shortly before the general election of 2012, he ordered a halt to all deportations. Neither Congress nor the Supreme Court had made any change to federal immigration law.\n\nBy what authority did President Obama negate the law?\n\nHis reason to stop the deportations was obvious and unapologetic pandering to the Hispanics, and it worked. His supra-legal action garnered him 71 percent of the 2012 Latino vote.\n\nBureaucrat Uber Alles\n\nThe Dodd-Frank 2010 banking and finance reform law created a bureaucracy, the Financial Stability Oversight Council. This agency gives Washington \u201cinvestigative, prosecutorial, and adjudicative powers,\u201d says the Wall Street Journal. The FSOC makes the Secretary of the Treasury not only the judge, jury and executioner, but also the investigating officer as well as the arresting officer.\n\nThe Obama administration acts as though separation of powers does not exist. This separation, enshrined in the Constitution, was intended by our Founding Fathers to prevent the concentration of power and thus avoid a return of the tyranny we rebelled against in 1776.\n\nConcentration of Power, Upheld by SCOTUS\n\nWhen Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, colloquially Obamacare, it said that only insurance exchanges \u201cestablished by the state\u201d could offer subsidies to American citizens. As the president wanted his federal (not state-established) exchange at healthcare.gov to provide insurance, he instructed the IRS to issue a ruling that healthcare.gov could distribute subsidies. In essence, he changed what his own ACA law said.\n\nIn King v. Burwell, the Supreme Court upheld Obama\u2019s supra-legal decision. They elevated the executive branch of government over the legislative branch, thereby concentrating power in White House hands and reinforcing the president\u2019s belief that he is above the law.\n\nPresidential Appointees Untouchable\n\nWhy did former IRS bureaucrat Lois Lerner and other Obama appointees get away with their questionably legal acts? Because Obama\u2019s example to them as their leader encouraged them to ignore or subvert the law.\n\nLerner, the former director of the Exempt Organizations Unit at the IRS, specifically targeted conservative groups who were opposed to the president\u2019s agenda. Liberal groups were left alone. Will Ms. Lerner ever be put on trial? Not a chance.\n\nHillary Clinton was Obama\u2019s secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. When she ran State, did she properly defend and protect our ambassador and his staff in Benghazi, Libya, on the 10th anniversary of 9/11? Everyone knows the answer: Clinton was derelict in her duty. The consequence Clinton may suffer? She could be our next president, being the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic nomination.\n\nIn 2009, President Obama appointed Eric Holder to be attorney general, the country\u2019s No. 1 upholder of the law. He cannot choose which laws he will defend or enforce. If it is federal law, the attorney general should defend and enforce it. Yet, Holder refused to fully enforce banking laws, used his office to spy on American journalists and was actually held in Contempt of Congress for refusal to hand over documents related to the Fast and Furious scandal. He decided what was the Law and what wasn\u2019t.\n\nRule of the Pen\n\nWhen President Obama said, \u201cI have a pen and I\u2019m not afraid to use it,\u201d he was referring to more than just veto power. His pen also works for executive orders, memoranda, advisories, guidelines and an untold number of undisclosed communications.\n\nSupporters have pointed to Obama\u2019s alleged lower number of executive orders while detractors have emphasized the scope of his orders, much broader than previous presidents.\n\nWe should judge based on the data, using the president\u2019s own publicly stated promise of the \u201cmost transparent\u201d administration in U.S. history, with a \u201csystem of transparency, public participation, and collaboration.\u201d However, it is hard to take the president seriously if we contrast his promises with his actions over the passage and implementation of Obamacare. Were all the backroom deals transparent? Can you call it \u201cpublic participation\u201d if most people oppose his namesake bill? Is it \u201ccollaboration\u201d when you pass major social legislation over the opposition of every member of the then-minority, Republican, party? And is it truly a law if the president keeps changing it at his whim?\n\nFinally, there is perception versus reality. Obama manufactured the appearance of transparency with his memorandum urging more FOIA releases, while he manipulated the White House Log of Visitors and Meetings to exclude those he wished to keep out of the public eye.\n\nLa Loi, C\u2019est \u00e0 moi.\n\nIn 1655, King Louis XIV of France intoned, \u201cL\u2019\u00e9tat, C\u2019est moi,\u201d meaning, \u201cI am the state.\u201d He believed that without him, there was no France. Four-and-a-half centuries later, President Obama might well declare, \u201cLa Loi, C\u2019est \u00e0 moi,\u201d which is loosely translated as, \u201cThe law is what I say it is.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nDr. Deane Waldman MD MBA is author of \u201cThe Cancer in the American Healthcare System;\u201d Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics, Pathology and Decision Science; and Adjunct Scholar (Healthcare) for the Rio Grande Foundation, a public policy think tank.
