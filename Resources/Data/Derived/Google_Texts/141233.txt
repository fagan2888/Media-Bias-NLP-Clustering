A woman who turned down her television when she heard a disturbance outside her Aurora home witnessed the fatal stabbing of a neighbor on Saturday night.

“There was a young lady on the ground here,” said the woman, who declined to give her name, saying she was frightened of reprisals. “And (there was) a man on top of her punching and stabbing her.”

Aurora police shot and killed the man when he refused to drop the knife, the woman said.

Family members have identified the woman killed Saturday night as Mireya Ramirez, a mother of four, according to KMGH-Channel 7.

The victim’s mother, who was also stabbed, said her 28-year-old daughter’s boyfriend attacked them before he was shot and killed by an Aurora police officer, according to 7News.

June Simpson said she heard her daughter screaming Saturday evening in their home on North Kenton Street, near East Sixth Avenue and Havana Street.

“I had to knock the door down and go in,” Simpson said. “And when I went in there, she was on the ground bleeding and he was on top of her, stabbing her.”

She said Ramirez ran outside into the street, but her boyfriend followed, continuing to attack her.

The woman who talked to The Denver Post said the victim was screaming for help, and another neighbor tried to distract her attacker by yelling. The assailant went after that man, but when the victim stood, he tackled her. “He got on top of her and he had a knife,” the woman said.

Police came moments later and the “guy was still trying to hurt her,” said the woman, who watched from her window.

Police pulled the suspect off the victim and he continued to wave the knife, she said. They told the suspect to put his weapon down two times before firing on him, she said.

“It was horrifying to see that poor woman run and try to get away from that horrible person,” she said. “It was a waste of life. All he had to do was put down the knife.”

Benita Palmer, another neighbor, said the couple had a fight a few weeks ago.
