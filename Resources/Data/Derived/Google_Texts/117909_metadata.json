She is a family nurse practitioner at Essentia.\n\nIn his ruling, Kyle wrote that the employer plan was amended as of Jan. 1 to remove the exclusion for gender-reassignment services and surgery. In the lawsuit, Tovar says her son was harmed by delaying medication treatment for his condition, because the family could not afford the $9,000 cost for a medication that can help some people with gender dysphoria.\n\nTovar alleged that because her son could not obtain necessary medical services, she suffered from stress, worry, anger, disappointment and sleepless nights. She said she experienced an increase in migraines, and ultimately reduced her hours at work.\n\n\u201cTovar and her family continue to suffer financial and emotional harm due to the plan\u2019s discriminatory exclusion of coverage for medical care needed by Tovar\u2019s son,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nKyle\u2019s order was issued Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services finalized a rule Friday mandating that insurers provide health services for patients regardless of their gender identity as part of the Affordable Care Act, the second time in a single day that the administration has framed transgender rights as a central civil-rights issue.\n\nThe rule, known as Section 1557, says that any health insurance company that participates in the federal health care exchange cannot deny individuals health care or coverage based on their gender identity, and that they \u201cmust be treated consistent with their gender identity, including in access to facilities.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post contributed to this report.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mother claimed her health plan wrongly excluded coverage for her son.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Mother claimed her health plan wrongly excluded coverage for her son.", "title": "Judge dismisses lawsuit on insurance coverage for gender reassignment", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/judge-dismisses-lawsuit-on-insurance-coverage-for-gender-reassignment/379473421/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mother claimed her health plan wrongly excluded coverage for her son.", "title": "Judge dismisses lawsuit on insurance coverage for gender reassignment", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/judge-dismisses-lawsuit-on-insurance-coverage-for-gender-reassignment/379473421/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "lawsuit"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "gender reassignment,lawsuit"}, "article_summary": "But the employer\u2019s health plan includes a categorical exclusion barring any insurance coverage for gender reassignment surgery or services, Tovar said in her lawsuit.\nIn the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Minnesota, Tovar argued that her son was diagnosed in November 2014 with gender dysphoria, a condition arising when an individual\u2019s gender identity differs from the gender assigned at birth.\nThe rule, known as Section 1557, says that any health insurance company that participates in the federal health care exchange cannot deny individuals health care or coverage based on their gender identity, and that they \u201cmust be treated consistent with their gender identity, including in access to facilities.\u201dThe Washington Post contributed to this report.\nIn January, Brittany Tovar sued her employer, Essentia Health, and the administrator of the company health plan, HealthPartners, alleging they violated state and federal law by excluding coverage for gender reassignment services or surgery.\nA federal judge has dismissed a northwestern Minnesota woman\u2019s lawsuit alleging that her teenage son was denied coverage for medication and surgery to help him transition from a female to a male."}
