It is unclear exactly how many New Yorkers are affected; according to state health officials, as many as 400,000 independent practitioners get health insurance through job-related group plans, but that number also includes people who receive coverage through their spouses\u2019 employers.\n\nThe predicament is similar to that of millions of Americans who discovered this fall that their existing policies were being canceled because of the Affordable Care Act. The crescendo of outrage led to Mr. Obama\u2019s offer to restore their policies, though some states that have their own exchanges, like California and New York, have said they will not do so.\n\nBut while those policies, by and large, had been canceled because they did not meet the law\u2019s requirements for minimum coverage, many of the New York policies being canceled meet and often exceed the standards, brokers say. The rationale for disqualifying those policies, said Larry Levitt, a health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation, was to prevent associations from selling insurance to healthy members who are needed to keep the new health exchanges financially viable.\n\nPhoto\n\nSiphoning those people, Mr. Levitt said, would leave the pool of health exchange customers \u201csmaller and disproportionately sicker,\u201d and would drive up rates.\n\nAlicia Hartinger, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said independent practitioners \u201cwill generally have an equal level of protection in the individual market as they would have if they were buying in the small-group market.\u201d She said the president\u2019s offer to restore canceled polices temporarily applied to association coverage, if states and insurers agreed. New York has no plans to do so.\n\nDonna Frescatore, executive director of New York State of Health, the state insurance exchange, said that on a positive note, about half of those affected would qualify for subsidized insurance under the new health exchange because they had incomes under 400 percent of the poverty level, about $46,000 for an individual.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut many professionals make too much money to qualify for the subsidies, and even if they are able to find comparably priced insurance, the new policies do not have the coverage they are accustomed to.\n\nDavid Rubin, vice president of Teiget, the Entertainment Industry Group Insurance Trust, which had served as a broker for about 1,000 members of creative guilds, said a big complaint was that in New York City and much of the state, the new individual plans both on and off the exchange did not allow patients to go to doctors out of network. \u201cAll these people had these customized plans which are better than most of the things out there, and most of them are saving only a small amount of money,\u201d Mr. Rubin said.\n\nRoy Lyons, managing director of Marsh U.S. Consumer, an insurance brokerage, said he had heard complaints from physicians, lawyers, pharmacists and optometrists. \u201cAt first they think it\u2019s the bar association making the decision or the insurance company doing it,\u201d Mr. Lyons said. \u201cWe have to explain that this is the Affordable Care Act; that\u2019s what was put into law. Once they understand, they\u2019re less emotional, but they\u2019re not happy with it.\u201d\n\nAmong those affected are members of the Authors Guild; the Advertising Photographers of America; the Suzuki Association of the Americas, a music teachers organization; the Society of Children\u2019s Book Writers and Illustrators; the New York City Bar Association; and the New York County Medical Society. (One group, the Freelancers Union, negotiated a one-year exemption with the state.)\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons to join a society is to get health insurance,\u201d said Dr. Paul N. Orloff, president of the New York County Medical Society. Even doctors pay a lot for coverage, he said, because the days of trading medical care with colleagues are long gone. \u201cIn the old days, professional courtesy was the norm,\u201d Dr. Orloff said.\n\nThe medical society has not yet formally notified its solo practitioners, because their insurance plans do not expire until April. But those letters will be going out soon, officials said.\n\nIt is not lost on many of the professionals that they are exactly the sort of people \u2014 liberal, concerned with social justice \u2014 who supported the Obama health plan in the first place. Ms. Meinwald, the lawyer, said she was a lifelong Democrat who still supported better health care for all, but had she known what was in store for her, she would have voted for Mitt Romney.\n\nIt is an uncomfortable position for many members of the creative classes to be in.\n\n\u201cWe are the Obama people,\u201d said Camille Sweeney, a New York writer and member of the Authors Guild. Her insurance is being canceled, and she is dismayed that neither her pediatrician nor her general practitioner appears to be on the exchange plans. What to do has become a hot topic on Facebook and at dinner parties frequented by her fellow writers and artists.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what is the reality of it?\u201d",
