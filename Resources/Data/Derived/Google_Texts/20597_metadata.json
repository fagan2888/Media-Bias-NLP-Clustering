The Tennessee Department of Revenue, which audited Hobby Lobby last November, did not agree. It found that Hobby Lobby owed $136,197.51 plus $27,630.40 in interest.\n\n\"The statute or related regulations do not elaborate upon the meaning of 'directly,'\" Hobby Lobby said in its appeal of the Tennessee Department of Revenue's decision.\n\nThe appeal was denied because, as the official who ruled in the Department of Revenue's favor wrote: \"'directly' is not an ambiguous term.\" She also noted that it's very clearly spelled out in the state's tax laws that personal checks cannot be used to purchase items for tax-exempt organizations.\n\nThis shouldn't exactly come as a surprise to Hobby Lobby, since it says in its own FAQ:\n\nPlease also note, all tax exempt orders must be placed using a company credit card or a business PayPal account. We are not able to issue a credit for tax if the order is placed with a personal credit card.\n\nYet the company sued Tennessee last week anyway.\n\nIf this doesn't work, perhaps Hobby Lobby will try to claim that paying sales tax is against its founder's religion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hobby Lobby, last seen\u00a0arguing before the Supreme Court\u00a0that the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act violated its religious freedom, has sued the state of Tennessee over a tax bill of $160,000 it doesn't think it should have to pay.", "title": "News, opinion and aggregation on business, politics, entertainment, technology, global and national \u2013 The Wire", "og": {"site_name": "The Wire", "description": "Hobby Lobby, last seen\u00a0arguing before the Supreme Court\u00a0that the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act violated its religious freedom, has sued the state of Tennessee over a tax bill of $160,000 it doesn't think it should have to pay.", "title": "Hobby Lobby Sues Tennessee Over $160K in Taxes and the Definition of 'Directly'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/05/20/AP802591811295/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.thewire.com/national/2014/05/hobby-lobby-sues-tennessee-over-160k-in-taxes-and-the-definition-of-directly/371307/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hobby Lobby, last seen\u00a0arguing before the Supreme Court\u00a0that the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act violated its religious freedom, has sued the state of Tennessee over a tax bill of $160,000 it doesn&#39;t think it should have to pay.", "creator": "@SaraMorrison", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/05/20/AP802591811295/lead_large.jpg", "title": "Hobby Lobby Sues Tennessee Over $160K in Taxes and the Definition of 'Directly'", "site": "@thewire", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "app_id": 192759427473466}, "keywords": "The Wire, TheWire.com, TheWire.com, news, opinion, aggregation, business, politics, entertainment, technology, global, national", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlanticWire"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca991\"", "article_summary": "\"The statute or related regulations do not elaborate upon the meaning of 'directly,'\" Hobby Lobby said in its appeal of the Tennessee Department of Revenue's decision.\nIf this doesn't work, perhaps Hobby Lobby will try to claim that paying sales tax is against its founder's religion.\nThe Tennessee Department of Revenue, which audited Hobby Lobby last November, did not agree.\nBecause the purchases were made, Hobby Lobby contends, to \"directly\" benefit a tax-exempt organization even though that organization didn't buy them, the exemption should still apply.\nIt found that Hobby Lobby owed $136,197.51 plus $27,630.40 in interest."}
