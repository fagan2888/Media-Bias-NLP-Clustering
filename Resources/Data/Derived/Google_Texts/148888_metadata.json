It estimates that Airbnb has spent $25 million on awareness efforts of its own.\n\nAirbnb, meanwhile, is not sitting idly by. The company argues that the Share Better campaign is really just a veiled attempt by the hotel industry to ward off its major competitor.\n\n\"Some misinformed hotels are willing to spend millions of dollars because they don't think regular New Yorkers should be able to share the home in which they live,\" wrote Max Pomeranc, public policy manager at Airbnb, in a Friday blog post responding to the launch of the campaign.\n\nPomeranc wrote that the \"Airbnb community will generate an estimated $768 million in economic activity in New York in 2014 and support 6,600 jobs.\" He added that earlier this year, Airbnb removed many users who were \"abusing our site\" by offering large numbers of poorly rated listings.\n\nHowever, representatives of Share Better maintain that sites like Airbnb contribute to skyrocketing rents and aggravate the city's affordable housing crisis.\n\n\"With the rise of illegal hotels and the influence of corporations like AirBNB, affordable housing in our City is in danger,\" said New York City public advocate Letitia James in a statement. \"A housing model that threatens, instead of supporting affordable housing cannot and will not work for me, or this City.\"\n\nAirbnb declined to comment to The Huffington Post on the Share Better campaign.\n\nHere's a video Share Better released with its launch:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The battle over the so-called sharing economy is heating up as New Yorkers question the impact of home-sharing sites like Airbnb.\n\nA campaign called \"", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-09-15 14:24:45 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The battle over the so-called sharing economy is heating up as New Yorkers question the impact of home-sharing sites like Airbnb.\n\nA campaign called \"", "title": "Airbnb Under Fire From New 'Share Better' Campaign", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/14/share-better-airbnb_n_5818676.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2058164/images/o-SHARE-BETTER-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The battle over the so-called sharing economy is heating up as New Yorkers question the impact of home-sharing sites like Airbnb.\n\nA campaign called \"", "creator": "kevinashort", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2058164/images/o-SHARE-BETTER-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Airbnb Under Fire From New 'Share Better' Campaign", "site": "@HuffPostTech", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-14 14:24:45 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5818676", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "technology", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "new york city affordable housing,hotel industry,share better airbnb,Letitia James,Max Pomeranc,New York City,urban_progress,affordable housing,airbnb,video,illegal hotels,nyc,share better,nyc hotels,Sharing Economy,nyc airbnb", "article": {"section": "Technology", "tag": "new york city affordable housing,hotel industry,share better airbnb,Letitia James,Max Pomeranc,New York City,urban_progress,affordable housing,airbnb,video,illegal hotels,nyc,share better,nyc hotels,Sharing Economy,nyc airbnb", "published_time": "2014-09-14 14:24:45 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-09-17 17:59:06 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Airbnb declined to comment to The Huffington Post on the Share Better campaign.\nThe company argues that the Share Better campaign is really just a veiled attempt by the hotel industry to ward off its major competitor.\nHowever, representatives of Share Better maintain that sites like Airbnb contribute to skyrocketing rents and aggravate the city's affordable housing crisis.\nThe Share Better group, for its part, is using Airbnb horror stories and policy arguments alike to turn public opinion against the popular site.\nThe Share Better coalition says it has $3 million to spend on its ad campaign."}
