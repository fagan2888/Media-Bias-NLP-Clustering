When compared to participants without the variant, those with it estimated lower levels of noise on positive and negative images, which is an indicator of \u201cemotional vividness.\u201d These participants also showed significantly more activity in the amygdala, the brain region responsible for emotional regulation, as well as evaluating pleasure and threat.\n\n\"We thought, from our previous research, that people with the deletion variant would probably show this emotionally enhanced vividness, and they did more than we would even have predicted,\" Todd said in a press release.\n\nTodd added these findings may explain why some people are more susceptible to mental health problems, like post-traumatic stress disorder and any intrusive memories following trauma. Ultimately, the variant is an emotional enhancement; it changes the way people see the world.\n\n\"Emotions are not only about how we feel about the world, but how our brains influence our perception of it,\" Adam Anderson, study co-author and professor of human development at Cornell University, said in a press release. \"As our genes influence how we literally see the positive and negative aspects of our world more clearly, we may come to believe the world has more rewards or threats.\"\n\nResearchers refer readers to French novel Marcel Proust; \u201che bit into the Madeline cookie ad, then wrote seven volumes of memoirs,\u201d they explain. To Todd, this suggests he was \u201cprobably emotionally sensitive\u2026and certainly creative.\u201d Proust may very well have had this genetic variation.\n\nSource: Todd R, et al.
