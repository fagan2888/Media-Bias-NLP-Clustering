I particularly remember one bright and vivacious 12-year-old girl. The two of us sometimes talked during dinner. As we talked, her little brother would buzz around us, using language and gestures more suited to the Navy than to his preschool. Her parents were puzzlingly limited. I would sometimes help them with simple tasks such as assembling their children\u2019s Christmas toys. They angered easily, with predictable results. In the middle of all this family chaos was this calm and resilient young girl. She made me a fantastic playful picture depicting a punked-out teenager with multiple piercings. I had no idea how to help her.\n\nI thought about her as I read the initial installments of Andrea Elliott\u2019s amazing, heartbreaking New York Times profile of another middle-schooler named Dasani, who lives in a homeless shelter called Auburn Family Residence, in Brooklyn\u2019s Fort Greene section. Dasani shares a 520-square-foot room with her parents and her seven siblings. She\u2019s one of 280 children in this huge and forbidding structure. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re sure how to help her, either.\n\n\n\nMost of the money the government spends subsidizing housing doesn't even go to the poor -- much less the homeless.\n\nHomelessness raises many issues that don\u2019t fit cleanly into the grooves of any political parable. Their lives \u2013 and their problems -- are complicated and particular.\n\nDasani\u2019s story is often cited to symbolize New York\u2019s glaring inequality and the shortage of affordable housing in the Big Apple. Fort Greene is one of New York\u2019s most rapidly gentrifying communities. Dasani and her family regularly pass million-dollar row-houses, in streets where low-end groceries coexist with places offering $740 bottles of wines. In a time of unparalleled wealth, rents have been rising while the bottom has fallen out of the low-wage economy. Not coincidentally, the number of homeless New York children has swelled to 22,000. Dasani\u2019s destitute mother, Chanel, and her step-father, Supreme, certainly can\u2019t afford market-rate housing.\n\nBut I\u2019m hard pressed to identify specific ways gentrification has actually worsened Dasani\u2019s immediate predicament. Homeless kids in Detroit or East Saint Louis, Ill., are spared the indignities of gentrification. It\u2019s not clear they are any better off for that. My own brushes with Chicago\u2019s homeless services in decidedly non-gentrified locales haven\u2019t inspired much confidence either.\n\nWith equal justice, this story might be told as an account of the ways that troubled parents damage the lives of their children. The adults in Dasani\u2019s life face a myriad of challenges involving substance abuse and various scrapes with the law. Chanel and Supreme are overwhelmed. They\u2019ve have way too many children with each other and with others. They seem inches away from losing their children, miles away from being able to hold a job or being able to manage daily parenting challenges.\n\nSupreme sells pirated DVDs on the street. He loses a critical tax refund to overdue child support. He rapidly depletes their monthly public assistance checks. Chanel commits petty thefts. In full view of her children, she picks fistfights with disrespectful strangers. She encourages her own daughter to do the same. It\u2019s heartbreaking but unsurprising to see Dasani replicate her mother\u2019s truculent stance, endangering her one way out by earning suspension from school.\n\nThis is also a story of apparent incompetence and mismanagement that allows the facilities at Auburn Family Residence to be so substandard:\n\nCity and state inspectors have repeatedly cited the shelter for deplorable conditions, including sexual misconduct by staff members, spoiled food, asbestos exposure, lead paint and vermin. Auburn has no certificate of occupancy, as required by law, and lacks an operational plan that meets state regulations. Most of the shelter\u2019s smoke detectors and alarms have been found to be inoperable\u2026. [P]repackaged meals are served in a cafeteria where Dasani and her siblings wait in one line for their food before heading to another line to heat it in one of two microwaves that hundreds of residents share. Tempers fly and fights explode. The routine can last more than an hour before the children take their first bite.\n\nThis is baffling and infuriating. To be sure, many services are under-funded in New York and elsewhere. But let\u2019s be clear: New York City spends $800 million on its homeless shelters. How difficult is it to install six more microwave ovens? How can a facility that houses hundreds of people apparently fall so far below reasonable physical standards?\n\nAuburn\u2019s physical challenges pale in comparison with the pathological social environment with which Dasani must contend. There were troubling cases of staff misconduct. The basic lack of security and professionalism were equally toxic. One bureaucratic episode led to the family being \u201clogged out\u201d of the Auburn facility:\n\nThat evening, tired and hungry, [Dasani\u2019s family] returned to their room. It looked ransacked. Almost everything was gone: their clothes, shoes, books, television, toys, Social Security cards, birth certificates, photographs, love letters \u2014 the traces of their existence\u2026. Chanel raced down to the security guards, Dasani chasing after her. \u201cWhere are my mother\u2019s ashes?\u201d she screamed. The story soon emerged: An Auburn employee had paid a resident $10 to clean out the room, as other residents looted the family\u2019s valuables. Everything else was tossed in the garbage. Chanel bolted to the back of the shelter, where a large, metal incinerator holds Auburn\u2019s rotting trash. She waded in, the garbage reaching her waist. She searched frantically. This could not be Joanie\u2019s final resting place, she kept telling herself.\n\nThe ashes were gone. The accompanying crisis set in motion a tragic series of events and decisions that led to Chanel\u2019s arrest for apparently trying to sell drugs to an undercover officer.\n\nNot surprisingly, New York\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services is feared and resented by many families. Elliot writes that the initials ACS \u201care uttered with the same kind of alarm that the C.I.A. can stoke overseas.\u201d\n\nBut what about the perspective of the child welfare professionals charged with the responsibility to support and monitor this family? These men and women includes graduates of programs such as the one in which I teach. What would you do in their place, given the imperfect options? How would you stay grounded and caring if you were forced to bear witness, day after day, to the misfortunes, self-sabotage, and tragedy recounted in this series? Dasani and her siblings might have benefited from some different residential arrangement. Yet they love their parents. And an out-of-home placement is hard to execute without separating siblings who love and depend upon each other.\n\nI study the lives of many men and women who spend much of their lives being labeled as patients or as clients in helping systems. One immediately knows which is which. If you present with tuberculosis or AIDS at the grittiest public health clinic in big-city America, you are likely to receive technically proficient care. Patients generally receive respectful and professional services in relatively well-resourced environments. Too often, if you walk down the street to the closest social service agency or homeless shelter, you will have a very different experience. Clients are treated less respectfully, in a less supported, less professional environment, and thus receive less effective help.\n\nNo one should claim with any confidence that we could have prevented or can solve the myriad problems that beset Dasani and her family. Some of their problems may not be fixable. But there are things we know we can do. We know Dasani could at least go to sleep in a clean and safe place where her family is secure from strangers\u2019 intrusions or predations. So we should at least do that.\n\nHarold Pollack is the Helen Ross professor at the School of Social Service Administration and co-director of the Crime Lab at the University of Chicago.
