Under a dramatic transformation due to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, physicians and hospitals are now being paid based on how well they manage populations of patients, such as receiving bonuses for improving their health while lowering medical costs, and being penalized for providing poor care.\n\nTraditionally, doctors and hospitals were paid for each service they provided, which did little to discourage unnecessary testing and procedures.\n\nThe 126-bed Alexian Brothers Women & Children's Hospital opened in 2013. Loyola is an academic medical center that became part of Trinity Health in 2011. Livonia, Mich.-based Trinity is one of the nation's largest Catholic hospital chains with more than 80 hospitals.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "timeCrawled": "20160525_06:11:48", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "published_at": "2014-8-13", "title": "Alexian Brothers Health System, Loyola University Health System team up to expand pediatric care", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/140819935", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Alexian Brothers Health System, Loyola University Health System team up to expand pediatric care"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Northwest suburban Alexian Brothers Health System and west suburban Loyola University Health System have signed a letter of intent to partner to expand pediatric services.", "title": "Alexian Brothers, Loyola team up to expand pediatric care", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140813/NEWS03/140819935/alexian-brothers-loyola-team-up-to-expand-pediatric-care", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "summary": "Northwest suburban Alexian Brothers Health System and west suburban Loyola University Health System have signed a letter of intent to partner to expand pediatric services.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Loyola University Health System", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b53\"", "article_summary": "Alexian Brothers Health System and Loyola University Health System have signed a letter of intent to affiliate and expand pediatric services, the Catholic systems announced in a statement today.\n\u201cThe Loyola and Alexian Brothers Pediatric Affiliation will provide patients and referring physicians improved access to these high-quality programs in their communities.\nThe systems said they also plan to work with community-based pediatricians to better manage their patients' health.\n\u201cAccess to high-quality pediatric clinical programs in a coordinated network of care is a vision both of our organizations share,\u201d said Daniel Post, Loyola senior vice president of clinical programs and chief business development officer.\nThe 126-bed Alexian Brothers Women & Children's Hospital opened in 2013."}
