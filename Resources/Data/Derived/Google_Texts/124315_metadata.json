Today copyright can last over 100 years. How did things get so off the rails? Well, Hollywood essentially imported European-style copyright \u2014 and does anyone think that Europeans imported copyright as the Founders intended?\n\nRecently, National Review Online published a response to a paper I wrote on copyright reform for the R Street Institute by Steven Tepp, a former lobbyist for Hollywood\u2019s trade organization, the MPAA and a current lobbyist on expanding copyright protection for their lead ally, the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nMy recent R Street report, \u201cGuarding Against Abuse: Restoring Constitutional Copyright,\u201d explored the original public meaning of copyright and how Hollywood\u2019s abuse hurts content creators and society. That report explained how and why the Supreme Court hasn\u2019t been and can\u2019t be the arbiter of enforcing constitutional copyright and analyzed significant research showing how destructive modern \u201cperpetual copyright on the installment plan\u201d has become.\n\nBut instead of defending the enormous federal expansion of copyright terms, or disputing the findings of R Street\u2019s report that unconstitutionally long copyright terms hinder content creation, Tepp\u2019s article just gives us intellectual dishonesty.\n\nThe first piece of spin: Tepp implies that the R Street report\u2019s criticism of longer terms is communitarian because shorter copyright terms would take away copyright holders\u2019 \u201cproperty.\u201d But this is ridiculous: Of course copyright isn\u2019t their property, it\u2019s a government-granted monopoly through a form of, at least effectively, regulation. As RedState wrote in criticizing the disingenuous attack, Tepp is the one \u201cpushing for more government.\u201d\n\nTepp claims that those who want shorter copyright terms have a \u201chostility to private rights in favor of communal property.\u201d Those who wanted shorter copyright of course includep the Founders, who actually enacted copyright terms of 14 years. They were very strong supporters of property rights . . . copyright just wasn\u2019t one of them, which is why they used a different legal term for it: \u201cmonopoly.\u201d If your argument\u2019s logical extension effectively makes the Founders into Marxists or at least communitarians, then you may need to rethink your talking points.\n\nTepp can claim that conservatives love his and Hollywood\u2019s ideas, but the facts suggest otherwise. Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek, Randy Barnett, Steve Forbes, Phyllis Schlafly, and other conservatives have long been supporters of major reforms to copyright to restore the original public meaning. The American Conservative magazine even published a piece called \u201cDo Any Conservatives Strongly Support Today\u2019s Copyright Regime?\u201d when the piece\u2019s author was unable to find any conservatives who support the existing policies. (In The American Conservative\u2019s cover story this month, \u201cGOP: The Party of Innovation,\u201d I call for, among other things, copyright reform.)\n\nTepp is certainly allowed to disagree and argue that some conservatives do support the existing regime, but he instead misleads the reader into believing that instead it is unconservative not to do so. NRO\u2019s Ramesh Ponnuru noted that this is misguided.\n\nThe real failure of Tepp\u2019s response is that he never argues with the R Street report. Despite the the allegation from the report and the related op-eds that the statements of the president of the MPAA, ex-senator Chris Dodd, may be potential evidence of potential quid pro quo corruption, Tepp never even disputes the analysis of Dodd\u2019s comments.\n\nTepp never disputes the analysis of the original meaning of copyright, or explains how a 580 percent inflation in copyright terms, vs. 43 percent inflation for the patent terms authorized in the same clause of the Constitution, is constitutional or good for content creators and the public.\n\nThe original public meaning of the copyright cause \u2014 the direction in the Constitution being to \u201cpromote the progress of Science and useful arts\u201d \u2014 seems to have no connection to modern copyright terms.\n\nTo give Tepp credit, he does provide one argument of substance: He claims that modern extreme copyright terms are constitutional because the Supreme Court said so once in Eldred v. Ashcroft.\n\nBut as NRO\u2019s Jonathan Adler explained, Eldred \u201cmade a mockery of the constitutional text.\u201d And who cares what the Supreme Court ruled once \u2014 what does that have to do with ascertaining the original public meaning of copyright? The Court ruled Obamacare constitutional, does that now mean that Obamacare is a constitutional use of the Commerce power? No. Every branch has a responsibility to interpret the Constitution.\n\nTepp even goes so far as to claim that the R Street report \u201cdismisses [Eldred] as a mere technicality.\u201d The R Street report cites the decision repeatedly and shows how it bolsters our thesis. During the case\u2019s oral argument, as I note in the report, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor said of the policy of continual copyright extension that it \u201cflies directly in the face of what the Framers had in mind, absolutely.\u201d\n\nBut most important, the justices in Eldred implied that they would only strike down copyright terms that were infinite, because the Constitution\u2019s text says \u201cfor limited times.\u201d The Court didn\u2019t really ascertain whether copyright of over 100 years is consistent with the original public meaning of the clause \u2014 that\u2019s Congress\u2019s job. Congress needs to determine whether copyright terms are consistent with the original public meaning to promote the \u201cprogress of Science and useful arts.\u201d\n\nTepp\u2019s citing the modern Supreme Court for an argument that the effectively perpetual terms of today are consistent with the original public meaning of the Constitution isn\u2019t a strong argument when the original public meaning is quite clear.\n\nAnd given that original meaning, it\u2019s a problem that Tepp never counters the central thesis of the R Street report, which is that current copyright terms, of over 110 years, are so long that they hinder content creation, historical preservation, learning, innovation, and free speech.\n\nFuture Disneys, for example, may well not exist under current terms, because the company built their media empire on works in the public domain:\n\nWhat is Hollywood\u2019s response? What is the defense for terms over 110 years? What study shows that this is an appropriate term? In reality, empirical studies suggest that it isn\u2019t. Here is one such assessment:\n\nAmerica is well off the charts for economically sound copyright terms. It would be nice to see an argument otherwise in the congressional record, but unfortunately when Hollywood won copyright extensions, it never had to make the argument because there was no major voice on the other side to \u201cguard [copyright] with strictness aga[inst] abuse\u201d and defend economically sane terms.\n\nTepp\u2019s attack also exposes another misunderstanding of the conservative movement. He contests the use of the term \u201cmonopoly\u201d to describe copyright, instead claim that it\u2019s their \u201cproperty.\u201d Unsurprisingly, this position contradicts the Founders\u2019 own words, legal treatises on copyright, and modern conservative property theory as espoused by economists like Friedrich Hayek. Hayek wrote:\n\nIt seems to me as beyond doubt that in [patents and copyright] a slavish application of the concept of property as it has been developed for material things has done a great deal to foster the growth of monopoly and that here drastic reforms may be required.\n\n\u201cBeyond doubt\u201d . . . except to Hollywood lobbyists, who like to use the term \u201cproperty\u201d even though it\u2019s never been their property, and certainly was not \u201cproperty\u201d to the Founders, economists, or legal scholars who use the term \u201cmonopoly\u201d to refer to copyright. Tepp would know that if he read the R Street report \u2014 there is an entire addendum on this point that he conveniently ignored.\n\nSince Tepp trusts the Supreme Court as the ultimate authority on this issue, they use the term monopoly to describe copyright:\n\nThese are not isolated examples, this is how the Supreme Court refers to copyright.\n\nTepp claims that all property rights are monopolies \u2014 no, not in the same sense. Hayek, other conservative economists, and the Founders make a clear distinction between property rights and other monopolies. Madison has an essay on monopolies mentioning copyright and patents but not real property, because he saw them differently.\n\nWhy is \u201cmonopoly,\u201d the Founders\u2019 term for copyright and patents, a bogeyman to Hollywood? Because Hollywood doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge that copyright is essentially a form of regulation by the government, which is required to be short and limited. Hollywood believes that they can manipulate conservatives who are skeptical of regulation by eliminating the vernacular of the Founders and mainstreaming their term, \u201cintellectual property.\u201d So much for originalism and textualism.\n\nTepp finishes by citing a specific proposal for copyright terms that the R Street report never actually recommends.\n\nThe paper mentions a report I produced while working for the House Republican Study Committee in 2012. Our collective RSC report, on behalf of over 160 conservative members of Congress, called for shorter copyright terms, and then specifically outlined one proposal of what shorter terms, including registration and fees as a disincentive to renewal, could look like. It wasn\u2019t a final bill, just a proof of concept of how this could be done for further discussion. Worse, when Tepp criticized the 2012 report as if it were recommended by the R Street paper, he misstates the numbers badly, massively overstating the costs of the RSC proposal.\n\nThe R Street report mentions the RSC proposal as one idea among a number of proposals, while not endorsing it, because it proved enormously popular among tech groups, young people, and conservatives.\n\nThe proposal that Tepp so gleefully attacked (with falsified numbers) received praise from The American Conservative, Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner, David Brooks and Ross Douthat, Randy Barnett (the architect of the NFIB v. Sebelius Obamacare challenge), the Wall Street Journal, Instapundit, and RedState. This is an idea that\u2019s unconservative?\n\nIt appears that Tepp didn\u2019t really read the R Street report. Given the original public meaning of copyright, I\u2019d like to see him or Hollywood justify modern copyright law: Why are copyright terms over 100 years? Explain why, when patents and copyrights were included in the same clause of the Constitution and originally had the same or similar durations, the patent term has increased by just 43 percent while the copyright term has increased by almost 580 percent. Congress and defenders of existing copyright must justify why a 20-year term can provide sufficient incentive to inventors, but not to writers and artists.\n\nAs James Madison implored, it\u2019s incumbent on us today to \u201cguard\u201d copyright \u201caga[inst] abuse\u201d by special interests \u2014 one of the most obvious examples of modern cronyism.\n\n\u2014 Derek Satya Khanna is a former employee of the Republican Study Committee, a 2013 Lincoln Fellow at the Claremont Institute, has spoken at the Conservative Political Action Conference, and is a fellow with Yale Law\u2019s Information Society Project.

(In The American Conservative\u2019s cover story this month, \u201cGOP: The Party of Innovation,\u201d I call for, among other things, copyright reform.)\n\nTepp is certainly allowed to disagree and argue that some conservatives do support the existing regime, but he instead misleads the reader into believing that instead it is unconservative not to do so. NRO\u2019s Ramesh Ponnuru noted that this is misguided.\n\nThe real failure of Tepp\u2019s response is that he never argues with the R Street report. Despite the the allegation from the report and the related op-eds that the statements of the president of the MPAA, ex-senator Chris Dodd, may be potential evidence of potential quid pro quo corruption, Tepp never even disputes the\u00a0analysis of Dodd\u2019s comments.\n\n#page#Tepp never disputes the analysis of the original meaning of copyright, or explains how a 580 percent\u00a0inflation in copyright terms, vs. 43 percent inflation for the patent terms authorized in the same clause of the Constitution, is constitutional or good for content creators and the public.\n\nThe original public meaning of the copyright cause \u2014 the direction in the Constitution being to \u201cpromote the progress of Science and useful arts\u201d \u2014 seems to have no connection to modern copyright terms.\n\n#ad#To give Tepp credit, he does provide one argument of substance: He claims that modern extreme copyright terms are constitutional because the Supreme Court said so once in Eldred v. Ashcroft.\n\nBut as NRO\u2019s Jonathan Adler explained, Eldred \u201cmade a mockery of the constitutional text.\u201d And who cares what the Supreme Court ruled once \u2014 what does that have to do with ascertaining the original public meaning of copyright? The Court ruled Obamacare constitutional, does that now mean that Obamacare is a constitutional use of the Commerce power? No. Every branch has a responsibility to interpret the Constitution.\n\nTepp even goes so far as to claim that the R Street report \u201cdismisses [Eldred] as a mere technicality.\u201d The R Street report cites the decision repeatedly and shows how it bolsters our thesis. During the case\u2019s oral argument, as I note in the report, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor said of the policy of continual copyright extension that it \u201cflies directly in the face of what the Framers had in mind, absolutely.\u201d\n\nBut most important, the justices in Eldred\u00a0implied that they would only strike down copyright terms that were infinite, because the Constitution\u2019s text says \u201cfor limited times.\u201d The Court didn\u2019t really ascertain whether copyright of over 100 years is consistent with the original public meaning of the clause \u2014 that\u2019s Congress\u2019s job. Congress needs to determine whether copyright terms are consistent with the original public meaning to promote the \u201cprogress of Science and useful arts.\u201d\n\nTepp\u2019s citing the modern Supreme Court for an argument that the effectively perpetual terms of today are consistent with the original public meaning of the Constitution isn\u2019t a strong argument when the original public meaning is quite clear.\n\nAnd given that original meaning, it\u2019s a problem that Tepp never counters the central thesis of the R Street report, which is that current copyright terms, of over 110 years, are so long that they hinder content creation, historical preservation, learning, innovation, and free speech.\n\nFuture Disneys, for example, may well not exist under current terms, because the company built their media empire on works in the public domain:\n\n\n\nWhat is Hollywood\u2019s response? What is the defense for terms over 110 years? What study shows that this is an appropriate term? In reality, empirical studies suggest that it isn\u2019t. Here is one such assessment:\n\n\n\nAmerica is well off the charts for economically sound copyright terms. It would be nice to see an argument otherwise in the congressional record, but unfortunately when Hollywood won copyright extensions, it never had to make the argument because there was no major voice on the other side to \u201cguard [copyright] with strictness aga[inst] abuse\u201d and defend economically sane terms.\n\n#page#Tepp\u2019s attack also exposes another misunderstanding of the conservative movement. He contests the use of the term \u201cmonopoly\u201d to describe copyright, instead claim that it\u2019s their \u201cproperty.\u201d Unsurprisingly, this position contradicts the Founders\u2019 own words, legal treatises on copyright, and modern conservative property theory as espoused by economists like Friedrich Hayek. Hayek wrote:\n\n\nIt seems to me as beyond doubt that in [patents and copyright] a slavish application of the concept of property as it has been developed for material things has done a great deal to foster the growth of monopoly and that here drastic reforms may be required.\n\n\n#ad#\u201cBeyond doubt\u201d\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0except to Hollywood lobbyists, who like to use the term \u201cproperty\u201d even though it\u2019s never been their property, and certainly was not \u201cproperty\u201d to the Founders, economists, or legal scholars who use the term \u201cmonopoly\u201d to refer to copyright.\u00a0 Tepp would know that if he read the R Street report \u2014 there is an entire addendum on this point that he conveniently ignored.\n\nSince Tepp trusts the Supreme Court as the ultimate authority on this issue, they use the term monopoly to describe copyright:\n\n\n\u201cA copyright, like a patent, is a statutory grant of monopoly privileges.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u201cWe have often recognized the monopoly privileges that Congress has authorized . . . are limited in nature and must ultimately serve the public good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe monopoly created by copyright thus rewards the individual author in order to benefit the public.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe limited scope of the copyright holder\u2019s statutory monopoly . . . reflects a balance of competing claims upon the public interest.\u201d\n\n\nThese are not isolated examples, this is how the Supreme Court refers to copyright.\n\nTepp claims that all property rights are monopolies \u2014 no, not in the same sense. Hayek, other conservative economists, and the Founders make a clear distinction between property rights and other monopolies. Madison has an essay on monopolies mentioning copyright and patents but not real property, because he saw them differently.\n\nWhy is \u201cmonopoly,\u201d the Founders\u2019 term for copyright and patents, a bogeyman to Hollywood? Because Hollywood doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge that copyright is essentially a form of regulation by the government, which is required to be short and limited. Hollywood believes that they can manipulate conservatives who are skeptical of regulation by eliminating the vernacular of the Founders and mainstreaming their term, \u201cintellectual property.\u201d So much for originalism \u00a0and textualism.\n\nTepp finishes by citing a specific proposal for copyright terms that the R Street report never actually recommends. \n\nThe paper mentions a report I produced while working for the House Republican Study Committee in 2012. Our collective RSC report, on behalf of over 160 conservative members of Congress, called for shorter copyright terms, and then specifically outlined one proposal of what shorter terms, including registration and fees as a disincentive to renewal, could look like. It wasn\u2019t a final bill, just a proof of concept of how this could be done for further discussion. \u00a0Worse, when Tepp criticized the 2012 report as if it were recommended by the R Street paper, he misstates the numbers badly, massively overstating the costs of the RSC proposal.\n\nThe R Street report mentions the RSC proposal as one idea among a number of proposals, while not endorsing it, because it proved enormously popular among tech groups, young people, and conservatives. \u00a0\n\nThe proposal that Tepp so gleefully attacked (with falsified numbers) received praise from The American Conservative, Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner, David Brooks and Ross Douthat, Randy Barnett (the architect of the NFIB v. Sebelius Obamacare challenge), the Wall Street Journal, Instapundit, and RedState. This is an idea that\u2019s unconservative?\n\nIt appears that Tepp didn\u2019t really read the R Street report. Given the original public meaning of copyright, I\u2019d like to see him or Hollywood justify modern copyright law: Why are copyright terms over 100 years? Explain why, when patents and copyrights were included in the same clause of the Constitution and originally had the same or similar durations, the patent term has increased by just 43 percent while the copyright term has increased by almost 580 percent. Congress and defenders of existing copyright must justify why a 20-year term can provide sufficient incentive to inventors, but not to writers and artists.\n\nAs James Madison implored, it\u2019s incumbent on us today to \u201cguard\u201d copyright \u201caga[inst] abuse\u201d by special interests \u2014 one of the most obvious examples of modern cronyism.\n\n\u2014 Derek Satya\u00a0Khanna is a former employee of the Republican Study Committee, a 2013 Lincoln Fellow at the Claremont Institute, has spoken at the Conservative Political Action Conference, and is a fellow with Yale Law\u2019s Information Society Project. He has never been a registered lobbyist or received money from an organization that lobbies on copyright reform."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40b9\"", "article_summary": "The real failure of Tepp\u2019s response is that he never argues with the R Street report.\nTepp even goes so far as to claim that the R Street report \u201cdismisses [Eldred] as a mere technicality.\u201d The R Street report cites the decision repeatedly and shows how it bolsters our thesis.\nTepp finishes by citing a specific proposal for copyright terms that the R Street report never actually recommends.\nRecently, National Review Online published a response to a paper I wrote on copyright reform for the R Street Institute by Steven Tepp, a former lobbyist for Hollywood\u2019s trade organization, the MPAA and a current lobbyist on expanding copyright protection for their lead ally, the Chamber of Commerce.\nHere is one such assessment:America is well off the charts for economically sound copyright terms."}
