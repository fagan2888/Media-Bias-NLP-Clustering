In the ad, a nameless heroine runs through a dystopian setting, where a face projected onto an enormous screen commands a room full of conformists to obey. Evading police in riot gear, the heroine smashes the screen with a giant hammer, freeing the audience. The message: IBM was 1984\u2019s Big Brother, and Mac was the audacious liberator.\n\nUp on stage, after unzipping the 17-pound computer from a carrying case, plugging it in and turning it on, Jobs showed a feverishly cheering audience screenshots of killer applications like MacWrite and MacPaint. The device\u2014designed around a user-friendly graphical user interface and mouse that debuted in the previous Lisa computer\u2014was remarkably intuitive for non-experts, allowing them to use the mouse to select programs they wanted to run, rather than type in code.\n\nOn the whole, reviewers seem to have been impressed by the the features of the $2,495 machine. But when the New York Times\u2019 Erik Sandberg-Diment first sat down at the computer, he was less than thrilled with the screen size:\n\nThe first thing to take me by surprise as I sat down at the Macintosh was not the mouse pointer used to move the cursor on screen, which everyone has been expecting, but the size of the screen itself. With a scant nine-inch diagonal, it presents a diminutive five-by-seven viewing image. My personal dislike for small screens made me chalk up an immediate minus on the Mac\u2019s scorecard.\n\nAt the time, the Mac\u2019s main rival for the home user market was the IBM PCjr, which had a 14-inch monitor and cost $1,269. Sandberg-Diment also nitpicked other aspects of the Mac\u2019s hardware: the keyboard didn\u2019t include a number pad, and the screen was black-and-white.\n\nTo his credit, though, he appreciated that these concerns were dwarfed by the computer\u2019s unprecedented graphic resolution, intuitive operating system and innovative mouse. A smaller monitor didn\u2019t matter because the computer was so much easier to use.\n\n\u201cThe Mac display makes all the other personal computer screens look like distorted rejects from a Cubist art school,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe fundamental difference between the Mac and other personal computers is that the Macintosh is visually oriented rather than word oriented.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn an era when using a personal computer meant typing in code, the Mac shipped with one of the first commercially-available mouses.
