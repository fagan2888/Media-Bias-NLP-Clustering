I blogged on the weird absence of this fact from the discussion over at The Iona Institute:\n\n\u2026Would anyone relying on the Irish media coverage of the hearings have any way of knowing what (the treaty) actually says? Was there much reporting on the actual legislation or its content? Nope. And without that information, this whole discussion, and all the fulminating and indignation that\u2019s accompanying it, is so much smoke in the wind.\n\nThe whole thing got me thinking about a question that\u2019s bothered me for some time. Why do people involved in public debates often spend so much time arguing about legality as a proxy for arguing about morality?\n\nIn debates over Obamacare\u2019s constitutionality, the lawfulness of \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d and the degree to which the Iraq War violated international law, it\u2019s striking how often \u201cI believe that behaviour/policy x is wrong\u201d coincides with \u201cI believe behaviour x is illegal/unconstitutional\u201d.\n\nI can\u2019t find the link, but when the Supreme Court was considering Obama\u2019s health-care law, Andrew Sullivan said something to the effect that he supported the law, but on balance reckoned it was unconstitutional. But his stance was rare indeed \u2013 people who thought the law was bad policy were much more likely to think it was unconstitutional, and almost none of the law\u2019s supporters shared Sullivan\u2019s take.\n\nSometimes this is just a matter of pragmatism. America\u2019s constitution is (by design) really, really hard to amend, and this can incentivise people to indulge in a bit of creative thinking about what is and isn\u2019t compliant with it.\n\nIf you strongly support gun control, you\u2019ll have a strong incentive to advocate for a reading of the constitution that doesn\u2019t render most firearms laws invalid. If you think Obamacare is going to do irreparable harm to the United States, that will be a powerful (though often subconscious) influence on you to emphasise those bits of the constitution that support your conclusion and to gloss over those that don\u2019t.\n\nBut sometimes pragmatism has little or nothing to do with it. Roe VS Wade is settled law in the United States, and it would be perfectly safe for supporters of the abortion regime it instituted to admit that the legal reasoning behind it was patchy to nonexistent (and some of them have done so). But you\u2019re about as likely to find a pro-choice Senator or a Planned Parenthood staffer saying such a thing as you are to discover the Fourth Secret of Fatima. There\u2019s a very similar dynamic at play in Ireland with the X Case, which legalised abortion on the grounds of suicidal ideation in the pregnant mother). This isn\u2019t about protecting the law from repeal \u2013 it\u2019s about using the legality of something to advocate for its goodness. A rightly-decided Roe has more moral weight than a wrongly-decided one, even if the ultimate conclusion is identical. The idea that the law is good in itself rather than valuable only insofar as it reflects The Good is what I\u2019ve come to call \u201cLaw-of-the-Land-ism\u201d.\n\nTake the recent case of Bogdan Chazan, the Polish doctor fired from his position as director of the ironically-named Holy Family Hospital in Warsaw after he refused to carry out an abortion. Here are Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s thoughts on the matter:\n\n\u201cRegardless of what his conscience is telling him, [a doctor] must carry out the law. Every patient must be sure that [\u2026] the doctor will perform all procedures in accordance with the law and in accordance with his duties.\u201d.\n\nIn Ireland, an appeal to \u201cthe Law of the Land\u201d (and it\u2019s always that exact phrase) is a sort of go-to stock phrase for current affairs anchors and presenters (to say nothing of politicians). They usually present it as though they\u2019re making some great revelation.\n\n\u201cBut if this law requiring priests to break the seal of confession is passed, won\u2019t you have to obey it? It will be the Law of the Land.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you vote against an abortion bill that\u2019s constitutionally mandated? You have to obey the Law of the Land, not the law of the Church.\u201d\n\nThe TD (member of parliament) or priest getting grilled generally responds by trying to argue that what they\u2019re doing actually is in accordance with the law. Now, they\u2019re often right, but I\u2019m just as often left wondering why they don\u2019t just say \u201cwell, if following my conscience is illegal, I suppose I\u2019m just going to have to \u2026 break the law.\u201d\n\nSHOCK! HORROR! Break the law, you say? The Law of the Land? What are you, some kind of theocratic subversive? (Lest you think I\u2019m exaggerating, an independent Senator accused parliamentarians who wanted to vote against abortion legislation of trying to stage a coup.)\n\nWell, no. The thing about religious teaching is that people follow them because they believe they\u2019re true. It\u2019s not like religious people are choosing whether to follow the rules of one authority or another \u2013 they\u2019re choosing between obeying the State and obeying their conscience.\n\nGandhi did not follow the law of the land. Martin Luther King did not follow the law of the land. Nor did Lech Walesa. And here\u2019s the thing: everyone is glad that they didn\u2019t. Everyone concedes that there are some unjust laws worth disobeying \u2013 they only become Law-of-the-Land-ers when they agree with the Law of the Land. So why bother with it at all? Why not just argue that people should do the right thing?\n\nWell, if you\u2019re a social liberal living in a Western democracy, you\u2019ll probably find that as time goes on the law corresponds more and more to your moral worldview. And from there the temptation to invest the law with absolute value is great indeed. Damon Linker nails it:\n\nFrom the dawn of the modern age, religious thinkers have warned that, strictly speaking, secular politics is impossible \u2014 that without the transcendent foundation of Judeo-Christian monotheism to limit the political sphere, ostensibly secular citizens would begin to invest political ideas and ideologies with transcendent, theological meaning. Put somewhat differently: Human beings will be religious one way or another. Either they will be religious about religious things, or they will be religious about political things. With traditional faith in rapid retreat over the past decade, liberals have begun to grow increasingly religious about their own liberalism, which they are treating as a comprehensive view of reality and the human good.\n\nBut even from within this frame it only takes a couple of moments thought to realize that Law-of-the-Land-ism is silly.\n\nImagine if Ireland was the only country in the world that outlawed slavery, and that in doing so it breached several international treaties. Who would seriously argue that Ireland should change its stance?\n\nThe rule of law is essential for any functioning society, and the state should try and ensure that people follow it \u2013 I\u2019m not advocating a return to the wild west.\n\nBut for an individual, if following the law means going against your conscience on some fundamental matter, you have to disobey the law. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being even remotely controversial here \u2013 to support the alternative is to flirt with totalitarianism.\n\nI\u2019m always loath to completely rubbish an idea or an argument that people sincerely hold (hey, I haven\u2019t given up on the possibility that there might be something good in Objectivism!). But the idea that you should ever obey the law of the land if doing so would violate your conscience is self-evidently absurd, and everyone on every side of every argument would be better off jettisoning it.\n\n***\n\nI\u2019m uncomfortable just ignoring the horrible events in the Ukraine and Gaza and breezily writing about other things \u2013 but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m well-informed enough on the underlying dynamics in either situation to write anything particularly useful or constructive. All I can do is pass on the calls for prayer.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Anchoress", "description": "Elizabeth Scalia", "title": "The Good, the Bad and the Legal", "url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/theanchoress/2014/07/20/the-good-the-bad-and-the-legal/", "image": "http://wp.patheos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs/theanchoress/files/2014/07/law_of_land_title.gif", "type": "article"}, "shareaholic": {"site_name": "The Anchoress", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/theanchoress/2014/07/20/the-good-the-bad-and-the-legal/", "article_author_name": "Ben Conroy", "image": "http://wp.patheos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs/theanchoress/files/2014/07/law_of_land_title.gif", "site_id": "20dc2e8a441592127f29c205726b5e75", "article_published_time": "2014-07-20T21:34:29+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-04-29T19:59:57+00:00", "wp_version": "7.6.0.2"}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,patheos.mkt5005.com,www.patheos.com", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc86\"", "article_summary": "byIreland was up in front of the UN Committee on Human Rights last week, and received something of a shellacking for our alleged record of human rights violation.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m being even remotely controversial here \u2013 to support the alternative is to flirt with totalitarianism.\nNo, I was perplexed because the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights doesn\u2019t mention abortion at all, explicitly or implicitly.\nThe idea that the law is good in itself rather than valuable only insofar as it reflects The Good is what I\u2019ve come to call \u201cLaw-of-the-Land-ism\u201d.\nEither they will be religious about religious things, or they will be religious about political things."}
