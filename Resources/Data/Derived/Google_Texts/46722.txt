NEW YORK -- Saturday marked the start of the second enrollment period for people to sign up for federally-mandated health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.

Americans have three months to select a plan before the Feb. 15 deadline.

After a troubled rollout last year, the Healthcare.gov website appears to be functioning relatively smoothly so far this time around.

But the ACA remains a highly controversial law which still appears to be fighting an uphill battle for acceptance with the American public.

The latest Associated Press poll finds given the choice... 56 percent o people in the U.S. would choose to repeal it completely.

Like millions of other Americans, when New York shoe designer Tori Noll tried to enroll on Healthcare.gov a year ago, she got an error message.

"This year, this was no problem at all," Noll says.

Noll was lucky -- some people are experiencing delays. Washington state's health care exchange had to shut down for a few hours.

There were also a few surprises. Noll, who just turned 30, found out her premium is going up.

"They were a lot more expensive than what I had before," Noll says. "More than $100, about $125 more."

And that's per month.

Dan Mendelson helped build the site. Now a consultant, he calls this second roll out a period of adjustment.

"Health insurance companies came to the market last year and made guesses about prices," Mendelson says. "Some priced too high, some priced too low."

The average premium is going up in 24 states, but in at least 11 others, the average premium will be less expensive.

If you're satisfied with your current plan, you don't have to re-enroll, but Mendelson says shop anyway.

"It's quite likely that a person will be able to find a less-expensive plan that is comparable in this market," Mendelson says.

Tori Noll hopes to qualify for some exemptions to lower her cost, but says knowing she has insurance -- just in case -- is worth the cost.
