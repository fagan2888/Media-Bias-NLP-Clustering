Also, the chance to conquer over 9 million user-generated levels certainly adds to the replayability.\n\nFar Cry 4: Limited Edition (Ubisoft, Rated Mature, $59.99) \u2014 One of the most exotic first-person shooters in the medium returns with a new, open world adventure just in time for the holiday season to make its case for a place on a gamers gift list.\n\nA player becomes the American Ajay Gahl. Looking to spread his departed mother\u2019s ashes in her native land, the mountain kingdom of Kyrat (an homage to Nepal), he gets caught up in a civil war as factions fight against the brutal, drug-dealing despot Pagan Min.\n\nAmidst sprawling, gorgeously panoramic terrain (near impossible to not constantly stop and admire, especially the snowy mountains), Ajay must shape his fate while using a potent arsenal and environment to his advantage.\n\nAn abundance of missions and side quests meld with sandbox-style exploration to keep the player busy.\n\nDuring any moment in the game, he may be riding an elephant to cause rampant destruction, prodding tigers to attack enemies by tossing raw meat near them, climbing a tower to shut down radio propaganda, racing quad bikes, flying around on a Buzzer and hang glider to pick off foes or learning about the dangers of angry honey badgers, up close and personal.\n\nThe Limited Edition includes an additional trio of single-player missions, access to the impaler harpoon gun and invites to send out to 10 friends to try the game\u2019s co-op mode for free.\n\nNote: To survive and succeed in \u201cFar Cry 4,\u201d Ajay will often have to kill wild animals, often dangerous, to craft new supplies. The act can be a bit off-putting and too graphic for more sensitive gamers. Heck, even Ajay moans his disgust during the process.\n\nMadden NFL 15 (EA Sports, Rated Everyone, $59.99) \u2014 The definitive virtual football experience makes for a great interactive gift for the professional football fan in the family\n\nHigh-definition visuals lead the way and capture every staple of the National Football League in action.
