Truett Cathy and Dan T. Cathy inside a Chick-fil-A store. ( Chick-fil-A )\n\nJoin us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.\n\nChick-fil-A is finally crossing the road.\n\nThe iconic chicken chain, as well known for its conservative heritage as its savory eats, is recalibrating its moral and culinary compass. It wants to go from old school to almost cool. It wants to evolve from a place where gays once picketed to a place where they\u2019ll feel comfortable going to eat. It wants to broaden the brand as it expands nationally and plows into the Millennial-driven urban arena.\n\nAbove all: It wants to be a serious player on fast food\u2019s biggest stage.\n\nCEO Dan Cathy\u2019s comments condemning gay marriage in 2012 set off a store picketing and a social media firestorm. Now he has backed away from such public pronouncements that mix personal opinion on social issues with corporate policy.\n\n\u201cAll of us become more wise as time goes by,\u201d he said, apologetically. \u201cWe sincerely care about all people.\u201d\n\nWhile Cathy\u2019s comments didn\u2019t hurt short-term business\u2014and even helped it\u2014Chick-fil-A executives recognize they may have done longer-term damage to the brand\u2019s image at the very time it was eyeing major growth outside its friendly Southern market.\n\nThe national growth is about to go into overdrive\u2014and it has a huge, new product platform behind it. Its biggest-ever new product roll-out will be announced Tuesday: a grilled chicken line for which the company has spent the past 12 years testing more than 1,000 grilled chicken recipes and developing such super-secret grilling equipment that executives won\u2019t let it be photographed.\n\nChick-fil-A\u2019s food, long-regarded as extra savory but nutritionally naughty, is going through an industry unprecedented \u201ccleaning\u201d cycle, with an ultimate aim of improving its brand image with trend-setting Millennials.\n\nLast month, it announced plans to sell only antibiotic-free chicken within five years. It\u2019s testing the removal of high fructose corn syrup from all dressings and sauces and artificial ingredients from its bun.\n\nThe once-tiny, regional chain just surpassed giant KFC to become the nation\u2019s largest chicken chain in domestic sales. But along with this sales and geographical growth comes a new social consciousness.\n\nThat\u2019s not by accident, said Christopher Muller, professor of hospitality at Boston University. \u201cThe politics of their Southern Baptist values will not transcend their core markets,\u201d he said.\n\nChick-fil-A\u2019s socially conservative agenda, which formally led the company to donate millions to charitable groups opposed to gay marriage, has been tempered. This, just as the company aims to expand into Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. Southern hospitality must give way to urban reality as the 1,800-store chain moves to compete with big city success stories like McDonald\u2019s, Panera Bread and Chipotle.\n\nIf nothing else, Cathy has listened. In 2012, Cathy not only heard from some unhappy consumers about his comments against gay marriage, but also from some store operators and employees. Now, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to leave it to politicians and others to discuss social issues.\u201d\n\nOne past critic has even become an unlikely fan. \u201cDan and I have an ongoing friendship,\u201d said Shane Windmeyer, executive director of the gay rights advocacy group Campus Pride. \u201cI am appreciative for the common ground we have established in treating all people with dignity and respect\u2014including LGBT people.\u201d\n\nWhich means Chick-fil-A can focus on what matters most: the food and growth. The privately held company, whose sales last year reached $5.1 billion\u2014up 9.3 percent, reports the research firm Technomic\u2014may rank among the most intriguing growth stories in fast food. Imagine this: A typical Chick-fil-A racked up annual sales of about $3.3 million last year, while a typical McDonald\u2019s posted sales of about $2.5 million. Never mind that Chick-fil-A is closed Sundays.\n\n\u201cThe next big thing is urbanization,\u201d says Cathy, 61, who tools around on his Harley-Davidson in his spare time. \u201cThat\u2019s where the future is heading.\u201d\n\nSo, the company that has spent 68 years building its stores inside suburban malls and near big-box retailers is mostly tossing out those plans. Now it wants to focus on big cities and big-city dwellers.\n\n\u201cThe challenge in business is to stay ahead of the curve,\u201d Cathy says. For Boomers, fast food was all about taste and price, he says. But for Millennials, he notes, it\u2019s also about local sourcing, product quality and worker rights. For them, he said, \u201cit\u2019s not just a product story any more \u2014 but the whole story.\u201d\n\nWhich is why Chick-fil-A removed yellow dye from its chicken soup late last year. And it\u2019s why the chain has just begun testing a line of fruit smoothies made with spinach and carrots.\n\nThis is the same company whose chief spokesman is a cartoon cow whose singular message for almost two decades has never changed: \u201cEat Mor Chikin.\u201d And it\u2019s the company in which 93-year-old founder, S. Truett Cathy, Dan\u2019s father, still keeps an expansive office, replete with photos of himself with George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, Billy Graham and Pat Boone.\n\nBut if Chick-fil-A could frame a new photo of who matters most to the company, it might be someone such as 23-year-old Kelli Means-Cheeley. The Atlanta resident and recent college graduate stopped by a bustling Chick-fil-A near Atlanta\u2019s airport and offered a thumbs-up after sampling the new grilled chicken. Healthy food ingredients are critical to Means-Cheeley, but, she says, \u201cwhat\u2019s also important to me is taste.\u201d\n\nA new line of iceberg lettuce-less salads, developed right before the company opened its new test kitchen, boosted annual salad sales by 50 percent to $250 million, said David Farmer, vice president of product strategy and development.\n\nUntil now, the key rule for new products was that they had to be \u201ccravable,\u201d Farmer said. While they still have to be cravable, he says, there\u2019s an increasing emphasis on them also being healthy.\n\nThat, says Cathy, has prodded Chick-fil-A to be \u201cmore transparent.\u201d Last year it began offering \u201cback stage tours\u201d of its restaurants\u2014where regular customers can request tours of the kitchens.\n\nUltimately, the chain plans to make that new transparency more literal.\n\nThey want to open up the kitchens and allow customers to watch dough being rolled and salads being freshly chopped.\n\nChick-fil-A will open 108 restaurants this year\u2014most of them urban and a good chunk of them in New York City.\n\nThe new urban locations will have much more natural wood. And some of the urban chefs are even replacing their old uniforms with snazzy chefs coats.\n\nThis new Chick-fil-A is striving to be very different from what was. \u201cWe\u2019re one foot out of fast food,\u201d Faulk said.\n\nCopyright 2014 Religion News Service.
