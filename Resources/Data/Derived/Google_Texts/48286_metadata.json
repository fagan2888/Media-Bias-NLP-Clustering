As a result, the organization\u2019s efforts were not considered charitable enough to achieve tax exempt non-profit status.\n\n\u201cThe promotion of health has long been recognized as a charitable purpose,\u201d the IRS said. \u201cHowever, not every activity that promotes health supports tax exemption.\u201d\n\nAccording to the IRS, the ACO was incorporated as a nonprofit corporation for charitable, scientific or educational purposes. It was supposed to promote the interest of a not-for-profit healthcare system. However, the organization did not engage in the direct delivery of medical care or provide health services to the general public. Although the ACO was classified as a public charity, its efforts appeared to be motivated by commercial factors. The organization served its own private interest, the IRS said.\n\nThe organization still functioned as an ACO in many ways, the IRS acknowledged. \u201cYou have established data infrastructure for collecting, aggregating and analyzing data, including an electronically integrated clinical information data warehouse and analysis, a patient satisfaction survey tool, and clinical network infrastructure necessary for tracking provider performance and sharing clinical data,\u201d the letter said. The ACO also linked rewards and penalties when providers met quality goals and performance measures.\n\nThe IRS also stated that the ACO claimed to make efforts toward furthering Triple Aim healthcare reform goals that were established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).\n\nAccording to the IRS, an organization may be exempt from tax if it is organized and operated exclusively for \u201creligious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary or educational purposes.\u201d No part of earnings should benefit an individual or private shareholder, the IRS explained.\n\nThe ACO was made up of physicians employed by the healthcare system and its affiliates as well as unaffiliated, independent, community-based providers. The unaffiliated providers made up about half of the organization.\n\n\u201cAn individual practice association (IPA) that provides health services through written agreements with health maintenance organizations (HMO) does not qualify for exemption from federal income tax as a social welfare organization,\u201d the IRS said as it cited a rule.\n\nThe IRS\u2019 adverse determination could potentially impact other ACOs.\n\n\u201cThis adverse determination could lead some providers to choose so-called \u2018dual purpose\u2019 ACOs, formed to participate in both the MSSP and commercial ACO arrangements, which could raise potential Antitrust and MSSP regulatory concerns.\u201d said law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath in a blog.\n\nThe number of MSSP ACOs has increased steadily over the first few years of the value-based reimbursement program. Hopefully, ACOs that join MSSP arraignments will keep their focus on serving the needs of patients rather than their own private interests.", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to the IRS, commercial accountable care organizations are not permitted to claim charitable tax exemptions.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/irs-commercial-aco-cant-claim-charitable-tax-exemptions", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Money_Picture.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "IRS: Commercial ACO Can\u2019t Claim Charitable Tax Exemptions"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to the IRS, commercial accountable care organizations are not permitted to claim charitable tax exemptions.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Money_Picture.jpg"}, "title": "IRS: Commercial ACO Can\u2019t Claim Charitable Tax Exemptions", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "An unnamed accountable care organization (ACO) will not be able to claim charitable tax exempt status since its role centered on facilitation instead of the provision of care, the IRS said in a determination letter this month.\n\u201cHowever, not every activity that promotes health supports tax exemption.\u201dAccording to the IRS, the ACO was incorporated as a nonprofit corporation for charitable, scientific or educational purposes.\nAs a result, the organization\u2019s efforts were not considered charitable enough to achieve tax exempt non-profit status.\nAlthough the ACO was classified as a public charity, its efforts appeared to be motivated by commercial factors.\n\u201cThe promotion of health has long been recognized as a charitable purpose,\u201d the IRS said."}
