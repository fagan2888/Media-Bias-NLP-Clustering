The horrible ObamaCare enrollment numbers, particularly among millenials? That got just a measly 10 seconds on the Big Three evening and morning shows.\n\n\n\nOn March 11 the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported that about 940,000 people signed up for ObamaCare in February, which brought the total enrollment figure to 4.2 million which was far short of the seven million goal, set by HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, by the end March. That bit of bad news was briefly touched on by only CBS Evening News anchor Scott Pelley in his introduction to a March 11 segment on Obama\u2019s Funny or Die video: \u201cThe White House told us today about four-and-a-quarter million Americans have signed up for ObamaCare. The administration had hoped to have more than five-and-a-half million by now.\u201d\n\n\u2666 CBS\u2019s Pelly hailed that the video had \u201cworked\u201d as it \u201cbecame the number one reason people visited HealthCare.gov today.\u201d Pelley\u2019s colleagues, on the March 11 CBS This Morning, dutifully hailed the video as a success. After co-host Norah O\u2019Donnell observed that \u201cIt was interesting to hear some of the President's top advisers saying they\u2019d chosen to do this because they\u2019re trying...to sign up younger people for health care coverage, \u201d fellow co-host Gayle King pronounced: \u201cAlright, mission accomplished.\u201d After a Bill Plante segment about the video, on the March 12 CBS This Morning, King effused: \u201cBravo to Zach and bravo to the President.\u201d Later in the show King even personally congratulated senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett: \u201cValerie, let\u2019s go to Funny or Die. It\u2019s certainly gone viral, which I think you guys are doing the hula over there.\u201d\n\n\n\nCBS led all networks in amount of time devoted to the video at 8 minutes, 36 seconds.\n\n\n\n\u2666 NBC came in second, devoting a total of 4 minutes, 28 seconds to Obama\u2019s mock-interview with the Hangover star. On the March 11 Today show Al Roker praised the President\u2019s \u201ccomedy chops.\u201d Social media host Carson Daly gushed: \u201cIt\u2019s over six minutes long...all of it is really funny.\u201d Later that night, on the March 11 NBC Nightly News, anchor Brian Williams did his part to drive his viewers to the video as he reported: \u201cIt seems to have worked. Inquiries to the now-functional website spiked today. Rather than try to explain what's going on here, you can see the entire video on our website tonight, NBCNews.com.\u201d Not a single NBC anchor or reporter mentioned the bad enrollment numbers.\n\n\n\n\u2666 ABC came in a close third, spending a total of 3 minutes and 26 seconds on what ABC World News anchor Diane Sawyer called a \u201cbold move\u201d by the White House. On the March 11 World News Sawyer announced: \u201cAnd next, a bold move on the battle over ObamaCare. Even if you\u2019re President of the United States, when you want the attention of young Americans, you put your dignity on the line and go where they laugh.\u201d Earlier that morning ABC\u2019s Laura Spencer, on the March 11 Good Morning America, also did the White House\u2019s bidding as she pushed her viewers to go watch the video: \u201cIt\u2019s great, you got to check it out. It\u2019s \u2013 the President also takes time to reach out to young viewers, though, encouraging them to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\n\nNo one at ABC mentioned the bad February enrollment figures for ObamaCare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.mrc.org/media-reality-check/nets-spend-100-times-more-coverage-plugging-obama-joke-interview-low-enrollment", "image": "http://www.mrc.org/sites/default/files/images/TwoFerns.jpg", "site_name": "Media Research Center", "description": "This week, anchors and reporters practically fell over themselves laughing at Barack Obama\u2019s Funny or Die collaboration with comedian Zach Galifianikis as they hailed the ObamaCare promotional video w", "title": "Nets Spend 100 Times More Coverage on Plugging Obama Joke Interview Than Low Enrollment!"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Bias by Omission,obamacare,Zach Galifianakis", "revisit-after": "1 day", "description": "This week, anchors and reporters practically fell over themselves laughing at Barack Obama\u2019s Funny or Die collaboration with comedian Zach Galifianikis as they hailed the ObamaCare promotional video was \u201cgreat\u201d and urged viewers \u201cyou gotta check it out!\u201d", "copyright": "1998-2013"}, "article_summary": "\u2666 NBC came in second, devoting a total of 4 minutes, 28 seconds to Obama\u2019s mock-interview with the Hangover star.\nThat got just a measly 10 seconds on the Big Three evening and morning shows.\nOn the March 11 World News Sawyer announced: \u201cAnd next, a bold move on the battle over ObamaCare.\nThe horrible ObamaCare enrollment numbers, particularly among millenials?\nIt\u2019s certainly gone viral, which I think you guys are doing the hula over there.\u201dCBS led all networks in amount of time devoted to the video at 8 minutes, 36 seconds."}
