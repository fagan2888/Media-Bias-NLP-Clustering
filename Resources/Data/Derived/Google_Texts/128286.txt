The House could vote on legislation related to the nation’s opioid epidemic in May, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy wrote in an Independent Journal op-ed published Thursday.

Committee work on the bills should wrap up this month, he said. McCarthy referenced several bills that are in the works, including one from Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) and Larry Bucshon (R-Ind.) that would improve opioid abuse treatment and prevention efforts. Other bills McCarthy referenced would improve guidelines for physicians, help infants born to opioid-addicted mothers and improve the country’s drug laws.

“We want to build on efforts to prevent addiction and treat those suffering, crafting legislation that will gather bipartisan support and get signed into law,” McCarthy wrote. “The President’s own proposals to combat opioid addiction demonstrate that there is ample opportunity to reach a bipartisan consensus, and the Senate’s recent work to combat opioid addiction shows bicameral legislative interest.”

The Senate passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act earlier this year, which authorized funding for new federal programs to improve treatment and prevention programs. McCarthy credited Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), both vulnerable Republicans up for re-election, for their work on the bill.
