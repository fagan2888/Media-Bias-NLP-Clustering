A new study of our Facebook posts offers some insight.\n\nFacebook Data Science sought to learn what Americans are thankful for, according to their Facebook posts. The study examined \u201ca set of anonymized English status updates that contained \u2018grateful\u2019 or \u2018thankful,\u2019 as well as the word \u2018day\u2019 preceded or followed by a number. These status updates were then aggregated and processed by a text-clustering algorithm so we could identify what people were grateful for.\u201d\n\nOverall, Facebook users are most likely to post that they are thankful for their friends, followed by family and health. Topics such as \u201cjob\u201d and \u201cthe roof over my head\u201d also made the top 10.\n\nWhen posts were separated by gender, men were most grateful for their wife, and women were most grateful for their husband and children. The top 10 topics for men included \u201cfootball\u201d and \u201cthe internet\u201d and the top 10 for women included \u201cwine\u201d and \u201cfur babies\u201d [pets].\n\nFacebook also analyzed what residents of each state report being thankful for. The map reflects what topics are most associated with each state, not what was most frequently posted.\n\nWeather and geography are reflected on the map. Residents of southwestern states such as Arizona are thankful for rain, and residents of coastal states such as Florida and Maine are thankful for \u201cliving near the beach.\u201d\n\nBible Belt states are thankful for things like \u201cmercy,\u201d \u201cgod\u2019s forgiveness,\u201d and \u201csalvation.\u201d Utah and Idaho are thankful for the \u201cheavenly father.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndiana and Colorado are thankful for \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d and Oklahoma is thankful for \u201cwork ethic.\u201d\n\nWebsites also make an appearance on the map: California, Delaware and Virginia are thankful for YouTube, Vermont for Pinterest, New Hampshire for Netflix and Kansas for Google.\n\nIronically, Facebook itself doesn\u2019t appear on the map. According to the results of the study, \u201cFacebook was mentioned more often than any other form of social media and uniformly enough to not show up on the map for any particular state.\u201d\n\nThe topics in statuses that received the most likes include \u201csobriety,\u201d \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201cwife.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also examined how age affects what Facebook users post about, and the frequency they post about the same topic.\n\nAccording to Facebook, most users whose posts were analyzed identified as 28-55 years old on their profiles, and 90 percent identified as female.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "What are Americans thankful for?
