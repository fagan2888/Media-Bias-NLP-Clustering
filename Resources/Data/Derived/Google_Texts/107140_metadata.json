Mike Huckabee, who might throw his hat into the ring for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, does not like people who do not like guns.\n\nIn his new book, God, Guns, Grits and Gravy, the ordained Baptist minister and son of the south says, \u201cClearly, city slickers who are more afraid of guns than of the criminals who might use them have a serious mental condition rendering them incapable of critical thinking.\u201d\n\nRelated: Mike Huckabee: 13 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Him\n\nHuckabee, who recently left Fox News, has long defended the Second Amendment. He grew up among hunters in Hope, Arkansas, with guns at home and drills from his father on how to use them safely. \u201cI\u2019m a hunter. I hunt ducks, deer, and turkey and have also hunted antelope in Wyoming and pheasant in Iowa. But the Second Amendment isn\u2019t about hunting. [It\u2019s] about preserving all the rights we possess as citizens.\u201d\n\nHuckabee 59, could appeal to a large conservative segment of the population, including evangelicals and libertarians who think the government is intruding on their lives. If his current 43-city book tour is any indication, his campaign might be on the ascendancy, especially since Romney has withdrawn from the race.\n\nHe has been attracting big crowds in some of the early primary states. As one South Carolina resident and fan of the southern evangelical put it, \u201cHe\u2019s the next president.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Budget Strategy Taxes Rich to Give to Middle Class\n\nThe former 2008 presidential candidate once again seems to reject the long election battle that would lie ahead. He attacks east- and west-coast liberals in his book who have an issue with guns: \u201cAnyone who thinks we can simply ban guns and \u2013 poof \u2013 make them all disappear, even from the hands of criminals, is deluded. Maybe on drugs.\u201d And, \u201cThe real \u2018gun nuts\u2019 are the ones who know the least about firearms or freedom, but who most want to make sure the good guys are unarmed when the bad guys decide to murder a few.\u201d\n\nThe slap at those who worry about the prevalence of guns and violence in America won\u2019t win him urban fans but he\u2019s clearly not concerned. The three \u201cnerve centers\u201d of American culture \u2013 New York City, Washington, D.C., and L.A. \u2013 should be known as \u201cBubble-ville,\u201d he says, as compared to his own \u201cBubba-ville.\u201d\n\n\u201c[New York] is crowded, loud, hurried, intense, and its streets seem filthy,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t find a Walmart in Manhattan and people stare at my cowboy boots when I\u2019m on the subway.\u201d\n\nRelated: Battleground Governor Kasich Draws Battle Lines\n\nUnlike other Republicans with new books, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Huckabee spends far less time spelling out policy prescriptions for America than letting it fly on the current state of American culture as he sees it. As discussions about the 2016 presidential race heat up, here are other quotes from Huckabee\u2019s book:\n\n\u201cIf ego could be turned into electricity, Washington, D.C. would have electric power in unlimited levels and never have a power outage\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t put pepper sauce on their black-eyed peas or order fried green tomatoes for an appetizer, I probably won\u2019t relate to them without some effort.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost people living in my world just want to be left alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing an economist must be interesting since they are paid handsomely to be wrong most of the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernment doesn\u2019t do things well even when it takes its sweet time. When it acts in haste, it can really screw things up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen someone says \u2018There ought to be a law,\u2019 it\u2019s going to cost you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe IRS is a criminal enterprise, it systematically violates our constitutional rights, and it has to go\u2026 It\u2019s the closest thing America has to a goose-stepping Gestapo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, poverty is a condition for poor people, but it\u2019s a career for those who administer the programs and who would be put out of business if they were actually successful in eradicating poverty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need more money in government; I do think we need more morality and decency in our culture.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Arkansas Gov.", "title": "Huckabee Lets Loose on Gun Control Liberals", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/01/Huckabee-Lets-Loose-Gun-Control-Liberals", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01052015_Mike_Huckabee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/01/Huckabee-Lets-Loose-Gun-Control-Liberals", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01052015_Mike_Huckabee.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former Arkansas Gov.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Mike Huckabee, who might throw his hat into the ring for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, does not like people who do not like guns.\nHe grew up among hunters in Hope, Arkansas, with guns at home and drills from his father on how to use them safely.\nI hunt ducks, deer, and turkey and have also hunted antelope in Wyoming and pheasant in Iowa.\nIf his current 43-city book tour is any indication, his campaign might be on the ascendancy, especially since Romney has withdrawn from the race.\nHe has been attracting big crowds in some of the early primary states."}
