Sure, they all had their run, but science has determined they\u2019re not as guilty of making us fat and unhealthy as once thought.\n\nToday\u2019s No. 1-with-a-bullet dietary bad boy is sugar.\n\nUnfortunately, as more people try to avoid sugar, some are passing on fruit, too. And that\u2019s a mistake.\n\nAvoiding sugar can be hard, since so many foods sneak in added sugar. These include no-duh! things like candy bars and soda, as well as more surprising culprits like spaghetti sauce (7 grams of added sugar per serving), instant oatmeal (12 grams) and sports drinks (14 grams).\n\nFederal guidelines call for kids to eat no more than 6 to 9 teaspoons of sugar a day. Yet a bowl of Froot Loops and an 8-ounce glass of orange juice \u2014 a typical meal fed to kids in the national school breakfast program \u2014 contains 11 teaspoons of sugar. So a kid has blown through his limit and it\u2019s not even 10 a.m. yet.\n\nBut avoiding fruit because of sugar would be like throwing the good-for-you baby out with the sugary bath water.\n\nWhile fruit does indeed contain sugar \u2014 that\u2019s why it tastes so good \u2014 there\u2019s no proof that eating it has the same detrimental health effects as eating processed foods with added sugar.\n\nIn fact, a recent study found that increased fruit consumption is neatly tied to reductions in both body weight and risk of obesity-related diseases.\n\n\u201cSugar in foods is absorbed by the body within minutes,\u201d explained Georgiana Gross, faculty dietitian at the University of Texas Health Science Center\u2019s School of Dentistry. \u201cThat quickly raises blood sugar levels and can, in time, lead to diabetes. Plus, the body uses stored vitamins and minerals to digest sugar, so it truly is empty calories.\u201d\n\nWhat makes fruit different is the fiber it contains.\n\n\u201cThe fiber makes eating fruit OK,\u201d said Dr. Robert Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nAccording to Lustig, the fiber in fruit slows the rate that sugar is absorbed so blood sugar rises more gradually. This also gives the good bacteria in your gut more time to consume the sugars themselves, keeping them happy and healthy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/07/hfnutri29.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaeee\"", "article_summary": "According to Lustig, the fiber in fruit slows the rate that sugar is absorbed so blood sugar rises more gradually.\nWhile fruit does indeed contain sugar \u2014 that\u2019s why it tastes so good \u2014 there\u2019s no proof that eating it has the same detrimental health effects as eating processed foods with added sugar.\nAvoiding sugar can be hard, since so many foods sneak in added sugar.\n\u201cThe fiber makes eating fruit OK,\u201d said Dr. Robert Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California, San Francisco.\nBut avoiding fruit because of sugar would be like throwing the good-for-you baby out with the sugary bath water."}
