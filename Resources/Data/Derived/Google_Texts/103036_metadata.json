But since 2010, full-time jobs are up 7.6 million, and part-time jobs have declined by more than 900,000.\u201d\n\nThis Republican myth has been debunked regularly but that doesn\u2019t stop them from trudging it out at the corner of embarrassed and desperate, thus Mort Zuckerman dragged out the mold yesterday for the Wall Street Journal, aka, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Other Foxian Arm.\n\nSo Thompson goes in for the kill. All it took was a graph.\n\nHere\u2019s a screengrab but you have to go to The Atlantic to play with it:\n\n\n\n(Data fromFRED Thompson notes, \u201cY-axis in 1,000s, again.\u201d )\n\nThompson pointed out several facts to bear in mind regarding the part-time versus full-time discussion, one of which was via a document produced by the Fed, which explained that \u201ccurrent levels of part-time work are largely within historical norms, despite increases for selected demographic groups, such as prime-age workers with a high-school degree or less.\u201d Of course, Republicans don\u2019t \u201cbelieve\u201d in the Fed. They think the Fed is part of an evil Marxist plot to takeover America with marketplace competition like Obamacare. So these facts probably won\u2019t get you anywhere in a \u201cdebate\u201d with true believers.\n\nIn September of 2013, we debunked the fevered hopes of a flailing party after House Majority Leader-elect (then Whip) Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) tweeted, \u201c90% of the jobs created have been part-time. Obamacare creates a part-time economy, part-time opportunity, and a part-time America.\u201d Not true.\n\nJust a month prior, PolitiFact had taken on this hazy right wing fantasy when they rated as true a claim by Alan Krueger, the chairman of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, that most jobs created since passage of the health care law have been full-time positions.\n\n\u201c(S)ince the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions.\u201d The statistics show that 87 percent of the increase in jobs between March 2010 and July 2013 consisted of full-time jobs. A shorter time frame would show the opposite pattern, but on the numbers, Krueger is right. We rate the claim True.\n\nIt\u2019s mid 2014 and Republicans haven\u2019t changed their claims one bit. No need to let reality intrude on their pleasant dreams of America failing.\n\nRepublicans like to infuse the image of the President with their idea that under him, America has become lazy and due to his healthcare reform law, America is so lazy that it\u2019s broken. Thus, they call him the part-time President and slobber over their fictional idea that the first black president has created a nation of lazy Americans who are only working part-time. Because, you know, they are so not racists.\n\nYet these same Republicans justify the laziest people in government \u2014 the US House of Representatives. The GOP-led House is the place legislation goes to die and crazy extremist go to be enabled. Meanwhile Republicans cut the working days down each year, demanding their same salary for doing nothing and instead spend 30%-70% of their time fundraising. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor rewarded the least popular House in history by cutting their number of scheduled work days even further than the already whittled 126 in 2013 to 113 in 2014.\n\nNice work if you can get it.\n\nThe truth is that Americans are hurting for well-paying jobs. The President has been urging Congress to follow his lead and raise the minimum wage, but Republicans are against this previously bipartisan action. They claim they are sure it will kill job creation, but that has been debunked by the Economic Policy Institute, who pointed out that in fact not only would it be good for the economy, but it will also have a positive effect on job creation.\n\nAmericans aren\u2019t lazy and neither is President Obama. House Republicans? They\u2019re as lazy and entitled as they come. They are also the only people in this scenario who willfully reduced their own working days until they are part-time legislators, but demanded the same pay for less work. That finger they\u2019re pointing at Obama? Four more are pointing back at them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans love to accuse President Obama of creating a 'part-time America', but in fact 'since 2010, full-time jobs are up 7.6 million, and part-time jobs have declined by more than 900,000.'", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Republicans love to accuse President Obama of creating a 'part-time America', but in fact 'since 2010, full-time jobs are up 7.6 million, and part-time jobs have declined by more than 900,000.'", "title": "The Republican Myth of Obama's 'Part-Time America' Gets Destroyed With One Graph", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/07/14/obamas.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-14-at-12.10.59-PM-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-14T13:20:33+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2014-07-14T13:14:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-14T13:20:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c0d\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare creates a part-time economy, part-time opportunity, and a part-time America.\u201d Not true.\nDerek Thompson slayed the Republican talking point about Obama\u2019s \u201cPart-Time America\u201d today in The Atlantic in an article entitled, \u201cHere\u2019s What Obama\u2019s \u2018Part-Time America\u2019 Really Looks Like.\u201dHe opened with a bang, \u201cThe president\u2019s critics love this talking point.\nHouse Republicans?\nThus, they call him the part-time President and slobber over their fictional idea that the first black president has created a nation of lazy Americans who are only working part-time.\nThey think the Fed is part of an evil Marxist plot to takeover America with marketplace competition like Obamacare."}
