Asa Hutchinson, hospitals all over the state will suffer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in the same situation,\u201d Bryan Thomas said. \u201cIt will effect every hospital in Arkansas.\u201d\n\nArkansas Works would continue what is currently known as the private option, the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program, which uses federal dollars to help purchase private health insurance for people earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level. The General Assembly in a special session approved the enabling legislation by votes of 70-30 in the House and 25-10 in the Senate.\n\nThose numbers, however, fall short of the 75 percent needed in each chamber to approve funding for the program and on Thursday, the senate turned down a bill to fund it.\n\nThomas said that without the legislation, JRMC stands to lose about $10 million next year.\n\nThat\u2019s because patients who previously did not have insurance are currently covered under the private option, but if that ends, those patients would not be able to pay medical bills.\n\n\u201cIt would be a significant setback,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nAccording to figures provided by the state, more than 267,000 Arkansas residents are covered under what is now the private option.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dan Rahn, the chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, said during an appearance in Pine Bluff that UAMS would lose about $65 million, which would affect not only patient care but education and research.\n\nScott Barrilleaux, the CEO of Drew Memorial Hospital in Monticello, said Thursday his hospital would likely lose between $1.3 and $1.4 million.\n\n\u201cNow that we\u2019ve been able to collect data for a few years, we know how the private option affects hospitals like Drew Memorial Hospital \u2014 It\u2019s doing exactly what it should,\u201d he said in a news release posted on the hospital\u2019s website Wednesday. \u201cIn its first year, the private option led our hospital\u2019s written off, uncollectable accounts to decrease by more than $1.3 million.\u201d\n\nThomas said that if the legislation does not pass, there could be \u201csome changes in the level of service\u201d provided by JRMC.\n\n\u201cSome adjustments would have to be made,\u201d he said.\n\nBarrrilleaux said it \u201cwould be a double-edged sword\u201d if funding for the program is not approved, with 8 percent of the population losing insurance on Jan. 1, 2017.\n\nHe said the hospital would see a large increase in bad debt, which would have a negative effect on the immediate area because federal funds, which were once used to offset the cost of providing health insurance \u2014 would no longer be available.\n\n\u201cOur hospital would lose on two fronts \u2014 increased uninsured patients and no money to cover the costs associated with providing that care,\u201d he said in the news release. \u201cAs a top employer in Drew County, our financial health helps our local economy. Moreover, people losing insurance might choose to avoid or postpone medical treatment, continuing our negative regional health statistics and continuing to drive the cost of care upward.\u201d\n\nBarrilleaux said Drew Memorial employs about 350 people.\n\nThomas said JRMC employs about 1,500 people, and failure to adopt the plan could not only affect them, but could alter the plans to eventually replace the current building.\n\n\u201cIf it is not approved, we would see a darkly negative impact on health care,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nState Sen. Stephanie Flowers (D-Pine Bluff) is one of those who supports the plan and on Friday had some harsh words for fellow senate members who opposed it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cFor them to be against health care for the working poor is disgraceful and says something about their morals and ethics.\n\n\u201cPeople who want to bash the Affordable Care Act don\u2019t realize what good it has done the state,\u201d Flowers said.\n\nFlowers said a $30 million grant from the Obama Administration made it possible for UAMS and rural hospitals in the state to link up through a telemedicine system and doctors in those rural hospitals can get specialized help from doctors at UAMS at very little cost.\n\n\u201cA lot of those rural hospitals benefit without a lot of costs,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t get it at all.\u201d\n\nFlowers said the Senate will try again on Tuesday and said Hutchinson was working hard to try and change the minds of at least two of the senators who voted no.\n\nShe also said most of those who voted against the program live in Northwest Arkansas, which is getting a medical school and a new hospital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they want to cut themselves off from the rest of the state,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cThe people in those districts need to make their voices heard. It\u2019s all about hating Obamacare. That\u2019s the only logical thing I can make out of it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The interim CEO of Jefferson Regional Medical Center said if the Arkansas General Assembly fails to pass legislation funding the Arkansas Works program proposed by Gov.
