On October 2, hunter and rock musician Ted Nugent went on Facebook and published a post critical of President Obama. Nugent, 66, called the president "a pathological liar & America hating goon" and made references to Obamacare, Benghazi, the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal and the IRS abuse scandal. "The guy is a bad man & psychotic liar," Nugent wrote.

"Heartbreakingly the president of the United States is a pathological liar & America hating goon. Oh, and BTW, if you like your Dr, you can keep your Dr. And NO, we will not provide security for our fellow Americans in ultra-dangerous terrorist regions like Benghazi. And yes, Brian Terry WAS murdered with a gun that the US AG & obama smuggled to mexican drug gangs. And yes, his IRS bitch did criminally abuse power & lie. And yes, he calls gay NBA guys heroes but doesnt call real heroes that sacrificed for freedom. The guy is a bad bad man & psychotic liar."

In the same post Nugent also republished an October 2 editorial by Alan Korwin, the author of several books on gun laws. Referring to a speech President Obama made in the wake of an October 1 shooting that resulted in the deaths of nine people on a college campus in Oregon, Korwin wrote, "The President made a repeated and critical mistake: New laws affecting all Americans will not affect the lone psychotics who commit these atrocities."
