Gary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion plan, at least as far as Senate President Wayne Niederhauser is concerned.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake, has introduced SB77, which is full Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going nowhere,\u201d Niederhauser, R-Sandy, told UtahPolicy.\n\nNo great surprise there.\n\nBut last year Sen. Brian Shiozawa, R-Cottonwood Heights, introduced Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah \u2013 which would draw down hundreds of millions of dollars in federal Medicaid matching funds into a Medicaid expansion plan.\n\nIt passed the Senate, with help from Senate Democrats, but stalled in the Utah House after the GOP caucus refused to support it.\n\nAn attempt by House Democrats to place the senator\u2019s plan into a House Medicaid expansion bill failed after a short, heated debate on the House floor last session.\n\nSo Healthy Utah, in that vote, failed on the House floor.\n\nShiozawa is not re-introducing his bill this year.\n\nRep. Raymond Ward, R-Bountiful, has introduced HB302, which is Healthy Utah with some minor modifications, this session.\n\nA doctor, Ward supported Healthy Utah last year.\n\nSaid Niederhauser, \u201cWe will wait\u201d to see what the House sends the Senate in the way of Medicaid expansion this year.\n\n\u201cNo, we won\u2019t debate\u201d Healthy Utah again, there is no point, said the Senate president, because it appears there are not the votes for it in the House.\n\nAnd another Healthy Utah debate would just take the time that can be dedicated to bills that may actually pass the Legislature.\n\nWard told UtahPolicy that Healthy Utah \u201cshould be an alternative\u201d before the House.\n\nBut if he were a betting man, he wouldn\u2019t put any money on HB302.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville, has yet to formally introduce his GOP House alternative \u2013 which admittedly will not take federal Obamacare expansion funds and will not provide health insurance to as many low-income Utahns than Healthy Utah would.\n\n\u201cI will enthusiastically support\u201d the Dunnigan bill if HB302 doesn\u2019t pass, said Ward.\n\n\u201cIt is by far better that we do something\u201d in Medicaid expansion \u201cthan nothing \u2013 which is what we are doing now,\u201d Ward said.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There will be no debate in the Utah Senate this year on GOP Gov.
