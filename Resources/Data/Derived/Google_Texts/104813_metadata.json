Sean Duffy (R-WI) confirms that Congress will hold hearings on Operation Choke Point in February.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOn Thursday Breitbart News cited sources reporting that Duffy, the new chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee, planned on holding such hearings in his subcommittee early next month.\n\n\u201cOperation Choke Point began as a means of combating fraudulent businesses \u2014 but evolved into an arbitrary list of businesses targeted by bureaucrats in the DOJ and banking regulators purely on moral grounds, backed by no legislation,\u201d Fox News explained on Friday.\n\nRep. Duffy told the network that the administration is targeting businesses it doesn\u2019t approve of. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is they put short-term lenders out of business, gun dealers out of business, ammunition manufacturers out of business. Because in America, if you can\u2019t bank, you can\u2019t do business,\u201d he said.\n\nAs first reported at Breitbart News on Tuesday, Mike Schuetz, a former Wisconsin state employee who once protested in Madison against Governor Scott Walker\u2019s program to reduce the powers of state public employee unions, opened a bank account at the Heritage Credit Union for his legal gun dealership in Hawkins. A week after he opened that account in November, officials at the Heritage Credit Union told Schuetz they had to close his bank account due to pressure from the National Credit Union Administration.\n\nSchuetz has extensive audio recordings of officials with the Heritage Credit Union that support his claim.\n\nThe CEO of Heritage Credit Union later told Breitbart News that its initial decision to close down Schuetz\u2019s bank account was not due to NCUA pressure, and that Mr. Schuetz is now eligible to reopen his bank account.\n\nBrian Wise, senior adviser to the United States Consumer Coalition, which has led the fight to expose and end the Obama administration\u2019s Operation Choke Point abuses, scoffed at the denials from both the Heritage Credit Union and the National Credit Union Administration that Obama administration pressure had nothing to do with the closing of Schuetz\u2019s bank account.\n\nSchuetz subsequently opened a bank account for his gun dealership at a bank that is not regulated by the National Credit Union Administration.\n\nBut Rep. Duffy warns that the ability of business owners in industries targeted by Operation Choke Point for shut down on grounds of morality\u2013gun dealers, pay day lenders, and other\u2013to maintain bank accounts at financial institutions other than credit unions will last only until the relevant financial regulatory authorities start applying the same pressure tactics that the National Credit Union Administration applied to Heritage Credit Union.\n\nBreitbart News first broke the story of the existence of the Obama administration\u2019s Operation Choke Point in January 2014. At the time, Breitbart News reported that the objective of the operation was \u201cto destroy sectors of the private lending industry,\u201d as well as gun and ammunition dealers.\n\n\u201cThe story of Mike Schuetz is only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d the United States Consumer Coalition\u2019s Wise told Breitbart News on Saturday in an exclusive interview.\n\n\u201cWe believe there are thousands of other victims who have lost their bank accounts due to Operation Choke Point but don\u2019t realize that this is the reason. I trust that with Congressman Duffy\u2019s leadership on this issue in Congress, those responsible for this misguided attempt to eliminate these businesses will be held accountable,\u201d Wise said.\n\n\u201cThe United States Consumer Coalition will continue to work with Mr. Duffy and lead the charge to stop Operation Choke Point,\u201d Wise promised.\n\nSources tell Breitbart News that Representative Duffy may not be the only Congressional committee chairman who will hold hearings on the Obama administration\u2019s controversial Operation Choke Point.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Subcommittee Chairman Sean Duffy Confirms Congressional Hearings Will be Held on Operation Choke Point", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Subcommittee Chairman Sean Duffy Confirms Congressional Hearings Will be Held on Operation Choke Point", "title": "Subcommittee Chairman Sean Duffy Confirms Congressional Hearings Will be Held on Operation Choke Point - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/handguns-display-reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/17/subcommittee-chairman-sean-duffy-confirms-congressional-hearings-will-be-held-on-operation-choke-point/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Subcommittee Chairman Sean Duffy Confirms Congressional Hearings Will be Held on Operation Choke Point", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/handguns-display-reuters.jpg", "title": "Subcommittee Chairman Sean Duffy Confirms Congressional Hearings Will be Held on Operation Choke Point - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Heritage Credit Union, Mike Schuetz, National Credit Union Administration, Operation Choke Point, Representative Sean Duffy, United States Consumer Coalition,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "United States Consumer Coalition", "published_time": "2015-01-17T10:38:41-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f37\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRep.
