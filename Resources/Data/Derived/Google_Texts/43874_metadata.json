Nevertheless, the Coalition for Court Transparency, representing several journalism groups, has written to Roberts asking that the court make an exception for the marriage arguments.\n\n\u201cThe country, if not the whole world, is watching to see what will happen,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAnd yet they cannot truly be watching, because live audio-visual coverage of Supreme Court proceedings is still barred. And while the cases affect millions of people's everyday lives, only those present in the courtroom that day will get to see and hear the oral arguments as they happen.\u201d\n\nThis page long has supported televising all arguments in the court. We find utterly unpersuasive the claim, recently recycled by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, that cameras in the courtroom would impel lawyers and justices to grandstand. Histrionics are mostly wasted in appellate courts, where there is no jury, and lawyers ham it up at the risk of alienating the judges who hold their clients' fate in their hands.\n\n\n\nThe other claim is that broadcasters will air sensationalized sound bites. But that already happens when the court releases same-day audio from high-profile cases. For example, radio and TV reports on arguments about the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act endlessly recycled Justice Antonin Scalia's comparison of a health insurance mandate to a law requiring people to buy broccoli. (Apparently justices can grandstand without the prod of a camera.)\n\nIdeally the justices would overcome their institutional inertia and allow TV cameras at all oral arguments. But if they won't go that far, they should at least televise the marriage arguments, either live (as the coalition requests) or after a slight delay. This would not only offer Americans an up-close view of a historic hearing but also would test the justices' assumption that cameras would change the nature of their work.\n\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "End the cameraphobia in the Supreme Court", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "In his 2014 end-of-the-year report on the federal judiciary, Chief Justice John G.
