He explodes rhetorical nuclear bombs on his opponents, only to feign outrage when his victims respond in kind, or in many cases, with relative spitballs.\n\nTake his defund Obamacare effort. The tactic to eliminate President Obama\u2019s health care law had zero prospect of success, which Cruz undoubtedly knew despite what he sold the conservative grassroots. Nonetheless, Cruz and his allies declared that anyone who didn\u2019t join them in their legislative Charge of the Light Brigade in effect supported Obamacare and were part of the Republican \u201cSurrender Caucus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am perpetually frustrated by what seems to be the \u2018Surrender Caucus\u2019 in the Congress, the group that just wants to give in,\u201d Cruz said on Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show July 25, \u201cthe group that just want us to give in and who say, well, President Obama will never give in on his top priority. Well, why is it that he gets to hold his principles, and it\u2019s assumed that we have to roll over, when the American people are with us?\u201d\n\nBy Cruz\u2019s definition, Republican senators like Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and congressmen like Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, two of the staunchest opponents of Obamacare from the very beginning, are actually de facto supporters of the president\u2019s health care law. Why? Because they live in reality and understand that Obamacare can\u2019t be defunded while Democrats control the Senate and the presidency.\n\nWhen Cruz started to be criticized for pushing his impossible strategy, he acted like he couldn\u2019t imagine why his fellow Republicans would dare say a nasty word about him.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear on the intraparty fight: I have not said an ill word about any of my colleagues,\u201d Cruz said on Laura Ingraham\u2019s show July 31, denying he ever used the term \u201cSurrender Caucus,\u201d perhaps not knowing radio shows are recorded for posterity. \u201cI have not said an ill word about any of my colleagues, and they have said some pretty nasty words about me.\u201d\n\nNot only did Cruz use the term to describe Republicans who questioned his Defund effort, but so did his chief of staff, who Cruz tried to throw under the bus in the Ingraham interview.\n\nThen there was Cruz\u2019s 21-hour speech on the Senate floor in which he compared those who opposed his Defund strategy to \u2014 wait for it \u2014 Nazi appeasers.\n\n\u201cIf we go to the 1940s, Nazi Germany \u2014 look, we saw it in Britain. Neville Chamberlain told the British people: Accept the Nazis. Yes, they will dominate the continent of Europe, but that is not our problem. Let\u2019s appease them. Why? Because it can\u2019t be done. We cannot possibly stand against them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn America there were voices who listened to that; I suspect the same pundits who said it couldn\u2019t be done. If this had happened in the 1940s, we would have been listening to them. Even then they would have made television. They would have gotten beyond the carrier pigeons and letters and they would have been on TV saying: You cannot defeat the Germans.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jamie Weinstein", "description": "Ted Cruz likes to pretend he is above the fray of Washington bickering, focused on large issues and too big to engage character assassination.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Ted Cruz\u2019s \u201caw shucks\u201d act is wearing thin.
