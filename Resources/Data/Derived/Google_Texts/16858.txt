State officials have told insurers who sell health plans to small businesses, individuals and students that they can't exclude coverage of care related to gender transition.

Gay-rights advocates applauded the directive, which was outlined in bulletins published by the Maryland Insurance Administration in December.

"We applaud the Maryland Insurance Administration for prohibiting this discriminatory exclusion that has become a fixture in health insurance plans and that has significant harm to the transgender community," said Patrick A. Paschall, executive director of FreeState Legal and Equality Maryland, which has been advocating for the change.

Agency officials said it brings the state into compliance with meet federal guidelines. They said there was no public opposition.

The directive will apply to health plans that go into effect in 2017 and are regulated by the state agency. That includes those plans that are sold directly to consumers or on the state's online health exchange under the Affordable Care Act.

"Transition-related care exclusions serve no other purpose than to discriminate against transgender people," Paschall said. "To deny life-saving medical care to an entire population based solely on the fact that they identify as transgender is not only unconscionable but, we believe, a violation of federal law."

It's not clear how many people would benefit from the change to policies.

A spokeswoman for the League of Life and Health Insurers of Maryland, the state's trade association representing companies writing life and health insurance, could not be reached to comment.
