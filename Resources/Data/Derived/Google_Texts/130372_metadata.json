The list \u201cfeatures medical schools with amazing architecture, structural prowess, campus integration, technological superiority and many other factors that were considered,\u201d Online Masters in Public Health says.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how it describes the Case medical school\u2019s campus, which was established in 1843 but hardly looks its age:\n\n\n\nLike a picture out of the Jetsons, the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine is a space-age, stunning campus that boasts genius design and gorgeous landscaping. Students can enjoy the beautiful surroundings at a lunch in the garden food court or on a leisurely stroll through the eye-catching parks. Lake Erie is right next door, and the school is in close proximity to a variety of culture-rich opportunities.\n\n\n\nCase Western Reserve University is the alma mater of several illustrious developers: Paul Buchheit, creator of Gmail; Craig Newmark, mastermind of craigslist.org; and Peter Tippett, originator of Norton AntiVirus. In 2002, the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine became only the third college ever to receive the top review possible from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, the organization that grants accreditation to U.S. medical degree programs.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s only one other Ohio medical school on the list: the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center, which ranks 22nd.\n\n\n\nTopping the list is the Duke University School of Medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis and that\n\nUp for a challenge: A Case Western Reserve connection to health care of a different kind is explored in this Washington Post analysis of a challenge to Obamacare that the Supreme Court takes up this week.\n\n\n\nThe case, King v. Burwell, was driven by a critique from Case Western Reserve law professor Jonathan Adler and Michael F. Cannon, a health policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the justices interpret a six-word phrase in the Affordable Care Act could determine its fate.From the story:The law, adopted in 2010, says the federal government can pay subsidies to help people afford insurance bought through \u201can Exchange established by the state.\u201dBut two-thirds of the states have opted against setting up their own exchanges, and as a result, more Americans have been buying insurance through the federal insurance marketplace. Now, opponents of the law will make their case to the high court that Americans who are not using the state exchanges are ineligible for subsidies. And if they win, insurance premiums could skyrocket and many people might drop their coverage \u2014 possibly undermining the whole health-care program.And as the justices weigh whether the health-care law in fact has a fatal glitch, one of the key questions is this: Why did the Obama administration rule-writing officials in the Internal Revenue Service and its parent agency, the Treasury Department, ultimately interpret the language the way they did?Adler has been appearing frequently in public to talk about the case. He notes in this post that today, Monday, March 2, he\u2019ll be debating King with professor Eric Segall of Georgia State University at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law. This debate is co-sponsored by the Penn Law chapters of the American Constitution Society, Federalist Society and the University of Pennsylvania Law Review.Forbes once again released its list of the world\u2019s billionaires, and once again, you\u2019re not on it. (Unless you\u2019re Dan Gilbert or Jimmy Haslam.

His fortune grew $3.2 billion since last year to $79.2 billion.It doesn\u2019t seem terribly likely that an Ohioan will be nominated to run for president as a Republican in 2016, but a vice presidential slot is another matter Plugged-in Politico.com reporter Mike Allen\u2019s popular \u201cPlaybook\u201d feature lists the top eight GOP VP prospects, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Rob Portman both make it.Kasich is ranked No. 6, mostly for strategic reasons: \u201cIf Republicans get Florida, Dems HAVE to take Ohio,\u201d Allen writes.Portman, at No. 7, seems like an afterthought: \u201cIf Kasich doesn\u2019t vet,\u201d according to the piece.The top five choices, according to Politico.com, are Sen. Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, Condoleezza Rice and \u2014 wait for it \u2014 Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also can follow me on Twitter for more news about business and Northeast Ohio.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Case is No. 16 in the Online Masters in Public Health's ranking of the 50 most beautiful medical school campuses in the United States.
