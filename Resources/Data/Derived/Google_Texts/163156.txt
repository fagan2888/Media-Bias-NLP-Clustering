× GQ offers Boulder congressman makeover for ‘worst Congressional style ever’

BOULDER, Colo. — Working in politics, Rep. Jared Polis from Boulder may be used to hearing criticism from others. However, he received public feedback of a different variety this week.

On Tuesday, a reporter tweeted a CSPAN screen grab of the Democratic congressman donning a bow-tie, polo-shirt and blazer combination on the congressional floor.

The tweet sparked a slew of social media buzz, leading to one GQ Magazine writer to call out Polis’ look as the “worst congressional style ever.”

Dennis Tang, the GQ writer, offered Polis a makeover from the publication.

Apparently, it was an offer he couldn’t refuse.

Polis tweeted back to GQ, accepting the fashion makeover and saying he is “looking forward to the consultation.”

Thank you @GQMagazine @GQFashion for the offer to help… I accept and am looking forward to the consultation!! — Rep. Jared Polis (@RepJaredPolis) February 25, 2014

Polis’ outfit from Wednesday also made the social media rounds for his ‘unconventional’ fashion sense.
