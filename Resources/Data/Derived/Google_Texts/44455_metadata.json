They won their first game without scoring an offensive touchdown. They won an NFL record 13th consecutive divisional road game at Kansas City after trailing by 14 points. Given the shocking nature of the victory, shouldn\u2019t Rihanna, Kanye West and Paul McCartney record \u201cEightNineSeconds\u201d to fumbling? A game like last Thursday\u2019s deserves a nickname.\n\nPerhaps \u201cBurnt Ends.\u201d\n\nThere were plenty of seething Chiefs fans following the loss, as evidenced by the strewn trash and broken bottles in the Arrowhead Stadium parking lot. They deserve to be mad. The Broncos? Well, they are balancing a perfect record with an unnerving blemish.\n\nLost in the endless chatter about Peyton Manning\u2019s age and arm strength is the underwhelming performance of the offensive line. The premise of marrying Manning\u2019s no-huddle, shotgun acumen relies on Denver\u2019s ability to run the ball. Through two games, they are running in place, or worse, into tacklers in the backfield.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, the starting linemen represent five of the team\u2019s six lowest-graded players on offense. A learning curve was expected, but not this steep. Opponents have sacked Manning seven times. He was sacked 17 times last season. The Broncos enter Sunday averaging 2.7 yards per carry, second worst in the NFL. And there\u2019s no blaming Montee Ball anymore.\n\nIn coach Gary Kubiak\u2019s 20 seasons as an offensive coordinator and coach, his rushing attack has averaged a 10th-place ranking.\n\nSo, yeah, this is jarring. But it isn\u2019t a reason to abandon the running game. Though known as a players\u2019 coach, Kubiak boasts success because the players know he is consistent and tough.\n\n\u201cIt just has to be demanded,\u201d said Kubiak on reviving the ground game. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a physical football team, then you\u2019ve got to stay committed. It\u2019s not good enough right now. I am very disappointed. I look at myself.\u201d\n\nKubiak accepts blame for mistakes. This fix, however, lies with the men in the trenches. The addition of Evan Mathis, an all-pro performer, was supposed to stabilize the group. The Ravens and Chiefs are stout up front, but the Broncos shouldn\u2019t have this many mistakes and missed blocks. Mathis insists the problems involve technique issues that can be addressed through additional reps this week.\n\n\u201cWe have what it takes personnel-wise (to be a good running team). And everyone is committed to it. We haven\u2019t been successful. But I don\u2019t hear anybody complaining,\u201d Mathis said. \u201cEveryone is accountable to what they are doing and doing everything they can to correct it.\u201d\n\nThe linemen represent a proud group. The performance the past two weeks stings. That\u2019s a good sign. But admission remains hollow without improvement. The Broncos have forged a fascinating story in two games. Regardless of Denver\u2019s nastiness on defense, it won\u2019t matter if the Broncos can\u2019t run well. It sets up play action \u2014 bringing the tight ends back into play \u2014 and opens up routes Denver currently can\u2019t use because teams aren\u2019t respecting quick pops from C.J. Anderson or Ronnie Hillman.\n\nThe Broncos are 2-0. The temptation to use Manning\u2019s offense lingers for fans, but it\u2019s a short-term solution. To play their best when it matters most, the Broncos can\u2019t pass on running the ball.\n\n\u201cWe want to contribute in a more meaningful way. We all know how to run the ball. With a combination of extreme focus and extreme willingness, we are going to get this done,\u201d right tackle Ryan Harris said. \u201cWe want to get this taste out of our mouth.\u201d\n\nTroy E. Renck: trenck@denverpost.com or twitter.com/troyrenck\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nRex Ryan, coach, Buffalo Bills\n\nWhen: Rex Ryan became a dead man walking with the New York Jets when the team failed to address its offensive shortcomings. Typical of a Ryan-led team, the defense remained stout, creating problems with exotic looks. But they weren\u2019t the 1985 Chicago Bears, and even that unit would struggle to make Geno Smith look passable. The Jets fired Ryan after six seasons. He won four playoff games his first two seasons then posted a record 12 games below .500 over his final four years. Just when it looked like Ryan might end up in Atlanta, Buffalo scooped him up.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: After a season-opening ear-boxing of the Indianapolis Colts, the Bills host the defending champion Patriots. They heightened animosity by selling football pumps at the team store.\n\nBackground: Ryan brings energy, enthusiasm, banter and bravado. The brash talk lacks substance when directed at the Patriots. Ryan fashions himself as a Patriots-killer, but he owns a 4-9 record against New England. Ryan, for all the bluster, is 1-7 since 2011 against New England. That\u2019s the thing about rivalries. They don\u2019t exist if one team always wins.\n\nRenck\u2019s take: The AFC East would be a lot cooler if any team emerged as a threat to the Patriots. They represent football\u2019s villains. Bills beastly defensive tackle Marcell Dareus blurted, \u201cDon\u2019t nobody like the Patriots. Let\u2019s just be honest about it now. Put it out there.\u201d OK, I did. Now put it on them or pipe down.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Renck: Denver Broncos\u2019 offensive improvement begins with linemen", "title": "Renck: Denver Broncos\u2019 offensive improvement begins with linemen", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/19/renck-denver-broncos-offensive-improvement-begins-with-linemen/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-19T16:40:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:33:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Troy Renck"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe have what it takes personnel-wise (to be a good running team).\nBut it isn\u2019t a reason to abandon the running game.\nIn coach Gary Kubiak\u2019s 20 seasons as an offensive coordinator and coach, his rushing attack has averaged a 10th-place ranking.\nLost in the endless chatter about Peyton Manning\u2019s age and arm strength is the underwhelming performance of the offensive line.\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, the starting linemen represent five of the team\u2019s six lowest-graded players on offense."}
