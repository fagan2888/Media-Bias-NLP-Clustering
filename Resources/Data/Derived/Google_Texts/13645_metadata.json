Rand Paul thrill a rapt audience of conservative activists with a romantic speech extolling liberty and slamming President Obama for failing to dismantle the post-9/11 national security state. I remember how quiet and still the crowd was while Paul spoke, and I remember how that surface-level calm was periodically interrupted with wild cheers whenever Paul delivered an especially well-crafted applause line.\n\nIn reference to mass surveillance, indefinite detention and secretive drone strikes on American citizens, for example, Paul quoted William Lloyd Garrison, the famous abolitionist, and asked the congregation, \u201cWill you, America\u2019s next generation of liberty lovers, will you stand and be heard?\u201d The answer was a resounding yes.\n\nBut as much as they loved imagining themselves as the modern heirs to a 19th century liberation movement that reached its apogee through the expansion of presidential and federal power, these assorted conservatives and libertarians were even more thrilled by the sections of Paul\u2019s speech castigating President Obama for being insufficiently dedicated to protecting Americans\u2019 civil liberties. \u201cI don\u2019t question President Obama\u2019s motives,\u201d Paul said, \u201cbut history will record his timid defense of liberty.\u201d\n\nA specific instance of timidity that Paul had in mind was Obama\u2019s decision to sign the NDAA, despite his misgivings that it infringed on the right of habeas corpus. \u201cWhen Congress passed legislation allowing for the indefinite detention of an American citizen without a trial,\u201d Paul said, \u201c[Obama] shamefully signed it while promising not to use such a power.\u201d In Paul\u2019s eyes, this was clearly not enough. \u201cA great president,\u201d he claimed, \u201cwould have risen to the occasion. Instead of merely suggesting that he wouldn\u2019t use this dreaded power, a great president would have taken pen in hand and vetoed this abomination.\u201d\n\nCPAC agreed; a great president (maybe a President Paul?) would ignore the politics, brush off the fear-mongers and simply do what was right. \u201cSome things are worth fighting for,\u201d Paul said, before reminding the crowd that he had filibustered against targeting Americans with drones and sued the president over the excesses and usurpations of the National Security Agency. \u201cIt is decidedly not a time for the faint of heart,\u201d he warned. \u201cIt is a time for boldness and action. The time is now. Stand with me. Let us stand for liberty.\u201d Paul then left the stage, carried to the exit on a wave of applause emanating from the hundreds of conservative activists, all of whom were on their feet.\n\nIt was an inspiring moment. But as I watched the CPAC attendees talk amongst themselves about how wonderful Paul\u2019s speech had been, I imagined how a candidate Chris Christie or Ted Cruz would savage Paul as soft on terror in a GOP presidential primary, and I was reminded, in a completely different context, of that infamous Bill Clinton quote: \u201cThis whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nWatching this week as the right worked itself into a jingoistic and vengeful fury over Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, I couldn\u2019t stop turning back to that fairy tale \u2014 the belief that the hysteria, paranoia and fear that defined American politics in the immediate years after 9/11 was a thing of the past; the confidence that U.S. politics had mellowed and matured, that demagoguery over Islamic terrorism was no longer a central component of the GOP\u2019s campaign playbook. Back when Benghazi was, nearly two years later, still dominating the news cycle, I thought this was fanciful. But today, in the wake of attempts to portray Bergdahl as a traitor-turned-jihadist, and in response to one breathless report after another parroting Taliban propaganda as if it were news, it seems to me to be downright absurd.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As fellow GOPers tried to revive hysteria of Bush years, supposed civil libertarian sat silent -- exposing his lie", "author": "Elias Isquith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As fellow GOPers tried to revive hysteria of Bush years, supposed civil libertarian sat silent -- exposing his lie", "title": "Rand Paul knocked off his high horse: How he lost moral high ground in attack on Bergdahl", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/rand_paul_knocked_off_his_high_horse_how_he_lost_moral_high_ground_in_attack_on_bergdahl/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/bergdahl_paul.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As fellow GOPers tried to revive hysteria of Bush years, supposed civil libertarian sat silent -- exposing his lie", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/bergdahl_paul.jpg", "title": "Rand Paul knocked off his high horse: How he lost moral high ground in attack on Bergdahl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Rand Paul knocked off his high horse: How he lost moral high ground in attack on Bergdahl", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 9/11, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Bowe Bergdahl, Civil Liberties, CPAC, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Editor's Picks, George W.
