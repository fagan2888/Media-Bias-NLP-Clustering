Part of the instruction as to how to sign up for the programs will come from the hospitals.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of people at Jefferson Healthcare who are working to adapt to the new laws, and they are doing a great job of it,\u201d said Matt Ready, who is vying with Mark Mauney for Position 3 on the hospital commission.\u201cBut it will be a huge adjustment. It takes the monster of a health care system that we already have and turns it into a different monster.\u201dReady said a little-known fact about the program is that while diagnosis is free, treatment is not.Ballots in the all-mail Nov. 5 election will be distributed Oct. 16.In addition to the two contended seats, Nikki Hay is unopposed for Position 2 commissioner.The candidates have formed slates by which the incumbents and the challengers are campaigning together.This sets up an experience-versus-change option for the voters, they said.And the Chamber of Commerce audience was given a dose of the option.\u201cDuring the implementation of Obamacare, there will absolutely be bumps along the road, and Congress will look to trusted leaders, like me, to help smooth the journey,\u201d Buhler said.\u201cMy opponent, while altruistic, is woefully misguided. My mandate as commissioner is not to change the law but to work within the system for the betterment of Jefferson Healthcare.\u201d\u201cMy opponent has claimed that I am out of touch with reality,\u201d Hensel said.\u201cI think this is an example of her failure to branch out of her own life and understand how many realities exist from Brinnon to Port Townsend.\u201cI will use my life experience as an uninsured working person in this county to represent the grossly under-represented.\u201dThe crux of the campaign for Ready, who now works as a problem solver for Jefferson Healthcare, is to provide health care for those who cannot afford it.\u201cI have worked on several problems at the hospital for 15 years, but this is one that I could not solve,\u201d Ready said,\u201cA friend of mine would not seek treatment due to its cost. Instead of going further into debt, she decided to roll the dice with her health, and I found that far too many patients are now doing the same thing.\u201d\u201cWe have implemented some great changes since 2008, when I first joined the board,\u201d Mauney said.\u201cWe have new facilities, and the morale is better. There are many services we do not offer, but we will take care of anyone in Jefferson County regardless of their ability to pay.\u201dAll four candidates said the hospital should maintain an active advertising campaign, although Ready said he didn\u2019t think there should be a full-time employee devoted to advertising while there isn\u2019t one to promote access to health care.\u201cIt\u2019s an important part of what we do because a lot of people out in the county aren\u2019t aware of what services we have,\u201d Buhler said.\u201cIn order to get more patients and get our community members where we can serve them, we need to make them aware. It\u2019s the business side of health care, and it is important.\u201d\u201cAdvertising is an important way to let people know what the hospital offers, but if that doesn\u2019t work, we need to try other things,\u201d Hensel said.\u201cLet\u2019s door-knock; let\u2019s get out and talk to people to find out what they are thinking. Everyone in this community elected the people on this board, so we need to be out there answering questions.\u201cIf I\u2019m elected, I will knock on everyone\u2019s door in this county to tell them what services the hospital has for them because if they don\u2019t know, how can we help them?\u201dThroughout the forum, the challengers attempted to paint the incumbents as out of touch while the incumbents criticized the challengers for their lack of experience.\u201cMatt has a vision, but I have a business plan,\u201d Mauney said.At the end of the forum, Buhler lived the candidate\u2019s worst nightmare: She was the fourth to answer a question about the hospital\u2019s role in implementing the Affordable Care Act and had a memory lapse.\u201cI agree with what Mark said,\u201d she said before falling silent and pausing:\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I forgot the question.\u201dAfter laughter, she provided an answer.\u201cWe will be doing many of the things we do today, but the difference is we will be getting some funding for them,\u201d she said.________Jefferson County Editor Charlie Bermant can be reached at 360-385-2335 or cbermant@peninsuladailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "port angeles newspaper, sequim newspaper, port townsend newspaper, olympic peninsula newspaper, daily news, port angeles classifieds, sequim classifieds, port townsend classifieds, local weather, local news, olympic peninsula obituaries, port angeles obituaries, sequim obituaries, port townsend obituaries,pdn,port angeles,sequim,port townsend,olympic peninsula", "og": {"url": "http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20130924/NEWS/309249993", "site_name": "Peninsula Daily News", "image": "http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=PT&Date=20130924&Category=news&ArtNo=309249993&Ref=AR", "type": "article", "title": "Four Jefferson Healthcare hospital commission hopefuls focus on Affordable Care Act effects"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002304548680, "app_id": 224084277650041}, "description": "Your #1 News Source for the Olympic Peninsula, Port Angeles, Sequim, Port Townsend and beyond."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaac2\"", "article_summary": "2 against challenger Savannah Hensel.Buhler was part of a forum hosted by the Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce on Monday, during which the Affordable Care Act, or \u201cObamacare,\u201d was a principal topic.She told of forums that the hospital district is planning.\u201cWe will be hosting a series of forums on how to get people enrolled.\nIt\u2019s the business side of health care, and it is important.\u201d\u201cAdvertising is an important way to let people know what the hospital offers, but if that doesn\u2019t work, we need to try other things,\u201d Hensel said.\u201cLet\u2019s door-knock; let\u2019s get out and talk to people to find out what they are thinking.\nFour Jefferson Healthcare hospital commission hopefuls focus on Affordable Care Act effectsBy Charlie BermantPeninsula Daily NewsPORT TOWNSEND \u2014 The Affordable Care Act, which begins implementation in October, will have a positive effect on local health care, but people still need to educate themselves about it, hospital board candidates told a business audience Monday.\u201cIt is a very complicated issue and will be difficult to implement,\u201d said Jill Buhler, who is running for a fourth term as Position 5 commissioner of Jefferson Healthcare\u2019s parent Public Hospital District No.\nInstead of going further into debt, she decided to roll the dice with her health, and I found that far too many patients are now doing the same thing.\u201d\u201cWe have implemented some great changes since 2008, when I first joined the board,\u201d Mauney said.\u201cWe have new facilities, and the morale is better.\nPart of the instruction as to how to sign up for the programs will come from the hospitals.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of people at Jefferson Healthcare who are working to adapt to the new laws, and they are doing a great job of it,\u201d said Matt Ready, who is vying with Mark Mauney for Position 3 on the hospital commission.\u201cBut it will be a huge adjustment."}
