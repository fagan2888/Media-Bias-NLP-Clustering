Application rates in expansion states increased 41 percent over the same period.\u201d\n\nStento told ThinkProgress that enrollments even in non-expansion states grew by 13 percent from October through January, compared to previous months.\n\nAvalere estimates that between 700,000 and 800,000 Americans in non-expansion states who were already eligible for existing Medicaid programs, but never actually signed up for them, enrolled between October through January. This is a phenomenon that health care experts refer to as the ACA\u2019s \u201cwoodwork effect,\u201d wherein eligible populations come \u201cout of the woodwork\u201d amid persistent national and local coverage of the health law\u2019s signup period. Some of these people may simply not have known that they previously qualified for government health care benefits, or didn\u2019t know how to sign up.\n\nExpansion states saw much bigger enrollment hikes, with somewhere between 1.7 million and 2.7 million signing up for Medicaid for the first time, since some people in those places became newly eligible under expansion. All told, between 2.4 million and 3.5 million of the poorest Americans started receiving Medicaid coverage for the first time during the first four months of Obamacare\u2019s enrollment season.\n\nBetween 1.3 million and 1.7 million Americans newly signed up for Medicaid in January alone \u2014 an enrollment surge that mirrors the approximately 1.1 million people who bought private plans through Obamacare\u2019s marketplaces in just that month.\n\n\u201cMedicaid enrollment grew quickly in January, now that coverage is in effect and new enrollees can seek healthcare services,\u201d said Caroline Pearson, vice president at Avalere Health, in a statement to reporters. \u201cAdditionally, more effective processing of backlogged applications likely contributed to the increased enrollment in January.\u201d\n\nIf the woodwork effect persists, it could have big implications for Obamacare\u2019s long-term impact on the number of uninsured Americans. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects about 31 million Americans to remain uninsured in 2024 despite a full decade of ACA implementation. The vast majority of those people will be voluntarily uninsured, including more than six million Americans who will refuse or simply won\u2019t know how to enroll in Medicaid. Since those estimates are based on historical trends in the number of Medicaid-eligible people who never sign up, a continuing woodwork effect could drive down the 31 million number.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Between 2.4 and 3.5 million Americans enrolled in Medicaid for the first time between October and January.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Between 2.4 and 3.5 million Americans enrolled in Medicaid for the first time between October and January.", "title": "Obamacare Is Giving Medicaid A Significant Boost \u2014 Even In The States That Didn\u2019t Expand It", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/03/04/3357761/avalere-medicaid-woodwork/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/flickr_medicaid-matters-e1393949366283.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Between 2.4 and 3.5 million Americans enrolled in Medicaid for the first time between October and January.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/flickr_medicaid-matters-e1393949366283-321x214.jpg", "title": "Obamacare Is Giving Medicaid A Significant Boost \u2014 Even In The States That Didn\u2019t Expand It", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/flickr_medicaid-matters-e1393949366283.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/flickr_medicaid-matters-e1393949366283.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-04T12:33:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca00\"", "article_summary": "Health Obamacare Is Giving Medicaid A Significant Boost \u2014 Even In The States That Didn\u2019t Expand It CREDIT: Flickr Virginia residents assemble in favor of Medicaid expansionA new analysis by Avalere Health finds that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s open enrollment season is boosting Medicaid signups even in the states that have refused the health law\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion.\n\u201cEnrollment of new Medicaid beneficiaries continues in both expansion and non-expansion states,\u201d said Jenna Stento, senior manager at Avalere Health, in a statement.\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects about 31 million Americans to remain uninsured in 2024 despite a full decade of ACA implementation.\nThe vast majority of those people will be voluntarily uninsured, including more than six million Americans who will refuse or simply won\u2019t know how to enroll in Medicaid.\n\u201cMedicaid applications have increased 27 percent on average from October to January compared to application rates before ACA."}
