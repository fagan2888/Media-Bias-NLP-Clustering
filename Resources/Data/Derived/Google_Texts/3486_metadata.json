While there various forms of birth control available on the market, only the male condom helps prevent STD\u2019s. The Female Health Company (FHCO) , a health care product developer and manufacturer, aims to place control in the hands of women by offering its condom alternative.\n\nHeadquartered in Chicago, illinois, The Female Health Company manufactures and markets the FC2 Female Condom\u00ae, the only currently available female-controlled birth control alternative approved by the FDA that also offers protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Since 2007, the company has shipped the FC2 to 144 countries and, moreover, the World Health Organization has approved the FC2 for purchase by U.N. agencies.\n\nToday, the company has revealed a major development that serves as a major operational and financial milestone. The Female Health Company and Aspen Park Pharmaceuticals, a men\u2019s health company, have entered into a definitive merger agreement. Per the agreement, both companies will be established as a men\u2019s and a women\u2019s health division that offers pharmaceuticals and consumer health products.\n\n\u201cFor FHC, this is a transformational merger, creating a powerful company with solid cash flows and a deep product development portfolio that serves multi-billion dollar industry segments,\u201d said O.B. Parrish, Chairman and CEO of The Female Health Company. \u201cMore specifically, APP brings numerous late and early stage product candidates focused in the areas of oncology and men\u2019s and women\u2019s health, as well as a first-class experienced management team. Importantly, the strategic benefits of the transaction deliver on our objective to add a diversified and complementary mix of products that has the potential to substantially expand our revenue base and grow our business.\u201d\n\nThe merger is expected to close in Q3 2016.\n\nFurthermore, in late March, the company addressed the reimbursability of the female condom under the Affordable Care Act through webinars developed in partnership with the National Coalition of STD Directors and the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association.\n\nHaving access to health essentials is key to maintaining one\u2019s quality of life. Through this landmark merger, both The Female Health Company and Aspen Park Pharmaceuticals are positioned to provide men and women products and pharmaceuticals that are vital to one\u2019s overall and sexual health. \u201cWe believe merging with APP is in the best interests of our shareholders,\u201d said Parrish, \u201cproviding exciting new opportunities, while substantially mitigating the risks associated with being a single product company.\u201d\n\nDISCLOSURE: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors, and do not represent the views of equities.com.
