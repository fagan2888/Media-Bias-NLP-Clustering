Marco Rubio sought a sweet spot with a young, conservative audience this morning by presenting himself as a candidate of the future who understands what makes America exceptional.\n\n\u201cOur leaders are still stuck in yesterday,\u201d Rubio, 43, said, at a time when \u201cwe\u2019re having a new industrial revolution every five years.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s remark came during a question-and-answer session with conservative commentator Sean Hannity that followed a short speech encapsulating the \u201cnew American century\u201d theme of his book, \u201cAmerican Dreams,\u201d and of his prospective campaign for president.\n\nWhen Hannity asked for a one-word answer to Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, Rubio replied: \u201cYesterday.\u201d\n\nThe scene was the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, where most of the likeliest Republican candidates for president have 20 minutes to make their case. The largest annual gathering of conservative activists, it concludes Saturday at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center just outside Washington in National Harbor, Md.\n\nRubio recalled for the friendly crowd the future his family was able to make after his father and mother left Cuba in 1956 for freedom in America.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the son of a bartender and a maid is sitting on the stage with you today?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why America is special.\u201d\n\nHis unrepayable debt to the \u201csingle greatest nation man has ever known,\u201d Rubio said, is behind his own consideration of whether to seek the presidency.\n\n\u201cSometimes you wouldn\u2019t know we\u2019re an exceptional nation by listening to the left,\u201d Rubio said, or \u201cby listening to the president. \u2026 [But] after all, when was the last time you heard about a boatload of American refugees landing on the shore of another country?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes you wouldn\u2019t know we\u2019re an exceptional nation by listening to the left.\u201d-@marcorubio at #CPAC2015\n\nAlthough he emphasized tax reform to spur job growth, balancing the federal budget, and repealing and replacing Obamacare, Rubio also underlined that family, not government, is \u201cthe most important organization.\u201d\n\nLeaders have a duty, he said, to reform education and provide choices so that young Americans from those families gain \u201cthe skills and values they\u2019ll need to succeed in this new century.\u201d Being trained as welders or airline mechanics is just as valid as seeking a four-year degree, he said.\n\nAsked by Hannity what he would do to defeat the ISIS terrorist group in Iraq and Syria, Rubio said President Obama hasn\u2019t deployed full military force because \u201che doesn\u2019t want to upset Iran.\u201d\n\nBecause ISIS, or the Islamic State, is \u201ca radical Sunni Islamic group,\u201d Rubio said, it needs to be defeated by other Sunnis led by regional governments such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan. If they are backed up by \u201cdevastating\u201d U.S. air support, Rubio said to applause, \u201cyou will wipe ISIS out.\u201d\n\nHannity asked the Florida Republican about his admitted \u201cmistake\u201d in co-sponsoring a Senate-passed immigration reform bill that, had the House not rejected it, would have led to citizenship for many of an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a serious problem that has to be addressed,\u201d Rubio insisted of the issue that put him at odds with many conservatives. But he said he learned that Americans won\u2019t trust their leaders even with needed reform of legal immigration until \u201cthey see\u201d the border is secure and \u201cillegal immigration has been brought under control.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
