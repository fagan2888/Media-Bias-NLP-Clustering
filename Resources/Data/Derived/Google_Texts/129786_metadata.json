Written comments may be submitted to the Board of County Commissioners by email at board@deschutes.org or by conventional mail to Deschutes County, PO Box 6005, Attn: BoCC, Bend, OR 97708-6005, or by fax to 541-385-3202.\n\nWhen the public hearing on a proposed moratorium and potential ban in Deschutes County on businesses involving marijuana opens Wednesday morning, a representative of Canna Tea LLC is expected to be there, said company CEO Rustin Kluge.\n\nKluge\u2019s 20-acre farm is one of the larger commercial marijuana operations in the county , he said. Kluge provides an umbrella for several growers, who supply more than 40 medical marijuana patients and sell the excess to cannabis dispensaries.\n\nA financier who specializes in funding marijuana businesses, Kluge said Canna Tea has so far created 120 jobs, from lawyers to landscapers. He looks forward to entering the market for recreational marijuana when it opens up next year, supplying not only the plant but also a holistic tea made from the nonpsychoactive portion of the marijuana plant.\n\n\u201cWe feel the more we can educate the community about how this industry is working, the better off we\u2019ll be,\u201d Kluge said Thursday. \u201cWe understand the fears or reactions we\u2019re getting. We understand that.\u201d\n\nNow a move is underway to gauge public sentiment for banning some or all commercial activity associated with recreational marijuana and any new permits for growing or dispensing medical marijuana in the unincorporated areas of Deschutes County.\n\nThe time for that discussion is now, before the six-month window the Legislature gave cities and counties to impose such bans expires, said Tony DeBone, chairman of the Deschutes County Commission.\n\nTwo public hearings are scheduled, at 10 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Wednesday, to gather public input on a possible ban, according to the commission office.\n\nKluge said that dismantling a growing industry will only hurt the local economy. He foresees the day when federal law changes to allow Oregon, and Deschutes County, to ship marijuana around the country.\n\nThe Oregon Health Authority in July reported 2,313 medical marijuana growers in Deschutes County and 1,742 grow sites. The number of growers increased by five since January, and the number of grow sites decreased by 88, according to OHA reports.\n\nSome will likely apply for licenses to grow, process or sell recreational marijuana, or some combination of those activities, when the Oregon Liquor Control Commission starts accepting applications in January.\n\nDeBone said he\u2019s not against personal use of marijuana, or commerce involving cannabis as a whole. The question, he said, is whether all the commercial cannabis activities to be licensed by the OLCC and those already permitted by the OHA are appropriate everywhere in the county.\n\n\u201cAs commissioners, we\u2019re not representing land use in the cities, but the land use outside the cities,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we going to see investments for large commercial operations? And there\u2019s a difference between production, growing the plant and cutting the crop, but also warehousing, distribution, processing, packaging for retail. Is that appropriate in an (exclusive farm use) zone; in some of these rural residential areas? That\u2019s the interesting discussion.\u201d\n\nDeBone said that if the county does not opt for any ban, it must address marijuana as a zoning question, anyway. He suggested that large commercial farms on lots of 5 or 10 acres minimum, for example, could grow marijuana that\u2019s processed or stored in commercial areas in Bend or elsewhere. If the county rejects a ban, marijuana would be treated like any other agricultural crop, especially in exclusive farm use zones.\n\nOpting out of commercial marijuana is a pressing question for marijuana businesses, too, said Nick Lelack, director of the county Community Development Department. Questions from prospective cannabis entrepreneurs and existing growers and processors arrive every day. He also sees an increasing number of land-use applications for greenhouses and accessory buildings, many of which are related to cannabis growing. That signals significant investment in not only land but also building materials, growing supplies and even LED grow lights.\n\n\u201cWe receive applications all the time,\u201d Lelack said Wednesday. \u201cWe just aim to provide everybody with the best information that we can. There is some risk in making those investments given that the OLCC hasn\u2019t finished its rule-making, the Board of County Commissioners hasn\u2019t decided whether to effectively opt in or opt out and then, of course, it could be subject to change by the voters in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe Legislature gave cities and counties the chance to opt out of commercial marijuana, but lawmakers allowed them only 180 days from June 30 to act. Six local governments, so far \u2014 one county and five cities on opposite ends of Oregon \u2014 have enacted local laws banning all business activity related to recreational marijuana, according to the OLCC. Douglas County, along with the cities of Brownsville and Sandy, all in Western Oregon, must submit those bans to a popular vote in November 2016. The cities of Nyssa, Vale and Ontario in Eastern Oregon enacted immediate bans.\n\nLocal governments in 15 counties where voters opposed Measure 91 by 55 percent or greater may enact an immediate ban by simply passing a law, according to the Association of Oregon Counties.\n\nDeschutes County, where 51.8 percent of voters in November approved Measure 91, may enact a ban on any or all commercial activity involving marijuana, but must put any question of a ban on marijuana businesses before voters in November 2016. Voters could ban all or some commercial marijuana activity in unincorporated areas of the county.\n\nCalling for a vote would automatically impose a moratorium on the OLCC from awarding any of the four recreational marijuana licenses: producing, processing, retailing or wholesaling and the OHA from granting any more permits to processors and dispensaries in the county, said David Doyle, Deschutes County counsel. Existing medical marijuana businesses would not be affected, and neither would personal recreational use, growing and possession of marijuana under Measure 91.\n\nIncorporated cities such as Bend, La Pine, Redmond and Sisters would not be affected by a county ban.\n\nMichael Boynton, a cannabis grower in La Pine with plans to open a medical marijuana dispensary in Madras, said he planned on applying to the OLCC for all four licenses for recreational marijuana. He originally grew cannabis in La Pine but moved his growing operation outside the city limits after neighbors complained about the aroma, he said. The complaints disappeared with the move, he said.\n\n\u201cThe typical complaints (were) about smell, but it got out of hand,\u201d he said, \u201cit got to a feuding neighbor thing.\u201d\n\nDeBone said neighbors of Kluge\u2019s 7-month-old operation in Alfalfa were concerned when they saw a fence and security cameras on his property. The caller described barbed wire and a secure gate.\n\n\u201c\u2018You gotta come see it;\u2019 that\u2019s the call I got a couple of times,\u201d he said.\n\nKluge said he\u2019s required to screen his marijuana growing from public view; the gate and security cameras are precautionary measures to guard against theft. Most of the community is OK with the site, he said.\n\n\u201cNinety-eight percent of the people in Alfalfa, I would say, really are happy we are there, for many reasons,\u201d Kluge said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely false that we are bringing down property values. I know people in Alfalfa that have been growing there for 10, 15 years.\u201d\n\nKluge, who relocated from Florida to Oregon, described his methods as careful; he screens potential investors to weed out those who think they\u2019ll make money fast. He uses organic growing methods, he said, and he relies on solar power for electricity. He said the public should think of the cannabis industry as it thinks of other craft industries in Oregon.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring value,\u201d Kluge said. \u201cWe want the community to feel we\u2019re bringing value and treat us like they treat our craft brewing and wine industries. That\u2019s who we are.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7815, jditzler@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the public hearing on a proposed moratorium and potential ban in Deschutes County on businesses involving marijuana opens Wednesday morning, a representative of Canna Tea LLC is expected to be there, said company CEO Rustin Kluge.
