In that light, you could call \u201cGetting Schooled\u201d a book about books. One of its less happy refrains has to do with how little books rate in the lives of the public high school students Keizer taught when he returned to the profession after a 14-year hiatus.\n\nA running motif in this chronicle of the one-year stint Keizer spent as an English teacher in rural Vermont is a collection of Library of America volumes (from the series of archival-quality collections of work by great American writers). Keizer spots a pyramidal stack of these books in a display in the school library, but they\u2019re just being used as risers for an assortment of \u201cgraphic novels and topical books of particular interest to teens.\u201d In fact, the Library of America volumes are \u201cdiscards\u201d because no student has checked out any of them in ages. Dismayed, Keizer resolves to reinstate the books in the library\u2019s collection before his year is up. \u201cSchool libraries exist to serve all the students, yes,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut they also exist to serve that student who only comes along once every 25 years,\u201d that unicorn-rare creature who still has time and attention for Walt Whitman.\n\nKeizer is nothing if not rooted. He returned to the same school where he taught for 16 years before he left to devote himself to writing full-time. He\u2019s both a local guy made good and a Vermont exemplar. He has been married to the same woman and lived in a nearby town for over three decades. He distrusts cellphones and what he calls \u201cdigital bling\u201d (\u201c\u2018the digital age\u2019 is not my god any more than the \u2018global marketplace'\u201d). He\u2019s disgusted by the encroachment of commercialism and bureaucracy into the once-sacred groves of private thought and feeling. He intends \u201cto live or die on the value of books.\u201d He once contemplated pasting a bumper sticker reading \u201cI\u2019m a homeschoolin\u2019 gun-totin\u2019 Bible-bangin\u2019 \u2026. SOCIALIST\u201d onto his car. He\u2019s a contributing editor to Harper\u2019s, for crying out loud \u2014 all of which is to say that Keizer fits the profile of a neo-curmudgeon thinker in the vein of Sven Birkerts or Wendell Berry, leftist champions of old-fashioned rural ways, print books, earnestness and deep thought.\n\nNow, the knee-jerk, smarty-pants Internet-opiner\u2019s response to neo-curmudgeonly assertions is supposed to be a saucy, skeptical dismissal \u2014 perhaps with lashings \u201cgolly!\u201d and \u201cgee!\u201d or similarly arch exclamations. What a dinosaur! How can Keizer so completely not get it? But this is one curmudgeon who can\u2019t be easily written off. First, all that time he\u2019s spent alone with the printed page and his own thoughts has produced admirable results. \u201cGetting Schooled\u201d is one of those books in which you find yourself underlining something on nearly every page. Its author constitutes Exhibit A for the argument that if you give yourself time and space to ruminate, you\u2019re more likely to come up with some sterling and well-expressed insights. Imagine that.\n\nSecond, although one of Keizer\u2019s colleagues tells him, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the day of the teacher as artist is dead,\u201d this book offers ample proof that her mourning is premature. Keizer can be tough and demanding, but the trickiest parts of his job, of all high-school teachers\u2019 jobs, involve the delicate handling of adolescent psyches, kids who are both exquisitely sensitive and chronically inattentive. \u201cA teacher should never underestimate the factor of selective listening,\u201d he writes. \u201cSimply to use the word \u2018stupid\u2019 risks having the kid believe, or claim to believe, that you\u2019ve called him stupid. He hears the word and nothing else.\u201d And then there\u2019s this ninja technique for preventing students from cribbing their work from online sources like SparkNotes: An exam that reprints one of the chapter summaries from the SparkNotes website and asks students to describe the ways it gets the book wrong.\n\nKeizer, who returned to the classroom so that his family could keep their health insurance while his speech-therapist wife took a break from her own school-system job, was assigned to teach average students. He was reminded again and again that many of them arrived in his classroom from homes with neglectful, absent or outright abusive adults. Some of them pined for the small family farms that had been lost to big agriculture. Despite the popular image of rural Vermont as the essence of wholesome, bedrock American values, poverty \u2014 material, but also emotional and cultural \u2014 has blighted many of their young lives. Meanwhile, at the state\u2019s celebrated town meetings, where every tax measure was battled down to the penny, \u201ccountrified transplants who\u2019ve sent their children to the best private colleges money can buy evoke the Vermont tradition of making do with less.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A writer returns to a profession transformed by economic inequality, standardized testing and capitalism", "author": "Laura Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A writer returns to a profession transformed by economic inequality, standardized testing and capitalism", "title": "\u201cGetting Schooled\u201d: Back to teaching in the era of Common Core", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/03/getting_schooled_back_to_teaching_in_the_era_of_common_core/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/getting_schooled.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A writer returns to a profession transformed by economic inequality, standardized testing and capitalism", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/getting_schooled.jpg", "title": "\u201cGetting Schooled\u201d: Back to teaching in the era of Common Core", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cGetting Schooled\u201d: Back to teaching in the era of Common Core", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, Education, Getting Schooled, high-school, Memoirs, Must-Do, Public School, teaching, What to Read", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c38\"", "article_summary": "\u201cGetting Schooled\u201d is one of those books in which you find yourself underlining something on nearly every page.\nIn that light, you could call \u201cGetting Schooled\u201d a book about books.\nOne of its less happy refrains has to do with how little books rate in the lives of the public high school students Keizer taught when he returned to the profession after a 14-year hiatus.\nTopics: Books, Editor's Picks, Education, Getting Schooled, high-school, Memoirs, Must-Do, Public School, teaching, What to Read, Entertainment NewsBefore coming out with his new book, \u201cGetting Schooled: The Reeducation of an American Teacher,\u201d Garret Keizer published popular treatises on privacy and on quiet; each was about how modern Americans enjoy less and less of those two blessed conditions.\nDismayed, Keizer resolves to reinstate the books in the library\u2019s collection before his year is up."}
