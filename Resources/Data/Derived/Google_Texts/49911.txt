A dump truck driver was hospitalized with serious injuries following a crash Saturday morning in Butler County

It happened just before 9:30 a.m. in the 5600 block of SW Butler Road, just northeast of Andover. The sheriff's office said a dump truck hauling a load of rock went off the road and hit a tree.

The driver, 75-year-old Martin Small of Rose Hill, was flown to a Wesley Medical Center in Wichita. He was originally listed in critical condition, but sheriff's office said Saturday afternoon Small remains in stable condition in intensive care.
