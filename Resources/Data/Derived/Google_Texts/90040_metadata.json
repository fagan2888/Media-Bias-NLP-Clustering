He\u2019s going to be right in the same spot, ready to work, every single day. I just feel like that\u2019s a difference from a mental standpoint.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got so much love for Ben. At the same time, I\u2019m not going to lie. I\u2019m happy to be part of this organization and happy that Peyton is my quarterback.\u201d\n\nSanders took heat for those comments, namely from Antonio Brown, his former Steeler teammate who said they were \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d The Broncos reciever stood by his comments, though, and said he doesn\u2019t regret them.\n\n\n\nBut now, Big Ben has spoken up. In an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Thursday, the Steelers quarterback said he was taken aback by Sanders\u2019 words.\n\n\u201cWhether he meant it or not, it hurt in a sense that I tried so hard to keep him here last year and was always supporting him,\u201d Roethlisberger said. \u201cWhen he was down in practice, I always talked to him. When he had a baby, I was trying to help him.\n\n\u201cI was more disappointed he didn\u2019t reach out to me. I know he told some other guys: \u2018You know I love Ben, I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u2019 I wish he would have reached out to me and just say that and I would have been fine with it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ben Roethlisberger,Broncos,Emmanuel Sanders,NFL,Peyton Manning,Steelers", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger responded to Emmanuel Sanders' earlier comments about his leadership in comparison to Peyton Manning, saying Sanders' words \"hurt.\"", "title": "Ben Roethlisberger on Emmanuel Sanders' comments: \"It hurt\"", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/14/emmanuel-sanders-comments-hurt-big-bens-feelings/28775/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/ben-sanders.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger responded to Emmanuel Sanders' earlier comments about his leadership in comparison to Peyton Manning, saying Sanders' words \"hurt.\"", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/14/emmanuel-sanders-comments-hurt-big-bens-feelings/28775/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/ben-sanders.jpg", "title": "Ben Roethlisberger \u201churt\u201d by Emmanuel Sanders\u2019 recent comments", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger responded to Emmanuel Sanders' comments about his leadership in comparison to Peyton Manning, saying Sanders' words \"hurt.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd080f\"", "article_summary": "Late last month, during an interview on The Fan 104.3, Broncos receiver Emmanuel Sanders was asked the difference between Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger, with whom he spent four seasons in Pittsburgh.\nIn an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Thursday, the Steelers quarterback said he was taken aback by Sanders\u2019 words.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got so much love for Ben.\nI know he told some other guys: \u2018You know I love Ben, I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u2019 I wish he would have reached out to me and just say that and I would have been fine with it.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like Peyton is a far better leader, in terms of staying after practice, catching balls, wanting guys to get on the same page with him, things of that sort,\u201d Sanders had said."}
