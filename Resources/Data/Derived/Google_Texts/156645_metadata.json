Rand Paul says he is the only presidential candidate defending the entire Bill of Rights.\"I\u2019m probably the only Republican in the race who thinks that the government shouldn\u2019t be collecting all of our phone records without a warrant,\" the Kentucky Senator said Sunday on \"The Cats Roundtable\" on AM 970 in New York. He's also one of the few in the race who thinks that although America needs to defend itself, \"sometimes being involved in foreign war doesn\u2019t help us,\" he said.\"And I\u2019m one of the few who thinks we need to talk about defending the entire Bill of Rights, not just a couple of ones cherry-picked here and there,\" he told host John Catsimatidis.Paul has a strong libertarian background, inherited from his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, who ran for president in past election cycles.\"I want to be part of the leave-me-alone coalition,\" Rand Paul said, \"which basically says if you\u2019re not hurting anybody, the government, particularly the federal government, ought to stay out of your life.\"As for likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Paul said her actions as secretary of state, particularly the war in Libya, have made the area \"less safe.\"\"It made it a hotbed for jihadists,\" he said. \"And, in fact, I think Libya now is a jihadist wonderland. And it was a big mistake for us to go in there in the first place, because a lot of times when we topple secular dictators, we\u2019ve gotten chaos and then we\u2019ve gotten the rise of radical Islam.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "rand paul, defend, bill of rights, catsimatidis", "pubdate": "2015-05-10T17:16:40", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Sen.
