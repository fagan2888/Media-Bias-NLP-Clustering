General Assembly scheduled for late September], will they resort to their old ways? Or will there be, in fact, real progress?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Some suggested President Xi Jinping could cancel the visit over hacking sanctions.", "description": "Some suggested President Xi Jinping could cancel the visit over hacking sanctions.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Katie Bo Williams", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Some suggested President Xi Jinping could cancel the visit over hacking sanctions.", "title": "White House official: No sanctions before Chinese leader's state visit", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/253654-white-house-official-no-sanctions-before-chinese-state-visit", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamabarack_jinpingxi_111114getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/253654-white-house-official-no-sanctions-before-chinese-state-visit", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-15T10:19-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Katie Bo Williams", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-15T10:19:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/253654-white-house-official-no-sanctions-before-chinese-state-visit", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Some suggested President Xi Jinping could cancel the visit over hacking sanctions.", "card": "summary", "title": "White House official: No sanctions before Chinese leader's state visit"}, "dcterms.title": "White House official: No sanctions before Chinese leader's state visit"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2cc4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat was clearly [the Chinese] goal.\u201dADVERTISEMENTThe official White House response has been less straight-forward.\nEnding weeks of speculation, a senior White House official told The Washington Post that the U.S. will not impose economic sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals before President Xi Jinping's state visit next week.\n\u201cThere are still big problems,\u201d the White House official told The Post.\n\u201cThey came up with enough of a framework that the visit will proceed and this issue should not disrupt the visit,\u201d the official told The Post.\nThe threat of sanctions put even more pressure on the already politically-charged state visit, heating up the cybersecurity rhetoric on both sides."}
