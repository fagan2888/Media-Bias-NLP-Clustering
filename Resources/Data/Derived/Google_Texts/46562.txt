A motorcycle rider died in a collision with heavy equipment at the Port of Catoosa Thursday afternoon.

Reports say 50-year-old Daniel White was heading northbound on Bird Creek Avenue at about 2:30 p.m. when his motorcycle collided with a large front-end loader attempting to turn eastbound onto Gravel Service Road.

Troopers said the man was not wearing a helmet. They said the driver of the front-end loader slowed down trying to avoid the collision but couldn't avoid the motorcycle.

The driver of the front-end loader was not hurt, according to the OHP.
