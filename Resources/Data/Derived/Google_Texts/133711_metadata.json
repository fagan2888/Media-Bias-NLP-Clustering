Get some real answers to some real questions.\u201d\n\nSen. Paul was subjected to the undercard in the North Charleston, South Carolina Republican debate on Thursday night, but rather than debate alongside Carly Fiorina and Rick Santorum, Paul spoke to listeners directly at his #RandRally for a little over 45 minutes about his positions on the U.S. Constitution, executive power, foreign policy, debt, the Federal Reserve, terrorism, and much more.\n\nPaul reached about 7 million people total over his two-day NYC media tour, according to CNN, which was surely more than the meager 2 million people the undercard debate averaged Thursday night, and more than the November GOP undercard debate (4.7 million viewers) and the January Fox Business debate combined.\n\nThe figure excludes the number of people he reached through last night\u2019s #RandRally.\n\nPaul received 370,371 views on Facebook alone for all three videos, at the time of this writing. At the debate\u2019s start Rand Paul had the second-highest follower growth among all candidates and the GOP, according to Twitter Government, although he did not maintain that place by the debate\u2019s end.\n\nOn healthcare, he said that we should apply capitalism to it because capitalism \u201cproduces the most amount of goods\u201d at the cheapest prices, just like it does in other industries where freedom reigns.\n\nIn fact, that was his main theme throughout the night: apply more freedom to various industries where the government is heavily involved.\n\nHe also said that before Obamacare, which was signed into law in 2010, \u201cabout half of healthcare was given and distributed by the government,\u201d which contributed to the high cost of care.\n\nHe also addressed candidates on both sides.\n\nOn Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, Paul said their differences are \u201cgrander than our similarities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who believe you can get something for free, or something for nothing, they just aren\u2019t looking hard enough to see that somebody actually has to pay for it,\u201d Paul said.\n\nAt the open, Paul\u2019s assistant read a message from a user that said \u201cHello from Canada.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will have some questions about Canada in this probably because this is the first time we\u2019ve had one of your countrymen running for the presidency,\u201d Paul joked. He was referring to Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) who some scholars say is not constitutionally eligible to run for president and others who without question say that he is.\n\nPaul said that there are people on stage who have \u201cno earthly idea what the nuclear triad is\u201d or what to do with the U.S.\u2019s nuclear weapons. \u201cI\u2019m talking about you Donald.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have people on the stage who will tell you tonight they want to make the sand glow,\u201d he said in reference to Ted Cruz\u2019s recent comments that he would carpet bomb ISIS. \u201cThe main problem with that strategy is, you know what, you may well end up creating more terrorists than you can kill,\u201d Paul continued.\n\nHe said candidates who want to increase defense spending for wars are \u201cnot conservative.\u201d\n\nOn the War on Drugs, Paul said we should admit it is a \u201cfailure,\u201d and that drug addiction should be treated as a health problem, not an incarceration problem, adding that money used on prisons could be redirected toward rehabilitation.\n\nOn Day One, Paul said that he would repeal 10,000 executive orders from \u201cprevious presidents\u201d that put a burden on the U.S. economy. On spending, he said he would spend exactly what the government takes in taxes.\n\nBoth parties have the potential to bankrupt the country, he said. On the right, by those who \u201cwant unlimited military spending\u201d; and on the left, by those \u201cwho want unlimited domestic spending,\u201d per his comments in a pre-debate message.\n\nPaul expressed concern that Republicans let the current president off the hook because the next (presumably Republican) president would be limited in making war.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Republicans recently said we\u2019re not going to pass any authorization for any kind of war in the Middle East because we\u2019re afraid we might limit the next president,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, precisely. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d he continued.\n\nInterestingly, he said that terrorists are \u201cvery weak people\u201d that incite terror only because they can\u2019t defeat a larger enemy in any military battle.\n\n\u201cWe do not have to fear terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we let our fear get the better of ourselves, if we forget who we are as Americans, if we let the Bill of Rights slip away from us because of fear of terrorism, that that\u2019s a great loss.\u201d\n\nOn Marco Rubio, Paul said his biggest concern with him is that \u201che\u2019s fallen into the trap of the neoconservatives who believe that we should remake the world in our image,\u201d but he also said Hillary Clinton is a neoconservative too.\n\nTo bolster his case, Rand cited the libertarian Cato Institute\u2019s \u201cPresidential Candidate Intervention Meter,\u201d which scored candidates\u2019 calls to intervene more heavily if they called for \u201cground force\u201d and global calls to fight terrorism, and less if they called for \u201cair power,\u201d and even less for \u201cno fly zones.\u201d\n\nIt ranked Hillary Clinton as the most-interventionist remaining candidate (Senator Lindsey Graham was number one, but dropped out), Rubio as the second most-interventionist candidate, and Paul the least.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats need to admit they\u2019ve got one on their side also,\u201d Paul said.\n\nPaul called New Jersey Governor Chris Christie \u201cthe World War III candidate,\u201d citing Christie\u2019s explicit statement to shoot down Russian airplanes if there was a no-fly zone in Syria.\n\nOn religious freedom, Paul said the government should leave people and businesses alone. But he almost made this unique statement:\n\nOne of the biggest dangers to religious liberty that\u2019s coming is many people look at a tax deduction and they say \u201cOh, that\u2019s the government\u2019s money.\u201d If you acknowledge, or you somehow believe or accept the notion that if you get a tax deduction or a tax credit that it\u2019s the government\u2019s money, then the government can control that money. That\u2019s the first step towards controlling churches because they\u2019ll say your donation is tax deductible, therefore we\u2019re going to control it because it\u2019s \u201cthe government\u2019s money.\u201d I don\u2019t believe that for a second.\u201d He also discussed what kind of Supreme Court appointee he would appoint, the NSA, the Federal Reserve, and the militarization of the police.\n\nReplays of the three-part broadcast can be found on Facebook here, here, and here.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Paul received 370,371 views on Facebook alone for all three videos, at the time of this writing.\nPresidential hopeful Rand Paul made an end-run around the GOP debate by going straight to viewers on Twitter, Periscope, and Facebook on Thursday night.\nIn fact, that was his main theme throughout the night: apply more freedom to various industries where the government is heavily involved.\nPaul expressed concern that Republicans let the current president off the hook because the next (presumably Republican) president would be limited in making war.\nOn Day One, Paul said that he would repeal 10,000 executive orders from \u201cprevious presidents\u201d that put a burden on the U.S. economy."}
