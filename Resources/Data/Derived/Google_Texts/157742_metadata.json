No one has been arrested at this time, police said.\n\nIt is unclear if the suspects entered the home by force, Lopez said.\n\nNeighbor Tommy Clenin was shocked when a police officer knocked on his door this morning and asked if he had heard anything.\n\nClenin, who hadn\u2019t heard shots or commotion, stepped outside to see police tape stretched throughout his neighborhood and officers swarming the area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually quiet,\u201d Clenin said. \u201cWe all know each other here. These are good people. I hope that woman is OK.\u201d\n\nThe search for suspects and investigation into the shooting remains ongoing.\n\nThis is a developing story that will be updated as more information becomes available.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or @ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Police search for 3 suspects after woman shot inside Denver home", "title": "Police search for 3 suspects after woman shot inside Denver home", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/27/police-search-for-3-suspects-after-woman-shot-inside-denver-home/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227_094921_3-sought-denver-home-shooting.jpg", "height": 481}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227_094921_3-sought-denver-home-shooting.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-27T08:22:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:03:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd755b\"", "article_summary": "Police are searching for three suspects after a woman was shot inside her Denver home early Saturday morning, officials said.\nIt is unclear if the suspects entered the home by force, Lopez said.\nI hope that woman is OK.\u201dThe search for suspects and investigation into the shooting remains ongoing.\nClenin, who hadn\u2019t heard shots or commotion, stepped outside to see police tape stretched throughout his neighborhood and officers swarming the area.\nNeighbor Tommy Clenin was shocked when a police officer knocked on his door this morning and asked if he had heard anything."}
