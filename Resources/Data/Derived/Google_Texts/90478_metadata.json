It\u2019s good for their housing.\u201d\n\nDonovan toured the Ella with Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor, Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn and leaders of the Tampa Housing Authority.\n\nThe authority is building Encore on the site of the former Central Park Village. The project is being financed by $30 million in HUD grants. When finished, the development will have 110,000 square feet of commercial, office and retail space along with a grocery story, library, child care center and health care center.\n\nIt\u2019s 2,000 apartments will be a mix of market-rate and subsidized housing.\n\nAs Donovan visited, crews were building more multi-level apartment buildings within sight of downtown\u2019s skyscrapers.\n\nBuckhorn thanked Donovan for the federal government\u2019s role in reinventing downtown Tampa, from Encore to the Riverwalk.\n\n\u201cWe could not change this city without your help,\u201d he said.\n\nTampa has 96,000 people that could be eligible for health care under the Affordable Care Act, Buckhorn said.\n\n\u201cThat changes lives,\u201d Buckhorn said. \u201cThat gives people security that haven\u2019t had security before.\u201d\n\nDonovan hammered state officials for blocking the expansion of Medicaid in Florida. Doing so would have given 848,000 people in the state health care coverage, he said.\n\nEarlier this year, Gov. Rick Scott said he supported the expansion. But Legislators blocked it out of concerns the expansion would cost the state too much. Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government has promised to pick up the cost of the expansion for three years, then pay 90 percent of it after that.\n\nDonovan visited Tampa a day after Obama apologized for the rough rollout of his signature program. The program\u2019s web portal, healthcare.gov, continues to operate in fits and starts.\n\nDonovan promised it will be working more smoothly by the end of the month. In the meantime, there are other ways to sign up for insurance, he said.\n\nStanding behind him as he spoke were a half-dozen women trained to help people navigate the new health insurance marketplace.\n\nOne of those, Gerry Skinner, outreach manager for Tampa Family Health Centers, said her agency had signed up more than 230 people in person in October.\n\n\u201cThis is more than just a website,\u201d Castor said of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cSomeone described it to me as being able to find water in the desert.\u201d\n\nkwiatrowski@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7871\n\nTwitter: @kwiatrowskiTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Fri, 08 Nov 2013 16:38:45 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Shaun Donovan, President Obama\u2019s housing secretary, visited Tampa today to tour the federally funded Encore housing project \u2014 and to promote the Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Shaun Donovan, President Obama\u2019s housing secretary, visited Tampa today to tour the federally funded Encore housing project \u2014 and to promote the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Obama housing secretary visits Tampa project, promotes healthcare law", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/obama-housing-secretary-visits-tampa-project-promotes-healthcare-law-20131108/", "image": {"width": 3847, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131108/ARTICLE/131109313/EP/1/2/EP-131109313.jpg", "height": 2724}, "updated_time": "2013-11-08T16:38:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Shaun Donovan, President Obama\u2019s housing secretary, visited Tampa today to tour the federally funded Encore housing project \u2014 and to promote the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Obama housing secretary visits Tampa project, promotes healthcare law", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131108/ARTICLE/131109313/AR/0/AR-131109313.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-11-08T16:38:45Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-11-08T16:38:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "TAMPA \u2014 Shaun Donovan, President Obama\u2019s housing secretary, visited Tampa today to tour the federally funded Encore housing project \u2014 and to promote the Affordable Care Act.\nIt\u2019s good for their housing.\u201dDonovan toured the Ella with Democratic Rep.
