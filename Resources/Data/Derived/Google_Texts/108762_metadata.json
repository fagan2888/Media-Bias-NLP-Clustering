(Photo: Charlie Neibergall, AP)\n\nIn early 2013, Ben Carson was largely known as a best-selling author, a celebrated pediatric neurosurgeon and subject of a television movie starring Cuba Gooding Jr.\n\nIt was a compelling narrative: a boy brought up in poverty in southwest Detroit by a single mother; a lousy student with a bad temper who turned it around to graduate from Yale, get a medical degree from the University of Michigan and become the youngest doctor, at the age of 33, to head a surgical division at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.\n\n\"Gifted Hands,\" the book and movie about his transformation from young punk to neurosurgeon, sold 614,000 copies, according to Nielsen BookScan, a business that tracks print book sales, and introduced him to a large swath of Americans, including many high school students who were assigned the book in classes.\n\nBut that life story began to change dramatically on Feb. 7, 2013, when Carson took on President Obama during a National Prayer Breakfast in Washington D.C. While Obama sat just a few feet away, Carson gently, but forcefully, criticized the country\u2019s tax and health care policies.\n\n\u201cWe need good health care for everybody. It\u2019s the most important thing that a person can have,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to figure out efficient ways to do it. We spend a lot of money on health care \u2014 twice as much per capita as anybody else in the world \u2014 and yet, we\u2019re not very efficient.\u201d\n\nBen Carson signs a book for Maryland state Del.

The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial headlined \u201cBen Carson for President,\u201d and proclaimed: \u201cThe Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon may not be politically correct, but he's closer to correct than we've heard in years.\u201d\n\nSales of his book, \"America the Beautiful,\" which was published in 2012, spiked and the political tome jumped to the top of The New York Times best-seller list and stayed in the top 20 for 19 weeks.\n\nBut Carson was still wary of running for office, telling conservative media host Glenn Beck in March 2013, \u201cIt is not my intention to run for office, because I would be a terrible candidate. There is no way I would get into that slime pool with all the special interest groups.\u201d\n\nSupporters, though, began to organize a concerted effort to get the doctor to officially switch from medicine to politics.\n\n\u201cI suppose it was the National Prayer Breakfast speech that first attracted me,\u201d said John Philip Sousa IV, the great grandson of the famous composer and founder of the \u201cRun Ben Run\u201d super PAC in 2013 that has since transformed into \"Win Ben Win!\" the 2016 Committee.\n\n\u201cHis strength and his courage and what he had to say, and the forum he elected to use, was incredibly impressive to me, I did more research to learn more and what I found, I really liked.\u201d Sousa said.\n\nAnd Sousa and other Carson supporters began paying closer attention. When Carson told the media he wasn\u2019t particularly interested in running for president but might change his mind if people clamored for his candidacy, Sousa began circulating petitions urging Carson to run.\n\n\u201cEvery week, I sent him a personal note with about 5,000 to 6,000 signatures that we had gathered,\u201d he said.\n\nCarson is a renowned pediatric neurosurgeon.

You have to be a little bit nutty to want to do a position like that. But I do recognize that sometimes we\u2019re placed in positions that are not of our choosing, so I\u2019m keeping my eyes and ears open.\u201d\n\nCarson also was sending signals that a campaign might materialize. His book tour took him to the crucial state of Iowa in August, and he said he was waiting for the results of the 2014 midterm elections to see how that might affect the leadership in the Senate.\n\nThe super PAC responded by running radio ads in Louisiana and North Carolina with the goal of defeating Democratic Sens. Mary Landrieu and Kay Hagan. Both lost their re-election bids, and Republicans regained a majority in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe invested a lot of money in those races,\u201d Sousa said. \u201cWe were solely focused on what\u2019s going to cause this guy to run.\u201d\n\nAlong the way, they got some encouragement from Carson himself, who told an interviewer that he knew of the group that had mailed out 75,000 mailers to conservative voters in the fall of 2013 and wouldn\u2019t interfere or try to stop them.\n\n\u201cThat gave us a hint that maybe we were on to something,\u201d said Sousa, who has only met Carson once but has field organizations operating in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina and a stable of 35,000 volunteers.\n\nThose efforts certainly had an impact on Carson, said his communications director, Doug Watts.\n\n\u201cThey did a very good job of organizing in several states and getting public supporters out. They\u2019re impossible to miss at a lot of these public events, with their signs and T-shirts,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though we have zero to do with them, he recognizes that they\u2019ve been exceptionally helpful in the launching of our campaign and the sustained level of our campaign.\u201d\n\nBy December 2014, the super PAC had raised $14 million, and by the following March, Carson had formed a presidential exploratory committee, officially announcing his candidacy May 3 in Detroit.\n\n\u201cAt some of those book signings, we had 1,000 people, standing in the sun or rain and waiting for him to sign their book. That\u2019s pretty heady,\u201d Watts said. \u201cIt was those continued expressions of support that he found out there. People were saying, \u2018Please the country needs you.\u2019 That has an impact.\u201d\n\nBen Carson is surrounded by supporters as he waits to be interviewed at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference at National Harbor, Md., on Feb. 26, 2015.

The Pew Research Center found that sentiment in a recent poll released last week that showed 65% of the Republicans surveyed said it\u2019s more important for a candidate to have new ideas than political experience and a proven record.The same poll had Carson in second place with 16% of the Republican primary voters, behind Trump\u2019s 25%. All the other GOP candidates were in single digits.\n\n\u201cThere is this fervor in the United States from people who want someone who\u2019s not a politician, someone who doesn\u2019t live off of sound bites,\u201d Sousa said. \u201cThe majority of people just don\u2019t trust our politicians. We gave Republicans control of the House and most of us are disappointed. We know that you\u2019re not going to repeal Obamacare, but we\u2019d love to see more of an effort.\u201d\n\nThe transformation of Carson from doctor to candidate has hit a few stumbles. He\u2019s been widely criticized for recent comments about Muslims and guns and flubbed an answer on what he\u2019d do as president when a hurricane hits. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Carson is unapologetic, saying his remarks have been taken out of context, and besides, he doesn\u2019t believe in being politically correct.\n\n\u201cHe does dig his heels in when he thinks he\u2019s being managed or cajoled to give the politically correct, politically balanced answer, sometimes to a fault,\u201d Watts said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long-term adjustment for him. We have assiduously avoided managing or handling him because it\u2019s part of his appeal, it\u2019s an important part of his appeal.\u201d\n\nAs for Carson, he told USA TODAY\u2019s Capital Download newsmaker series last week, that at first, he thought all the fuss about a possible presidential campaign \u201cwas kind of ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it didn\u2019t go away. It just kept building. And that\u2019s when I started thinking, should I be listening to these people?\u201d he said. \u201cThe pundits said it was impossible. But if you open the door, I\u2019ll walk through it.\u201d\n\nFollow michpoligal on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/1LqXawu", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "He became a conservative rock star after the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast.", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit Free Press", "description": "He became a conservative rock star after the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast.", "title": "How Ben Carson went from poverty to presidential trail", "url": "http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/12/how-ben-carson-went-doctor-2016-candidate/73823088/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/freep.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He became a conservative rock star after the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast.", "title": "How Ben Carson transformed from doctor to 2016 presidential candidate", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8b2ff238f134f14cd3dc9527c79af8eb3f36c6a6/c=410-0-3866-3456&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799875893126666-AP-GOP-2016-Carson-Guns.jpg", "creator": "@freep", "site": "@freep", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600072714", "fb": {"app_id": 185931034751252}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Ben Carson, Barack Obama, Republicans, 2016 presidential race, Detroit"}, "article_summary": "Ben Carson speaks in Ankeny, Iowa, on Oct. 2, 2015.\n(Photo: Charlie Neibergall, AP)In early 2013, Ben Carson was largely known as a best-selling author, a celebrated pediatric neurosurgeon and subject of a television movie starring Cuba Gooding Jr.\n\u201cI suppose it was the National Prayer Breakfast speech that first attracted me,\u201d said John Philip Sousa IV, the great grandson of the famous composer and founder of the \u201cRun Ben Run\u201d super PAC in 2013 that has since transformed into \"Win Ben Win!\"\nWhile Obama sat just a few feet away, Carson gently, but forcefully, criticized the country\u2019s tax and health care policies.\nWhen Carson told the media he wasn\u2019t particularly interested in running for president but might change his mind if people clamored for his candidacy, Sousa began circulating petitions urging Carson to run."}
