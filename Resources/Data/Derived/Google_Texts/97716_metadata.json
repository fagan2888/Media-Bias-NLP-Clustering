Lisa Murkowski Lisa MurkowskiOvernight Energy: Lawmakers closing in on chemical safety deal GOP chair pushes Obama official on Arctic drilling plan McConnell touts 'Senate squad' in Wes Anderson-style video MORE (R-Alaska) and Heidi Heitkamp Heidi HeitkampThe Hill's 12:30 Report House Dems urge Senate panel to vote on Ex-Im Bank nominee Senate Dems frustrated over lack of action on Ex-Im Bank nominee MORE (D-N.D.) have introduced a bill to lift the 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports.\n\nThe bill would fulfill one of Murkowski\u2019s biggest energy priorities and allow American oil companies to export crude oil as they do petroleum products. It would also allow exports of condensate, a type of light crude oil.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s energy landscape has changed dramatically since the export ban was put in place in the 1970s. We have moved from energy scarcity to energy abundance. Unfortunately, our energy policies have not kept pace,\u201d Murkowski, the chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis legislation builds from bipartisan ideas, linking energy security and infrastructure to expanding exports and helping our allies. Our nation has an opportunity to embrace its role as a global energy powerhouse, sending a signal to the world that we are open for business and will stand by our friends in need.\u201d\n\nEleven Republicans have co-sponsored the bill, but Heitkamp is the only Democrat to sign on so far. She said Wednesday that she hopes to find more at some point.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking very closely at a path forward, very excited about the opportunity,\" she said in a short interview. \"We keep building out bipartisan support, and so, good news.\"\n\nThe oil industry cheered the move on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis bill will unlock America\u2019s energy potential and help U.S. energy production to stay competitive in a difficult market,\u201d American Petroleum Institute Executive Vice President Louis Finkel said in a statement. \u201cThe benefits are clear, and members of Congress in both the House and Senate have shown they are ready to act in a bipartisan way to support free trade.\u201d\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) called the bill \u201c critical for U.S. energy security, economic growth, increased investment in free trade, and new American jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch like the export of gasoline and diesel fuels from American refineries now helps keep refining jobs in America, oil exports will enable the U.S. to invest in more American shale crude development and keep those good jobs here,\u201d IPAA and a handful of other oil interests wrote in a letter to Murkowski and Heitkamp.\n\nLifting the ban has been a top priority for Murkowski and other Republicans, who have pitched the measure as a boon for the oil industry, a win for consumers and a national security and diplomacy issue.\n\nDemocrats have met the move with hesitancy, worrying that exporting more crude oil could lead to higher costs for consumers in the United States.\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Murkowski\u2019s Democratic counterpart on the Energy panel, has often asked the Energy Information Administration to study the impact it would have on gasoline prices in the United States.\n\n\u201cLower oil prices act like a tax cut for the vast majority of Americans. No one wants to see the price at the pump go up,\u201d she said at a March hearing on the export ban. \u201cI would rather have Americans get their own fiscal house in order, versus paying more at the pump for their transportation needs.\u201d\n\nGreen groups say lifting the ban \u2014 and the increased oil production associated with it \u2014 would have dire environmental impacts.\n\n\"Repealing the ban would open the floodgates to more crude oil extraction and the burning of petroleum products, which would worsen the impacts of climate disruption,\u201d Friends of the Earth Oceans and Vessels Program Director Marcie Keever said in a Wednesday statement.\n\nAthan Manual, the director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, said his biggest concern is how increased oil consumption around the world will impact climate change.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think we should be exporting global warming, basically, to other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think all the countries in the world should do what the U.S. is doing and dramatically reduce their use of fossil fuels, especially oil, to fight climate change.\u201d\n\nMurkowski said Wednesday she\u2019s still trying to find a way to pass the measure through the Senate. She said she should try attaching it to a broader energy bill, or it could up moving on its own.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to work the legislative route,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m committed to trying to change this outdated policy as it relates to oil exports and the ban.\u201d\n\n\u2014This post was updated at 3:03 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The bill would fulfill one of Sen.
