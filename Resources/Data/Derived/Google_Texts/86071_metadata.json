(Photo: Evan Siegle/Gannett Wisconsin Media)Buy Photo\n\nIn all of the debate over the cuts to the University of Wisconsin System in Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s budget plan, the group that has the most at stake is the most often overlooked:\n\nStudents.\n\nWalker has proposed cutting state funding for the UW System by about $300 million over the two-year, 2015-17 budget. That\u2019s about 13 percent of the current $1.2 billion yearly state funding. State money makes up about 20 percent of the System\u2019s $6 billion budget, although about $3.7 billion is restricted funding, such as federal grants or student loans.\n\nIn exchange, the governor said, he wants to create a public authority, which would give UW more autonomy to manage its budgets and freedom from legislative mandates. And he would extend the two-year tuition freeze another two years.\n\nSince Walker announced his budget plan in early February, the UW cuts have been the hottest topic and have led to further developments:\n\nWalker\u2019s plan initially changed the language in state statutes about the mission of the university, stressing career readiness but also taking out wording that reflected the time-honored Wisconsin Idea \u2014 that it should \u201cextend knowledge and its application beyond the boundaries of its campus\u201d and that \u201cbasic to every purpose of the system is the search for truth.\u201d After public outcry, the governor backed off, saying his instructions had been misinterpreted when the budget bill was written.\n\nMany UW System chancellors pushed back at the cuts, particularly UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank, who said they would damage the university\u2019s reputation and further hinder its ability to attract and retain faculty.\n\nThe UW Board of Regents pushed back, too, with Regent Margaret Farrow \u2014 a former Republican legislator and lieutenant governor and the mother of state Sen. Paul Farrow, a Republican leader \u2014 saying, \u201cIt\u2019s been cut, cut, cut and now this enormous hatchet job.\u201d\n\nUW System President Ray Cross walked a narrow line between a governor and legislators he doesn\u2019t want the System to further alienate and the campuses he oversees. But he, too, bristled at Walker\u2019s suggestion that UW professors need to work harder and teach more classes. And he recently said he\u2019ll resign if the $300 million cut is in the final version of the budget, along with the end of tenure, shared governance and academic freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, legislators of both parties are saying the cuts are wrong (the Democratic view) or cut too deeply (the view of some Republicans). Both Senate President Scott Fitzgerald and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos have expressed concerns about them.\n\nIt\u2019s not that students have been totally forgotten in all of this. But if the primary goal of public higher education in Wisconsin is to give as many students as possible the ability to get a high-quality education as affordably as possible \u2014 and it should be \u2014 that goal can help guide these UW budget decisions.\n\nNo, now is not the time to cut state funding of the UW System that deeply, even though it\u2019s a small percentage of the overall budget. We want \u2014 we need \u2014 more college-educated adults in Wisconsin, which still trails the average percentage among states.\n\nThe cuts would be particularly impactful at the two-year UW Colleges, like UW-Fox Valley in Menasha. These are our most cost-efficient campuses for students. UWFox\u2019s budget is 96 percent personnel costs. A cut would mean staff losses, bigger class sizes and, perhaps, fewer course offerings.\n\nVos has said one of his concerns about the proposed cuts is that it would make it tougher for students to graduate in four years. It\u2019s a valid concern.\n\nIt\u2019s also a fact that UW faculty pay, particularly outside of Madison, is below the pay at their peer-group colleges. That has an impact on educational quality, as well as the UW-Madison research that\u2019s invaluable to the state\u2019s economy.\n\nYes, reducing or eliminating the UW cut means that money will have to be cut somewhere else in the budget.\n\nHere\u2019s one suggestion: The Manufacturing and Agriculture Tax Credit, which was part of the 2011-13 budget, is projected to cost the state more than double what originally projected, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Because of its structure, it\u2019s been called \u201ca total giveaway to the wealthy.\u201d The added cost in the next budget? About $275 million.\n\nThere\u2019s one more factor in Walker\u2019s plan that could have a negative effect on students. The intended flexibility for the UW System to manage its own budgets would include \u2014 at this point, at least \u2014 the ability to set its own tuition after the 2015-17 budget.\n\nIf that results in a large tuition increase to make up for four years of freezes, it would show that the governor and Legislature were wrong to trust UW with its new freedom.\n\nIt would also show that whatever savings the state is able to make \u2014 or whatever funding the System is able to salvage \u2014 was achieved on the backs of those who could afford it least:\n\nStudents.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1bFn1T3", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Proposed cuts would end up hurting students and their futures.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "Proposed cuts would end up hurting students and their futures.", "title": "Stick to the mission: UW is too valuable to cut deeply", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/03/28/stick-mission-uw-valuable-cut-deeply/70610782/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Proposed cuts would end up hurting students and their futures.", "creator": "@postcrescent", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/864ae3547f734b1a557d02cccf418ff358b6ea39/c=311-0-1689-1378&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Appleton/2015/03/28/B9316775151Z.1_20150328192916_000_GFKABMN3I.1-0.jpg", "title": "Stick to the mission: UW is too valuable to cut deeply", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0361\"", "article_summary": "Yes, reducing or eliminating the UW cut means that money will have to be cut somewhere else in the budget.\nNo, now is not the time to cut state funding of the UW System that deeply, even though it\u2019s a small percentage of the overall budget.\nWalker has proposed cutting state funding for the UW System by about $300 million over the two-year, 2015-17 budget.\n(Photo: Evan Siegle/Gannett Wisconsin Media)Buy PhotoIn all of the debate over the cuts to the University of Wisconsin System in Gov.\nThat\u2019s about 13 percent of the current $1.2 billion yearly state funding."}
