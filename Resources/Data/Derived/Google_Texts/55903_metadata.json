That\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s like with Rusty, the 8-year-old chocolate Labrador who has spent the past six years spreading love and happy thoughts throughout the Toulon Rehabilitation and Health Care Center in Toulon, Ill.\n\nRusty\u2019s life has been pretty good since he was found by the sister of the nursing home\u2019s administrator, Sue VanDeRostyne, in 2008, when he was a stray running through her backyard. Since then, he\u2019s brought happiness to many a resident, cheering them up by being a dog to lean on \u2014 especially among those who have Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia.\n\n\u201cThey just lighten up,\u201d VanDeRostyne told McKnight\u2019s, a site dedicated to long-term care and assisted living news. \u201cRusty gets called so many different names because people who have had dogs in the past call him \u2018Brownie\u2019 or \u2018Missy.\u2019 He\u2019ll go over to them, he\u2019ll come and walk right over to the wheelchair and will stay until they\u2019re done petting him.\u201d\n\nBesides offering companionship, Rusty also helps with therapy. One resident, for example, refused to participate in therapy, but the nursing home staff knew that he loved Rusty. They made him believe that he was just throwing the ball for Rusty to fetch, but it was really a way \u201cto get him to do that activity, and they\u2019d do their therapy session together,\u201d VanDeRostyne told McKnight\u2019s.\n\nIf you want to see Rusty\u2019s love in action, check out the video below.\n\nNews and Weather For The Quad Cities -", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chocolate labrador, rusty chocolate labrador, chocolate lab, therapy dog, rusty helps nursing home patients, nursing home, toulon rehabilitation and health care center", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Rusty, a formerly stray chocolate Labrador, has been helping nursing home residents in Illinois find comfort for the past six years.", "title": "Rusty, A Chocolate Lab, Brings Comfort To Nursing Home Residents", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rusty-8-year-old-chocolate-lab-brings-comfort-nursing-home-residents-270512", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/03/labrador.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rusty, a formerly stray chocolate Labrador, has been helping nursing home residents in Illinois find comfort for the past six years.", "title": "Rusty, A Chocolate Lab, Brings Comfort To Nursing Home Residents", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rusty-8-year-old-chocolate-lab-brings-comfort-nursing-home-residents-270512", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/03/labrador.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/03/labrador.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-03-03T21:47:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-03T21:47:37-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Rusty, a formerly stray chocolate Labrador, has been helping nursing home residents in Illinois find comfort for the past six years."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf33e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey just lighten up,\u201d VanDeRostyne told McKnight\u2019s, a site dedicated to long-term care and assisted living news.\nOne resident, for example, refused to participate in therapy, but the nursing home staff knew that he loved Rusty.\nWho doesn\u2019t love a friendly dog, whose only purpose \u2014 seemingly \u2014 is to bring them happiness?\nThey made him believe that he was just throwing the ball for Rusty to fetch, but it was really a way \u201cto get him to do that activity, and they\u2019d do their therapy session together,\u201d VanDeRostyne told McKnight\u2019s.\nIf you want to see Rusty\u2019s love in action, check out the video below."}
