Well, other establishment financial minds foresee the same thing.\n\nIn a report obtained by CNBC, bank analyst Dick Bove of Rafferty Capital Markets says economic growth, interest rates and inflation higher will transpire for the next little while and then a recession will hit the United States in 2018. In addition, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note will increase to eight percent in 2017.\n\n\u201cIn order to develop earnings models for banking companies, you must have a \u2018worldview\u2019 related to money supply, the economy, inflation and interest rates,\u201d Bove wrote. \u201cThe view that I am using . . . implies a relatively fast growing economy, increasing rates of inflation, much higher interest rates, and a move back to recession by 2018.\n\nMany are concerned on Wall Street because the M2 money supply (currency, demand deposits, time deposits and coins) has outgrown the gross domestic product since the Great Recession and is currently expanding at more than five percent annually.
