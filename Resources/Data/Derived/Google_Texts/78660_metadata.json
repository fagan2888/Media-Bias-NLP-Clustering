The importance of physical fitness in the development of cognitive and memory skills have long been extoled by scientists. Cardiorespiratory capacity, muscular strength, and motor ability are components of physical fitness that have been known to improve mental health.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by the University of North Texas, healthy heart and lungs are one of the most important factors for middle school students to make good grades in math and reading. \u201cCardiorespiratory fitness was the only factor that we consistently found to have an impact on both boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 grades on reading and math tests. This provides more evidence that schools need to re-examine any policies that have limited students\u2019 involvement in physical education classes,\u201d said study co-author Trent A. Petrie.\n\nResearchers from the University of Illinois also found a connection between exercise and the size of the brain in 9 and 10- year-old children. MRI techniques showed that physically active children had bigger hippocampi as compared to their less active peers and did better in memory tests. Researchers also determined the different effects that cardiorespiratory capacity, muscular strength, and motor ability have on the brain and how they influence academic performance. \"Because these physical fitness components are highly associated with each other, it is important to differentiate which physical fitness components are important in relation to academic performance,\" said Irene Esteban-Caornejo from the Autonomous University of Madrid in a press release.\n\nThe research involved analyzing records of 2,038 Spanish children and adolescents between the ages of 6 to 18 years. The data included complete records of physical fitness, body composition, and academic performance. Esteban- Cornejo and the UP & DOWN Study Group members found that cardiorespiratory capacity and motor ability profoundly affected academic performance both independently and combined. But better motor ability seemed to produce better academic benefits than cardiorespiratory capacity.\n\nIn contrast, children and adolescents who had both lower levels of cardiorespiratory capacity and motor ability had lower grades. Cardiorespiratory exercises include swimming, outdoor cycling, tennis, skipping, jogging, soccer, basketball etc while motor fitness exercises include agility exercises like ice-skating and skiing. Muscular strength was not independently associated with academic performance. \"Having high levels of cardiorespiratory and motor fitness may, to some extent, reduce the risk of school failure,\" noted Esteban-Cornejo.\n\nThe authors stress the need to promote physical activities in schools that include aerobic exercises and motor tasks to enhance cardiorespiratory capacity and motor ability, thereby improving academic development.\n\nSource: Esteban-Cornejo I, Tejero-Gonz\u00e1lez C, Mart\u00ednez-G\u00f3mez D, et al.
