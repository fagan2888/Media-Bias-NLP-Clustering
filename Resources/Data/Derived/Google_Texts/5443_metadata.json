Now, for the first time since the law\u2019s inception, open enrollment appears to be, well, actually focused on signing up uninsured Americans for health insurance.\n\nBetween November 1 and January 31, men and women eligible to enroll for medical coverage\u2014including 304,000 metro Atlantans\u2014can once again shop for a variety of different plans at HealthCare.gov. To help promote the Health Insurance Marketplace, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell visited Atlanta earlier last Friday to drum up support for open enrollment for the health-insurance exchange. The White House recently named Atlanta as one of 20 cities involved in its \u201cHealthy Communities Challenge\u201d aimed at signing up more people for healthcare plans. The winning city will land a visit from President Barack Obama.\n\nDuring her Atlanta stop, Burwell visited a Castleberry Hill salon to spread the word about open enrollment. She then stopped by a \u201cHealth Insurance Storefront\u201d on Luckie Street, where people can enroll for health insurance at a brick-and-mortar location, and gave a few remarks alongside Fulton County Chairman John Eaves and Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams. From there, she swung by Manuel\u2019s Tavern, where she chatted with local community leaders before heading over to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAt the Poncey-Highland watering hole, Burwell chatted with us about the current open enrollment period, Georgia\u2019s rejection of Medicaid expansion, and the ongoing work to fight Ebola. This interview is condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nFor starters, how\u2019s open enrollment going in metro Atlanta during this signup period, compared to past years?\n\nHere in Atlanta, we began with a large with number of folks who are uninsured and eligible. Progress has been made, but we know it\u2019s a city where more can be made. You also have good support for it. That\u2019s how we selected Atlanta as [one of 20] Healthy Communities. So it\u2019s a combination of the two.\n\nWith regard to the beginning of open enrollment and our goals, we think we can move the numbers of the [national] marketplace to 10 million by the end of next year. But it\u2019s important to keep people focused on the uninsured. It\u2019s not about the means by which you get there, but what we want is people to have access to insurance and healthcare.\n\nSo far, we\u2019re doing what we did last year, putting out the numbers to date on a weekly basis. Those numbers are overall, not state-by-state at this point. We know 500,000 people did planned selections and enrolled in that first week. I would describe it this way: Off to a solid start, but we have a lot of work to do.\n\nThis is the first year of open enrollment where there\u2019s not a major issue hanging over the signup period, whether it\u2019s a broken website, or a U.S. Supreme Court challenge. How much does that help your cause in a place like Atlanta?\n\nWe feel fortunate to not have the challenges you described, and we have learning under our belt in listening to the consumer. The number of people we\u2019re targeting is much smaller. That\u2019s a good problem to have. These folks clearly haven\u2019t come [to sign up] in two years. There\u2019s a higher threshold with them. It\u2019s challenging, but we\u2019re going to work smarter and better with some of the headwinds not existing as much. There\u2019s still great progress to be made in Atlanta and Georgia at large.\n\nWhen you say \u201csmarter and better,\u201d what do you specifically mean?\n\nSpecifically, smarter and better has to do with affordability. We\u2019ve studied it. We\u2019ve worked with consumers currently in the Marketplace. Surveys of those outside the Marketplace by Kaiser and others show us that affordability is the primary issue. So it\u2019s really understanding the major issues and then communicating about it. You\u2019ve heard me say there are 7 out of 10 [people who can get a healthcare plan for less than $75 per month]. It\u2019s getting that information out to consumers so they can think about it.\n\nThe second thing is continuing to learn how to improve the site. Speed of the site is up. Backend stuff we\u2019ve done. For some young people, they care about speed. There\u2019s specific technical things with the website. But then it\u2019s how we do outreach\u2014we\u2019re focused on local markets and that\u2019s why we have 20 cites that we\u2019ve named Healthy Communities. We know this happens on the ground in local communities through local stakeholders.\n\nGiven the early struggles of the Affordable Care Act, is it inevitable that a certain percentage of people\u2014such as the portion of the 15 percent of Georgia residents who are uninsured despite being eligible\u2014won\u2019t be willing to sign up? Or do you think you can work past those challenges?\n\nI think we can overcome that. The question of what went before is something that\u2019s overcomeable [sic]. It\u2019s now about determining what are the other decisions people are making their decisions on. That\u2019s why communicating about affordability is so important. Communicating about the fee [for not signing up] is also important.\n\nThere are roughly 304,000 metro Atlantans who are uninsured and eligible for open enrollment that you\u2019re targeting with your visit. In Georgia, there\u2019s more\u2014over 400,000\u2014who would also be eligible if state officials stopped blocking Medicaid expansion. As elected officials in Southern states mull the merits of Medicaid expansion, as Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley last week acknowledged he was doing, what do you think are the lasting consequences of opposing that policy?\n\nThe effects of the lack of expansion in states are on individuals\u2019 health and financial wellbeing. We know the changes that have occurred, whether that\u2019s the number of people who have trouble paying health bills, to what we\u2019re saying in the expansion states with the numbers of the population coming in to have their diabetes treated, to the questions of the economics. We know that rural hospital closures are an issue across the country. That\u2019s about the hospitals and their surrounding populations. But we also know there\u2019s more closures in states that don\u2019t expand. We know uncompensated care has been reduced dramatically. It\u2019s reduced more in states that have expansion. There\u2019s a whole list of things happening right now. Some of them are about individuals, and some of them are about community economics, and some of them are about the state\u2019s economics.\n\nNow there seems to be two ways of going about Medicaid expansion: the moral argument\u2014that it\u2019s the right thing to do\u2014and the economic argument that has been used by Gov. Nathan Deal and Republican state lawmakers to argue against it. As states like Georgia continue to discuss Medicaid expansion, what does the road forward look like to you regarding both of those rationales in this policy debate?\n\nThe economics of the issue should be discussed\u2014and what it means for different states. As recently as two weeks ago, Montana came in. You\u2019ve seen a serious conversation in South Dakota. These are not Southern states. But they are deeply conservative states that have the same concerns about their economies as the state of Georgia. As people continue to debate, let\u2019s look at the economic analysis of what it means to the state in terms of the funds that will come in, and what it means overall to the communities and the hospitals. What is going to happen is that support for Medicaid expansion will continue to build. You hear the Alabama governor. You\u2019ve heard conversations in Louisiana. You saw that, while it didn\u2019t get there, there was a serious effort in Florida. Even in these Southern states, you\u2019re seeing those conversations.\n\nAs time and experience build, the governors will see it. We\u2019re at 30 states plus D.C. We\u2019ve added Pennsylvania under a Republican governor. We\u2019ve added Indiana under a Republican governor. We\u2019ve added Alaska under a Republican governor. It\u2019s coming back up in places: Michigan, Arkansas, New Hampshire. We\u2019re going to continue working through each of those states.\n\nDo you see it as being just a matter of time before all join\u2014some taking longer than others?\n\nYes. Because it\u2019s a continuum of insurance. That\u2019s what gets missed in the conversation. [If you get insurance through an employer], the company gets a tax break, and the company subsidizes your insurance. Whether you\u2019re in Medicare, subsidized insurance for the elderly; whether it\u2019s you and me, with employer-based care in which the tax benefit occurs; or whether you\u2019re in the original Medicaid or Medicaid expansion, a population in which a large percentage is working, it\u2019s a continuum of insurance. As a nation, we\u2019ve come to recognize the importance of health insurance. People are subsidized in different ways at different levels. That\u2019s going to happen because it\u2019s getting built into the system of the nation.\n\nThis is a space where the market hasn\u2019t worked in terms of information and transparency. That\u2019s one of the most important things the Affordable Care Act does\u2014now you can find out who in this country is receiving the most Medicare payments, you can find out what physicians are receiving payments from pharmaceuticals, you can find out what insurance companies want to raise rates more than 10 percent going into the season. That\u2019s all information that didn\u2019t exist before. The more we create transparency, the more we empower consumers, and support a market across the entire space.\n\nYour final stop in Atlanta is at the CDC. Obviously, the CDC as well as Emory Hospital played major roles in the fight against the Ebola epidemic. Looking back to that saga, what are the biggest takeaways you got from that experience and the role of the region\u2019s agencies in that international effort?\n\nI\u2019ll be meeting with some of the Ebola teams. You\u2019ve probably seen the news that Sierra Leone is Ebola-free. We\u2019ll discuss the progress that\u2019s been made. In the CDC realm, it\u2019s the commitment of the folks here\u2014I think it\u2019s over 3,000\u2014that have gone to West Africa. I\u2019ll meet with people who have gone three rounds. There\u2019s an incredible commitment: One CDC person canoed blood samples [to get them delivered.] The commitment of the public servants in this country, whether it\u2019s the work CDC did abroad and the people here in Atlanta, where your Department of Public Health did tracking and tracing of people. It wasn\u2019t easy. And then there\u2019s an institution like Emory Hospital that didn\u2019t flinch, and was incredibly standup in doing something that was hard and risky, and then delivered with the utmost quality in the world.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.categories": "News & Opinion,", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/11/Burwell300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Max Blau", "description": "Sylvia Burwell, head of the Health and Human Services, on open enrollment, Medicaid expansion in Georgia, and the CDC\u2019s continued fight against Ebola.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "sailthru.link": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/hhs-secretary-states-like-georgia-will-eventually-see-the-merits-of-medicaid-expansion/", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Magazine", "description": "Sylvia Burwell, head of the Health and Human Services, on open enrollment, Medicaid expansion in Georgia, and the CDC\u2019s continued fight against Ebola.", "title": "HHS Secretary: States like Georgia will eventually see the merits of Medicaid expansion - Atlanta Magazine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/11/Burwell300.jpg", "height": 300}, "updated_time": "2015-11-16T09:07:37-04:00", "url": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/hhs-secretary-states-like-georgia-will-eventually-see-the-merits-of-medicaid-expansion/", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.image.221": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/11/Burwell300-221x290.jpg", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-16 09:05:10", "sailthru.image.100": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/11/Burwell300-100x120.jpg", "robots": "noodp", "sailthru.title": "HHS Secretary: States like Georgia will eventually see the merits of Medicaid expansion", "sailthru.image.400": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/11/Burwell300.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Affordable Care Act,Atlanta,Georgia,HHS,Medicaid Expansion,Sylvia Burwell,News & Opinion,News and Culture,", "article": {"section": "News & Opinion", "tag": "Sylvia Burwell", "published_time": "2015-11-16T09:05:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-16T09:07:37-04:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/maxcblau"}, "news_keywords": "affordable care act, atlanta, georgia, hhs, medicaid expansion, sylvia burwell", "sailthru.description": "Sylvia Burwell, head of the Health and Human Services, on open enrollment, Medicaid expansion in Georgia, and the CDC\u2019s continued fight against Ebola.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/11/Burwell300.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.image.150": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/11/Burwell300-150x150.jpg"}, "article_summary": "HHS Secretary: States like Georgia will eventually see the merits of Medicaid expansionSylvia Burwell, head of the Health and Human Services, on open enrollment, Medicaid expansion in Georgia, and the CDC\u2019s continued fight against Ebola.\nAs elected officials in Southern states mull the merits of Medicaid expansion, as Alabama Gov.\nShe then stopped by a \u201cHealth Insurance Storefront\u201d on Luckie Street, where people can enroll for health insurance at a brick-and-mortar location, and gave a few remarks alongside Fulton County Chairman John Eaves and Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams.\nWhat is going to happen is that support for Medicaid expansion will continue to build.\nIn Georgia, there\u2019s more\u2014over 400,000\u2014who would also be eligible if state officials stopped blocking Medicaid expansion."}
