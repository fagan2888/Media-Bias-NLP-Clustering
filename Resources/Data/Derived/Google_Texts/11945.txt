That take is larger than the election-year total NRCC brought in when it had former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as a headliner last year.

The total shows the controversial former vice president is still a big draw in GOP circles, and the haul could give the NRCC a leg up on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in their monthly fundraising battle.
