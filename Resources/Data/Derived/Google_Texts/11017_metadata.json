His foster parents Brenda and Kent Davis worry about what might happen if he\u2019s injured on the football field. They want to adopt him before his next birthday so he can get on their insurance.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be a part of our family forever no matter what, whether its adoption or not,\u201d says Brenda Davis. \u201cI would really like to make sure he's covered.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nListenListening...\n\n3:34\n\nHealth insurance is far from the minds of most older teens and young adults. And for most, it doesn\u2019t need to be. Under the Affordable Care Act, young adults can stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until their 26th birthday. Kids aging out of foster care can also stay on Medicaid.\n\nBut having coverage is not the same thing as accessing health care, and without parents to guide them through the health care system, former foster kids can get lost.\n\nThere is scant support in navigating the health care system for the more than 20,000 kids who age out of foster care each year, says Debrah Rosen who manages strategic partnerships at Hillside, a non-profit that works for child welfare in Rochester, New York. But like all young people, they need parental guidance.\n\nKent, Brenda, and Alex Davis chat and laugh together on the couch after dinner.CREDIT MICHELLE FAUST\n\n\u201cI didn't think about [health coverage] when I was seventeen either. I panicked when I needed to go to the doctor. I panicked directly to the phone call to my mom,\u201d she recalls.\n\nHillside provides specialized services and training for kids that age out of the system in Monroe County in Western New York.\n\nOne first step for kids who age out is to sign up with Medicaid.\n\n\u201cYou can't just assume that it's going to happen through the miraculous volition of a nineteen year old who would much rather be doing something else,\u201d says Rosen. \u201cIt needs to be somebody's job and that job description needs to be informed by the real needs and circumstances of young people.\u201d\n\nA new idea in New York, may be the solution. As part of the state\u2019s Medicaid redesign, patients will soon be connected with care managers, people who oversee their health care.\n\nAlex Davis is looking forward to his upcoming eighteenth birthday. He says he's doing much better since his foster parents adopted him in 2014.CREDIT MICHELLE FAUST\n\nThis could be crucial for former foster kids. Not only do many of them lack stable family relationships, but kids who\u2019ve been through the system are more like to suffer from mental health concerns\u2014about a quarter of them have post-traumatic stress disorder. And they\u2019re also likely to have other chronic medical conditions.\n\n\u201cWe know that people with co-occurring medical conditions and mental health needs are less likely to consistently access effective care,\u201d says Rosen.\n\nNew York\u2019s Medicaid care managers could help solve that for foster kids. That\u2019s not the case everywhere.\n\n\u201cWe can assume and should assume that unless there's a very purposeful and assertive effort within a state to get the arms around that population of young people that they are trending in the same direction as any population that struggling with those issues.\u201d says Rosen.\n\nThe Davises are raising two other teenage boys along with Daryl. They became foster parents after their biological sons were grown, in 2010. The Davises make sure to teach their boys lessons about health insurance, lessons that they learned the hard way.\n\n\u201cI learned about health insurance at a young age because I didn't have any when I gave birth at eighteen so we paid cash we had to pay and make payments,\u201d recalls Brenda.\n\nSo now they take time to talk their sons through the basics of accessing health care.\n\n\u201cI look at health insurance, like it\u2019s another utility. It's just one of those things that everybody needs to understand at some point when they're taking care of themselves,\u201d says Brenda. \u201cIt's just because these kids have been dealing with adult problems all along. And I guess we want to show them adult solutions,\u201d Brenda says.\n\nThe Davises\u2019 older son Alex, who they adopted from foster care in 2014, deals with PTSD, anxiety and depression. Alex says his health has improved with the support of his adoptive parents, and the services they\u2019ve helped connect him with. He\u2019s looking forward to turning 18 soon and going to college, but not feeling quite ready for all the adult decisions he\u2019ll have to face.\n\n\u201cSooner or later, I\u2019m going to have to figure it out. You know. That's one of the things that teenagers like to procrastinate,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don't want to deal with the reality and they just want their parents to help them with their health insurance. \u201d\n\nBrenda Davis\u2019 focus is on making sure the three teenage boys in her care are prepared for health adulthoods--and she loves doing it. \u201cI would say I feel like I won the foster parent lottery three times with these guys. They're just the greatest.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Science and Technology", "description": "At 17 years old, Daryl Chatman is more interested in football than he is in health insurance.
