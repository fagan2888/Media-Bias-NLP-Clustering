No one appeared to be seriously injured as good Samaritans pulled children and adults from the burning building.\n\nWitnesses who lined the street for hours say one woman and young child were pulled by a man from a first-floor window, flames lapping around them.\n\nAnother group including two women and their young children was escorted from an exterior first-floor patio \u2014 fire on either side of them \u2014 by a 22-year-old man who asked not to be identified.\n\n\u201cThey were petrified; I saw them and made sure they were safe,\u201d said the man, who lives in the neighborhood and was walking to his truck when he saw the black smoke that was a constant presence in the Endion neighborhood throughout the afternoon.\n\nMultiple people were taken to the hospital by ambulance for what witnesses said was smoke inhalation, describing one good Samaritan as sitting on the boulevard afterward and coughing profusely before being taken away by ambulance.\n\nThe fire was first reported at around 12:45 p.m. Suppression efforts lasted into the evening. Firefighters lined up their spent oxygen tanks on the boulevard across the street, 13 in a row at one point. They assaulted the blaze with water cannons and other suppression efforts. As more firefighters arrived, two civilian men sprinted to their parked pickup truck to move it farther away from a fire hydrant at the corner of East Second Street and North 18th Avenue East.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stabilizing, but things can change in a hurry,\u201d said Assistant Fire Chief Clint Reff, who was orchestrating Duluth Fire Department efforts at the scene. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep it on the one half.\u201d\n\nThe apartments \u2014 at 1705 and 1707 E. Second St. \u2014 appear to be one building, but are separated by a concrete wall between them. It was the eastern-most building, at 1707, that was on fire. Flames engulfed the street-side front of the building, claiming all three floors, with flames and smoke pouring out the roof. In the alley on the building\u2019s backside, smoke was so thick it shrouded the building. Firefighters used ladder trucks on either side of the building \u2014 one boom extending up five stories high \u2014 to target water onto the roof and under the eaves. Vinyl siding was stripped off the building by the water pressure. At first, the sloped front lawn was charred black in front of the building\u2019s entrance, but later it carried rushing water into the street. The building dripped with constant water, but flames could be seen inside the building throughout the firefighters\u2019 efforts.\n\nFirefighters battle Duluth apartment fire. Steve Kuchera / Forum News Service\n\nThe owner of the building, Kent Oliver, was eating Easter dinner at his son\u2019s house when he was first alerted to the fire. He arrived in time to console some tenants. Oliver owns 17 apartment complexes and operates under the name Oliver Management Services. The apartments that burned \u2014 called Applewood Knoll \u2014 are affordable housing for families and people who are disabled.\n\n\u201cIt is a worst nightmare,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping nobody is hurt and everybody got out. The building is just a physical asset. Hopefully, everybody is out.\u201d\n\nReff confirmed after 2 p.m. that the building was evacuated.\n\nCarl Brodin comforts his girlfriend Cynthia Fox. Steve Kuchera / Forum News Service\n\nCynthia Fox was in the building when it caught fire. She lives on the second floor and recalled looking to her patio and seeing an orange ball of flames beyond her black drapes. She hollered \u201cfire, fire,\u201d she said, and \u201ccalled out my ex-husband\u2019s name by accident.\u201d A moment later, her patio door blew out. She said she heard an explosion and later speculated an oxygen tank had erupted in the apartment beneath hers.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even see; my glasses were inside,\u201d said the 58-year-old Fox, who sat covered in a blanket on a neighbor\u2019s front porch steps. \u201cI just grabbed my robe and out the door I went.\u201d\n\nFox lives with her 16-year-old grandson in the apartment. He was in Cumberland, Wis., for the weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even going to tell him today,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just lost everything.\u201d\n\nDuluth police officers kept the scene safe and even brought Easter baskets to crying young children belonging to Jessica Petersen and another young mother.\n\nA Duluth police officer holds Easter presents at the scene of apartment building fire. Steve Kuchera / Forum News Service\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re miserable,\u201d Petersen said of her two children. \u201cThey just want to go home, but I don\u2019t think we have a home to go back to.\u201d\n\nHotel arrangements were being cobbled together at the scene for displaced residents. Fire Marshal Marnie Grondahl was investigating the scene and interviewing witnesses; there was witness speculation the fire started in the lawn. Fox said she saw flames outside her patio door before noticing any smoke.\n\nThe unnamed good Samaritan said, \u201cWhen I ran up, everything was already up in flames.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,Minnesota,fires,duluth mn", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Brady Slater", "og": {"site_name": "Grand Forks Herald", "description": "DULUTH, Minn. \u2013 A 20-unit, three-story apartment building was decimated by fire Sunday on the 1700 block of East Second Street.
