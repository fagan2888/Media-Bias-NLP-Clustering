It\u2019s a government bailout.\n\nAdministration officials can\u2019t say it for political reasons. And they don\u2019t have to say it because it\u2019s already in the Affordable Care Act, buried deep.\n\nFirst, Section 1341, the \u201creinsurance\u201d fund collected from insurers and self-insuring employers at a nifty $63 a head. (Who do you think the cost is passed on to?) This yields about $20 billion over three years to cover losses.\n\nThen there is Section 1342, the \u201crisk corridor\u201d provision that mandates a major taxpayer payout covering up to 80 percent of insurance-company losses.\n\nNever heard of these? That\u2019s the beauty of passing a bill of such monstrous length. You can insert a chicken soup recipe and no one will notice.\n\nNancy Pelosi was right: We\u2019d have to pass the damn thing to know what\u2019s in it. Well, now we have and now we know.\n\nThe whole scheme was risky enough to begin with \u2014 getting enough enrollees and making sure 40 percent were young and healthy. Obamacare is already far behind its own enrollment estimates. But things have gotten worse. The administration has been changing the rules repeatedly \u2014 with every scrimmage-line audible raising costs and diminishing revenue.\n\n1 of 8 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 What Obama didn\u2019t know View Photos The many controversies that the White House says the president was kept in the dark about. Caption The many controversies that the White House says the president was kept in the dark about. Health-care insurance cancellations\n\n\n\nIn fact, that wasn\u2019t the case. Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers. The president said he wasn\u2019t aware his promise before the rollout would result in cancellations, and Obama had repeatedly stated that, although new health-care insurance would be available through the Affordable Care Act, those willing to stay on their plan would be able to do so.In fact, that wasn\u2019t the case.

Then it exempted from the individual mandate people whose policies were canceled (by Obamacare). And for those who did join the exchanges, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is \u201cstrongly encouraging\u201d insurers \u2014 during the \u201ctransition\u201d \u2014 to cover doctors and drugs not included in their clients\u2019 plans.\n\nThe insurers were stunned. Told to give free coverage. Deprived of their best customers. Forced to offer stripped-down \u201ccatastrophic\u201d plans to people age 30 and over (contrary to the law). These dictates, complained an insurance industry spokesman, could \u201cdestabilize\u201d the insurance market.\n\nTranslation: How are we going to survive this? Shrinking revenues and rising costs could bring on the \u201cdeath spiral\u201d \u2014 an unbalanced patient pool forcing huge premium increases (to restore revenue) that would further unbalance the patient pool as the young and healthy drop out.\n\nEnd result? Insolvency \u2014 before which the insurance companies will pull out of Obamacare.\n\nSolution? A huge government bailout. It\u2019s Obamacare\u2019s escape hatch. And \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 it\u2019s already baked into the law.\n\nWhich is why the GOP needs to act. Obamacare is a Rube Goldberg machine with hundreds of moving parts. Without viable insurance companies doing the work, it falls apart. No bailout, no Obamacare.\n\nSuch a bill would be overwhelmingly popular because Americans hate fat-cat bailouts of any kind. Why should their tax dollars be spent not only saving giant insurers but also rescuing this unworkable, unbalanced, unstable, unpopular money-pit of a health-care scheme?\n\nThe GOP House should pass it and send it to Harry Reid\u2019s Democratic Senate. Democrats know it could be fatal for Obamacare. The only alternative would be single-payer. And try selling that to the country after the spectacularly incompetent launch of \u2014 and subsequent widespread disaffection with \u2014 mere semi-nationalization.\n\nDo you really think vulnerable Democrats up for reelection will vote for a bailout? And who better to slay Obamacare than a Democratic Senate \u2014 liberalism repudiating its most important creation of the last 50 years.\n\nWant to be even bolder? Attach the anti-bailout bill to the debt ceiling. That and nothing else. Dare the president to stand up and say: \u201cI\u2019m willing to let the country default in order to preserve a massive bailout for insurance companies.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Republicans made unrealistic and unpopular debt-ceiling demands \u2014 and lost badly. They learned their lesson. Last year, Republicans presented one simple unassailable debt-ceiling demand \u2014 that the Senate pass its first budget in four years.\n\nWho could argue with that? The Senate capitulated within two days.\n\nWho can argue with no bailout? Let the Senate Democrats decide: Support the bailout and lose the Senate. Or oppose the bailout and bury Obamacare.\n\nHappy New Year.\n\nRead more from Charles Krauthammer\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Subsidizing the insurance industry isn\u2019t the answer to Obamacare\u2019s woes.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Krauthammer/95978776589", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Subsidizing the insurance industry isn\u2019t the answer to Obamacare\u2019s woes.", "title": "Charles Krauthammer: Stop the bailout, now", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-stop-the-bailout-now/2014/01/02/6b3087a2-73d7-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/02/Production/Digital/homepage/Images/117118210.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@krauthammer"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-stop-the-bailout-now/2014/01/02/6b3087a2-73d7-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "charles krauthammer, obamacare, affordable care act, health insurance, kathleen sebilius, dealth spiral, insurance subsidies, nancy pelosi", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Krauthammer/95978776589"}, "news_keywords": "charles krauthammer, obamacare, affordable care act, health insurance, kathleen sebilius, dealth spiral, insurance subsidies, nancy pelosi", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "6b3087a2-73d7-11e3-8def-a33011492df2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8014\"", "article_summary": "First order of business for the returning Congress: The No Bailout for Insurance Companies Act of 2014.\nLet the Senate Democrats decide: Support the bailout and lose the Senate.\nRead more from Charles Krauthammer\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\nBut of course there\u2019s a Plan B.
