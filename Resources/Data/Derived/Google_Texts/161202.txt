About 25 people made the trek from Clarksville's Veterans of Foreign Wars post to the Sellersburg American Legion hall Saturday for the first "Purple Heart Ride," a tribute to those who have served their country and have been wounded in action.

The ride was the idea of the Righteous and Wicked Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club of Kentuckyiana, according to its president, Matt Palmer, a retired federal air marshal and current Clarksville court bailiff.

"It's an important ride because a lot of troops come back with physical or emotional wounds and they need to be supported," he said, adding that it lets veterans "know we care."

Clarksville police officer Steve Cunningham, who has a Purple Heart and Bronze Star from his service in Afghanistan, was the ride's grand marshal.

"I am happy and honored to do it," Cunningham said. "I wasn't able to bring home one of my soldiers (recalling a member of his platoon that lost his life in Afghanistan) so I do it for others who can't."

Proceeds from the ride will benefit the national Wounded Warrior Project.
