Bay Mills Indian Community, Et Al. By way of introduction, a description of what brought the parties to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe basis of Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community has to do with a casino built by the Bay Mills Indian Community, more than one hundred miles from its reservation. It was built and operated for a time (it is now shut down) on land Bay Mills had purchased with \u201cclaims settlement\u201d monies. It had received those monies in compensation for what was said to be a \u201ctaking\u201d of its traditional territory. Bay Mills claimed that the lands it purchased constituted \u201cIndian land\u201d for the reason that they used their settlement monies to buy the land and the settlement agreement states that lands bought with the money shall be \"held as Indian lands are held.\"\n\nThe State of Michigan claimed that the land purchased by Bay Mills for a casino was not \u201cIndian land\u201d and that Bay Mills Indian Community was operating an illegal gambling operation on the land it purchased. Using a hypothetical, the State of Michigan said that if a foreign nation, such as France, were to purchase land in Michigan and open up an illegal business\u2014whether it be gambling or some other pursuit\u2014Michigan could successfully go after France. Yet when it comes to an Indian nation or tribe that has refused to waive its sovereign immunity, the State of Michigan cannot proceed. The Michigan Solicitor General argued that if the Supreme Court decides the Bay Mills Indian Community has blanket sovereign immunity, this will give Bay Mills Indian Community greater sovereign immunity than a foreign nation would have in the same situation.\n\nThere is however, a key difference. The Bay Mills Indian Community is Anishinaabe (sometimes called \u201cOjibway\u201d), and Bay Mills had used federal \u201ctrust\u201d monies to purchase lands within its traditional Anishinaabe territory. This is not the same as a foreign nation purchasing land in the State of Michigan, or, for that matter, purchasing land in that part of the Anishinaabe territory now commonly called \u201cMichigan.\u201d The Anishinaabe are in a very different position than any other non-Anishinaabe government or people in regard to their ancestral lands.\n\nU.S. attorney Edwin S. Kneedler, on behalf the United States government, spoke in support of Bay Mills Indian Community by talking about the \u201csovereignty\u201d of \u201cIndian tribes.\u201d As Kneedler stated: \u201cThe Constitution refers to Indian tribes\u2014Worcester v. Georgia announced that Indian tribes are sovereigns. We make treaties with sovereigns.\u201d\n\nIn response to Mr. Kneedler\u2019s claim that Worcester v. Georgia had \u201cannounced that Indian tribes are sovereigns,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said: \u201cThey [the tribes] are quasi sovereigns. Which means--\u201d\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg quickly interjected: \u201cDependent sovereigns.\u201d\n\nChief Justice Roberts, following Justice Ginsberg\u2019s prompting, continued: \u201cDependent sovereigns which is surprising that the scope of their immunity exceeds that of States or foreign nations.\u201d\n\nThus, Chief Justice Roberts made the statement, as if it were a fact, that Indian \u201ctribes\u201d are \u201cquasi sovereigns.\u201d As an adjective, the word quasi is usually interpreted as \u201chaving some resemblance to a given thing: SEEMING, VIRTUAL.\u201d\n\nAs stated previously, Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 definitive statement that Indian \u201ctribes\u201d are \u201cquasi sovereigns\u201d or \u201cdependent sovereigns\u201d was in response to Mr. Kneedler\u2019s comment about Worcester v. Georgia. Yet in Worcester the Supreme Court never characterized Indian nations or \u201ctribes\u201d as being either \u201cquasi\u201d or \u201cdependent sovereigns.\u201d In fact, using the Delaware Nation treaty with the United States as a model, Chief Justice Marshall said in Worcester: \u201cThis treaty, in its language, and in its provisions, is formed, as near as may be, on the model of treaties between the crowned heads of Europe.\u201d\n\nAnd yet for purposes of reduction and diminishment, Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Ginsberg, and Mr. Kneedler, felt compelled to attach the modifier \u201cquasi\u201d and then \u201cdependent\u201d to the word \u201csovereign\u201d to characterize \u201cIndian tribes.\u201d In fact, Mr. Kneedler invoked U.S. authority over Indian nations when his statement for the United States: \u201cThey [Indian tribes] are dependent sovereigns, but they are dependent the plenary power of Congress, not the plenary power of this Court.\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter, Justice Scalia asked Deputy U.S. Solicitor Kneedler: \u201cWho made these Indian tribe[s] sovereign?\n\nKneedler responded (in contradiction to Worcester v. Georgia): \u201cThe [U.S.] Constitution.\u201d\n\nScalia: \u201c\u2026Who decided the Indian tribes are sovereign?\u201d\n\nKneedler: \u201cThe Constitution -- \u201d\n\nScalia: \u201cWho pronounced them to be sovereign?\u201d\n\nKneedler: \u201cThis Court.\u201d\n\nScalia: \u201cThis Court.\u201d\n\nKneedler: \u201cBut -- \u201d\n\nScalia: \u201cSo I assume that this Court could also determine the scope of their sovereignty.\u201d\n\nKneedler (to his credit): \u201cBut this Court didn\u2019t do it [pronounce them to be sovereign] as a matter of common law. It did it by looking at the Constitution. We have treaties with Indian tribes, we have the -- \u201d\n\nToo bad Mr. Kneedler didn\u2019t read the Worcester ruling closely enough to realize that the original free and independent nationhood of Indian nations, typically termed \u2018sovereignty,\u2019 long predates the U.S. Constitution. It wasn\u2019t the U.S. Constitution that \u201cdecided\u201d Indian tribes are \u201csovereign.\u201d\n\nJustice Scalia, by the way, ought to be compelled to recuse himself from every case dealing with Indian nations or \u201ctribes\u201d for his lack of judicial impartiality. He disqualified himself, in my view, by a statement he is reported to have made to Congressman Tom Cole of the Chickasaw Nation: \u201cDon\u2019t forget you belong to a conquered race.\u201d (When asked about the incident, Congressman Cole\u2019s Office said representative Cole will not comment on a private conversation.)\n\nThe Supreme Court is likely to deliver its decision in the spring of 2014.\n\nSteven Newcomb (Shawnee, Lenape) is co-founder and co-director of the Indigenous Law Institute, and author of Pagans in the Promised Land: Decoding the Doctrine of Christian Discovery (Fulcrum, 2008).", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.creator": "mazecyrus", "description": "This column is about oral arguments at the U.S. Supreme Court that took place on December 2, 2013 in the case Michigan v.
