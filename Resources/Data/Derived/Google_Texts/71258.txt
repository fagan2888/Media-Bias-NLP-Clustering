With his Republican presidential campaign on the rocks ahead of the crucial New Hampshire primary, Jeb Bush is embracing the family name to try and keep his White House ambitions afloat.

The former Florida governor sat down with his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, for an interview airing on CBS Friday. In 2013, as her son mulled a presidential run, Barbara Bush publicly said the country probably wasn’t keen on another Bush in the Oval Office.

And his big brother, former President George W. Bush – who had kept a low profile this election cycle – cut a commercial for the pro-Jeb super PAC, Right to Rise, that will air in South Carolina beginning Friday. They’ll also campaign together in the state.

“The first job of the president is to protect America,” the 43rd commander-in-chief says to the camera.”The next president must be prepared to lead. I know Jeb. I know his good heart and his strong backbone.”

He goes on: "Jeb will unite our country. He knows how to bring the world together against terror. He knows when tough measures must be taken. Experience and judgment count in the Oval Office. Jeb Bush is a leader who will keep our country safe."
