Sixty percent confirmed tangible apprehensions regarding their ICD-10 readiness levels.\n\nFifty-nine percent of physicians confirm they are seeking to sell primarily due to administrative duties, profitability struggles, and regulatory demands, says CareCloud. This 59 percent increased by 6 percent compared to last year\u2019s data.\n\nParallels to last year\u2019s PPI evident\n\nAs EHRIntelligence.com reported, according to last year\u2019s PPI, ICD-10 preparation levels were indeed on the horizon for previously surveyed physicians.\n\n\u201cThe arrival of healthcare reform has coincided with a continued slide in physician practice profitability,\u201d last year\u2019s study said.\n\nLast year, physicians were reportedly more than twice as likely to expect profitability drops in the year ahead. The sizable amount of time physicians were spending on administrative burdens was also confirmed last year as directly hindering patient engagement efforts.\n\nAs RevCycleIntelligence.com reported, 86 percent of 200 surveyed physicians via a recent SERMO poll confirm ICD-10 implementation is detrimentally affecting patient care.\n\nNonetheless, post-ICD-10 aftermath reports remain optimistic as the healthcare industry collectively assesses what comes next.\n\nOver 1 million first attempt ICD-10 claims reportedly yielded a 99 percent success rate last month. Additionally, as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reported, a ten percent denial rate was reported among 4.6 million daily ICD-10 claims throughout October.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The three leading concerns among physicians predicting profitability drops are declining reimbursements, increasing personnel expenses, and supply issues.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/low-reimbursement-high-costs-threaten-physician-rcm-success", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_11_3980482086.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Low Reimbursement, High Costs Threaten Physician RCM Success"}, "twitter": {"description": "The three leading concerns among physicians predicting profitability drops are declining reimbursements, increasing personnel expenses, and supply issues.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_11_3980482086.jpg"}, "title": "Low Reimbursement, High Costs Threaten Physician RCM Success", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe arrival of healthcare reform has coincided with a continued slide in physician practice profitability,\u201d last year\u2019s study said.\nParallels to last year\u2019s PPI evidentAs EHRIntelligence.com reported, according to last year\u2019s PPI, ICD-10 preparation levels were indeed on the horizon for previously surveyed physicians.\nAs RevCycleIntelligence.com reported, 86 percent of 200 surveyed physicians via a recent SERMO poll confirm ICD-10 implementation is detrimentally affecting patient care.\nOver half of the over 5,000 physicians surveyed online claimed ICD-10 is hindering their profitability.\nOver 1 million first attempt ICD-10 claims reportedly yielded a 99 percent success rate last month."}
