A number of Democrats have signaled worries about the law and the website.\n\nTen Democratic senators signed a letter on Friday urging Health and Human Service Secretary Kathleen Sebelius Kathleen SebeliusFighting for assisted living facilities The chaotic fight for ObamaCare California exchange CEO: Insurers \u2018throwing ObamaCare under the bus\u2019 MORE to extend the deadline for enrolling to make sure people unable to access ObamaCare's enrollment website will have time to do so.\n\nRepublicans have also hammered Democrats on the issue. The National Republican Congressional Committee on Thursday launched a series of radio ads focused on the website that target vulnerable House Democrats. The ads are meant to appeal to female voters.\n\nWasserman Schultz said she doesn't think an extension of the enrollment period will be necessary.\n\n\"We fully expect that that won't be necessary, because the kinks that have occurred through the website are being worked on and are being ironed out,\" she said. She pointed to the \"tech surge\" \u2014 the team of experts and programmers called in to fix the sites \u2014 and said it \"is already showing signs of being effective.\"\n\nDemocrats need 17 seats to pick up the House \u2014 a tall order in a midterm election, when turnout is lower than in a presidential election.\n\nBut Wasserman Schultz argued the government shutdown and debt-ceiling fight has hurt Republicans and will resonate with voters next year.\n\n\"Oh, absolutely,\" she said. \"I think so. Yes.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Democrats will be able to run on ObamaCare and win in 2014, the party chairwoman's insisted.", "description": "Democrats will be able to run on ObamaCare and win in 2014, the party chairwoman's insisted.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Democrats will be able to run on ObamaCare and win in 2014, the party chairwoman's insisted.", "title": "DNC head: Dems can run and win on ObamaCare", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/186466-dnc-head-dems-can-run-and-win-obamacare", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/wassermanschultzdebbie_102513getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T23:19:58-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T23:19-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/186466-dnc-head-dems-can-run-and-win-obamacare", "dcterms.date": "2013-10-25T10:51-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "author": "Alexandra Jaffe", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Kathleen Sebelius,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-25T10:51:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T23:19:58-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/186466-dnc-head-dems-can-run-and-win-obamacare", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Democrats will be able to run on ObamaCare and win in 2014, the party chairwoman's insisted.", "card": "summary", "title": "DNC head: Dems can run and win on ObamaCare"}, "dcterms.title": "DNC head: Dems can run and win on ObamaCare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe24e2\"", "article_summary": "\"Democrats will run on the Affordable Care Act and win,\" Wasserman Schultz said.\nDemocrats will be able to run on ObamaCare and win in 2014, the party's chairwoman insisted Friday.\nBut Wasserman Schultz argued the government shutdown and debt-ceiling fight has hurt Republicans and will resonate with voters next year.\nWasserman Schultz cited the ability of women to receive free birth control and preventative care under the law as examples.\nWasserman Schultz said she doesn't think an extension of the enrollment period will be necessary."}
