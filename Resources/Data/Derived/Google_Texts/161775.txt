It’s crunch time for the bevy of Republican candidates looking to distinguish themselves in the crowded race to succeed Lynn Westmoreland in Georgia’s Third Congressional District. Jim Pace, a political rookie and wealthy businessman from Peachtree City who is partially self-funding his campaign, used some of the money from his sizable war chest to unveil his first television ad in the lead-up to the May 24 primary.

The 30-second spot begins with images of Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama juxtaposed with pictures of children. Pace then highlights his stances on red meat issues such as border security, the 2010 healthcare law and fighting the Islamic State. The ad is currently running in the Atlanta and Columbus media markets on channels including Fox News.

Here’s a transcript:

“Career politicians in Washington are putting their ambition first, jeopardizing the future of our children who hold the promise of tomorrow. I’m Jim Pace. I approve this message because I’m a businessman, not a politician. And as a man of faith and family, I believe we have a moral obligation to finally secure the border, to destroy radical Islamic terrorism and abolish Obamacare, because our families’ futures depend on our immediate actions. There’s no time to waste.”

There are seven candidates vying for the Republican nomination in the deeply-red west-central Third District, which stretches from Peachtree City in the northeast to LaGrange and Harris County in the southwest. The opponents duked it out in a wide-ranging televised debate last week that at times took a turn toward the odd. The winner of that contest will face one of two Democrats seeking their party’s nod this May.
