Musicians played horns and drums and a bloodied ex-entrepreneur sold brains on a stick.\n\n\u201cWe have an infection. But this is a living city. And zombies are walking among us,\u201d software engineer Jon Jongepier, 31, said through his thick fleshy face paint beneath the D&F clock tower, towing a bloody corpse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ebola!\u201d Hailey Deweese, 21, shouted in her bloody zombie nurse\u2019s attire, drawing nervous laughter. A temp worker, she\u2019s been tracking the news of that virus.\n\n\u201cWe can control it through quarantine. But the nurses didn\u2019t take precautions,\u201d Deweese said.\n\nBilled as one of the nation\u2019s largest zombie crawls, the Denver event appears to be growing in popularity every year.\n\n\u201cThis defies everything. It is fun because of that,\u201d said Kham Shem Toure, 15, strolling past Taco Bell as a masked superhero.\n\nLord of the Rings-themed wise man William Lebrun, 61, stood before a line of zombies at a stoplight and declared: \u201cYou shall not pass!\u201d\n\nBut they did. And the revels continued through the afternoon and on into the evening, barely stopping for a mass performance of Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller\u201d dance .\n\nThe people shrieking, laughing and crawling along the mall seemed to be playing with notions of immortality and death, said Bob Valdez, 56, parading in costume with his daughter, Vanessa, 13, who\u2019d enjoyed a recent \u201cZombie Day\u201d at her Denver Public Schools middle school.\n\n\u201cWe deny death a lot. We hide from death. Maybe this is a way to come to terms with it, to a degree,\u201d Valdez said.\n\nPart of the appeal is \u201cchaos,\u201d said Kyshawn Davis, 18, wearing the red anarchist A on his costume with friends from Rangeview High School in Aurora \u2014 all battling against zombies as \u201csurvivors.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, people are so in order all the time. You get to let loose,\u201d Davis said, gripping the sword he made hastily from a swimming pool noodle using duct tape.\n\n\u201cZombies chase us. This definitely gets your blood pumping.\u201d\n\nFake blood trickled on the walkways. Mall shuttles were cancelled for the day due to the crowd.\n\nThe event felt \u201ca little crazy,\u201d Chinese student at Denver University Tian Le, 21, said, looking on with two fellow students from China. As she spoke, a man in a fuzzy bear suit walked past them lugging a chain saw.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d Le decided, \u201cis cool.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand transplant Annabel Reader, 37, a professional street performer, towered over a sea of zombie heads on stilts in a bloodied pale-blue prom dress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun to dress up and get dead,\u201d Reader said. \u201cNow we are the un-dead, coming back\u201d \u2014 which eventually has led (thanks to Denver Pavillions merchants who hired her) to \u201ca good livelihood.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Crowd of would-be zombies packs 16th Street Mall", "title": "Crowd of would-be zombies packs 16th Street Mall", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/18/crowd-of-would-be-zombies-packs-16th-street-mall/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141018__20141019_B2_CD19ZOMBIESp1.jpg", "height": 501}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141018__20141019_B2_CD19ZOMBIESp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-18T16:52:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:06:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A parade of zombies packed the 16th Street Mall Saturday in a twisted pre-Halloween exploration of death and conformity and disease.\nBilled as one of the nation\u2019s largest zombie crawls, the Denver event appears to be growing in popularity every year.\nStalking the hundreds, if not thousands, of walking corpses, legions of would-be zombie slayers carried toy weapons, leading to chases up and down alleys.\nAnd zombies are walking among us,\u201d software engineer Jon Jongepier, 31, said through his thick fleshy face paint beneath the D&F clock tower, towing a bloody corpse.\n\u201cNow we are the un-dead, coming back\u201d \u2014 which eventually has led (thanks to Denver Pavillions merchants who hired her) to \u201ca good livelihood.\u201d"}
