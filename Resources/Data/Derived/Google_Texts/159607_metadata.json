Sixty percent of individuals responding to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey, which was released last week, said the ACA should be repealed and then replaced with a Republican alternative.\n\nBy contrast, just 8% of Democratic respondents back repeal, while a majority \u2014 54% \u2014 say Congress should work to improve the health care reform law.\n\nThat near total contrast \u2014 based on political affiliation \u2014 of voters on whether the ACA should remain law is not surprising, Kaiser executives and others say.\n\n\u201cEvery time we have done such surveys they show how deep the partisan divides are,\u201d said Liz Hamel, Kaiser director of public opinion and survey research in Menlo Park, California.\n\nLawmakers \u201care not ahead of their constituencies,\u201d added Geoff Manville, a principal with Mercer L.L.C. in Washington.\n\nRespondents, like lawmakers, also are divided based on their political affiliation on whether it is time to shift focus away from the health care reform law and move on to other issues.\n\nFor example, 59% of Democratic respondents said the country should focus more on other issues, and 38% said it is important for the country to continue the debate over the health care reform law.\n\nOn the other hand, far fewer Republican respondents \u2014 40% \u2014 said the country's focus should shift away from the ACA, while 58% said it is important to continue the debate over the health care reform law.\n\nThat political split also exists in Congress as well, with most of the legislative initiatives to amend the law being led by Republicans, including the most recent unsuccessful attempt late last year that would have, among other things, repealed the ACA's mandate that employers offer coverage, or be hit with a still financial penalty.\n\nLike many of the Kaiser survey respondents, especially Republicans responding to the Kaiser survey, employers want Congress to amend the health care reform law, benefit lobbyists say.\n\n\u201cThere still is a lot Congress needs to do, including repealing the employer mandate, the excise tax\u201d and certain reporting requirements, said Annette Guarisco Fildes, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington.\n\nThe Kaiser survey was conducted last month, with just over 1,202 individuals responding.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "When it comes to what should be done to the health care reform law, voters, just like Congress, are sharply divided along political lines.Since the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, congressional Republicans have launched numerous drives \u2014 all unsuccessful...", "title": "Public deeply divided over health care reform repeal - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20160302/NEWS03/160309954", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20160302/NEWS03/160309954/AR/0/political-divide-over-health-care-reform.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "When it comes to what should be done to the health care reform law, voters, just like Congress, are sharply divided along political lines.Since the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, congressional Republicans have launched numerous drives \u2014 all unsuccessful...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Public deeply divided over health care reform repeal - Business Insurance"}, "article_summary": "When it comes to what should be done to the health care reform law, voters, just like Congress, are sharply divided along political lines.\nBy contrast, just 8% of Democratic respondents back repeal, while a majority \u2014 54% \u2014 say Congress should work to improve the health care reform law.\nLike many of the Kaiser survey respondents, especially Republicans responding to the Kaiser survey, employers want Congress to amend the health care reform law, benefit lobbyists say.\nRespondents, like lawmakers, also are divided based on their political affiliation on whether it is time to shift focus away from the health care reform law and move on to other issues.\nFor example, 59% of Democratic respondents said the country should focus more on other issues, and 38% said it is important for the country to continue the debate over the health care reform law."}
