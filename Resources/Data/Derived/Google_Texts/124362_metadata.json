The company charged with disposing of them has gone bankrupt. The U.S. Army agreed to destroy the M6 propellant via open tray burning. Area residents said no.\n\nLast week, lawmakers on the House Appropriations committee asked Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Peggy Hatch for an update.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe decision was made to allow other options,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of where we are.\u201d\n\nRuston Rep. Rob Shadoin was concerned about the costs of alternative disposal methods.\n\n\u201cDo we know what impact that\u2019s going to have on our budget\u2014our state budget?\u201d he asked.\n\nAssistant DEQ Secretary Chance McNeely responded, \u201cIt\u2019s unclear at this point whether all parties to the AOC\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe who?\u201d Shadoin interrupted.\n\n\u201cThe agreement\u2014the AOC\u2014so the parties are the Guard, EPA, DEQ and the Army\u2014are willing to modify the agreement,\u201d McNeely explained.\n\nDEQ, the EPA and the Louisiana National Guard have agreed to change the disposal method. The Army has not responded at all.\n\n\u201cSo we really don\u2019t know how much this is going to cost us\u2014depending on what disposal method we use?\u201d Shadoin pressed.\n\n\u201cThat is one of the purposes of the RFQ that we\u2019re currently pursuing,\u201d McNeely replied.\n\nAn \u201cRFQ\u201d is a \u201crequest for quotes\u201d\u2014basically an estimate of what closed incineration of the explosives might cost. DEQ is scheduled to make its recommendations on the RFQ to the EPA next week.\n\n\u201cWell, I appreciate that,\u201d Shadoin said. \u201cAnd I know with EPA and DEQ and AOC and RFQ\u2014I just don\u2019t want the people to be S-O-L.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we don\u2019t either,\u201d Hatch added.\n\nThe open burn method was anticipated to cost the Army between 22 and 24-million dollars. Alternative disposal methods could cost more. And it\u2019s still up in the air whether the Army will pay for anything except open tray burning.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Louisiana News", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wwno.org/post/camp-minden-situation-remains-explosive", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201504/397834192.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Camp Minden Situation Remains Explosive"}, "story_id": 397763377, "twitter": {"site": "@WWNO", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WWNO"}, "author": "Sue Lincoln", "org_id": 595, "dc": {"title": "Camp Minden Situation Remains Explosive"}, "nid": 78429, "datePublished": "2015-04-06", "keywords": "environment, Camp Minden, military", "wordCount": 427, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c34\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe agreement\u2014the AOC\u2014so the parties are the Guard, EPA, DEQ and the Army\u2014are willing to modify the agreement,\u201d McNeely explained.\n\u201cSo we really don\u2019t know how much this is going to cost us\u2014depending on what disposal method we use?\u201d Shadoin pressed.\nFifteen million pounds of deteriorating explosives are improperly stored at Camp Minden in northwest Louisiana.\nDEQ, the EPA and the Louisiana National Guard have agreed to change the disposal method.\nThe open burn method was anticipated to cost the Army between 22 and 24-million dollars."}
