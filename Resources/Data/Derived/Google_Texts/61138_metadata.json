They include fees on big banks and taxes on companies that do business overseas \u2014 plus spending cuts on health programs and other savings \u2014 to cover the costs of all the new initiatives.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObama isn\u2019t suggesting enough cuts or tax increases to eliminate deficits completely, not to mention the long-term debt. But he\u2019ll make the case to Americans that bringing deficits down to \u201csustainable\u201d levels \u2014 below 3 percent of the nation\u2019s economic output \u2014 is good enough to keep the debt manageable, a senior administration official said.\n\n\u201cWe can afford to make these investments while remaining fiscally responsible,\u201d Obama said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to be smarter about paying for our priorities.\u201d\n\nObama is using the budget to challenge Republicans on middle-class issues, as well as national security funding. He made his budget pitch during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security, where he warned Republicans that they\u2019ll undermine the nation\u2019s security and hurt the federal workers who work at those agencies \u2014 including the Border Patrol, airport screeners, law enforcement officials, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service \u2014 if they don\u2019t send him a \u201cclean\u201d funding bill that doesn\u2019t try to block his immigration executive actions.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t jeopardize our national security over this disagreement,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThese Americans aren\u2019t just working to keep us safe \u2013 they have to take care of their own families. The notion that they would get caught up in a disagreement around policy that has nothing to do with them makes no sense.\u201d\n\nRepublicans wasted no time rejecting Obama\u2019s budget. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called it \u201canother top-down, backward-looking document that caters to powerful political bosses on the Left and never balances\u2014ever.\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said it \u201cwould impose new taxes and more spending without a responsible plan to honestly address the big challenges facing our country.\u201d\n\nAnd Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi and House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, in a joint statement, declared that \u201ca proposal that never balances is not a serious plan for America\u2019s fiscal future.\u201d\n\nThe budget calls for $1.091 trillion in discretionary spending for fiscal year 2016, $74 billion above the \u201csequestration\u201d spending caps that Obama wants to eliminate. The additional spending \u2014 $38 billion for defense, $37 billion for domestic programs \u2014 would produce a $474 billion deficit for next year.\n\nObama said the sequestration cuts have been bad for economic growth and national security, and warned: \u201cI\u2019m not going to accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward \u2026 I will not accept a budget that severs the vital link between our national security and our economic security.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials say Obama\u2019s budget would produce $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years, including $400 billion in health savings \u2014 mainly by delivering health care more efficiently, building on experiments that are already being tried under Obamacare \u2014 and $640 billion in net revenue from capital gains tax increases and other tax changes.\n\nThat includes $95 billion in higher tobacco taxes over 10 years to pay for two initiatives: an extension of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program \u2014 which ends this year if Congress doesn\u2019t revive it \u2014 and Obama\u2019s ongoing proposals to guarantee universal access to preschool. The proposal would nearly double taxes on cigarettes and small cigars to about $1.95 per pack from about $1.01 per pack, and index the tax for inflation.\n\nThe budget also counts on savings from getting rid of waste, fraud and abuse \u2014 including $32 billion in savings from more frequent reviews of people who get Supplemental Security Income benefits, which are supposed to go to low-income people with disabilities.\n\nThe goal is to replace \u201cmindless sequestration cuts with smart reforms,\u201d Office of Management and Budget director Shaun Donovan told reporters at a briefing.\n\nThere\u2019s $82 billion in mandatory spending over 10 years to help the families of 1.1 million children afford child care, as well as $1.5 billion in additional funding for Head Start. It also asks Congress to give states more than $2 billion to help them start paid family leave programs.\n\nAnd Obama wants a 5.5 percent increase in funding for research and development \u2014 a total of $146 billion over 10 years \u2014 including more money for the National Institutes of Health, scientific research at the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation, and a Precision Medicine initiative that will try to develop more personalized approaches to medical treatments and cures.\n\nObama\u2019s budget is full of taxes and other requests that are likely to come to a screeching halt in a Republican Congress, though \u2014 including the higher capital gains tax rate, the tobacco taxes and the closing of what White House officials call the \u201ctrust fund loophole,\u201d a provision that allows huge amounts of inherited capital gains to go untaxed.\n\nObama to Congress: Put politics aside get budget 'done'\n\nIt also asks for $239 million to help the Environmental Protection Agency fight climate change, despite the fact that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans have promised to block some of the agency\u2019s biggest rules, including a proposed rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a 7.8 percent increase for the Department of Veterans Affairs, a request that will present a political dilemma for Republicans: Do they want to give more money to the scandal-plagued agency that\u2019s still reeling from last year\u2019s revelations of long waiting lists for veterans\u2019 medical care?\n\nThe White House is also counting on $160 billion in savings from comprehensive immigration reform \u2014 the same immigration reform proposals that stalled among Republicans last year and are even more dead now that Obama has infuriated the GOP by issuing executive actions to reduce deportations.\n\nAdministration officials say it\u2019s in the budget because Obama still supports it, and because the broader immigration legislation would save money by adding younger workers to the workforce, helping to balance out the costs of an aging population. It would also extend the life of the Social Security trust fund by providing more workers to pay taxes into the program.\n\nDonovan insisted that including immigration reform, along with the $400 billion in health savings, proves Obama is serious about cutting the costs of entitlements, despite the lack of major initiatives like raising the Medicare eligibility age or the \u201cchained CPI\u201d proposal Obama has floated in the past to change the formula for Social Security benefits.\n\n\u201cI think we have a strong argument that the president has been focused from the beginning on the key drivers of the costs of our entitlements,\u201d Donovan said.\n\nThe Obama team believes it will win over the public with $277 billion in \u201cmiddle-class and pro-work tax cuts\u201d \u2014 including a tax credit for working spouses, a tripling of the maximum child-care tax credit to $3,000 and an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit to include low-wage workers without children. Senior administration officials say the tax package will help 44 million families, with an average benefit of $600 per household. They argue that Republicans have previously endorsed ideas similar to some of those proposals.\n\nWhite House officials say their goal is to keep deficits stable relative to the gross domestic product and bring the long-term debt down slightly. The $474 billion deficit for next year would be about 2.5 percent of GDP, and it would end up in about the same place for 2025 even though the dollar amount would rise to $687 billion. The federal debt \u2014 the cumulative total of deficits that the government owes \u2014 would start at 75 percent of GDP in 2016 and ease down to 73.3 percent in 2025.\n\nThe $400 billion in savings administration officials say they\u2019ll get from mandatory health spending programs \u2014 mainly Medicare \u2014 are similar to the ones Obama proposed in last year\u2019s budget. They'd cut spending mainly by reducing payments to doctors and other health care providers \u2014 going beyond the cuts already included in Obamacare \u2014 and by discouraging seniors from buying generous Medigap policies that don\u2019t encourage them to be cost-conscious.\n\nThere are other recycled proposals from past budgets that didn\u2019t get anywhere in Congress even when Democrats controlled the Senate. Obama\u2019s budget includes the \u201cBuffett rule,\u201d which would require people with incomes between $1 million and $2 million to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes. It would also save money by cutting crop insurance subsidies by $16 billion over 10 years, reviving a proposal from past budgets that never gets any traction in Congress.\n\nObama\u2019s team says it doesn\u2019t matter if his proposals have stalled out before because his budget should be an expression of his priorities, not the outlines of a final deal with Congress. \u201cThe fact that they didn\u2019t pass the first time doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not good ideas,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest.\n\nBesides, he said, any budget deal would have to be a compromise between a Republican Congress and a Democratic president, and \u201canything that emerges from those discussions on the budget will require an effort to find common ground.\u201d\n\nEarnest wouldn\u2019t say whether Obama would veto spending bills from Congress that don\u2019t get rid of the sequestration cuts, but he said the threat of the next round of cuts \u201cdoes have a negative impact on our ability to help the middle class, and it does have a negative impact on the ability of the men and women of our military to keep the country safe.\u201d\n\nEven though most Republicans have already been blasting the basic framework of the budget \u2014 suggesting it\u2019s full of tax increases and will never fly with their side \u2014 they haven\u2019t ruled out all hope of dealing with Obama. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan suggested Sunday that he\u2019d like to find \u201ccommon ground\u201d on corporate tax reform.\n\nDemocrats said the budget would give Republicans a serious political challenge. \u201cIf the GOP takes this budget and sticks it in a drawer, they\u2019ll be making it crystal clear that they\u2019re more interested in helping special interests than middle class families,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\nAnd from early signs, Obama seems to have avoided angering disgruntled liberals with too many compromises on spending.\n\n\u201cIf we are serious about rebuilding the disappearing middle class, we need a budget which creates millions of decent-paying jobs, raises wages, makes college affordable and demands that the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations start paying their fair share of taxes,\u201d said Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent who is the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cIn all these matters, the president\u2019s budget begins to move us in the right direction.\u201d\n\nBrian Faler and Edward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this story.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The president says his $4 trillion budget raises spending without increasing the deficit.", "title": "Obama's 'have-it-all' budget", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/barack-obama-budget-114822.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/02/02/20150202_senate_budget_js_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Congress,Taxes,Budget,White House", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The president says his $4 trillion budget raises spending without increasing the deficit.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5c8\"", "article_summary": "The notion that they would get caught up in a disagreement around policy that has nothing to do with them makes no sense.\u201dRepublicans wasted no time rejecting Obama\u2019s budget.\nObama\u2019s budget includes the \u201cBuffett rule,\u201d which would require people with incomes between $1 million and $2 million to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes.\nThe additional spending \u2014 $38 billion for defense, $37 billion for domestic programs \u2014 would produce a $474 billion deficit for next year.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to be smarter about paying for our priorities.\u201dObama is using the budget to challenge Republicans on middle-class issues, as well as national security funding.\n\u201cIn all these matters, the president\u2019s budget begins to move us in the right direction.\u201dBrian Faler and Edward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this story."}
