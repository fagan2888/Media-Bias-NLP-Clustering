Because I understand technology, a transformational tool. Because I understand bureaucracies, how they work and how you need to change them, and our government is a huge bureaucracy. And because I understand executive decision making, which is making tough calls in tough times, with high stakes for which you\u2019re prepared to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nFiorina said would bring experience as a business executive to the White House, and that she is uniquely qualified to address \u201cfundamental structural problems\u201d with our economy, namely that \u201cwe have tangled people up in a web of dependence\u201d and \u201cwe are crushing small business.\u201d\n\nShe suggested \u201czero-based budgeting\u201d and a \u201cpay for performance\u201d policy toward civil employees as ways to address Washington bureaucracy.\n\nWallace asked Fiorina about layoffs during her time as CEO and how she was ultimately fired by the board of directors.\n\nFiorina defended her record as CEO. She said she lead Hewlett-Packard through the \u201cworst technology recession in 25 years,\u201d and though layoffs are a \u201clast resort,\u201d they are sometimes necessary for the \u201coverall health of the enterprise.\u201d\n\nShe said the company ultimately became more successful and added more jobs under her watch.\n\nWallace said Fiorina appears \u201cto take special delight\u201d in criticizing potential rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nFiorina said Clinton \u201clacks a track record of accomplishment\u201d and is \u201cnot candid, which suggests her character is flawed.\u201d\n\nFiorina added that she is also concerned about Clinton\u2019s \u201ccompetence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone who in 2015 says you can\u2019t have two email accounts on a single device obviously doesn\u2019t understand technology,\u201d said Fiorina.\n\nWallace said that though it comes across as \u201csexist,\u201d some have suggested that Fiorina is truly running as a potential running mate rather than as a serious candidate.\n\n\u201cIf I run for president, it\u2019s because I can win the job and it\u2019s because I can do the job,\u201d said Fiorina.\n\nWallace asked Fiorina if she\u2019d consider becoming the nominee\u2019s running mate after the primary.\n\n\u201cWell, when you start asking all of the other candidates that question, then maybe we\u2019ll have that conversation,\u201d said Fiorina.\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d said Wallace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said there\u2019s a very high chance she\u2019ll enter the race for president.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said there\u2019s a very high chance she\u2019ll enter the race for president.", "title": "Carly Fiorina on What Sets Her Apart in a Crowded GOP Field", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150329_CarlyFiorina.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-29T23:47:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1BAIxO3"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said there\u2019s a very high chance she\u2019ll enter the race for president.", "title": "Carly Fiorina on What Sets Her Apart in a Crowded GOP Field", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150329_CarlyFiorina.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-03-29T13:34:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-29T23:47:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Carly Fiorina, Hillary Clinton, Chris Wallace, Fox News Sunday, 2016, Republican Primary"}, "article_summary": "Wallace asked Fiorina about layoffs during her time as CEO and how she was ultimately fired by the board of directors.\nWallace asked Fiorina if she\u2019d consider becoming the nominee\u2019s running mate after the primary.\nWallace said that though it comes across as \u201csexist,\u201d some have suggested that Fiorina is truly running as a potential running mate rather than as a serious candidate.\nFormer Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said there\u2019s a very high chance she\u2019ll enter the race for president.\nBecause I understand technology, a transformational tool."}
