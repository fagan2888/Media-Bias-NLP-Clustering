A 6-year-old told a police officer that a man known to her family had done things to her; things that led to police charging Conrado Santos-Carmona with sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child, authorities said.

Santos-Carmona, 27, went to the Lakewood police station Wednesday at the request of detectives investigating the child’s allegation, said Al Della Fave, spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office.

Lakewood Detectives Nate Montgomery and Jason Pederson and Ocean County Prosecutor’s Special Victims Unit Detective Melissa Matthews spoke with the girl and her mother “to get a clear picture of the allegations,” Della Fave said.

After speaking with the child and her mother, the detectives called Santos-Carmona and asked him to come to Lakewood police headquarters, authorities said.

Senior Assistant Prosecutor Terry Linardakis approved the charges against Santos-Carmona, who was being held in the Ocean County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail with no option to pay 10 percent. Additionally, U.S. Immigrations and Custom Enforcement was notified of Santos-Carmona’s incarceration.

The state Division of Child Protection and Permanency was contacted to advocate on behalf of the victim, police said.
