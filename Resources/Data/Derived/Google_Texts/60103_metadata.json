The bishops met in executive session Nov. 13.\n\nA media release with the message explained that USCCB regulations regarding statements and publications define a \u201cspecial message\u201d as a statement, only issued at general meetings, that the general membership considers appropriate in view of the circumstances at the time. It was passed unanimously.\n\nThe message opened with a listing of various matters the bishops had dealt with during their assembly, including a response to the Philippine typhoon, some liturgical issues and an update on church assistance to Haiti.\n\n\u201cWe stand together as pastors charged with proclaiming the Gospel in its entirety,\u201d it said. \u201cThat Gospel calls us to feed the poor, heal the sick and educate the young, and in doing so witness to our faith in its fullness.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution and the law protect the church\u2019s freedom to answer that call to serve through various apostolates, the statement said. \u201cYet with its coercive HHS mandate, the government is refusing to uphold its obligation to respect the rights of religious believers.\u201d\n\nThe mandate was issued by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of the health care law. It requires most religious and other employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraceptives, sterilization and abortifacient drugs and devices even if the employer is morally opposed to such services. It includes an exemption for some religious employers that fit its criteria. The mandate does not include a conscience clause for employers who object to such coverage on moral grounds.\n\nThere also is an accommodation for some employers to use a third party to pay for the objectionable coverage.\n\nThe bishops\u2019 message recapped the battle between the USCCB and the federal government over the mandate. It reiterated points made in a 2012 statement issued by the USCCB Administrative Committee titled \u201cUnited for Religious Freedom.\u201d\n\nThe special message outlined three objections the bishops still have, including that it establishes what they called \u201ca false architecture of religious liberty that excludes our ministries and so reduces freedom of religion to freedom of worship.\u201d\n\nIt \u201ccompels our ministries\u201d to provide coverage that \u201cviolates our deeply held beliefs,\u201d and the bishops said they also object to \u201cour faithful people in business\u201d being required \u201cto act against our teachings, failing to provide them any exemption at all.\u201d\n\nThere are multiple lawsuits working their way through the courts that have been filed on behalf of church entities, religious colleges and faith-based institutions as well as for-profit companies.\n\n\u201cDespite our repeated efforts to work and dialogue toward a solution, these problems remain,\u201d the message said.\n\nThe bishops\u2019 message observed that the deadline for implementing the HHS mandate is Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cEven as each bishop struggles to address the mandate, together we are striving to develop alternative avenues of response to this difficult situation,\u201d it said. \u201cWe seek to answer the Gospel call to serve our neighbors, meet our obligation to provide our people with just health insurance, protect our religious freedom and not be coerced to violate our consciences.\u201d\n\nIt said they would continue their efforts \u201cin Congress and especially with the promising initiatives in the courts to protect the religious freedom that ensures our ability to fulfill the Gospel by serving the common good.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Catholic News Service", "og": {"site_name": "The Catholic Sun", "description": "In a \u201cspecial message\u201d released Nov. 13, the U.S. bishops reiterated their objections to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that employee insurance include contraceptive covera\u2026", "title": "Bishops send \u2018special message\u2019 reiterating objections to HHS mandate", "url": "http://www.catholicsun.org/2013/11/14/bishops-send-special-message-reiterating-objections-to-hhs-mandate/", "image": {"width": 2400, "identifier": "http://www.catholicsun.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/20131112nw093.jpg", "height": 1600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.catholicsun.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/20131112nw093.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-14T12:44:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-14T12:44:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd9a\"", "article_summary": "The bishops\u2019 message observed that the deadline for implementing the HHS mandate is Jan. 1.\nThe bishops\u2019 message recapped the battle between the USCCB and the federal government over the mandate.\nIt includes an exemption for some religious employers that fit its criteria.\nThe mandate does not include a conscience clause for employers who object to such coverage on moral grounds.\nIt requires most religious and other employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraceptives, sterilization and abortifacient drugs and devices even if the employer is morally opposed to such services."}
