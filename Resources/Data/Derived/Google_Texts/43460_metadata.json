This is about to change, however, with the premiere of HBO\u2019s Looking, (Sunday at 10:30pm), a half-hour drama exploring the lives of three gay men in San Francisco. The three friends\u2014Patrick, a 29-year-old video-game developer (Jonathan Groff); Agustin, a 31-year-old artist (Frankie J. Alvarez); and Dom, a 39-year-old waiter (Murray Bartlett)\u2014are based on the characters in Michael Lannan\u2019s short film Lorimer. Lannan, the creator of the show, also serves as its co-executive producer along with Andrew Haigh, who directed the 2011 indie film Weekend. I spoke with Lannan and Haigh from their office in L.A. This interview has been lightly condensed and edited for clarity. What was your experience like trying to sell this show to HBO? Was it difficult?\n\nMICHAEL LANNAN: We had this very casual conversation at HBO in Santa Monica about gay characters and why there weren\u2019t any shows that featured gay characters. We talked about shows in the past like Tales of the City and the UK version of Queer as Folk that were so great and inspiring. We wanted a version of those shows that we could do now, that felt contemporary, fresh, relevant to the time. They asked me to write a half-hour with those three characters [from Lorimer], and that was the beginning of our development. It was an opportunity before us\u2014something that wasn\u2019t being done. Do you think Looking would survive as a network show? Related Story The TV Show That's Maybe 'Too Gay' for Australia\u2014but Perfect for America ANDREW HAIGH: I can\u2019t imagine it working. HBO has given us the freedom to explore things that wouldn\u2019t be OK to explore on a network show. In terms of language and sexuality and honesty and realism\u2014you just wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. There would be a lot of pressure to make it funny or make it something that we didn\u2019t want the story to be. LANNAN: And in terms of the style, they were supportive of it having a cinematic quality, of having Andrew develop the cinematic language and be unconventional, and having characters that were quite subtle in some ways, but also very emotional. Distinctly in the \u201ccomedy\u201d department, but they let us find our own type of comedy that worked for the show. HAIGH: Allowing them to be emotional was the key; you really cared about these people and wanted to watch their development and their journey, and keep it within the everyday, the subtle and the small. Looking deals with the complicated boundary between sex and intimacy that is universal across relationships\u2014gay or straight. HAIGH: You want it to be universal. The minute you start to become specific about these characters, you start to see that their concerns and struggles universal. The notion that gay people are completely different from everybody else \u2026 well, of course they\u2019re not. We all have similar desires and similar needs. And I think that struggle and search for intimacy and connection is such a universal one, and it\u2019s what we wanted to focus on. There\u2019s this idea that if you watch a show about a bunch of gay people and you\u2019re not gay, it\u2019s not going to reflect your life. But of course it reflects your life. LANNAN: The best HBO shows have been about very specific, detailed worlds. Everything from The Wire to The Sopranos is about very specific places and times. But through that you get this more universal and transcendent thing.\n\nHAIGH: It\u2019s interesting\u2014you watch something like The Wire, and of course you understand those characters and they resonate with you. And then there\u2019s this idea that if you watch a show about a bunch of gay people and you\u2019re not gay, it\u2019s not going to reflect your life. But of course it reflects your life. Do you think Looking challenges stereotypes about what it means to be a gay couple? HAIGH: It\u2019s not that we wanted to necessarily challenge the audience, but we certainly wanted to explore the subtleties and the different types of relationships people can have. Just because now gay people can get married, it doesn\u2019t mean they want to get married. It\u2019s important that we look at all the different ways people can have relationships and the ways they can make things work. LANNAN: It\u2019s built into Patrick\u2019s journey. He begins the show with the idea that you can either have sex in the woods or settle down and get married. As the show goes on, he realizes that those aren\u2019t the only two choices\u2014that there\u2019s this whole world of options. HAIGH: It speaks to a universal concern that all of us have, which is the two poles of security and freedom. That\u2019s what Patrick\u2019s dealing with. He\u2019s torn between complete freedom and complete security, and I think we all can understand those dual desires. Where does Looking fit into the context of other shows that have featured gay characters? LANNAN: We don\u2019t really know. We\u2019re doing what we think feels real and authentic to us, that builds on our own influences, Andrew\u2019s and mine. Everything from '70s cinema, '90s indie cinema, to television shows we loved like Tales of the City. Only time will tell where it fits in. My hope is that if this show does well, it will offer the opportunity for other people to make other shows about different types of gay people. HAIGH: Our ambition is not to tell the story about all gay people, which is impossible to do. The gay community is full of all different types of people. It never was our intention to be the ultimate gay show about all gay people. We just want to tell the stories of these characters and their lives. Do you feel a sense of pressure, or a burden to get this right?\n\nHAIGH: I think \u201cburden\u201d is a good way to put it. We do feel like there\u2019s a burden, and then the trailer comes out, and everyone comments on it, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not my life.\u201d It was hysterical looking at some of the comments. Some people decided it was a show about cock-hungry sluts, and others would say that it\u2019s all white people. Everyone has a judgment. But we can\u2019t represent everybody\u2014it\u2019s impossible. So in many respects, we have to ignore that. But I also understand the desire, the need, for representation on the screen. My hope is that if this show does well, it will offer the opportunity for other people to make other shows about different types of gay people. Your show features \u201c30-somethings\u201d\u2014Patrick is 29 and Dom is 39\u2014but you also include older characters. I think it\u2019s interesting that you offer this multi-generational perspective of the gay experience in San Francisco. HAIGH: What I find interesting about a lot of groups of gay friends is that they are often multi-generational. What brings a lot of them together in the initial stage is their sexuality, and they can develop friendships that way. But these are guys who met at college\u2014it\u2019s not a bunch of grade-school friends. When you\u2019re in your 20s, you think that by the time you get to 30 everything is going to be fine, but of course, once you get to 30, and 40, and 50, and 60, there are always struggles. You\u2019re not suddenly defined as a person by the age 30. It\u2019s ongoing. Dom\u2019s character is almost 40 but he still hasn\u2019t made up his mind what he wants with his life. LANNAN: Enough of the world has changed so quickly in the last 10 years that somebody who\u2019s Dom\u2019s age, 39, has, in many ways, different experiences from someone like Patrick, who\u2019s 29. They relate, and they\u2019re very close, but they\u2019re also so different. Dom would\u2019ve grown up with the height of the fear and anxiety about the AIDS crisis. To Patrick, that\u2019s a little more of something he\u2019s heard about\u2014not something he lived with. And I think the Internet changed things for people younger than myself (and I\u2019m 36). There was no Internet till I was out of college, and the kind of gay communication style is confusing. But for people five years younger than me, it\u2019s the norm.\n\nDom\u2019s age and the time period he grew up in give him a slightly more jaded perspective than someone like Patrick, who\u2019s more na\u00efve, or perhaps takes for granted that he will be accepted for his sexual orientation. HAIGH: It was a different generation, and it was harder for Dom to come out when he did come out. And he carries that baggage with him, the ideas of masculinity, but all those things have changed in the 10-year age difference between them. What\u2019s your process in the writing room like? How do you come up with story ideas? HAIGH: Michael and I came up with an idea about where we want these characters to go, how we see them developing, and for us its very important to explore the characters, about finding stories that suited that exploration. In the writer\u2019s room, we talk about our own experiences\u2014it\u2019s like a therapy session most of the time. When I look back at the episodes, I really feel the whole of the room is in those episodes. It\u2019s a close environment, an honest environment. Seven out of your nine writers are gay men. Was that intentional? HAIGH: To be honest, it was relatively intentional. We certainly wanted a female perspective in there, but it would\u2019ve felt weird to us to have a room with a bunch of straight guys. It wasn\u2019t to disregard anybody, but it turned out that these people were a good fit. It was so important for us to keep an open environment, where everyone could have an opinion. LANNAN: And from the writers to the actors to the crew, it was important to have people who were passionate about the project. It resonated for them, and they brought a lot of insight to it that came from their own personal experiences. This show explores contemporary gay relationships for these specific characters in San Francisco. What does that mean to you? HAIGH: We\u2019re interested in the choices we have now as gay people. More choices than we\u2019ve ever had before. We can get married, adopt children and all those things. There\u2019s so much more visibility and openness. But that comes with new challenges and struggles. Having more choice can be a daunting thing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The series&#39; executive producers discuss the challenge of creating a show that&#39;s both universally relatable and authentic to its writers&#39; experiences.", "author": "Hope Reese", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The series&#39; executive producers discuss the challenge of creating a show that&#39;s both universally relatable and authentic to its writers&#39; experiences.", "title": "HBO's Looking: Not 'the Ultimate Gay Show About All Gay People'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/01/looking/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/01/hbos-em-looking-em-not-the-ultimate-gay-show-about-all-gay-people/283087/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81ae\"", "article_summary": "MICHAEL LANNAN: We had this very casual conversation at HBO in Santa Monica about gay characters and why there weren\u2019t any shows that featured gay characters.\nDo you think Looking challenges stereotypes about what it means to be a gay couple?\nDo you think Looking would survive as a network show?\nWhere does Looking fit into the context of other shows that have featured gay characters?\nIt never was our intention to be the ultimate gay show about all gay people."}
