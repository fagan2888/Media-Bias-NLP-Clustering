Some local business showed their appreciation for our military men and women by offering them a break on something they may need.

The Mad Hatter Automotive shop on West 23rd street in Panama City were providing free oil changes today for any retired or active duty member of the military.

The owner and the store manager came up with the idea.

This is the first year for the offer, but they're thinking of making it an annual event.

Joshua Brown, the store manager said, "Basically, we realize it's something that's small. An oil change isn't really a whole lot. When you try to do anything to give back to the military. I mean without these men and women we wouldn't be, quite frankly, where we are today, i wouldn't be able to run this store."

Brown says they're also thinking about a similar offer for Veteran's Day.
