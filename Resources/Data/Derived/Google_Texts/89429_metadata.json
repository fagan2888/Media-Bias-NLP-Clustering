Yet, despite what appears to be the best job market in more than 14 years, many Americans still feel that the economic recovery has not really taken hold for them, and that the sort of solid, middle class jobs that used to be available to Americans with a high school education simply do not exist anymore.\n\nAlongside workers struggling to find good-paying work are businesses claiming that they can\u2019t find the workers they need. With an unemployment rate still hovering at 5.5 percent and a labor force participation rate near historical lows, employers continue to report that they cannot fill many of those open positions.\n\nRelated: Illinois Governor Vows to 'Gut' Indiana\u2019s Economy\n\nEconomist Harry J. Holzer, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McCourt School of Public Policy, offers some encouragement for both workers and business owners. Holzer\u2019s analysis of BLS data suggests that solid middle class jobs \u2014 what Holzer refers to as \u201cmiddle-skill\u201d work \u2014 has not so much disappeared from the U.S. as it has shifted from an industrial economy to a \u201cknowledge economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeclining middle-wage jobs often involve the performance of very routine tasks \u2014 such as working on an assembly line or typing manuscripts \u2014 that can easily be performed by various forms of digital technology,\u201d Holzer writes. \u201cIn contrast, the jobs that are growing and still pay well increasingly require more complex reasoning or communications skills.\u201d\n\nAs a result, he notes, \u201cThe traditional middle of the job market \u2014 composed primarily of construction, production and clerical jobs that require fairly little education \u2014 has indeed been declining rapidly. But another set of middle-skill jobs \u2014 requiring more postsecondary education or training \u2014 in health care, mechanical maintenance and repair and some services \u2014 is consistently growing, as are skill needs within traditionally unskilled jobs. Among these are the ones that employers have had trouble filling.\u201d\n\nRelated: Reject Common Core, But Don\u2019t Reject Shared Knowledge\n\nMany economists have argued that claims by businesses that there are no qualified workers are disingenuous efforts to keep labor costs low. Businesses that traditionally offered training programs to entry-level employees no longer do so, calling on the education system \u2014 much of it funded by taxpayers \u2014 to deliver work-ready employees to their doors. Other economists point out that a lack of real wage growth in recent years suggests that business aren\u2019t actually trying particularly hard to attract new talent.\n\nBoth arguments have merit, Holzer concedes. However, business owners reluctant to train new hires also have a point, he says. \u201cInvesting funds in on-the-job training can be un-profitable if the skills generated by such training are quite general (relative to other jobs in the region) or the workers are young, since these workers might leave the firms at any time and make it impossible for employers to recoup their training expenditures. If U.S. workers have weak basic skills (as several skill surveys have clearly documented) they will not be good candidates for training investments, especially of a more technical nature.\u201d\n\nRelated: 5 Million Job Openings, So Why Can\u2019t You Get Hired?\n\nHolzer proposes a three-part plan to boost both the number of middle-skill jobs in the U.S. and the number of people qualified to fill them.\n\nFirst, he says, the government needs to reallocate higher education funding toward community colleges and lower-tier four-year schools, while simultaneously \u201ccreating incentives and accountability by basing state subsidies on student completion rates and earnings of graduates.\u201d\n\nHe calls for expanding access to career and technical education programs and as well as access to on-the-job training programs such as apprenticeships.\n\nFinally, he says, the government ought to be \u201cassisting and incentivizing employers to create more good jobs. Other supportive policies \u2014 including higher minimum wages, paid parental leave, and labor law reform \u2014 would help as well.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Job openings in the U.S. are at a 14-year high, yet many workers still can\u2019t find employment, and many companies can\u2019t fill positions.
