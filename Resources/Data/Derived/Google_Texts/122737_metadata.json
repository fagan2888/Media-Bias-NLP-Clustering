(Eva Russo for The Washington Post)\n\nVirginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli II fired up a crowd of several hundred Republicans and tea party members Tuesday with rousing talk about keeping Washington at bay and fighting to maintain the commonwealth\u2019s tradition of limited government.\n\nBut the Virginia attorney general was also forced to distance himself from a local Republican official who spoke ahead of the candidate and told an anti-Semitic joke; a video of the joke went viral later in the day.\n\nCuccinelli was joined by nationally syndicated talk show host Mark Levin at a Constitution Day rally in Sterling and spoke of his efforts to restrain government, including legal challenges to President Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul and to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\u201cGet government out of the way, and you will watch the American economy explode,\u201d Cuccinelli said, invoking the names of Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry and other Virginia-born patriots. \u201cThose principles that they built this nation on are eternal and universal. They apply everywhere and all the time. They apply as much in 2013 as they did in 1776.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli painted his Democratic opponent, Terry McAuliffe, as a creature of inside-the-Beltway politics who would exacerbate partisan tensions in Virginia. The loudest applause came when he spoke of his support of school choice.\n\nJohn Whitbeck, 10th Congressional District GOP chairman, raised eyebrows at a rally where gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli spoke. (Video courtesy of the Democratic Party of Virginia)\n\n\u201cA child in Virginia \u2014 a child in Petersburg \u2014 trapped in the boundaries of a failing school, can\u2019t pursue happiness if they can\u2019t get a decent education. And right now, their own government blocks them from alternatives that would allow them to pursue happiness,\u201d Cuccinelli said. \u201cWe don\u2019t promise outcomes; we promise opportunity. And this is a classic example where we can expand and make real the promise of opportunity of government policy.\u201d\n\nPeople brought yellow lawn chairs with the motto \u201cDon\u2019t tread on me,\u201d and at least one tricorner hat was visible in the crowd. John Whitbeck, 10th Congressional District Republican Committee chairman, raised eyebrows when he kicked off the festivities by telling a joke in which the head of the Jewish religion presented the pope with a long, elaborate document that the Jewish leader said was a bill for the last supper.\n\nThe crowd laughed uproariously. But American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal political action committee, tweeted about Whitbeck\u2019s \u201canti-Semitic\u201d opener and the state Democratic Party later circulated a video of the joke.\n\nCuccinelli was not yet on stage at the time the joke was told, and his campaign later distanced him from the remarks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know who the guy is,\u201d Cuccinelli campaign strategist Chris La Civita said, referring to Whitbeck. \u201cIt\u2019s wholly inappropriate and not connected to the campaign. And it\u2019s not reflective of Ken Cuccinelli.\u201d\n\nWhile Cuccinelli was working his base, McAuliffe was in Virginia Beach collecting an endorsement from the city\u2019s mayor, Will Sessoms, who is a Republican. McAuliffe spokesman Josh Schwerin said the two events offered a snapshot of the contrasts between the candidates, and he accused Cuccinelli of fully embracing the tea party movement and only pretending to focus on mainstream Virginians.\n\nThe state Democratic Party highlighted remarks by Levin that party officials said demonstrated his extremism, such as accusing Obama of being a Muslim Brotherhood \u201csympathizer.\u201d\n\nSen. David W. Marsden (D-Fairfax), in an interview before the rally, said the gathering was proof that Cuccinelli and his backers were out of step with a Virginia that had evolved into a swing state. Marsden said the definition of liberty promoted by Cuccinelli and tea party members leaves out homosexuals, women seeking abortions and others. And he criticized Cuccinelli for focusing on his core supporters instead of trying to broaden his message and being more inclusive.\n\n\u201cThe degree of fear and paranoia and misinformation that comes out of the tea party, it\u2019s just chilling,\u201d Marsden said.\n\nSeveral people at the rally celebrated having a conservative activist at the top of the GOP\u2019s statewide ticket.\n\n\u201cWe have someone who\u2019s not afraid to tell the federal government, \u2018Get out \u2014 this is ours,\u2019 \u201d Loudoun County Supervisor Suzanne M. Volpe (R-Algonkian) said during her introduction of Cuccinelli. \u201cOne thing I told a group of tea party folks the other night when I was at a meeting, I said, \u2018Ken Cuccinelli was tea party before there was a tea party.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCuccinelli urged the crowd of nearly 250 people to help him overcome a funding deficit by knocking on doors and working the phones. He highlighted his victory over the EPA \u2019s attempt to regulate storm-water runoff. He said the move saved Northern Virginia taxpayers millions of dollars. He also criticized the agency\u2019s forthcoming regulations on carbon emissions, saying they could cripple the economy in Virginia\u2019s coal fields.\n\nHe called the Affordable Care Act an example of federal overreach that has caused companies to hire only part-time employees, hindering economic growth. He attacked McAuliffe for saying he would not sign a budget unless the legislature agreed to expand Medicaid. He introduced Levin as his \u201cfavorite media mogul.\u201d Cameras and smart phones were raised to take pictures as Levin took the podium.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to watch Terry McAuliffe be governor of Virginia,\u201d Levin said. \u201cNow, if he wants to run for governor of Maryland, I understand it,\u201d Levin said. \u201cBut this is Virginia, and we have to draw a line somewhere in Virginia, and we\u2019re drawing it right here.\u201d\n\nStaff writer Marc Fisher contributed to the report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP gubernatorial hopeful Ken Cuccinelli attends rally in Sterlin while McAuliffe stumps in Virginia Beach.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/freddy.kunkle", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "GOP gubernatorial hopeful Ken Cuccinelli attends rally in Sterlin while McAuliffe stumps in Virginia Beach.", "title": "Cuccinelli rallies with radio talk show host in N.
