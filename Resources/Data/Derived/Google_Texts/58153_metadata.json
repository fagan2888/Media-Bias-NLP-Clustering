And they\u2019ve also used it as a platform to take on the broader drug industry. Here\u2019s a sample of what they\u2019ve said.\n\nHillary Clinton: The leading Democratic candidate for president has led the recent round of criticism. In a much-watched speech, Clinton announced a new pharmaceutical industry reform plan, and she later ran a campaign ad that specifically blasted Shkreli\u2019s price hike. And in response to a question at last week\u2019s Democratic debate, Clinton also listed the pharmaceutical industry as among her top \u201cenemies.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders: The Democratic candidate has spent the past several weeks touting new legislation, which he introduced before Shkreli\u2019s decision became national news, that would allow the United States to import drugs from Canada and permit Medicare to negotiate drug prices.\n\nMarco Rubio: The Republican candidate for president last week suggested that some drug companies are engaged in \u201cpure profiteering\u201d and that there should be more focus on paying for drugs that are proven to work. \u201cCriticism of the drug industry has largely been the domain of Democratic candidates,\u201d Drew Armstrong and Sahil Kapur noted at Bloomberg. \u201cRubio\u2019s comments turn criticism of the industry bipartisan.\u201d\n\nBig Talk \u2014 But Little Action?\n\nThere\u2019s some debate over whether any of the politicians\u2019 proposals will actually address the core issues that have allowed Shkreli, and other drug companies, to dramatically hike the prices of their drugs in recent years. Clinton\u2019s plan, for example, would cap out-of-pocket spending on prescription medications \u2014 but would do little to fix the regulatory loopholes that permitted Shkreli to essentially secure a monopoly on Daraprim.\n\nAnd some warn that the side effects of politicians\u2019 plans could be prohibitive.\n\n\u201cDrug prices aren\u2019t sacrosanct and surely the behaviors of Turing Pharmaceutical and its CEO, Martin Shkreli, need to be addressed,\u201d John LaMattina wrote in Forbes, responding to Clinton\u2019s proposal to cap out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs at $250 per month. (LaMattina is the former head of Pfizer Global Research and Development.) \u201cBut price controls for the drug industry will bring about the loss of jobs and billions of dollars invested in new drug R&D. Do we really want that?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s an open question as to whether promises made on the campaign trail will translate into action when taking office. Plans like Sanders\u2019 proposals have been around for years with little legislative action. And while Clinton has been the most outspoken candidate about criticizing drug company behavior, she has also taken the most donations from the industry \u2014 more than three times as much as Rubio and nearly 20 times as much as Sanders. That\u2019s made some observers skeptical of Clinton\u2019s pledge to take on the industry. \u201cWith enemies like this, who needs friends?\u201d Dan Goldberg asks at Politico New York.\n\nHowever, observers point out that the ongoing focus on the pharmaceutical industry is likely at its highest level in years. And even if nothing is signed into law, the continuing scrutiny is at least bringing new ideas to control drug spending to the forefront.\n\nFor instance, economist Austin Frakt this week suggested that U.S. regulators adopt an idea imported from Europe: Reference pricing for drugmakers. Specifically, the model sets a standard price for similar drugs \u2014 and if a consumer wants a higher-priced drug, he or she ends up paying the difference.\n\n\u201cIn pushing prices down, reference pricing doesn\u2019t suppress innovation; it encourages a different form of it,\u201d Frakt argues in the New York Times. \u201cThe market still rewards the invention of a cutting-edge drug with novel therapeutic effects.\u201d\n\nAnd given the industrywide shift toward value-based payments, John Tozzi writes at Bloomberg Business that hospitals and insurers are starting to lobby drugmakers to promise that their high-priced medicines will come with a \u201cmoney-back guarantee.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Next\n\nIn a recent report, Moody\u2019s projected that the drug industry would probably not be affected by reform proposals, noting the \u201cpolitical hurdles\u201d such plans face before they can become law.\n\n\u201cWhile U.S. drug pricing is under increasing scrutiny following the price hikes of many pharmaceutical products, we see limited potential for a rapid drop in overall drug pricing levels or their upward trend,\u201d noted Michael Levesque, a Moody\u2019s senior vice president.\n\nIn the meantime, Shkreli isn\u2019t helping his own cause. The executive has stayed in the public eye, arguing with reporters, feuding with presidential candidates \u2014 and providing fresh ammunition for political talking points.\n\nHoping to get a meeting with Sanders, Shkreli donated $2,700 to his campaign last month, David Nather reported for the Boston Globe \u2014 a donation that the Sanders campaign plans to give away.\n\n\u201cWe are not keeping the money from this poster boy for drug company greed,\u201d a Sanders spokesperson said.\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s what else is happening on the road to reform.\n\nHigh-deductible health plans don\u2019t do what policymakers want them to do. Economists expected HDHPs to encourage patients to do more price-shopping \u2014 but instead, consumers ended up skipping necessary care, Sarah Kliff writes at Vox.\n\nJeb Bush lays out Obamacare repeal-and-replacement plan. There is \u201cno way to fix\u201d the Affordable Care Act, and states should have more of a role in setting health care policy, Bush said in a speech last week and Nancy Cook reports for Politico.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pharmaceutical industry has been under scrutiny for the past month, after one executive's decision to hike the price of a drug by more than 5,000% overnight attracted the attention of presidential candidates.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "The pharmaceutical industry has been under scrutiny for the past month, after one executive\u2019s decision to hike the price of a drug by more than 5,000% overnight attracted the attention of pre\u2026", "title": "Can Drug Companies Survive Their Martin Shkreli Moment?", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/can-drug-companies-survive-their-martin-shkreli-moment/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-10-21T08:03:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-21T08:03:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce170\"", "article_summary": "And they\u2019ve also used it as a platform to take on the broader drug industry.\n\u201cBut price controls for the drug industry will bring about the loss of jobs and billions of dollars invested in new drug R&D.\nIn September, a drug company executive named Martin Shkreli gave patients fits after hiking the price of a drug called Daraprim by more than 5,000% overnight.\n\u201cCriticism of the drug industry has largely been the domain of Democratic candidates,\u201d Drew Armstrong and Sahil Kapur noted at Bloomberg.\nHowever, observers point out that the ongoing focus on the pharmaceutical industry is likely at its highest level in years."}
