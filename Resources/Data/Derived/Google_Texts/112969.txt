Kynect has given the people of Kentucky a one stop shop to find the healthcare coverage they need. But Governor Matt Bevin has announced that he plans to dismantle it.

The move will force all Kentuckians looking for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, to use the federal health insurance site, instead of Kynect.

But with the success of Kynect, many are wondering if it's not broken, why fix it?

"Kynect is just for the state of Kentucky. It was set up on exchange to get your tax credit, it's a lot easier to use than 'HealthCare.gov', that's the exchange for those states that have not set up their own exchange," Individual Specialist at Van Meter Insurance, Chappell Watt said.

In a statement from the governor's office, the Kynect program is called a 'redundancy'.

"I've heard that people in the past have had problems with Kynect, and Governor Bevin is going to make some changes, maybe change might be good for them," insurance carrier Brenda Iler said.

And beginning in 2017, customers will start from square one.

"And basically do everything over again," Watt said.

One health insurance carrier says he doesn't have an opinion about Bevin's change.

"Currently, I fall underneath the federal program because of the Tricare and VA.gov. So I don't have anything or never did have anything with the state," Joseph Parker said.

NPR reports that more than 500,000 Kentuckians have gotten health insurance through Kynect.

"As busy as the federal exchange gets, this was kind of a local, you could call somebody local and do it pretty easily this way," Watt added.

She continued to say that the insurance coverage will not be any different once the change comes in 2017.

The last day to enroll for 2016 coverage under Kynect is Sunday, January 31st.
