It\u2019s something we all do, whether we like it or not. And many of us, witnessing our muddled brain, sagging skin, the dreaded chin whiskers, just don\u2019t like it.\n\nThat\u2019s because most people don\u2019t see it the way Frank Lloyd Wright did.\n\n\u201cThe longer I live,\u201d this world-famous architect informed us, \u201cthe more beautiful life becomes.\u201d\n\nMore mysterious, too.\n\n\u201cThe secret to staying young,\u201d Lucille Ball once revealed, \u201cis to live honestly, eat slowly and lie about your age.\u201d\n\nThere must be 10 gazillion books on the subject of healthy aging. It\u2019s a multibillion-dollar industry that\u2019ll never die, even though every one of us will. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a compelling subject for all ages.\n\nInstead of an overview, I\u2019m going to offer a point-of-view, my current Nine Rules for Healthy Aging based on a lifetime of reading, writing, learning, exploring and, oh, yeah, growing older.\n\nEach rule could be a day\u2019s discussion or an 8-week online course. Forget that. The clock is ticking. In fact, keeping it simple is the 10th rule.\n\nThe order is random, much like life. No. 1 is not more important than No. 9, unless it is to you:\n\nExpect success. Aging is not a disease. It\u2019s part of the natural flow of life. So embrace the positives about aging \u2014 wisdom and freedom are two biggies \u2014 and let go of the negative. People with positive perceptions of aging live seven years longer than people with negative perceptions. (Fact!) Not just longer, but happier, more meaningful lives!\n\nExercise (mind and body). This is the key. To age gracefully, stay active. Move it or it disappears. Walk, bike, swim, whatever you like. Strength train, too. If you decide to run with only one of my so-called Rules, make it this one.\n\nNourish your body. To age well, you have to eat well. That means real food, clean food, yummy food in amounts that don\u2019t make you sick or obese. The drama of dieting is over the day you give up processed foods, fake foods, high-in-sugar foods and let the healthiest part of you prepare and eat food that nourishes your body in a way that hot dogs and Pop-Tarts never will.\n\nAccept what is. Strive to accept your life as it unfolds, without being angry or bitter, or feeling victimized. At the same time, fight hard to live the best, most balanced life possible. Don\u2019t dwell in the past or obsess about the future.\n\nRely on yourself. Self-care is the best care. Seek the finest medical care, but beware of overtreatment. Be smart about prevention, but avoid too much scrutiny. \u201cWhat is a well person?\u201d a doctor once asked his students. \u201cA well person is a patient who hasn\u2019t been completely worked up.\u201d\n\nVent in healthy ways. Difficult things happen as you age. Sickness, pain, loss. You can\u2019t avoid the stress but you can, you must, learn to deal with it in healthy ways. Yoga, qi gong, meditation, exist for that purpose.\n\nTake risks. If you want to feel vital, fully alive as you age, keep challenging yourself. \u201cGo out on a limb,\u201d Jimmy Carter said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the fruit is.\u201d\n\nDo unto others. The older and crankier you get, the more kindness and forgiveness have to come into play. Helping others adds more meaning and purpose to life.\n\nUnderstand death and dying. We all die. It\u2019s not if, it\u2019s when. So delve into it with humor, curiosity and spirit. And find a community that supports your choices and beliefs.\n\nNow take the first letter for each rule \u2014 E-E-N-A-R-V-T-D-U \u2014 and spell out a word we both embrace. Life\u2019s a great game, and ultimately, like aging, you have to unscramble it for yourself.\n\n\u2014Marilynn Preston is a fitness expert, personal trainer and speaker on healthy lifestyle issues.
