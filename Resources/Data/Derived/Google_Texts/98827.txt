A woman is seriously hurt in a downtown Wichita shooting early Saturday morning.

It happened around 2:45 a.m. in the 300 block of South Laura, outside a motorcycle club near Washington and Waterman. Sgt. Brian Sigman said four women in a car got into an argument with a 37-year-old man. The man then pulled a gun and fired, hitting the 27-year-old driver in the leg.

The victim drove herself to the hospital where she was treated for non-live-threatening injuries. Her name was not released.

Police gave no description of the suspect, but Sgt. Sigman said police know who he is.

No one else was hurt.
