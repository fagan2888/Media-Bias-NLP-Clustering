Her campaign\u2019s website states:\n\n\u201cWhen a little boy asserts himself he\u2019s called a \u2018leader.\u2019 Yet when a little girl does the same, she risks being branded \u2018bossy.\u2019 Words like bossy send a message: don\u2019t raise your hand or speak up. By middle school girls are less interested in leading than boys\u2014a trend that continues into adulthood. Together we can encourage girls to lead.\u201d\n\nI have mixed feelings on Sheryl Sandberg, and her recent feminist activism has surely stirred up controversy (see here, here, here). On the one hand, it\u2019s laudable that Sandberg has focused on changing culture through persuasion rather than petitioning Congress for another law. (For instance Norway\u2019s absurd and somewhat insulting law that requires 40 percent of a public limited company\u2019s board be comprised of women.) It\u2019s commendable that she focuses on the individual, as she encourages women to \u201clean in\u201d to the workplace, take more risks, speak up, and take on leadership roles. These are praiseworthy goals.\n\nHowever, Sandberg\u2019s latest idea may create more problems than it solves as she pivots from individual action to societal obligation. Beyond the general absurdity of trying to ban words, it also places extra emphasis on the role outside forces have on the individual. I\u2019m not saying that outside forces don\u2019t matter, clearly they do, but accentuating them can be problematic.\n\nThe campaign to ban bossy is in a way telling women that they are dependent on the society around them for their achievements. It implicitly suggests that women can\u2019t be successful until society stops saying mean and hurtful things to them. Alexandra Petri provides a good analogy when she writes: \u201cThis is like dealing with the Sleeping Beauty curse by removing all the spindles from the land. The trick is not to remove all the spindles. The trick is to teach you how to handle a spindle safely so that it won\u2019t sting you.\u201d\n\nEmphasizing external factors that impact a women\u2019s success can also encourage individuals to \u201cexternalize\u201d what happens to them, which can be demotivating and frankly demoralizing. Social psychologists have identified this phenomenon called the locus of control, describing the extent to which individuals believe they influence what happens to them. Those who de-emphasize environmental factors, but instead believe they can control their lives are more likely to have higher expectations of themselves, perform better in school, have better health, and take action rather than wish for change.\n\nPerhaps a better solution would be to treat boys and girls as individuals rather than members of groups in need of filtered language and gender-specific treatment in order to succeed. Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer\u2019s own success may be in part due to the fact that she was not hyper-focused on gender and the external and cultural barriers she faced.\n\nReflecting upon her computer science classes at Stanford, Mayer says her lack of gender awareness was \u201cactually healthy.\u201d She goes on to say, \u201cI think if I had felt more self-conscious about being the only woman along the way, I think it would have actually stifled me a lot more.\u201d Mayer also pointed out in 2012 when she was still at Google, \u201cI\u2019m not a woman at Google; I\u2019m a geek at Google. If you can find something that you\u2019re really passionate about, whether you\u2019re a man or a woman comes a lot less into play. Passion is a gender-neutralizing force.\u201d\n\nMost women don\u2019t want to feel like people are treating them with kid gloves or are in need of gender-specific treatment. Growing up it never occurred to me that I could accomplish anything less than men. I had assumed the time had long passed since society systematically held women down. It wasn\u2019t until recently when older feminist sages brought it to my attention that I began to notice some of the problems they mentioned still existed. However, noticing these things arguably made things worse, and I found it\u2014like Mayer said\u2014\u201cstifling.\u201d\n\nCheck our Marissa Mayer's talk here:\n\n)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and author of the \u201csort of feminist manifesto\u201d Lean In, is fighting the good fight once more with her campaign to", "title": "Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s Word Police: Have You Banned Bossy Yet?", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/03/13/sheryl-sandbergs-word-police-have-you-ba", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_03/erin-patrice-obrien-for-the-wa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and author of the \u201csort of\nfeminist manifesto\u201d Lean\nIn, is fighting the good fight once more with her campaign\nto \u201cban bossy\u201d from our lexicon.
