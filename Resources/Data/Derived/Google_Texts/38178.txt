Ever wonder what a Denver Nuggets football helmet would look like?

Neither did I, but graphic designers James Politi and Luke Daly designed helmets for every single NBA team, including the Nuggets (above), in their “If the NBA had helmets” series.

The two stuck to two rules: No copying and pasting logos and no basketballs included in the designs because “only two of the 32 teams in the NFL have footballs on them (the helmets).”

Here’s how they designed the Nuggets’ helmet:

I altered the Nuggets’ alternate logo and placed (it) on the helmet after I cowered down and discarded a helmet that embraced the most colorful and intense throwbacks in history. I am typing in regret.

We could’ve had an ’80s rainbow Nuggets helmet. Sadness.
