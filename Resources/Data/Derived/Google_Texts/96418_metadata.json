There would be no attempt to save my life: instead, nature should take its course. For a few seconds I turned the words over in my mind, struggling to grasp their enormity. Then, as their meaning engulfed me, it was as if an icy hand had grasped my heart. If I stopped breathing, I would simply be left to die.\n\nDo Not Resuscitate Orders are a legitimate part of medicine. But they should be agreed to by patients/family/duly appointed patient surrogates.\n\nUnfortunately, UK law allows doctors to impose a DNR if the patient can\u2019t communicate, with only an attempt at discussion with family, who can be distant relatives. Rather than speak to Farmiloe\u2019s daughter who was nearby, doctors called in in-law who didn\u2019t understand her intense desire to fight.\n\nDoctors said she wouldn\u2019t live this long. But she has beat the odds and wants the law of DNR changed:\n\nFor the guidelines which govern DNR orders state that if you are unable to make and communicate this vital decision on your own \u2014 if your faculties are impaired or you are terribly confused, as I was \u2014 then the decision will be made for you by doctors, who should discuss the issue with your family. Extraordinarily, this does not have to be your next of kin. I did not authorise the DNR order \u2014 I was far too ill to think cogently. But I know absolutely that, even in my weaked state, I would have wanted to fight with every fibre of my being.\n\nShe says rightly that should be her decision, not that of doctors:\n\nThere must, I believe, be safer ways of administering DNR orders. Even those who appear to be on the brink of death can confound the wisest of doctors. I have proved as much. And I intend to continue to defy anyone who suggests that because I have terminal cancer I am dying. I am not. I have a lot more living to do yet.\n\nI am not looking down my nose. For example, last year I helped defeat a Texas bill that would have explicitly authorized unilateral imposition of DNR.\n\nI should have said \u201cdelayed\u201d instead of \u201cdefeated.\u201d The idea isn\u2019t going away, particularly given Obamacare\u2019s pending cost/benefit medical technocracy.\n\nIf you do or don\u2019t want DNR, be sure and prepare a durable power of attorney for health care to better ensure that your wishes\u2013rather than that of strangers\u2013will determine whether you receive a potentially life-saving course.\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Wesley J.
