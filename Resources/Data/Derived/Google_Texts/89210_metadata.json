And all of us, in our own lives, have the power to set an example. Join our campaign to stop this violence. Go to itsonus.org and take the pledge. And to the artists at the Grammys tonight, I ask you to ask your fans to do it too.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on us, all of us, to create a culture where violence isn\u2019t tolerated, where survivors are supported, and where all our young people, men and women, can go as far as their talents and their dreams will take them,\u201d Obama concluded. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter @NussBB", "article_metadata": {"description": "Watch: Obama Anti-Rape PSA Airs During Grammys", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Watch: Obama Anti-Rape PSA Airs During Grammys", "title": "Watch: Obama Anti-Rape PSA Airs During Grammys - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 488, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Obama28.jpg", "height": 366}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/02/08/watch-obama-anti-rape-psa-airs-during-grammys/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Watch: Obama Anti-Rape PSA Airs During Grammys", "title": "Watch: Obama Anti-Rape PSA Airs During Grammys - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Obama28.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Grammys, Obama, Rape, rape PSA,Breitbart TV, Obama,Obama rape psa", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "rape PSA", "published_time": "2015-02-08T19:20:46-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Obama"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf127\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cGood evening everybody,\u201d Obama began his remarks.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPresident Barack Obama delivered pre-recorded remarks at the Grammy Awards Sunday night, telling artists and their fans to join a pledge to end rape and violence against women.\nAnd all of us, in our own lives, have the power to set an example.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not okay, and it has to stop.\u201d\u201cArtists have a unique power to change minds and attitudes and get us thinking and talking about what matters.\nJoin our campaign to stop this violence."}
