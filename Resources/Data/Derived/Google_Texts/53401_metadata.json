Here is the full statement:\n\n\u201cMatt Prater of the Denver Broncos has been suspended without pay for the first four games of the 2014 regular season for violating the NFL Policy and Program for Substances of Abuse.\n\n\u201cPrater will be eligible to return to the Broncos\u2019 active roster on Monday, October 6 following the team\u2019s October 5 game against the Arizona Cardinals.\n\n\u201cPrater is eligible to participate in all offseason and preseason practices and games.\u201d\n\nThe 30-year-old kicker violated the league\u2019s substance-abuse policy. The violation was alcohol-related. Prater has been in the league\u2019s alcohol program since soon after he was charged with driving under the influence Aug. 12, 2011. He had also been arrested for DUI in 2008, in Orlando, and is barred from drinking alcohol while in the intervention program.\n\nThe four-game suspension, which is expected to be announced Monday, was part of an agreement reached between Prater\u2019s attorney, Harvey Steinberg, and the league, so an appeal is not expected. The NFL had initially threatened a one-year suspension.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NFL releases statement on Broncos kicker Matt Prater\u2019s suspension", "title": "NFL releases statement on Broncos kicker Matt Prater\u2019s suspension", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/26/nfl-releases-statement-on-broncos-kicker-matt-praters-suspension/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140825__FBNBroncosPrater2.jpg", "height": 325}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140825__FBNBroncosPrater2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-26T09:46:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:18:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda84\"", "article_summary": "The NFL released its statement Tuesday on Broncos kicker Matt Prater\u2019s suspension.\n\u201cPrater is eligible to participate in all offseason and preseason practices and games.\u201dThe 30-year-old kicker violated the league\u2019s substance-abuse policy.\nHere is the full statement:\u201cMatt Prater of the Denver Broncos has been suspended without pay for the first four games of the 2014 regular season for violating the NFL Policy and Program for Substances of Abuse.\nPrater has been in the league\u2019s alcohol program since soon after he was charged with driving under the influence Aug. 12, 2011.\nThe NFL had initially threatened a one-year suspension."}
