Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), one of Congress\u2019 less-conservative members, shared his frustrations about his party\u2019s direction.\n\n\u201c Week one, we had a Speaker election that did not go as well as a lot of us would have liked,\u201d Dent told reporters. \u201cWeek two, we got into a big fight over deporting children, something that a lot of us didn\u2019t want to have a discussion about. Week three, we are now talking about rape and incest and reportable rapes and incest for minors\u2026. I just can\u2019t wait for week four.\u201d\n\nIf Dent is waiting for the Republican majority to get serious about its governing responsibilities, I\u2019m afraid the Pennsylvania congressman will just have to be patient \u2013 \u201cweek four\u201d will feature more nonsense .\n\nThe House will vote next week on a bill to undermine the 2010 healthcare overhaul in what will be close to the 60th time over the last four years. Next week\u2019s vote will be the first in this Congress to repeal ObamaCare in full, leadership aides said. The House has already voted three times to modify the healthcare law this month, including to establish a full-time workweek as 40 hours instead of 30. The vote will allow new House GOP freshmen who campaigned on repealing ObamaCare to put their pledges to a vote.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I used to pass by a McDonald\u2019s on the way home from school, and it had one of those big signs out front that read, \u201cOver __ Billion Served.\u201d Periodically, as I recall, someone would actually change the number to show that the chain has cleared another threshold, but after a while, they were replaced with less specific signs. \u201cBillions and Billions Served,\u201d the new signs read.\n\nI always figured the chain still kept track, but at a certain point, there just wasn\u2019t any point to specifying exactly how many customers had come through the doors around the globe. It was a lot; it was what McDonald\u2019s was good at; and that was enough.\n\nI thought of this yesterday when learning about the House GOP\u2019s plan for next week. Just how many times have Republicans voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act? Sure, we could check, and someone is no doubt keeping track, but like McDonald\u2019s, we can probably just assume the number is very large and move on. Some folks sell hamburgers, some folks vote repeatedly to take away families\u2019 access to medical care. The exact tally becomes less important over time.\n\nIn the upper chamber, meanwhile, Senate Republicans are equally busy pursuing pointless endeavors\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) plans to bring to the Senate floor next week a House-passed bill reversing President Obama\u2019s executive actions shielding millions of illegal immigrants from deportation. [\u2026] McConnell said the Senate will consider it next week after finishing work on legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nWill these measures become law? Of course not. But the point isn\u2019t to legislate or govern; the point is to invest time and energy in bills Republicans know will fail, but which nevertheless make them feel better.\n\nThere was a point, immediately after the 2014 midterms, when quite a few Beltway commentators said Republicans, at long last, would get \u201cserious\u201d about governing. Never mind what happened before, these pundits said, now that they controlled Congress in its entirety, GOP lawmakers were ready to prove just how capable and responsible they can be.\n\nI hate to say, \u201cI told you so,\u201d but it\u2019s hard not to wonder whether these pundits are kicking themselves as they watch developments unfold on Capitol Hill.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, this isn\u2019t a total condemnation of \u201cmessage\u201d votes or symbolic measures \u2013 on occasion, there\u2019s real value in bringing a let\u2019s-get-everyone-on-the-record bill to the floor. Last week\u2019s measures in the Senate on whether members believe in climate science didn\u2019t have any specific legislative meaning, but the results were nevertheless informative.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Remember after the midterms when we were told Republicans would get \"serious\" about governing?
