When the leadership at Roper St. Francis Healthcare System decided to spend millions to implement a new enterprise EMR system, they didn't do it in a vacuum. Instead, they created a multi-department team -- including revenue cycle -- to make sure that the benefits the new EMR aligned with the 657-bed systemâ€™s goal of transitioning to value-based care.

Three RSF leaders discuss this process in the following presentation. Carol Martin, director of quality informatics; Diane Story, director of revenue cycle improvement; and Value Benefits Project Lead Patricia Newcomb reveal how they worked collaboratively with other team members, and highlight key revenue cycle requirements.
