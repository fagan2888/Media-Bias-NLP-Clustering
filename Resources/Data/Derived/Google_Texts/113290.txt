A series of moderate earthquakes continues to shake northern Oklahoma, near the Kansas border.

The U.S. Geological Survey recorded a 3.7 magnitude quake two miles west of Cushing at 1:59 p.m. Sunday, following 3.5 and 3.4 magnitude quakes nine miles northwest of Medford at 10:04 p.m. Saturday and 2:29 a.m. Sunday. Magnitude 2.9 and 2.5 temblors were also recorded Sunday near Medford.

No injuries or damage are reported.

The quakes come after 17 earthquakes were recorded in the area from Friday night through Saturday afternoon -- including magnitude 4.2 and 4.1 temblors near Medford that were reported felt in Oberlin, Kansas, some 400 miles away.

The Oklahoma Geological Survey has said many recent earthquakes in the state likely were triggered by the injection of wastewater from oil and natural gas drilling operations.

Nearly a dozen earthquakes have rattled parts of Oklahoma and Kansas since Friday afternoon.

The latest temblor felt in Kansas was a magnitude 4.2. The U.S Geological Survey says the quake occurred at 12:29 p.m. Saturday about 10 miles north-northwest of Medford, Oklahoma. It was the strongest of the 12 quakes to shake up the region in less than 24 hours.

Of the 11 other quakes, 10 of them occurred in north-central Oklahoma. They ranged in magnitude from 2.5 to 3.5. One of them, however, was a 4.1 and also happened near Medford at 5:11 a.m..

Though the two strongest Oklahoma quakes were felt in south-central Kansas, only one of them actually occurred in the Sunflower State. It was a magnitude 2.9 that hit around 1 a.m. Saturday in Harper County.
