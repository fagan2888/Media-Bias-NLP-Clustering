Ever had to fight with your doctor's office about a bill you didn't think you had to pay? I know I have: I once had to make upwards of 200 calls until my insurance company agreed to take care of my annual exam. It was infuriating and a huge time-suck. Even worse, though, was that the ordeal made me nervous to go back the next year, in case the same thing happened again.

Turns out those of us who've dealt with this problem are far from alone. According to two new reports from the National Women's Law Center Insurance companies are widely violating the Affordable Care Act (ACA) when it comes to women's health. The center looked at practices of more than 100 companies in 15 states and found violations in every single stateâ€”and suggested that the shady business is probably happening nationwide. The ACA was signed into law five years ago; shouldn't the insurance guys have their act together by now?

Here's what should always be covered: your annual well-woman visit with your gynecologist, all FDA-approved birth-control methods (without a copay or deductible, keep in mind), maternity care, breast-feeding support, and HIV and HPV screening, to name a few. Unsure whether a procedure or prescription should be your responsibility? You can find a full list of covered at the Health Resources and Services Administration website.

If you're insured but get stuck with a bill for any medicine or service you think should be covered, fight back. For tips about how to take control (and save some dough), check out the National Women's Law Center's CoverHer hotline at coverher.org.
