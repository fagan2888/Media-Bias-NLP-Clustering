Mary Landrieu, D-La., and Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., greet each other before the start of their final debate for the Senate election runoff on Monday in Baton Rouge, La. Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nLouisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu is likely in the final throes of her U.S. Senate career, but she scored one last victory in the closing debate with her Republican opponent Monday night.\n\nWith polls showing her down double digits to Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., ahead of Saturday\u2019s runoff election, Landrieu turned in a scrappy, pugnacious, unrelenting debate performance. This campaign extended into December when neither candidate acquired more than 50 percent of the vote last month.\n\n[READ: After Keystone, Landrieu Faces Tougher Re-lection]\n\nWhereas Landrieu was poised, well-prepared and aggressive, Cassidy was stiff, repetitive and at times, plain awkward.\n\nThere were a few moments where the three-term incumbent gazed over at Cassidy while he answered questions, as if to convey: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m losing to this guy.\u201d\n\nYet she is losing. But it may have more to do with changing demographics in the Bayou State, the deterioration of the Democratic Party\u2019s brand in the South and President Barack Obama\u2019s dreadful unpopularity than anything Landrieu could have done.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know how she could save herself from this year\u2019s crushing midterm GOP wave. It\u2019s questionable that even renouncing her vote for the Affordable Care Act \u2013 a consistent critique of Cassidy\u2019s \u2013 would have made a difference.\n\nBut Landrieu pulled out all the stops she had left in their final and only faceoff since the November election.\n\nAbove all else, she repeatedly smacked Cassidy for collecting a salary from Louisiana State University while serving in Congress. Landrieu charged that Cassidy, a physician, received thousands of dollars from the school for undocumented work.\n\n\u201cHe is not a doctor for the poor, he is a doctor for himself,\u201d she slammed, predicting Cassidy would be wrestling with legal troubles in the Senate if voters chose to elect him. \u201cHe\u2019ll be doing a lot more than fighting President Obama. He will be fighting subpoenas.\u201d\n\n[ALSO: Landrieu's Biggest Hurdle in Louisiana? Obama]\n\nCassidy didn\u2019t directly respond to the accusations, only saying that his work helped the poor and uninsured and that he loves treating patients and teaching.\n\nLandrieu also knocked the congressman for supporting raising the retirement age to qualify for Social Security to 70 years old. She accused him of suggesting recipients of government subsidies are drug abusers, calling the supposition \u201coutrageous.\u201d She even attempted to mask her support for abortion rights, declaring \u201cI do not promote abortion and never have,\u201d a statement that caused an outcry from conservatives.\n\nBut she made it her calling card to come back to the questions surrounding the work Cassidy performed for LSU, dubbing him a \u201ccongressman padding his own payroll.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only doctor in the Congress that has this sweetheart deal,\u201d she said, noting her opponent collected dual salaries.\n\nWhen presented with her own political liability \u2013 that she improperly billed flights for political events with government funds \u2013 she came armed with records ostensibly detailing her travel expenditures, calling the previous mistake \u201ca bookkeeping error.\u201d\n\n[ALSO: Mary Landrieu Is Not Pleased. Can You Blame Her?]\n\nA stunt? Sure. But she answered the thorny question head on while deftly turning the attention to Cassidy\u2019s own personal financial situation.\n\nOn more than one opportunity, Cassidy used his response time to note Landrieu voted with Obama \u201c97 percent of the time,\u201d a refrain that has served as the guiding principle to his campaign.\n\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t have this issue to talk about, he wouldn\u2019t have any issue to talk about. That\u2019s all he talked about this whole campaign,\u201d Landrieu responded.\n\nAs tough and firm as Landrieu was, she noticeably kept a warm smile on her face when she was being attacked, even as she kept her eyes trained on Cassidy during their exchanges. Cassidy, for the most part, looked straight ahead. He relied on the strange refrain \u201cWe can tweet that\u201d in several of his answers.\n\nWhen Landrieu was preparing to pose her direct candidate question to Cassidy, he oddly blurted out: \u201cI think this is Dr. Double Dip. I saw your notes.\u201d\n\nThe twittersphere exploded with shock, awe and, of course, jokes.\n\nBut the twittersphere isn\u2019t the Louisiana electorate. And the early signs show Republicans are winning the race on the ground. They are commanding the early vote and are enjoying a sizable spending advantage on the air along with a significant polling lead. Louisiana looks to be the ninth pick-up for Republicans in the Senate this cycle.\n\nLandrieu\u2019s the far superior politician and the more effective communicator in the race, but that hardly guarantees victory anymore in low-turnout campaigns that have become thoroughly nationalized.\n\nIn the closing moments of the debate, the candidates were asked to recall the biggest mistake in their professional life. Landrieu cited an unspecified speech she made as a young legislator that revealed her to be unprepared.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten to be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cKnow your material. Show up and debate.\u201d\n\nLandrieu delivered on that life lesson Monday.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Mary Landrieu Wins a Battle Before Losing the War", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The Louisiana Democrat outperforms Bill Cassidy in their final Senate debate.", "title": "Mary Landrieu Wins a Battle Before Losing the War", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/12/02/mary-landrieu-wins-a-battle-before-losing-the-war", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/29/88/9447a06c4bcc91ed7bd4ff360102/141202-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The Louisiana Democrat outperforms Bill Cassidy in their final Senate debate.", "card": "summary", "title": "Mary Landrieu Wins a Battle Before Losing the War"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 2, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "David Catanese,Landrieu, Mary,Louisiana,Senate,Louisiana State University,politics,Collections: Political,Pulse,picks,2014 Congressional elections,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Louisiana Democrat outperforms Bill Cassidy in their final Senate debate."}, "article_summary": "[READ: After Keystone, Landrieu Faces Tougher Re-lection]Whereas Landrieu was poised, well-prepared and aggressive, Cassidy was stiff, repetitive and at times, plain awkward.\nSen.
