We hope the Supreme Court will hear our case and ensure that people from diverse faiths can freely follow God\u2019s calling in their lives.\u201d\n\nThe latest action by the Denver-based Little Sisters follows a July 14 ruling by the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals that the religious order and other religious entities are not substantially burdened by procedures set out by the federal government by which they can avoid the requirement to provide contraceptive coverage in employee health insurance.\n\nThe circuit court ruling also affected Christian Brothers Services and Christian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust, the Catholic ministries through which the Little Sisters obtain their health coverage, and included challenges to the procedures filed by Southern Nazarene University, Oklahoma Wesleyan University, Oklahoma Baptist University, Mid-America Christian University, Truett-McConnell College and Reaching Souls, an Oklahoma-based a non-profit corporation founded by a Southern Baptist minister that trains pastors and evangelists and provides care to orphans in Africa, India and Cuba.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, all health insurance plans are required to provide coverage for birth control drugs and procedures. Churches themselves and other institutions that primarily employ and serve members of the churches are exempt.\n\nNon-profit religious entities such as Church-run colleges and social service agencies are not exempt, but the federal Department of Health and Human Services created what it calls an \u201caccommodation\u201d under which such organisations morally opposed to the coverage may file a particular form or notify HHS that they will not provide it.\n\nThe contraceptive coverage is then provided to those organisations\u2019 employees, but through third parties, and with no cost or further involvement to the employer. Entities that refuse to comply with the mandate are subject to significant fines.\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor and other organisations that sued say that the acts of filling out the form or notifying HHS are a substantial burden on their religious rights because the steps implicate them in the ultimate provision of contraceptives. The court disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe Little Sisters consider it immoral to help the government distribute these drugs,\u201d said Mark Rienzi, senior counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and lead attorney for the religious order.\n\n\u201cBut instead of simply exempting them, the government insists that it can take over their ministry\u2019s employee health care to distribute these drugs to their employees, while dismissing the Sisters\u2019 moral objections as irrelevant,\u201d he said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cIn America, judges and government bureaucrats have no authority to tell the Little Sisters what is moral or immoral. And the government can distribute its drugs without nuns \u2014 it has its own health care exchanges that can provide whatever it wants.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/content/themes/catholicherald/images/icons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#b91d47", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/content/themes/catholicherald/images/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1081\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn America, judges and government bureaucrats have no authority to tell the Little Sisters what is moral or immoral.\n\u201cAs Little Sisters of the Poor we dedicate our lives to serving the neediest in society, with love and dignity,\u201d she said in a statement.\nAnd the government can distribute its drugs without nuns \u2014 it has its own health care exchanges that can provide whatever it wants.\u201d\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, all health insurance plans are required to provide coverage for birth control drugs and procedures.\n\u201cWe perform this loving ministry because of our faith and simply cannot choose between our care for the elderly poor and our faith, and we shouldn\u2019t have to."}
