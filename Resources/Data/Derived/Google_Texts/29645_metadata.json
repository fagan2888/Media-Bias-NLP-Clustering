The 41-year-old Thomas was in the league\u2019s officiating development program in 2013 and \u201914 and worked some team minicamps last year.\n\nShe\u2019s already broken ground in the officiating field as the first woman to work college games in 2007. She was the first female official on the FBS level and the first to officiate a bowl game, the 2009 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl in Detroit.\n\n\u201cI am a female, but I don\u2019t look at myself as just a female,\u201d Thomas said last June while working a Cleveland Browns minicamp. \u201cI look at myself as an official.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Sarah Thomas to be NFL\u2019s first female full-time referee\n\nShannon Eastin worked regular-season NFL games in 2012 as a replacement official, making her the first woman to do so in any capacity. She also was a line judge.\n\nThomas, a former college basketball player, was inspired to become an official in the 1990s when she attended a meeting with her brother, Lea. In 1996, Thomas became the first woman to officiate in a Division 1-A high school football game in Mississippi.\n\nJust under a decade later, she began officiating college games when she was hired by Conference USA, working as a line judge and head linesman. She also has worked the Senior Bowl, the Fight Hunger Bowl, the Medal of Honor Bowl, and the Conference USA championship game in 2010 and 2014.\n\nThomas officiated two seasons in the United Football League, which is now out of business.\n\nNine first-year officials were announced Wednesday. The group includes side judge Walt Coleman IV, the son of NFL referee Walt Coleman. The Colemans will become the third active father-son officiating duo, joining Ed and Shawn Hochuli and Steve and Brad Freeman.\n\nThe other new officials are line judge Kevin Codey from the American Athletic Conference; head linesmen Hugo Cruz of Conference USA and Bart Longson of the Pac-12; umpire Clay Martin of C-USA; side judges Aaron Santi of the Pac-12 and Jabir Walker of the SEC; and field judge Shawn Smith of the Big Ten.\n\nOff the field, Thomas is a pharmaceutical representative. She said last June her two sons and one daughter see nothing extraordinary about her football job.\n\n\u201cThey just know mom officiates and it\u2019s nothing foreign to them or pioneering or anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI do this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Sarah Thomas hired as first NFL female official", "title": "Sarah Thomas hired as first NFL female official", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/08/sarah-thomas-hired-as-first-nfl-female-official/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150408_084947_sarah-thomas.jpg", "height": 485}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150408_084947_sarah-thomas.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-08T08:49:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:49:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI am a female, but I don\u2019t look at myself as just a female,\u201d Thomas said last June while working a Cleveland Browns minicamp.\nNEW YORK \u2014 The NFL has its first full-time female game official.\nSarah Thomas, who has worked exhibition games, will be a line judge for the 2015 season, the league announced Wednesday.\nShe was the first female official on the FBS level and the first to officiate a bowl game, the 2009 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl in Detroit.\nShe also was a line judge."}
