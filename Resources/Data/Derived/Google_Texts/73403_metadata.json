Study Boosts Keystone Pipeline Prospects\n\nAFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told The Washington Post last week, \"We think that anything that's going to create jobs, help the country and do it in an environmentally sound way ought to be done.\" American Petroleum Institute officials say approval of the full pipeline could \u201csupport 42,000 jobs\u201d and \u201cput $2 billion in workers\u2019 pockets during its construction.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental groups that have battled the project for the past five years say the economic benefit has been vastly overblown, and that once the pipeline is built, there would be fewer than 50 permanent jobs connected with the pipeline in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nAnthony Swift, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said derisively that the number of construction jobs generated by Keystone would be comparable to the construction crew of a \u201cmedium-sized shopping mall.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a national jobs policy,\u201d Swift said in an interview Monday. \u201cThe argument that Keystone XL is something that needs to happen to put Americans back to work is really overblown. We\u2019re not looking at a jobs-creating vehicle of any significance.\u201d\n\nRelated: Canada Warns Obama on Keystone XL Pipeline\n\nNRDC, the Sierra Club and other environmental groups have vigorously opposed the pipeline \u2013 warning of the dangers of oil spills, serious damage to wildlife and ground water, and worsening climate change. According to one estimate the 830,000 barrel a day would add 1.2 billion metric tons of carbon pollution to the atmosphere over its 50-year estimated lifespan.\n\nLast Friday, the State Department issued a much anticipated final environmental assessment \u2013 one that boosted the case for industry proponents. The report found that the proposed 875-mile pipeline between Alberta, Canada and U.S. refineries along the Gulf Coast probably wouldn\u2019t alter global green-house gas emissions.\n\nThat\u2019s because even if President Obama were to side with environmentalists and permanently block the pipeline construction, the Canadians would almost certainly continue to develop their oil sands and ship the crude oil across the United States by rail.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is the job project that has been sitting on the shelf for way too many years,\u201d said Sabrina Fang, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group. \u201cThe president\u2019s own State Department has said in many reports now that this project will create more than 42,000 jobs to build the pipeline \u2013 that\u2019s indirect and direct jobs.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Climate Plan - Trade-off for Keystone XL Pipeline?\n\n\u201cAnd this is a great infrastructure project that will enhance our energy security,\u201d she added. \u201cThe fact of the matter is \u2013 I don\u2019t think many people know \u2013 we can be North American self-sufficient in liquid fuels in about a decade if we get more Canadian energy, and combine that with our own U.S. production.\u201d\n\nAlmost from the beginning, the tar sand industry has been pitching its pet project as a national jobs generator. In the early going, industry proponents boasted that the Keystone XL would create \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of jobs, Swift recalled, while some in the news media speculated that it might bring as many as a million jobs.\n\nLater, oil companies, the API, many politicians and a few unions who urged the State Department to approve the pipeline framed Keystone XL as an economic game changer. They claimed it would be the source of 20,000 \u201cdirect jobs\u201d \u2013 meaning primarily construction workers \u2013 and 108,000 \u201cindirect jobs,\u201d which could mean anything from suppliers to restaurants feeding crew members.\n\nAPI also cites numbers from the Canadian Energy Research Institute that the pipeline could \u201csupport\u201d 117,000 new American jobs associated with oil sands development by 2035.\n\nLast August, Obama pooh-poohed the industry\u2019s claims, saying that in a workforce of more than 150 million Americans, the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline would be a \"blip relative to the need.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen people mock these job numbers,\u201d Fang, the spokesperson for API, said. \u201cBut the fact of the matter is, a job is a job. These are good-paying jobs and if you want to talk about construction work, all construction jobs are temporary jobs.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Keystone XL Pipeline project cleared another major hurdle last week, and in the process rekindled a long-simmering dispute over the potential economic benefit of the $54 billion TransCanada project to the U.S. economy.
