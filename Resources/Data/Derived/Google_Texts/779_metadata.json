According to the tabloid, The Big Bang Theory production delay played a part in Jim Parsons\u2019 decision to get engaged:\n\n\u201cThe week\u2019s work stoppage left Jim with unexpected time on his hands. That led to a heart-to-heart with Todd, the 37-year-old art director who has been his partner for nearly 11 years.\u201d\n\nAn unnamed source told The Enquirer that Jim Parsons hasn\u2019t popped the question yet because \u201che wanted to make sure that he was settled and secure before he took on such a major change.\u201d The source went on to claim that Todd Spiewak pressured Jim into getting engaged by pointing out that his lucrative new Big Bang Theory contract will provide the couple with all the stability that they need.\n\nHowever, Big Bang Theory fans might see a Shamy wedding before they see Parsons and Spiewak walking down the aisle. Jim was quick to respond to the engagement rumors with a cute throwback Instagram photo bearing this caption:\n\n\u201cMe and Todd in 2003. Still very happy today\u2026 And NOT engaged! #justFYI #NationalEnquirerMakesS**tUp #duh.\u201d\n\nSome Big Bang Theory fans just don\u2019t understand why Jim Parsons refuses to wed Todd Spiewak. Marilynm60 wrote:\n\n\u201cI agree you should get married, this way you have the right to make important medical decisions if one of you would take I\u2019ll.\u201d\n\nOther fans see nothing wrong with the couple remaining unwed. Ericatrippy wrote:\n\n\u201cThe two of you know what your relationship needs and if marriage isn\u2019t necessary then it isn\u2019t necessary. You\u2019re happy and in love and that\u2019s all that matters. If only all of us could have that. You two are absolutely adorable. Congrats on 11 years and here\u2019s to many, MANY more!\u201d\n\nAs The Inquisitr previously reported, Jim Parsons recently admitted that marriage has never been a life goal for him. However, The Big Bang Theory actor is happy that more and more members of the LGBTQ community are getting the opportunity to wed their partners.\n\nDuring an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Jim Parsons struggled to explain why he\u2019s so against the idea of getting married. According to the Daily Mail, this is how The Big Bang Theory star responded when DeGeneres asked him if he would ever consider tying the knot:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a hard one. You get used to your life as it is.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like Parsons is a creature of habit just like his Big Bang Theory character.\n\nSpeaking of the odd creature that is Sheldon Cooper, Mayim Bialik recently dropped a hint about the astrophysicist\u2019s future when she shared the Instagram photo below. It reveals the title of the first episode of season 8 of The Big Bang Theory.\n\nThe \u201clocomotion\u201d could refer to the locomotive that Sheldon is on, and it sounds like his train trip might come to an end before it\u2019s supposed to. This will probably make Amy and Shamy fans very happy, but hopefully Shelly is gone long enough to find the peace that he\u2019s searching for.\n\nSheldon might actually realize that he misses Amy during the time that he\u2019s away, and maybe soon Big Bang Theory fans will get to witness the nerdiest nuptials ever \u2013 Shamy\u2019s wedding wouldn\u2019t be complete without replicas of the One Ring from Lord of the Rings, a Flash T-shirt underneath Sheldon\u2019s suit, and Amy rocking Princess Leia buns.\n\nWould you like to see a Shamy wedding on The Big Bang Theory, or do you think that Parsons and his character both need to stick to their guns by refusing to conform to social conventions?\n\n[Image credit: Robyn Beck/Getty via E!
