None of it was surprising, but that didn\u2019t make it any less awful to watch. So here\u2019s a selection of sound bites from this morning\u2019s Ferguson coverage.\n\nMark Furman, retired LAPD detective:\n\n\u201cWell, I think it was very predictable, Bill, because even the limited amount that we knew we could actually paint a fairly good picture that Michael Brown was the suspect from the very beginning to the very end. He precipitated every action that was used against him, he precipitated every contact with officer Wilson.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Wilson\u2019s] career has been stolen from him because somebody targeted him, not the reverse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that people are missing here is that you have entire parts of a community that is supporting Michael Brown, absent of the fact that Michael Brown committed not only a robbery but attacked a uniformed officer on duty and tried to kill him. That for some reason escaped everybody.\u201d\n\nDavid Webb, Fox News contributor:\n\n\u201cIt was no longer, and frankly for a lot of them, never had been about Michael Brown but the people who had been stirred up by Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson and others who simply are there for the, as you call it, they advertise themselves, but it\u2019s a bait and switch on the black community to think they in any way represent the best interests of solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seem to have given away our voice and our actions to these purported race grievance industry leaders like Al Sharpton and Jackson and the social engineering constructs being ginned up by Eric Holder and others. Those don\u2019t solve the problems.\u201d\n\nHost Jon Scott:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the irony here, is some people seem to think that a terrible crime was visited upon Michael Brown and they respond to it with terrible crimes.\u201d\n\nJon: \u201cWe\u2019re in an America where in this particular place haven\u2019t the flames been fanned by the media, you know talking about an unarmed black teen shot by a white police officer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since the Ferguson verdict was announced, Fox News has predictably been a carnival of terrible opinions", "title": "\u201cWilson\u2019s career has been stolen from him\u201d: Today\u2019s most horrifying Fox news sound bites", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Since the Ferguson verdict was announced, Fox News has predictably been a carnival of terrible opinions", "title": "\u201cWilson\u2019s career has been stolen from him\u201d: Today\u2019s most horrifying Fox news sound bites", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/25/wilsons_career_has_been_stolen_from_him_todays_most_horrifying_fox_news_soundbites/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/fox-news1-1280x825.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Since the Ferguson verdict was announced, Fox News has predictably been a carnival of terrible opinions", "title": "\u201cWilson\u2019s career has been stolen from him\u201d: Today\u2019s most horrifying Fox news sound bites", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/fox-news1-1280x825.jpg", "creator": "@annaesilman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anna Silman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ferguson, ferguson missouri, Fox News, Media, michael brown, Riots, Shooting", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2442\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Ferguson, ferguson missouri, Fox News, Media, michael brown, Riots, Shooting, Politics NewsSince the Ferguson verdict was announced last night, Fox News has been a carnival of talking heads spewing commentary that veers between depressing and infuriating and exhausting.\nSo here\u2019s a selection of sound bites from this morning\u2019s Ferguson coverage.\nNone of it was surprising, but that didn\u2019t make it any less awful to watch.\nMark Furman, retired LAPD detective:\u201cWell, I think it was very predictable, Bill, because even the limited amount that we knew we could actually paint a fairly good picture that Michael Brown was the suspect from the very beginning to the very end.\nHe precipitated every action that was used against him, he precipitated every contact with officer Wilson.\u201d\u201c[Wilson\u2019s] career has been stolen from him because somebody targeted him, not the reverse.\u201d\u201cThe thing that people are missing here is that you have entire parts of a community that is supporting Michael Brown, absent of the fact that Michael Brown committed not only a robbery but attacked a uniformed officer on duty and tried to kill him."}
