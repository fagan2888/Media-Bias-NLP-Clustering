French police officers and forensic experts examine the car used by armed, masked gunmen who stormed the Paris offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people, in Paris Wednesday. Three men reportedly armed with a Kalashnikov and a rocket-launcher stormed the building and exchanged fire with police before one of them hijacked a car and escaped. Dominique Faget/AFP/Getty Images
