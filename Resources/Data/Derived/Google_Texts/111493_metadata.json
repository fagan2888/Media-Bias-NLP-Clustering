Mike Pence ignited a national firestorm by signing into law the state\u2019s new Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nLawmakers believed the act would \u201censure that Indiana law will respect religious freedom and apply the highest level of scrutiny to any state or local governmental action that infringes on people\u2019s religious liberty.\u201d\n\nBut to the Twitterverse, it meant \u201ca license to discriminate\u201d \u2013 mostly against the LGBT community, who reasoned that business owners could legally refuse to serve them.\n\nJust days before the NCAA Final Four basketball tournament was set to arrive in the capitol city of Indianapolis, staff at tourism promoters such as Visit Indy flew into \u201cfull crisis mode\u201d as boycotts were called for, rock concerts were canceled and national conventions pulled out.\n\nSince then \u2013 and amid similar actions taken in Arkansas \u2013 revisions were made to the act\u2019s language to clarify that it does not provide business owners the legal right to discriminate against their customers based on sexual orientation. Despite that fix, the Associated Press has reported, repairs to Indiana\u2019s tarnished brand will take years.\n\nTo NIU political scientist Mitch Pickerill, the hullabaloo in Hoosierland is only natural and merely the latest step in a process that began a half-century ago.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he says, it\u2019s a throwback to the conciliatory nature of old-school politics.\n\n\u201cWe live in a polarized world now. Politicians are engaged in policymaking and position-taking to appeal to their bases,\u201d says Pickerill, whose research interests include American politics and constitutional law.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is complicated. Cable news channels don\u2019t do the story justice,\u201d he adds. \u201cSometime you have to take it issue by issue and get some historical context to understand what happened.\u201d\n\nPickerill points to a 1963 case before the U.S. Supreme Court \u2013 Sherbert v. Verner \u2013 brought by Adeil Sherbert, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\n\n\u201cHer company went to a six-day work week: Monday through Saturday. For Seventh-day Adventists, their Sabbath is Saturday. She didn\u2019t go to work, got fired and was denied unemployment,\u201d he says.\n\nJustices voted 7-2 that, according to www.oyez.org, the South Carolina Employment Security Commission\u2019s eligibility restrictions \u201cimposed a significant burden on Sherbert\u2019s ability to freely exercise her faith.\u201d She was protected under the Free Exercise Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nFast-forward 30 years.\n\nIn Employment Division v. Smith, the court took on a case involving Native American counselors at a drug rehab center. \u201cPart of their rituals involved taking peyote,\u201d Pickerill says. \u201cThe hallucinations they got from it were visions from the gods.\u201d\n\nWhen they were fired for using drugs, their claims for unemployment compensation were turned down. Justices eventually voted 6-3 against the counselors in a 1990 ruling.\n\nAccording to www.oyez.org, \u201cJustice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, observed that the court has never held that an individual\u2019s religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conducts that government is free to regulate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn response to Smith, we got a political coalition of religious groups and civil rights groups who didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Pickerill says. \u201cThey lobbied Congress to pass the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which restored the old test from Sherbert v. Verner cases.\u201d\n\nSure enough, that also came before the high court, which struck down language applying directly to states.\n\n\u201cAfter that, you had broad coalition of liberal and conservative groups going to states and getting them to pass their own laws, each making a civil rights act for people whose civil freedom had been violated. It really wasn\u2019t very controversial,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat flared up in Indiana ignited from words not in the bill.\n\n\u201cSenate Bill 101 prohibits state or local governments from substantially burdening a person\u2019s ability to exercise their religion \u2013 unless the government can show that it has a compelling interest and that the action is the least-restrictive means of achieving it,\u201d the Indianapolis Star reported regarding the original language. \u201cAlthough the bill does not mention sexual orientation, opponents fear it could allow business owners to deny services to gays and lesbians for religious reasons.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Pickerill says, Indiana\u2019s headache came at a time when religious liberty is a hot-button issue thanks to the nation\u2019s extremely divisive opinions about Obamacare. In one prominent challenge, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 last year that the religious owners of Hobby Lobby can refuse to pay for certain kinds of contraception for its female employees.\n\nAt the same time, he adds, many state governments are \u201cunified\u201d under one political party and accomplishing things that are nearly impossible in gridlocked Washington.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting policies in these states that tend to sit on ideological extremes, such as marijuana legalization and gun rights. It doesn\u2019t typically blow up because the base of the party in power agrees with the policy,\u201d he says. \u201cThis just happened to make the national news and become part of a much broader story.\u201d\n\nHe can understand the feelings of business owners who\u2019d rather not bake cakes or rent tuxedos for same-sex weddings.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of political holding that position, and they\u2019re sincere about it. These are devout folks. We have a long history of freedom of religion in this country, and we have to respect sincerely held religious views even if we disagree with them,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the same time, I think we need to respect the concerns of the LGBT community with respect to discrimination based on sexual orientation.\u201d\n\nPickerill admits he\u2019s intrigued by this chapter in the \u201cculture wars\u201d and that \u201call of this publicity and pushback led to the kind of compromise we haven\u2019t been seeing lately, especially at the federal level.\u201d\n\nAlthough give-and-take \u201cis never fully satisfactory to either side,\u201d he says, \u201cit is how politics used to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe watch the news now, and everything\u2019s a scorecard. Who wins? Who loses? Sometimes, we forget that politics is about ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cTen to 15 years ago, I would not have believed that same-sex marriage would be legalized in the places where it\u2019s legal or that marijuana would be legal in the places where it\u2019s legal.\u201d\n\nConsidering such changes \u2013 welcome breaths of fresh air to some, recipes for destroying the American fabric to others \u2013 is it safe to assume that the nation is becoming less conservative?\n\nMaybe, Pickerill says.\n\n\u201cThe conventional wisdom among commentators and scholars is that Republicans right now tend to take positions that do not resonate with the Millennials and the generation coming up on their heels. One would think that would be a problem,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d he adds, \u201cthe Republicans hold most statehouses, and if you\u2019re sitting in the leadership of the Republican Party, maybe you\u2019re thinking, \u2018If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t\u2019 fix it.\u2019 But I\u2019ve got to think that, at some point, continuing to hold positions that a whole new wave of voters disagree with is going to come up and catch you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2af6\"", "article_summary": "Mike Pence ignited a national firestorm by signing into law the state\u2019s new Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\u201cThe hallucinations they got from it were visions from the gods.\u201dWhen they were fired for using drugs, their claims for unemployment compensation were turned down.\nWe have a long history of freedom of religion in this country, and we have to respect sincerely held religious views even if we disagree with them,\u201d he says.\nSince then \u2013 and amid similar actions taken in Arkansas \u2013 revisions were made to the act\u2019s language to clarify that it does not provide business owners the legal right to discriminate against their customers based on sexual orientation.\nIn Employment Division v.
