The stage is set of an epic budget showdown between the Florida House and Senate.

Later today, the House will vote -- and overwhelmingly approve -- its $76.2 billion budget. On Wednesday, the Senate unanimously approved its $80.4 billion budget 36-0.

Lawmakers have only one month to bridge that $4.2 billion gap, one of the widest budget discrepancies at this stage of the 60-day legislative session in recent memory.

And itâ€™s all over Obamacare.

For the past three years, Florida has refused $51 billion in federal money earmarked for expanding subsidized health care coverage. The Senate is now advancing a plan to expand coverage through the use of a state-run marketplace for private insurance. But the House has refused to consider it. Many have speculated that the federal government won't extend Florida's program for low-income patients unless the legislature expands Medicaid.

The state Agency for Health Care Administration announced on Wednesday that federal health care officials are temporarily suspending negotiations with Florida over aid to low-income-pool (LIP) hospitals, which is a $2.2 billion program.
