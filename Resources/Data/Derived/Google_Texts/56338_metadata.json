Maybe it\u2019s time for political observers start taking note. We always hope politicians will \u201cgrow\u201d in office, but in hindsight, their most destructive tendencies were almost always baked in the cake all along \u2014 deeply embedded in their most fundamental beliefs and self-image.\n\nLet\u2019s take President Obama, for example. There seem to be two constants in his life that should have been obvious all along: He is temperamentally calm and ideologically radical. If you\u2019re a liberal, this is a great advantage. The obvious problem for Republicans, of course, is that the former (a gut feeling about his moderation and likability) overwhelms the latter (a matter of record).\n\nThis is convenient, but it isn\u2019t fake. In terms of his calm demeanor, nothing \u2014 not even the disastrous launch of his landmark legislation \u2014 has visibly rattled the man. The \u201cNo Drama, Obama\u201d moniker wasn\u2019t just a line \u2014 it was utterly consistent with his M.O.\n\nAt the 1976 Republican convention, when asked by an old Reaganite what his \u201cdemeanor\u201d should be when approaching delegates, Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger famously quipped: \u201cDa meaner da better.\u201d In that regard, Obama\u2019s team seems to believe \u201cda calmer da better.\u201d It is doubtful this comes as naturally to the team as it does to the principal, but it has worked almost as successfully. By feigning calmness, Team Obama has too often managed to persuade us that we are the ones who are overreacting.\n\nOne could certainly argue that Obama\u2019s insouciance finally caught up with him. If his blas\u00e9 attitude didn\u2019t help create the website debacle, it certainly contributed to the fallout. But it hardly matters. Despite his recent failings, Obama did manage to win two elections, shift the balance of the federal courts, and pass ObamaCare.\n\nAlong the way, his temperamentally moderate persona helped belie his radical politics.\n\nThis is true, despite the fact that anyone paying attention should have known all along how he would govern. His support of \u201credistributive justice\u201d is arguably the most obvious and pernicious example.\n\nHe talked about it in a 2001 interview. He alluded to it when he talked to Joe the Plumber about spreading the wealth around. And he implemented it as president (always framed under the guise of the rich paying their fair share.)\n\nWell, it might be cold comfort for conservatives, but \u2014 thanks to ObamaCare \u2014 his cover is finally blown. Writing in the New York Times this Sunday, John Harwood observes:\n\n\u201c[F]or those nervous about potential changes, the president promised stability. \u2018If you like your current insurance, you will keep your current insurance,\u2019 Mr. Obama said the day he signed the legislation in March 2010, a promise he made repeatedly as the Oct. 1 opening day of the online health insurance marketplaces approached. \u201cHiding in plain sight behind that pledge \u2014 visible to health policy experts but not the general public \u2014 was the redistribution required to extend health coverage to those who had been either locked out or priced out of the market. \u201cNow some of that redistribution has come clearly into view.\u201d\n\nThis, of course, was always the plan. ObamaCare was always meant to be a win/lose, not a win/win. The urge to redistribute is deeply embedded in President Obama\u2019s psyche \u2014 possibly for as long as he can remember.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Calm, cool, and...collectivist?: How Obama's moderate personality belies his radical politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "For years, researchers have\u00a0suggested\u00a0that\u00a0our personalities are locked in by the time we hit preschool.
