Those agencies will not, however, send the form over to the OPM.\n\nWhen the online system is back up and running, applicants will have to reenter their information digitally, \u201cso that the required investigation may be completed through the regular process,\u201d the memo said.\n\nThe interim process was revealed shortly after the senators from Virginia, where many federal employees live, wrote the OPM expressing concern about how the government was going to handle thousands of new background checks with its submission system down.\n\n\u201cAlthough the time that e-QIP is offline will allow OPM to address the current backlog, that down time will also mean additional submissions will continue to pile up, exacerbating the problem when e-QIP is brought back online,\u201d wrote Democratic Sens.
