READINGTON A 45-year-old township man has been charged with taking a police summons, placing it between what the indictment calls his "butt cheeks," wiping the paper up and down, then and tossing it at a police officer.



Joseph Greenwood, of the Whitehouse Station section, was indicted on a fourth-degree charge of throwing bodily fluids.



Fourth-degree crimes carry a possible 18-month jail sentence, though most result in probation.



According to the indictment, Greenwood tossed the summons at Lt. John Insabella of the Readington Police Department on June 2.



Greenwood was given the summons after being released on a municipal court charge of threatening to assault another person, court records indicate.



Three months later, on Sept. 18, Greenwood was charged by Patrolman Patrick Brown with disorderly conduct and making threats to kill another person. Those charges are pending.
