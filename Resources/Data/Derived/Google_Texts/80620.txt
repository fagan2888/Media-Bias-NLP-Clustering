The new executive director of Get Covered Illinois is Karin Zosel, a former CIA intelligence officer and college director, the group said Tuesday.

Get Covered Illinois helps enroll people in health insurance plans through Obamacare. As of February, the group has helped 947,776 people enroll in health plans and Medicaid.

"I look forward to joining the GCI team and leading this program into the future," Zosel said. "I am thrilled to use my experience to help GCI continue connecting Illinois residents with the quality health coverage they need."

Most recently, as the director of annual giving at MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Ill., Zosel managed the college's budget and operational expenses. In 2004, Zosel graduated from Yale university with a degree in political science. She has a master's degree in international policy studies from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies and a law degree from Mercer University.

She worked as an intelligence officer for the CIA for nearly a decade.
