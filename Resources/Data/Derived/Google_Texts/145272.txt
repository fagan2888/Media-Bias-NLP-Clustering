Sioux Falls, SD

Runners brave the cold today to kick-off the Frosty Frolic weekend event.

At Spencer Park this morning runners took to the trails for either a one mile fun run, a 5K or 10K run. Even with the cold, people of all ages where out. This was the third year of the run, and the Sioux Falls Park and Rec department is always pleased on who show up to run, no matter what the temperature.

“We have some religious followers, people that like to get out in the winter time and run. They come dressed up, we have some people with fancy socks on, fancy headgear on, kind of getting into the spirit of the event,” Recreation Program Coordinator Jean Pearson said.

There will be more events tonight as well. There is a figure skating show that just started at Memorial Ice Rink, followed by a luminary skate until 9 p.m.

Due to the bitter cold on the way; Great Bear will be closed Sunday and Monday, where many of the events would have been held.
