— Durham police have charged two men who they say broke into a home on Cole Mill Road Monday night, tied up the couple living there and then stole several items and an SUV.

Brandon Jayne, 35, and Joey Fabela, 35, both of Snowcrest Trail, are charged with robbery with a dangerous weapon, first-degree burglary, two counts of second-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon, larceny of a motor vehicle and possession of stolen property.

Jayne was also charged with two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, one count of possession of a weapon of mass destruction and one count of possession of a stolen firearm.

According to a 911 call released Thursday afternoon, the homeowner said his wife was taking out the trash around 8 p.m. when the men, armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a rifle, forced her back into the house, tied her and him with duct tape, stole several items – including jewelry, money and a cellphone – and then fled in the couple's white 2003 GMC Envoy.

The GMC Envoy was later recovered on Sparger Road.

Investigators searched Fabela and Jayne's Snowcrest Trail residence Friday evening. They found jewelry and other items belonging to the victims, and they also recovered a sawed-off shotgun that had been reported stolen during a Jan. 8 burglary in Wake County.

Investigators also found an AK-47 rifle, $400 in cash, marijuana and a small amount of cocaine. Authorities said Saturday that the robbery did not appear to be random.

Both men were in the Durham County jail Saturday. Jayne received a $1.5 million bond and Fabela received a $500,000 bond.
